  abstract = {Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) show promise in helping children during therapeutic and clinical interventions. However, using SARs for the evaluation of mental wellbeing of children has not yet been explored. Thus, this paper presents an empirical study with 28 children 8-13 years old interacting with a Nao robot in a 45-minute session where the robot administered (robotised) the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). Prior to the experimental session, we also evaluated children's wellbeing using established standardised approaches via online RCADS questionnaires filled by the children (self-report) and their parents (parent-report). We clustered the participants into three groups (lower, medium, and higher tertile) based on their SMFQ scores. Further, we analysed the questionnaire responses across the three clusters and across the different modes of administration (self-report, parent-report, and robotised). Our results show that the robotised evaluation seems to be the most suitable mode in identifying wellbeing related anomalies in children across the three clusters of participants as compared with the self-report and the parent-report modes. Further, children with decreasing levels of wellbeing (lower, medium and higher tertiles) exhibit different response patterns: children of higher tertile are more negative in their responses to the robot while the ones of lower tertile are more positive in their responses to the robot. Findings from this work show that SARs can be a promising tool to potentially evaluate mental wellbeing related concerns in children.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are envisioned to dramatically change the future of Software Engineering, allowing practitioners to chat and inquire about their software projects and interact with different services using natural language. At the heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots remains an open challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs, namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically, we examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners, 1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q\&A forums (e.g., Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with an F1-measure {$>$} 84\%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when deciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.},

In this study, we report the results from a systematic review of the state-of-the-art in home robotics research for caring for older adults. This review aims to address two questions: (1) What research is being done towards integrating robotics for caring for older adults? (2) What are the research and technology challenges that robots are facing in the home? Sixty-three papers have been identified and studied in this review by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Common themes that are consistent across the reviewed papers are distinguished and consolidated as follows: (1) Ambient assisted living, where smart home environments and physical support tools are studied; (2) Robot ecosystem, where robotic devices are used to provide various services; (3) Social interaction, where the social isolation problem has been targeted. We also summarize the results of similar literature reviews we came across during our search. The results of this study present the current research trends and technologies used in each category. The challenges and limitations of robotics applications are also identified. Suggestions for accelerating the deployment of robots at home for providing older adults with independent care in the home are presented based on the results and insights from this study.},

With a focus on personalised medicine, ethical issues and problems, future directions and opportunities, real-world case studies, and data privacy and security, this review article investigates the existing and potential applications of deep learning in healthcare. Deep learning in personalised medicine holds enormous promise for improving patient care by enabling more precise diagnoses and individualised treatment approaches. But it's important to take into account ethical issues like data privacy and the possibility of bias in algorithms. Deep learning in healthcare will likely be used more in the future to manage population health, prevent disease, and improve access to care for underprivileged groups of people. Case studies give specific examples of how deep learning is already changing the healthcare industry, from discovering rare diseases to forecasting patient outcomes. To fully realize the potential of deep learning in healthcare, however, issues including data quality, interpretability, and legal barriers must be resolved. Remote monitoring and telemedicine are two promising areas where deep learning is lowering healthcare expenses and enhancing access to care. Deep learning algorithms can be used to analyse patient data in real-time, warning medical professionals of possible problems before they worsen and allowing for online discussions with experts. Finally, when applying deep learning to healthcare, the importance of data security and privacy cannot be understated. To preserve patient data and guarantee its responsible usage, the appropriate safeguards and rules must be implemented. Deep learning has the ability to transform the healthcare industry by delivering more individualised, practical, and efficient care. However, in order to fully realize its promise, ethical issues, difficulties, and regulatory barriers must be solved. Deep learning has the potential to significantly contribute to enhancing patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs with the right safeguards and ongoing innovation},

The need for these systems arises from the desire to enable patients and seniors to live independently in their homes without relying heavily on their families or caretakers. To achieve substantial improvements in healthcare, it is essential to ensure the continuous development and availability of information technologies tailored explicitly for patients and elderly individuals. The primary objective of this study is to comprehensively review the latest remote health monitoring systems, with a specific focus on those designed for older adults. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding, we categorize these remote monitoring systems and provide an overview of their general architectures. Additionally, we emphasize the standards utilized in their development and highlight the challenges encountered throughout the developmental processes. Moreover, this paper identifies several potential areas for future research, which promise further advancements in remote health monitoring systems. Addressing these research gaps can drive progress and innovation, ultimately enhancing the quality of healthcare services available to elderly individuals. This, in turn, empowers them to lead more independent and fulfilling lives while enjoying the comforts and familiarity of their own homes. By acknowledging the importance of healthcare systems for the elderly and recognizing the role of information technologies, we can address the evolving needs of this population. Through ongoing research and development, we can continue to enhance remote health monitoring systems, ensuring they remain effective, efficient, and responsive to the unique requirements of elderly individuals.},

The need to manage or even reduce healthcare costs while improving the quality of service is high government agendas. Although, technology has a major role to play in achieving these aspirations, any solution must be designed, implemented and validated using appropriate domain knowledge. In order to overcome these challenges, the remote real-time monitoring of a person's health can be used to identify relapses in conditions, therefore, enabling early intervention. Thus, the development of a smart healthcare monitoring system, which is capable of observing elderly people remotely, is the focus of the research presented in this paper. The technology outlined in this paper focuses on the ability to track a person's physiological data to detect specific disorders which can aid in Early Intervention Practices. This is achieved by accurately processing and analysing the acquired sensory data while transmitting the detection of a disorder to an appropriate career. The finding reveals that the proposed system can improve clinical decision supports while facilitating Early Intervention Practices. Our extensive simulation results indicate a superior performance of the proposed system: low latency (96\% of the packets are received with less than 1 millisecond) and low packets-lost (only 2.2\% of total packets are dropped). Thus, the system runs efficiently and is cost-effective in terms of data acquisition and manipulation.},

In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80\%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases. This study shows that a real-time alerting system can be used for early detection of infection and other stressors and employed on an open-source platform that is scalable to millions of users.},

SARA is a low-cost, novel robotic platform that enhances children's skills and improves their health awareness. The proposed system incorporates an efficient method for managing clinical data (i.e., glucose measurement and daily activities) in a fun, child-friendly way. The acceptance of the SARA robotic platform has been investigated through a pilot study of five diabetic kids (aged six to nine years old). The average acceptance rate was close to 88.2\%. Overall, SARA is a powerful tool for enhancing dietary adherence in children.},

  abstract = {Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients' health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Prot{\'e}g{\'e} Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions.},

We then motivate the need for a three dimensional display of faces to guarantee accurate delivery of gaze and directional movements and present Furhat, a novel, simple, highly effective, and human-like back-projected robot head that utilizes computer animation to deliver facial movements, and is equipped with a pan-tilt neck. After presenting a detailed summary on why and how Furhat was built, we discuss the advantages of using optically projected animated agents for interaction. We discuss using such agents in terms of situatedness, environment, context awareness, and social, human-like face-to-face interaction with robots where subtle nonverbal and social facial signals can be communicated. At the end of the chapter, we present a recent application of Furhat as a multimodal multiparty interaction system that was presented at the London Science Museum as part of a robot festival,. We conclude the paper by discussing future developments, applications and opportunities of this technology.},

We categorized chatbots based on their public health response use case(s) and design. Six categories of public health response use cases emerged comprising 15 distinct use cases: risk assessment, information dissemination, surveillance, post-Covid eligibility screening, distributed coordination, and vaccine scheduler. Design-wise, chatbots were relatively simple, implemented using decision-tree structures and predetermined response options, and focused on a narrow set of simple tasks, presumably due to need for quick deployment.Chatbots' scalability, wide accessibility, ease of use, and fast information dissemination provide complementary functionality that augments public health workers in public health response activities, addressing capacity constraints, social distancing requirements, and misinformation. Additional use cases, more sophisticated chatbot designs, and opportunities for synergies in chatbot development should be explored.},

  abstract = {Background: The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide and the high recent mortality rates (74.4\%) associated with them, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is causing a substantial global burden of disease, necessitating innovative and sustainable long-term care solutions. Objective: This scoping review aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)--based conversational agents (CAs)---including chatbots, voicebots, and anthropomorphic digital avatars---as human-like health caregivers in the remote management of NCDs as well as identify critical areas for future research and provide insights into how these technologies might be used effectively in health care to personalize NCD management strategies. Methods: A broad literature search was conducted in July 2023 in 6 electronic databases---Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science---using the search terms ``conversational agents,'' ``artificial intelligence,'' and ``noncommunicable diseases,'' including their associated synonyms. We also manually searched gray literature using sources such as ProQuest Central, ResearchGate, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. We included empirical studies published in English from January 2010 to July 2023 focusing solely on health care--oriented applications of CAs used for remote management of NCDs. The narrative synthesis approach was used to collate and summarize the relevant information extracted from the included studies. Results: The literature search yielded a total of 43 studies that matched the inclusion criteria. Our review unveiled four significant findings: (1) higher user acceptance and compliance with anthropomorphic and avatar-based CAs for remote care; (2) an existing gap in the development of personalized, empathetic, and contextually aware CAs for effective emotional and social interaction with users, along with limited consideration of ethical concerns such as data privacy and patient safety; (3) inadequate evidence of the efficacy of CAs in NCD self-management despite a moderate to high level of optimism among health care professionals regarding CAs' potential in remote health care; and (4) CAs primarily being used for supporting nonpharmacological interventions such as behavioral or lifestyle modifications and patient education for the self-management of NCDs. Conclusions: This review makes a unique contribution to the field by not only providing a quantifiable impact analysis but also identifying the areas requiring imminent scholarly attention for the ethical, empathetic, and efficacious implementation of AI in NCD care. This serves as an academic cornerstone for future research in AI-assisted health care for NCD management. Trial Registration: Open Science Framework; https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GU5PX},

Robots have been proposed to help engage older adults in physical activity (PA), albeit with limited success. There is a lack of robust understanding of older adults' needs and wants from robots designed to engage them in PA. In this paper, we report on the findings of a co-design process where older adults, physical therapy experts, and engineers designed robots to promote PA in older adults. We found a variety of motivators for and barriers against PA in older adults; we, then, conceptualized a broad spectrum of possible robotic support and found that robots can play various roles to help older adults engage in PA. This exploratory study elucidated several overarching themes and emphasized the need for personalization and adaptability. This work highlights key design features that researchers and engineers should consider when developing robots to engage older adults in PA, and underscores the importance of involving various stakeholders in the design and development of assistive robots.},

The generated categories were fairly consistent across settings, although higher temperatures included less relevant aspects.

Moreover, in this context recurrent software design issues such as ensuring interoperability, improving reusability and customizability of software components also arise. Designing and implementing social robotic software architectures is a time-intensive activity requiring multi-disciplinary expertise: this makes it difficult to rapidly develop, customize, and personalize robotic solutions. These challenges may be mitigated at design time by choosing certain architectural styles, implementing specific architectural patterns and using particular technologies. Leveraging on our experience in the MARIO project, in this paper we propose a series of principles that social robots may benefit from. These principles lay also the foundations for the design of a reference software architecture for social robots. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) Establishing a reference architecture whose components are unambiguously characterized by an ontology thus allowing to easily reuse them in order to implement and personalize social robots; (ii) Introducing a series of standardized software components for social robots architecture (mostly relying on ontologies and semantic technologies) to enhance interoperability, to improve explainability, and to favor rapid prototyping.},

  abstract = {Objectives Objectives: Human biologists are increasingly interested in measuring and comparing physical activities in different societies. Sedentary behavior, which refers to time spent sitting or lying down while awake, is a large component of daily 24 hours movement patterns in humans and has been linked to poor health outcomes such as risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independently of physical activity. As such, it is important for researchers, with the aim of measuring human movement patterns, to most effectively use resources available to them to capture sedentary behavior. Methods This toolkit outlines objective (device-based) and subjective (self-report) methods for measuring sedentary behavior in free-living contexts, the benefits and drawbacks to each, as well as novel options for combined use to maximize scientific rigor. Throughout this toolkit, emphasis is placed on considerations for the use of these methods in various field conditions and in varying cultural contexts. Results Objective measures such as inclinometers are the gold-standard for measuring total sedentary time but they typically cannot capture contextual information or determine which specific behaviors are taking place. Subjective measures such as questionnaires and 24 hours-recall methods can provide measurements of time spent in specific sedentary behaviors but are subject to measurement error and response bias. Conclusions We recommend that researchers use the method(s) that suit the research question; inclinometers are recommended for the measurement of total sedentary time, while self-report methods are recommended for measuring time spent in particular contexts of sedentary behavior.},

The limitations of currently available systems, however, include time lag behind changes in blood glucose, the invasive nature of such systems, and in some cases, their accuracy. Non-invasive techniques have been developed, but, to date, no commercial device has been successful. A key research priority for people with Type 1 diabetes identified by the James Lind Alliance was to identify ways of monitoring blood glucose constantly and accurately using a discrete device, invasive or non-invasive. Integration of such a sensor is important in the development of a closed-loop system and the technology must be rapid, selective and acceptable for continuous use by individuals. The present review provides an update on existing continuous glucose-sensing technologies, and an overview of emergent techniques, including their accuracy and limitations.},

Moreover, this happens in the context of increasing well-being costs and decreasing caregiver availability. Therefore, technology must create assisted living solutions that support elderly in their daily activities and ensure their continuous health-monitoring, safety and social integration while maintaining an acceptable degree of independence. In this context we present the CAMI system---an intelligent system that provides health and home monitoring, supervised physical exercises and interaction between the user and the system is performed through a multimodal interface. The supervised physical exercises are recommended based on the current medical parameters of the user. The results performed by the user are presented in an interactive way using a feedback module. The multimodal interface accepts voice and gesture-based commands and is adapted to the device and to the user profile and preferences.},

The research articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and studies that support or present a vision to provide advancement to the current space of ADLs, independent living and supporting the ageing population. Most studies focused on the system aspects of wearable sensors and IoT monitoring solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and usability. Moderate to low usability/ user-friendly approach is reported in most of the studies. Other issues found were inaccurate sensors, battery/ power issues, restricting the users within the monitoring area/ space and lack of interoperability. The advancement of wearable technology and the possibilities of using advanced IoT technology to assist older adults with their ADLs and independent living is the subject of many recent research and investigation.},

Our main contribution lies within the detailed results on perceived safety, usability, and acceptance from field trials with autonomous robots in real homes of older users. In these field trials, we studied how 16 older adults (75 plus) lived with autonomously interacting service robots over multiple weeks. Robots have been employed for periods of months previously in home environments for older people, and some have been tested with manipulation abilities, but this is the first time a study has tested a robot in private homes that provided the combination of manipulation abilities, autonomous navigation, and non-scheduled interaction for an extended period of time. This article aims to explore how older adults interact with such a robot in their private homes. Our results show that all users interacted with Hobbit daily, rated most functions as well working, and reported that they believe that Hobbit will be part of future elderly care. We show that Hobbit's adaptive behavior approach towards the user increasingly eased the interaction between the users and the robot. Our trials reveal the necessity to move into actual users' homes, as only there, we encounter real-world challenges and demonstrate issues such as misinterpretation of actions during non-scripted human-robot interaction.},

In this paper we present CLARC, a mobile robot able to receive the patient and his family, accompany them to the medical consulting room and, once there, help the physician to capture and manage their data during CGA procedures. The hardware structure of CLARC is based on a robotic platform from MetraLabs. The software architecture of the system incorporates a deeply tested framework for interactive robots. This framework, by encoding the whole CGA session using Automated Planning, is able to autonomously plan, drive, monitor and evaluate the session, while also managing robot navigation and data acquisition. CLARC incorporates a series of sensors allowing to collect data automatically, using non-invasive procedures. The healthcare professional can use the platform to automatically collect data while addressing other tasks such as personal interviewing, data evaluation or care planning. First trials will be carried out in hospitals in Seville and Barcelona in June and July 2016, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background               Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly used in health care apps; however, their acceptability in type 2 diabetes (T2D) self-management apps has not yet been investigated.                                         Objective               This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of the ECA (Laura) used to deliver diabetes self-management education and support in the My Diabetes Coach (MDC) app.                                         Methods               A sequential mixed methods design was applied. Adults with T2D allocated to the intervention arm of the MDC trial used the MDC app over a period of 12 months. At 6 months, they completed questions assessing their interaction with, and attitudes toward, the ECA. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of the participants from the intervention arm to explore their experiences of using the ECA. The interview questions included the participants' perceptions of Laura, including their initial impression of her (and how this changed over time), her personality, and human character. The quantitative and qualitative data were interpreted using integrated synthesis.                                         Results               Of the 93 intervention participants, 44 (47\%) were women; the mean (SD) age of the participants was 55 (SD 10) years and the baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 7.3\% (SD 1.5\%). Overall, 66 of the 93 participants (71\%) provided survey responses. Of these, most described Laura as being helpful (57/66, 86\%), friendly (57/66, 86\%), competent (56/66, 85\%), trustworthy (48/66, 73\%), and likable (40/66, 61\%). Some described Laura as not real (18/66, 27\%), boring (26/66, 39\%), and annoying (20/66, 30\%). Participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel more motivated (29/66, 44\%), comfortable (24/66, 36\%), confident (14/66, 21\%), happy (11/66, 17\%), and hopeful (8/66, 12\%). Furthermore, 20\% (13/66) of the participants were frustrated by their interaction with Laura, and 17\% (11/66) of the participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel guilty. A total of 4 themes emerged from the qualitative data (N=19): (1) perceived role: a friendly coach rather than a health professional; (2) perceived support: emotional and motivational support; (3) embodiment preference acceptability of a human-like character; and (4) room for improvement: need for greater congruence between Laura's words and actions.                                         Conclusions               These findings suggest that an ECA is an acceptable means to deliver T2D self-management education and support. A human-like character providing ongoing, friendly, nonjudgmental, emotional, and motivational support is well received. Nevertheless, the ECA can be improved by increasing congruence between its verbal and nonverbal communication and accommodating user preferences.

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, several deployments of robots for in-house assistance of older adults have been trialled. However, these solutions are mostly prototypes and remain unused in real-life scenarios. In this work, we review the historical and current landscape of the field, to try and understand why robots have yet to succeed as personal assistants in daily life. Our analysis focuses on two complementary aspects: the capabilities of the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. The former analysis shows regularities in hardware configurations and functionalities, leading to the definition of a set of six application-level capabilities (exploration, identification, remote control, communication, manipulation, and digital situatedness). The latter focuses on the impact of robots on the daily life of users and categorises the deployment of robots for healthcare interventions using three types of services: support, mitigation, and response. Our investigation reveals that the value of healthcare interventions is limited by a stagnation of functionalities and a disconnection between the robotic platform and the design of the intervention. To address this issue, we propose a novel co-design toolkit, which uses an ecological framework for robot interventions in the healthcare domain. Our approach connects robot capabilities with known geriatric factors, to create a holistic view encompassing both the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. As a case study-based validation, we discuss the use of the toolkit in the pre-design of the robotic platform for an pilot intervention, part of the EU large-scale pilot of the EU H2020 GATEKEEPER project.},

In this study we investigate older Americans' robot acceptance before and after exposure to a domestic mobile manipulator, with an emphasis on understanding trialability (i.e., ``trying out'' a robot for a short time period) and result demonstrability (i.e., observing the results of the robot's functionality). Method Older adult participants observed a mobile manipulator robot autonomously demonstrating three tasks: delivering medication, learning to turn off a light switch, and organizing home objects. We administered pre and post exposure questionnaires about participants' opinions and attitudes toward the robot, as well as a semi-structured interview about each demonstration. Results We found that demonstration of a mobile manipulator assistive robot did, in fact, influence older adults' acceptance. There was a significant increase, pre vs. post, in positive perceptions of robot usefulness and ease of use for 8 of the 12 Robot Opinions Questionnaire items. Furthermore, in the Assistance Preference Checklist, eighteen tasks significantly differed between pre and post exposure, with older adults showing a greater openness to robot assistance after exposure to the robot. Conclusion Thus, demonstration of robot capability positively affected older adults' preferences for robot assistance for tasks in the home. Interview data suggest that the robot's capability and reliability influenced older adults' first impressions of the robot.},

Three different information presentations were evaluated: tabular, graphical, and combined tabular-graphical. Tabular reports led to better decision making and graphical reports led to faster decision making when time constraints were low. The combined report, which integrated the advantages associated with both tabular and graphical presentation, was the superior report format in terms of performance and was rated very highly by decision makers.

  abstract = {The family of gradient boosting algorithms has been recently extended with several interesting proposals (i.e. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) that focus on both speed and accuracy. XGBoost is a scalable ensemble technique that has demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient machine learning challenge solver. LightGBM is an accurate model focused on providing extremely fast training performance using selective sampling of high gradient instances. CatBoost modifies the computation of gradients to avoid the prediction shift in order to improve the accuracy of the model. This work proposes a practical analysis of how these novel variants of gradient boosting work in terms of training speed, generalization performance and hyper-parameter setup. In addition, a comprehensive comparison between XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, random forests and gradient boosting has been performed using carefully tuned models as well as using their default settings. The results of this comparison indicate that CatBoost obtains the best results in generalization accuracy and AUC in the studied datasets although the differences are small. LightGBM is the fastest of all methods but not the most accurate. Finally, XGBoost places second both in accuracy and in training speed. Finally an extensive analysis of the effect of hyper-parameter tuning in XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost is carried out using two novel proposed tools.},

On the dyad and aggregate level, we compare preferences of older adult women and their adult children for three remote monitoring technologies. Their assessments of each technology's impact on privacy, safety, independence, freedom, relationship with family member, social life, and identity are also compared.This dyadic study used cognitive-based interview probing and value-centered design methods. Twenty-eight individual, in-depth, structured interviews were conducted with 18 women who are Meals on Wheels clients and 10 of their adult children.Meals on Wheels participants reported multiple chronic conditions and an average of 1.7 ADL and 3.3 IADL difficulties; two thirds were enrolled in Medicaid. Adult children preferred each technology more than their mothers did and underestimated both their mothers' ability to comprehend the functions of the technologies and the importance of engaging them fully in decision making. Most were confident that they could persuade their mothers to adopt. For both groups, privacy was the most-cited concern, and participants perceived significant overlap between values of privacy, independence, identity, and freedom.Studying privacy in isolation overlooks privacy's instrumental role in enabling other values. Shared decision-making tools are needed to promote remote monitoring use consistent with older adults' values and to prevent conflict and caregiver overreach.},

The widespread use of smartphones and their increasing computing power and storage capacity make them the ideal tool to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present Digital Avatars, a software framework adapted to the needs of older adults who wish to preserve their lifestyle, but who require assistance through technology. Building on previous work on the People as a Service model, Digital Avatars takes advantage of a smartphone's capabilities and services to collect information about the people who own them. To do this, it applies Complex Event Processing techniques extended with uncertainty to infer the habits, preferences, and needs of the device owner to build with them an enhanced virtual profile of the user. These virtual profiles are the mechanism for monitoring the quality of life of older adults: analyzing their patterns of activity, reminding them of medication schedules, or detecting risky situations that generate alerts to relatives, caregivers, or the community health system.},

Despite the undeniable wealth of socially assistive robots (SARs), there is an increasing need to customize the tools used for measuring their acceptance in real-life applications. Methods Within the Robot-Era project, a scale was developed to understand the degree of acceptance of the robotic platform. A preliminary test with 21 participants was performed to assess the statistical validity of the Robot-Era Inventory (REI) scales. Results Based on the criteria observed in the literature, 41 items were developed and grouped in different scales (perceived robot personality, human--robot interaction, perceived benefit, ease of use, and perceived usefulness). The reliability of the Robot-Era Inventory scale was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha, with a mean value of 0.79 (range = 0.61--0.91). Furthermore, the preliminary validity of this scale has been tested by using the correlation analysis with a gold standard, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Discussion The Robot-Era Inventory represents a useful tool that can be easily personalized and included in the assessment of any SARs that cooperate with older people in real environment applications.},

We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of combining machine learning (ML) with PGHD in TJA to predict patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods Twenty-two TJA patients were recruited for this pilot study. Three activity trackers collected 35 features from 4 weeks before to 6 weeks following surgery. PROMs were collected at both endpoints (Hip and Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey Physical Component Score). We used ML to identify features with the highest correlation with PROMs. The algorithm trained on a subset of patients and used 3 feature sets (A, B, and C) to group the rest into one of the 3 PROM clusters. Results Fifteen patients completed the study and collected 3 million data points. Three sets of features with the highest R2 values relative to PROMs were selected (A, B and C). Data collected through the 11th day had the highest predictive value. The ML algorithm grouped patients into 3 clusters predictive of 6-week PROM results, yielding total sum of squares values ranging from 3.86 (A) to 1.86 (C). Conclusion This small but critical proof-of-concept study demonstrates that ML can be used in combination with PGHD to predict 6-week PROM data as early as 11 days following TJA surgery. Further study is needed to confirm these findings and their clinical value.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Research in social robotics is focused on the development of robots that can provide physical and cognitive support in a socially interactive way. Whilst some studies have previously investigated the importance of user characteristics (age, gender, education, robot familiarity, mood) in the acceptance of social robots as well as the influence a robot's displayed emotion (positive, negative, neutral) has on the interaction, these two aspects are rarely combined. Therefore, this study attempts to highlight the need to consider the influence that both human and robot attributes can have on social robot acceptance. Eighty-six participants completed implicit and explicit measures of mood before viewing one of three video clips containing a positive, negative or neutral social robot (Pepper) followed by questionnaires on robot acceptance and perception. Gender and education were not associated with acceptance; however, several constructs of the acceptance questionnaire significantly correlated with age and mood. For example, those younger and those experiencing sadness or loneliness were more dependent on the opinions of others (as measured by the social influence construct of the acceptance questionnaire). This highlights the importance of mood in the introduction of social robots into vulnerable populations. Robot familiarity also correlated with robot acceptance with those more familiar finding the robot less useful and less enjoyable, this is important as robots become more prominent in society. Displayed robot emotion significantly influenced acceptance and perception with the positive robot appearing more childlike than the negative and neutral robot, and the neutral robot the least helpful. These findings emphasise the importance of both user and robot characteristics in the successful integration of social robots.},

  abstract = {Numerous projects, normally run by younger people, are exploring robot use by older people. But are older any different from younger people in the way they want to interact with robots? Understanding older compared to younger people's preferences will give researchers more insight into good design. We compared views on multi-modal human--robot interfaces, of older people living independently, with students and university staff. We showed 96 participants aged under 65 and 18 aged 65\,+\,, six videos presenting different scenarios, including interfaces both working properly and failing, for an older man interacting with a robot by speech and touch screen tablet. Participants were asked about the interfaces they might use and why, using self-completed questionnaires with mainly open-ended questions. People over 65 were more like people under 21 than those aged 22--64 (78\%, 67\%, 47\% respectively) in preferring speech over tablet for robot--human interaction. But reasons for doing so may differ, for example, hearing and eyesight impairment versus speaking while hands full. Older participants were more likely (83\% vs. 55\%) to want a robot in the house than those under 65. Older people were as familiar with tablets and smart speakers as younger people, but less likely to use smart phones. Some younger people suggested interacting with robot via their smart phone, and while not at home. Answers to similar questions about preferences for robot interaction varied according to position in the questionnaire. User-centred design of human--robot interfaces should include open questions to understand people's preferences, should account for question wording and order in interpreting user preferences, and should include people of all age ranges to better understand interface use. Older people's technology needs have differences and similarities to the younger people who are likely carrying out the research. Our sample of older people were more like people under 21 than those aged in between for preference of robot--human interaction, and more willing to have a robot in the home than younger people. Differences may come from a more home based lifestyle and difficulties with vision, hearing, or dexterity rather than lack of interest in technology.},

The objective of this study is to create and evaluate a robot-mediated activity to deliver information on COVID-19 precautionary measures in an accessible and engaging way using the humanoid robot Nao. An interactive scenario explaining and demonstrating COVID-19 precautionary measures is created using the verbal and non-verbal behaviours of the robot. The scenario ({$\approx$}5 min) is presented to 124 users of a geriatric hospital, including the following: older patients (n = 45), accompanying persons (n = 39), and health professionals (n = 40). The data regarding perceived usefulness, acceptability, and accessibility are collected using a questionnaire. A video analysis of the participants' behaviour during the interaction with the robot is performed to examine the quality of engagement in the activity. The results show a good acceptance, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the robot-mediated activity.

  abstract = {Background                Conversational user interfaces, or chatbots, are becoming more popular in the realm of digital health and well-being. While many studies focus on measuring the cause or effect of a digital intervention on people's health and well-being (outcomes), there is a need to understand how users really engage and use a digital intervention in the real world.                                            Objective                In this study, we examine the user logs of a mental well-being chatbot called ChatPal, which is based on the concept of positive psychology. The aim of this research is to analyze the log data from the chatbot to provide insight into usage patterns, the different types of users using clustering, and associations between the usage of the app's features.                                            Methods                Log data from ChatPal was analyzed to explore usage. A number of user characteristics including user tenure, unique days, mood logs recorded, conversations accessed, and total number of interactions were used with k-means clustering to identify user archetypes. Association rule mining was used to explore links between conversations.                                            Results                ChatPal log data revealed 579 individuals older than 18 years used the app with most users being female (n=387, 67\%). User interactions peaked around breakfast, lunchtime, and early evening. Clustering revealed 3 groups including ``abandoning users'' (n=473), ``sporadic users'' (n=93), and ``frequent transient users'' (n=13). Each cluster had distinct usage characteristics, and the features were significantly different (P{$<$}.001) across each group. While all conversations within the chatbot were accessed at least once by users, the ``treat yourself like a friend'' conversation was the most popular, which was accessed by 29\% (n=168) of users. However, only 11.7\% (n=68) of users repeated this exercise more than once. Analysis of transitions between conversations revealed strong links between ``treat yourself like a friend,'' ``soothing touch,'' and ``thoughts diary'' among others. Association rule mining confirmed these 3 conversations as having the strongest linkages and suggested other associations between the co-use of chatbot features.                                            Conclusions                This study has provided insight into the types of people using the ChatPal chatbot, patterns of use, and associations between the usage of the app's features, which can be used to further develop the app by considering the features most accessed by users.},

  abstract = {Social robots are arriving to the modern healthcare system. Whether patients with heart failure, a prevalent chronic disease with high health and human costs would derive benefit from a social robot intervention has not been investigated empirically. Diverse healthcare provider's perspectives are needed to develop an acceptable and feasible social robot intervention to be adopted for the clinical benefit of patients with heart failure. Using a qualitative research design, this study investigated healthcare providers' perspectives of social robot use in heart failure patient care.Interdisciplinary healthcare providers from a tertiary care cardiac hospital completed a structured individual interview and a supplemental questionnaire. The framework method was used to analyse the qualitative data. Respondents (n = 22; saturation was reached with this sample; 77\% female; 52\% physicians) were open to using social robots to augment their practice, particularly with collecting pertinent data and providing patient and family education and self-management prompts, but with limited responsibility for direct patient care. Prior to implementation, providers required robust evidence of: value-added beyond current remote patient monitoring devices, patient and healthcare provider partnerships, streamlined integration into existing practice, and capability of supporting precision medicine goals. Respondents were concerned that social robots did not address and masked broader systemic issues of healthcare access and equity.The adoption of social robots is a viable option to assist in the care of patients with heart failure, albeit in a restricted capacity. The results inform the development of a social robotic intervention for patients with heart failure, including improving social robot efficiencies and increasing their uptake, while protecting patients' and providers' best interest.},

Especially for the older patient group, the PROM questioning poses an undesirable workload on the staff. This proof of concept paper investigates whether a social robot with a display can conduct such questioning in an acceptable and reliable way. A set of 15 typical questions was selected from existing PROM questionnaires. For the asking, answer-processing and responding, a multi-modal robot-dialogue was designed and implemented. In a within-subjects experiment, 31 community-dwelling older participants answered the 15 questions in two conditions: questioning by the robot, versus questioning by a human. The main part of the robot questioning provided reliable answers, but took somewhat more time compared to human questioning. The experiment demonstrated the feasibility of a social robot for an acceptable and reliable collection of PROM data from older persons.},

  abstract = {Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are an essential means for collecting information on the effectiveness of hospital care as perceived by the patients themselves. Especially older adult patients often require help from nursing staff to successfully complete PROMs, but this staff already has a high work load. Therefore, a social robot is introduced to perform the PROM questioning and recording task. The study objective was to design a multimodal dialogue for a social robot to acquire PROMs for older patients. The primary outcomes were the effectiveness, the efficiency, and the subjective usability as perceived by older adults of acquiring PROMs by a social robot. The robot dialogue design included a personalized welcome, PROM questions, confirmation requests, affective statements, use of a support screen on the robot displaying the answer options, and accompanying robot gestures. The design was tested in a crossover study with 31 community-dwelling persons aged 70~years or above. Answers obtained with the robot were compared with those obtained by a questionnaire taken by humans. First results indicated that PROM data collection in older persons may be carried out effectively and efficiently by a social robot. The robot's subjective usability was on average scored as 80.1 ({\textpm}\,11.6) on a scale from 0 to 100. The recorded data reliability was 99.6\%. A first relevant step has been made on the design trajectory for a robot to obtain PROMs from older adults. Practice variation in subjective usability scores still asks for technical dialogue improvements.},

Social robots capable of verbal dialogues may contribute to informing patients and the public in general about such tests and procedures, for example in general practitioner or hospital waiting rooms, nursery homes, as well as in public spaces. As an example of latter, an exploratory study was conducted at the Lowlands music festival in August 2022. A social robot explained a blood pressure measurement and a grip strength measurement to participants. Participants were asked to value the expected clarity of the explanation before the explanation, the experienced clarity after the robot explanation but before the actual physical measurements, and after the physical measurements. 172 participants completed the interaction (99 female, 57 male, 8 non-binary, 8 undisclosed). The mean interaction duration was 2.02 minutes (SD=0.40 minutes). Participants found the explanation after the interaction with Pepper clearer than they expected beforehand. Participants found the clarity of the explanation, after they had actually undergone the physical examination, even higher than before the physical examination. This study indicates that social robots are potentially useful to explain medical tests and procedures.},

Improving BP control in this population may require a better understanding of the specific challenges to BP control at older age. In this narrative review, we propose a framework for considering how key steps in BP management occur in the context of aging characterized by heterogeneity in function, multiple co-occurring health conditions, and complex personal and environmental factors. We review existing literature related to 4 necessary steps in hypertension control. These steps include the BP measure which can be affected by the technique, device, and setting in which BP is measured. Ensuring proper technique can be challenging in routine care. The plan includes setting BP treatment goals. Lower BP goals may be appropriate for many older adults. However, plans must take into account the generalizability of existing evidence, as well as patient and family's health goals. Treatment includes the management strategy, the expected benefits, and potential risks of treatment. Treatment intensification is commonly needed and can contribute to polypharmacy in older adults. Lastly, monitor refers to the need for ongoing follow-up to support a patient's ability to sustain BP control over time. Sustained BP control has been shown to be associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular disease and multimorbidity progression. Implementation of current guidelines in populations of older adults may be improved when specific challenges to BP measurement, planning, treating, and monitoring are addressed.},

TA refers to a range of flexible and evolving approaches for qualitative data analysis. Its increased use demonstrates a change in research practices, and with that the emergence of new local standards. We need to understand and reflect upon these emerging local practices, including departures from what is advocated as quality TA practice more generally. Toward this, we conducted a scoping review of a decade of CHI publications (2012\&nbsp;--\&nbsp;2021) that researched healthcare and termed their analysis approach ``thematic analysis''; 78 papers reporting a total of 100 TAs were included. We contribute a description of 1) the contexts in which TA is being used, 2) the TA approaches being conducted, and 3) how TA is being reported. Drawing on this, we discuss opportunities to improve research practice when using TA in healthcare HCI.},

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

  abstract = {This chapter surveys some of the principal research trends in Social Robotics and its application to human--robot interaction (HRIhuman--robotinteraction). Social (or Sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in a~natural, interpersonal manner~-- often to achieve positive outcomes in diverse applications such as education, health, quality of life, entertainment, communication, and tasks requiring collaborative teamwork. The long-term goal of creating social robots that are competent and capable partners for people is quite a~challenging task. They will need to be able to communicate naturally with people using both verbal and nonverbal signals. They will need to engage us not only on a~cognitive level, but on an emotional level as well in order to provide effective social and task-related support to people. They will need a~wide range of social-cognitive skills and a~theory of other minds to understand human behavior, and to be intuitively understood by people. A~deep understanding of human intelligence and behavior across multiple dimensions (i.\,e., cognitive, affective, physical, social, etc.) is necessary in order to design robots that can successfully play a~beneficial role in the daily lives of people. This requires a~multidisciplinary approach where the design of social robot technologies and methodologies are informed by robotics, artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, design, anthropology, and more.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

In general, it is impossible to specify the usability of a system (i.e. its  fitness for purpose) without first defining who are the intended users of the system,  the tasks those users will perform with it, and the characteristics of the physical,  organizational and social environment in which it will be used.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the association of severe exacerbations of asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) requiring ambulance emergency service (AES) visits with meteorological parameters and influenza outbreaks. Methods: The records of patients calling the AES in 2007 and 2008 in the urban area of Lodz due to dyspnea were analyzed. Information on 25 daily reported meteorological parameters was obtained from the local meteorological service and data on influenza outbreaks obtained from the national surveillance service. Results: During the winter months, a significantly higher mean daily number of AES visits for both COPD and asthma were noticed when compared to the summer. Interestingly, the number of daily AES visits correlated with several weather parameters, and the multiple regression analysis confirmed a negative correlation with minimum temperature, mean temperature and the dew point for both diseases (R = 0.526; p {$<$} 0.01; R = 0.577; p {$<$} 0.01 and R = 0.589; p {$<$} 0.01). Furthermore, the increased number of AES visits also correlated with a new number of cases of influenza infections as reported by local influenza surveillance system (rs = 77.6\%; p {$<$} 0.001 and rs = 80.8\%; p {$<$} 0.001 for asthma and COPD, respectively). Conclusion: Seasonality of AES visits for asthma and COPD are similar and seems to be related to specific weather conditions and to influenza outbreaks.},

We investigated prospective associations of circadian disturbances with incident frailty in over 1000 older adults who had been followed annually for up to 16 years. We found that decreased rhythm strength, reduced stability, or increased variation were associated with a higher risk of incident frailty and faster progress of frailty over time.

  abstract = {The use of robots in elderly care represents a dynamic field of study aimed at meeting the growing demand for home-based health care services. This article examines the application of robots in elderly home care and contributes to the literature by introducing a comprehensive and functional architecture within the realm of theInternet of Robotic Things (IoRT). This architecture amalgamates robots, sensors, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to monitor the health status of the elderly. This study presented a four-actor system comprising a stationary humanoid robot, elderly individuals, medical personnel, and caregivers. This system enables continuous monitoring of the physical and emotional well-being of the elderly through specific sensors that measure vital signs, with real-time updates relayed to physicians and assistants, thereby ensuring timely and appropriate care. Our research endeavors to develop a fully integrated architecture that seamlessly integrates robots, sensors, and AI, enabling comprehensive care for elderly individuals in the comfort of their homes, thus reducing their reliance on institutional hospitalization. In particular, the methodology used was based on a user-centered approach involving geriatricians from the outset. This has been of fundamental importance in assessing their receptivity to the adoption of an intelligent information system, and above all, in understanding the issues most relevant to the elderly. The humanoid robot is specifically designed for close interaction with the elderly, capturing vital signs, emotional states, and cognitive conditions while providing assistance in daily routines and alerting family members and physicians to anomalies. Furthermore, communication was facilitated through an external Telegram bot. To predict the health status of the elderly, a machine learning model based on the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a medical scoring scale, was developed. Five key lessons emerged from the study, showing how the system presented can provide valuable support to physicians, caregivers, and older people.},

  abstract = {Background: Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ``conversational agents,'' ``conversational AI,'' ``chatbots,'' and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence--driven, and smartphone app--delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents' formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.},

To understand better the real-world potential of robot-based assistance, we undertook a 10-week case study in a care home involving groups of residents, caregivers and managers as stakeholders. We identified both, enablers and barriers to the potential implementation of robot systems. The study employed the robot platform Pepper, which was deployed with a view to understanding better multi-domain interventions with a robot supporting physical activation, cognitive training and social facilitation. We employed the robot in a group setting in a care facility over the course of 10 weeks and 20 sessions, observing how stakeholders, including residents and caregivers, appropriated, adapted to, and perceived the robot. We also conducted interviews with 11 residents and caregivers. Our results indicate that the residents were positively engaged in the training sessions that were moderated by the robot. The study revealed that such humanoid robots can work in a care home but that there is a moderating person needed, that is in control of the robot.},

They constitute a type of (a) multimodal interface where the modalities are those natural to human conversation: speech, facial displays, hand gestures, and body stance; (b) software agent, insofar as they represent the computer in an interaction with a human or represent their human users in a computational environment (as avatars, for example); and (c) dialogue system where both verbal and nonverbal devices advance and regulate the dialogue between the user and the computer. With an embodied conversational agent, the visual dimension of interacting with an animated character on a screen plays an intrinsic role. Not just pretty pictures, the graphics display visual features of conversation in the same way that the face and hands do in face-to-face conversation among humans. This book describes research in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of embodied conversational agents as well as details of specific working systems. Many of the chapters are written by multidisciplinary teams of psychologists, linguists, computer scientists, artists, and researchers in interface design. The authors include Elisabeth Andre, Norm Badler, Gene Ball, Justine Cassell, Elizabeth Churchill, James Lester, Dominic Massaro, Cliff Nass, Sharon Oviatt, Isabella Poggi, Jeff Rickel, and Greg Sanders.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize recent evidences and advances on the implementation and the use of the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). RECENT FINDINGS: Despite being introduced and validated for clinical use about 20 years ago, the MNA has recently received new attention in order to more widely disseminate among healthcare professionals the practice of a systematic nutritional screening and assessment of the old patient. Particularly, the structure has been implemented to face the difficulties in having the patients contributing to the assessment and to reduce further the time required to complete the evaluation. Recent data also confirm that in older populations prevalence of malnutrition by this tool is associated with the level of dependence. The rationale of nutritional assessment is to identify patients candidate to nutritional support. However, the sensitivity of the MNA is still debated because it has been associated with a high-risk 'overdiagnosis' and the advantages of a positive screening need to be assessed both in terms of outcome and money saving. SUMMARY: The MNA is a simple and highly sensitive tool for nutritional screening and assessment. The large mass of data collected and the diffusion among healthcare professionals clearly support its use. However, the cost-effectiveness of interventions based on its scoring deserves investigation.},

Unlike formless conversational agents, like smart speakers or chatbots, VH bring together the capabilities of both a conversational agent and an interactive avatar (computer-represented digital characters). Although their use in patient-facing systems has garnered substantial interest, it is unknown to what extent VH are effective in health applications. Objective: The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of VH in patient-facing systems. The design and implementation characteristics of these systems were also examined. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with relevant key terms. Studies were included in the systematic review if they designed or evaluated VH in patient-facing systems. Of the included studies, studies that used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate VH were included in the meta-analysis; they were then summarized using the PICOTS framework (population, intervention, comparison group, outcomes, time frame, setting). Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated, and the risk of bias was assessed. Results: Among the 8,125 unique records identified, 53 articles describing 33 unique systems, were qualitatively, systematically reviewed. Two distinct design categories emerged --- simple VH and VH augmented with health sensors and trackers. Of the 53 articles, 16 (26 studies) with 44 primary and 22 secondary outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the 44 primary outcome measures revealed a significant difference between intervention and control conditions, favoring the VH intervention (SMD = .166, 95\% CI .039-.292, P=.012), but with evidence of some heterogeneity, I2=49.3\%. There were more cross-sectional (k=15) than longitudinal studies (k=11). The intervention was delivered using a personal computer in most studies (k=18), followed by a tablet (k=4), mobile kiosk (k=2), head-mounted display (k=1), and a desktop computer in a community center (k=1). Conclusions: We offer evidence for the efficacy of VH in patient-facing systems. Considering that studies included different population and outcome types, more focused analysis is needed in the future. Future studies also need to identify what features of virtual human interventions contribute toward their effectiveness.},

However, the industry faces hurdles in comprehending the intricacies of trust dynamics within the domain of HRC. It exerts considerable influence on both productivity and safety within the construction sector. To address this issue, the paper proposes machine learning-based models to predict and enhance human trust in construction robots using psychophysiological data. Through a virtual reality bricklaying task across varied construction settings, this study collected psychophysiological data from participants and predicted trust score. Results indicated that electrodermal activity and skin temperature were two significant standalone variables for trust prediction. With similar R squared value of 0.98, the XG boost, and random forest models displayed superior predictive accuracy, with minor standard deviations of 0.003 and 0.004, respectively. This study contributes valuable insights into trust dynamics, paving the way for more dependable and secure HRC in construction, optimizing workflows and ensuring industry-wide advancements.},

With the outpatient text classification system, users can talk about their situation to a service robot and the robot can tell them which clinic they should register with. In the implementation of the proposed method, dialog text of users in the Taiwan E Hospital were collected as the training data set. Through natural language processing (NLP), the information in the dialog text was extracted, sorted, and converted to train the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model. Experimental results verify the ability of the robot to respond to questions autonomously through acquired casual knowledge.},

The influencing factors are divided into three types: individual, social, and technology. [Conclusions]: This study finds that IHMT's application covers all aspects of the health services of the elderly. Among these applications, self-monitoring is the most used. We divided the influencing factors of the elderly's acceptance of IHMT into three categories and nine subcategories, having 25 variables.},

  abstract = {Deductive coding is a widely used qualitative research method for determining the prevalence of themes across documents. While useful, deductive coding is often burdensome and time consuming since it requires researchers to read, interpret, and reliably categorize a large body of unstructured text documents. Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, are a class of quickly evolving AI tools that can perform a range of natural language processing and reasoning tasks. In this study, we explore the use of LLMs to reduce the time it takes for deductive coding while retaining the flexibility of a traditional content analysis. We outline the proposed approach, called LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), along with an in-depth case study using GPT-3.5 for LACA on a publicly available deductive coding data set. Additionally, we conduct an empirical benchmark using LACA on 4 publicly available data sets to assess the broader question of how well GPT-3.5 performs across a range of deductive coding tasks. Overall, we find that GPT-3.5 can often perform deductive coding at levels of agreement comparable to human coders. Additionally, we demonstrate that LACA can help refine prompts for deductive coding, identify codes for which an LLM is randomly guessing, and help assess when to use LLMs vs. human coders for deductive coding. We conclude with several implications for future practice of deductive coding and related research methods.},

The GUARDIAN ecosystem is designed to address the different needs of end users in different countries. The ecosystem consists of a socially assistive robot (SAR), including sensors, and two mobile applications (one for caregivers and one for the older user). Starting from a user-centred and value-sensitive co-design approach, three key user requirements have been identified: monitoring, reminding, and social companionship. User requirements were translated into technical requirements to develop a flexible system architecture. Usability tests were performed to verify the satisfaction level about the GUARDIAN concept. User tests were carried out in three different countries involving 13 older adults, 14 informal carers and 15 formal carers showing that the proposed ecosystem satisfies the user requirements. These results confirm the feasibility of the application of the GUARDIAN ecosystem in living indoor environments.},

  abstract = {Ubiquity (devices becoming part of the context) and transparency (devices not interfering with daily activities) are very significant in healthcare monitoring applications for elders. The present study undertakes a scoping review to map the literature on sensor-based unobtrusive monitoring of older adults' frailty. We aim to determine what types of devices comply with unobtrusiveness requirements, which frailty markers have been unobtrusively assessed, which unsupervised devices have been tested, the relationships between sensor outcomes and frailty markers, and which devices can assess multiple markers. SCOPUS, PUBMED, and Web of Science were used to identify papers published 2010--2020. We selected 67 documents involving non-hospitalized older adults (65+ y.o.) and assessing frailty level or some specific frailty-marker with some sensor. Among the nine types of body worn sensors, only inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the waist and wrist-worn sensors comply with ubiquity. The former can transparently assess all variables but weight loss. Wrist-worn devices have not been tested in unsupervised conditions. Unsupervised presence detectors can predict frailty, slowness, performance, and physical activity. Waist IMUs and presence detectors are the most promising candidates for unobtrusive and unsupervised monitoring of frailty. Further research is necessary to give specific predictions of frailty level with unsupervised waist IMUs.},

As part of a study evaluating the use of the Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) Paro in the homes of older adults with depression, we performed two focus groups with clinicians to discuss how they might use sensor data collected by domestic SARs in clinical practice. In the first focus group, participants discussed potential uses of currently available SARs and sensors by them and their clients. The second focus group took place after sensor data from sensors onboard the Paro robot had been collected in older adults' homes. Clinicians considered the data and what information might be most useful for supporting clinical care. Data regarding monitoring client health, such as behavioral changes in sleep and daily activity levels, were of particular interest to clinicians. They also suggested using SARs to provide clients with information and interaction could help them develop coping skills and alleviate symptoms.},

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6\% average accuracy on XNLI, +13\% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4\% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available.},

In order to help diagnose these disorders, social assistive robots are promising technologies to assist psychologists. To be accepted by the elderly, the robot behaviours must be close enough to the fundamental competences of the psychologists in order not to confuse the patient. This pilot study aims (1) to design a social assistive robot capable of performing a memory evaluation test, (2) to gather opinions on the robot's acceptability with an innovative method (persona) and (3) to identify robot behavioural improvements. We used the ``persona methodology'' for this pilot study. A panel of students playing the role of a ``persona'' performed the memory test called RL/RI16, by interacting with the social robot Pepper and then were interviewed about their experience. The robot plays the psychologist role. The interviews and videos analysis showed that the robot is not yet well accepted but the analysis results gave interesting leads to continue.},

The feasibility of feeding back more complex, seemingly unrelated measures to users was investigated, by assessing whether increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression (factors known to affect cardiac function) and general health measures could be accurately predicted using heart rate variability (HRV) data from wrist wearables alone. Levels of stress, anxiety, depression and general health were evaluated from subjective questionnaires completed on a weekly or twice-weekly basis by 652 participants. These scores were then converted into binary levels (either above or below a set threshold) for each health measure and used as tags to train Deep Neural Networks (LSTMs) to classify each health measure using HRV data alone. Three data input types were investigated: time domain, frequency domain and typical HRV measures. For mental health measures, classification accuracies of up to 83\% and 73\% were achieved, with five and two minute HRV data streams respectively, showing improved predictive capability and potential future wearable use for tracking stress and well-being.},

As the healthcare landscape changes, evolving into a partnership model, consumers are expected to assume more responsibility in managing their health, and play a more significant role in their care. Technology has the potential to help patients and caregivers become better informed, make better care decisions, and manage medical conditions outside clinical settings. It also can help prevent disabilities, enhance mobility and quality of life for people with physical limitations, and work to extend the life of people with chronic conditions.},

  abstract = {Thematic analysis (TA) has been widely used for analyzing qualitative data in many disciplines and fields. To ensure reliable analysis, the same piece of data is typically assigned to at least two human coders. Moreover, to produce meaningful and useful analysis, human coders develop and deepen their data interpretation and coding over multiple iterations, making TA labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recently the emerging field of large language models (LLMs) research has shown that LLMs have the potential replicate human-like behavior in various tasks: in particular, LLMs outperform crowd workers on text-annotation tasks, suggesting an opportunity to leverage LLMs on TA. We propose a human--LLM collaboration framework (i.e., LLM-in-the-loop) to conduct TA with in-context learning (ICL). This framework provides the prompt to frame discussions with a LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to generate the final codebook for TA. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using survey datasets on the aspects of the music listening experience and the usage of a password manager. Results of the two case studies show that the proposed framework yields similar coding quality to that of human coders but reduces TA's labor and time demands.},

  abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.}

  abstract = {Background: Manually analyzing public health--related content from social media provides valuable insights into the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals, shedding light on trends and patterns that can inform public understanding, policy decisions, targeted interventions, and communication strategies. Unfortunately, the time and effort needed from well-trained human subject matter experts makes extensive manual social media listening unfeasible. Generative large language models (LLMs) can potentially summarize and interpret large amounts of text, but it is unclear to what extent LLMs can glean subtle health-related meanings in large sets of social media posts and reasonably report health-related themes. Objective: We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs for topic model selection or inductive thematic analysis of large contents of social media posts by attempting to answer the following question: Can LLMs conduct topic model selection and inductive thematic analysis as effectively as humans did in a prior manual study, or at least reasonably, as judged by subject matter experts? Methods: We asked the same research question and used the same set of social media content for both the LLM selection of relevant topics and the LLM analysis of themes as was conducted manually in a published study about vaccine rhetoric. We used the results from that study as background for this LLM experiment by comparing the results from the prior manual human analyses with the analyses from 3 LLMs: GPT4-32K, Claude-instant-100K, and Claude-2-100K. We also assessed if multiple LLMs had equivalent ability and assessed the consistency of repeated analysis from each LLM. Results: The LLMs generally gave high rankings to the topics chosen previously by humans as most relevant. We reject a null hypothesis (P\&lt;.001, overall comparison) and conclude that these LLMs are more likely to include the human-rated top 5 content areas in their top rankings than would occur by chance. Regarding theme identification, LLMs identified several themes similar to those identified by humans, with very low hallucination rates. Variability occurred between LLMs and between test runs of an individual LLM. Despite not consistently matching the human-generated themes, subject matter experts found themes generated by the LLMs were still reasonable and relevant. Conclusions: LLMs can effectively and efficiently process large social media--based health-related data sets. LLMs can extract themes from such data that human subject matter experts deem reasonable. However, we were unable to show that the LLMs we tested can replicate the depth of analysis from human subject matter experts by consistently extracting the same themes from the same data. There is vast potential, once better validated, for automated LLM-based real-time social listening for common and rare health conditions, informing public health understanding of the public's interests and concerns and determining the public's ideas to address them.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful generative Artificial Intelligence solutions. This paper presents results and reflections of an experiment done with the LLM GPT 3.5-Turbo to perform an inductive Thematic Analysis (TA). Previous research has worked on conducting deductive analysis. Thematic Analysis is a qualitative method for analysis commonly used in social sciences and it is based on interpretations by the human analyst(s) and the identification of explicit and latent meanings in qualitative data. The paper presents the motivations for attempting this analysis; it reflects on how the six phases to a TA proposed by Braun and Clarke can partially be reproduced with the LLM and it reflects on what are the model's outputs. The paper uses two datasets of open access semi-structured interviews, previously analysed by other researchers. The first dataset contains interviews with videogame players, and the second is a dataset of interviews with lecturers teaching data science in a University. This paper used the analyses previously conducted on these datasets to compare with the results produced by the LLM. The results show that the model can infer most of the main themes from previous research. This shows that using LLMs to perform an inductive TA is viable and offers a good degree of validity. The discussion offers some recommendations for working with LLMs in qualitative analysis.},

However, despite ubiquitous visions of a robotic future, very few fully-fledged social robots are currently available to consumers. To improve their designs, studies of their long-term use are particularly valuable, but are currently unavailable. To address this gap, we report on interviews with four long-term users of Pepper - a social robot introduced in 2014. Our thematic analysis elicited insights across three kinds of value Pepper brought to its users: utilitarian functionality; the community that formed around Pepper; and a personal value of affection. We focus on two contributions those values bring to social robot design: social robots as social proxies, alleviating disabilities or acting akin to social media profiles; and robot nurturing as a design construct, going beyond purely utilitarian or hedonistic perspectives on robots.},

  abstract = {Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is getting a lot of attention for its potential in assisting elderly users. However, for robotic assistive applications to be effective, they need to satisfy the particular needs of each user and be well perceived. For this purpose, a personalization based on user's characteristics such as personality and cognitive profile, and their dynamic changes is a crucial factor. Moreover, most of the existing solutions rely on the availability of specific technological infrastructures, generally requiring high economic investment, and that cannot be easily placed in different environments. Personalization and adaptation of assistive robotics applications to different user's characteristics and needs, and even to different technological environments, are still not fully addressed in real environments. In the present work, the results of the UPA4SAR project are presented. The project aimed at providing a social robotic system to deliver assistive tasks for home care of patients with mild cognitive impairment in a personalized and adaptive way. We introduce the general architecture of the system and the developed robotic behaviors. Personalization and dynamic adaptation of assistive tasks are realized using a service-oriented approach by taking into account both user's characteristics and environmental dynamic conditions. Field experimentation of the project was carried out with 7 patients, using the robotic system autonomously running in their homes for a total of 118 days. Results showed a reliable functioning of the proposed robotic system, a generally positive reaction, and a good acceptability rate from patients.},

The robot intelligence is programmed using the state-of-the-art IBM Watson AI Cloud services, which provide the necessary capabilities for improving the social interaction and scoring the tests.

The RiSH integrates a home service robot, a home sensor network, a body sensor network, a mobile device, cloud servers, and remote caregivers. A layered architecture is proposed to guide the design and implementation of the RiSH software. Basic service functions are developed to allow the RiSH to recognize human body activity using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the home service robot to perceive the environment through audio signals. Based on these functions, we developed two low-level applications: (1) particle filter-based human localization and tracking using wearable motion sensors and distributed binary sensors; (2) Dynamic Bayesian Network-based human activity recognition using microphones and distributed binary sensors. Both applications extend the robot's perception beyond its onboard sensors. Utilizing the low-level applications, a high-level application is realized that detects and responds to human falls. We conducted experiments in our RiSH testbed to evaluate auditory perception services, human body activity recognition, human position tracking, sound-based human activity monitoring, and fall detection and rescue. Twelve human subjects were asked to conduct daily activities in the testbed and mimic falls. All data of their movement, body activities, and sound events were collected by the robot. Human trajectories were estimated with a root mean square error of less than 0.2 m. The robot was able to recognize 37 human activities through sound events with an average accuracy of 88\% and detect falling sounds with an accuracy of 80\% at the frame level. The experiments show the operation of the various components in the RiSH and the capabilities of the home service robot in monitoring and assisting the resident.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the importance and meanings of formal and informal social support relationships and neighbourhood ties for older adults `ageing in place' in urban neighbourhoods in two different welfare state settings: Portland (Oregon, the United States) and Amsterdam (the Netherlands). The rising number of people growing old(er) in urban environments raises new demands and pressing challenges for urban development. The majority of older adults are and will be ageing in their homes and communities, as opposed to institutionalized care facilities and settings. At the same time, the provision of formal and public care is being increasingly challenged by government cutbacks. On top of this, the formerly strong welfare states in many European countries have weakened. In-depth interviews with 40 older adults and key informants in two neighbourhoods in each city provide the empirical basis for this study. In Portland, there are widespread local civic initiatives related to care provision for older adults. The city has a long tradition both of individual responsibility and community culture, which has emerged from and appears to compensate for the overall lack of state services and support. Amsterdam has a long tradition of state provision, but is experiencing a policy shift towards a stronger reliance on private market-led services, and an emphasis on family and community as providers of support. Although a few emerging local initiatives for elderly care in Amsterdam were identified, it is unclear whether this form of community support can compensate for decreasing state provision in Amsterdam. This study raises concerns about the future of care provision for older adults living in unsupportive urban neighbourhoods, without financial resources or nearby relatives.},

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a key symptom to be measured during follow-up, and there is a need for more easy-to-administer, ecological and engaging tools to assess it. Virtual agents have shown their effectiveness in performing clinical evaluation in a medical environment. A virtual agent assessing excessive daytime sleepiness via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale has been tested at home by 102 patients treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and their homecare providers. Acceptance and trustworthiness of the agent, as well as the influence of demographics and clinical characteristics of patients, were investigated. Results showed that both patients and homecare providers reported a positive attitude towards the virtual agent, which was found to be usable, satisfactory, credible and benevolent. Homecare providers reported that it was not a burden to their working routine. Positive regression coefficients were found between patients' and homecare providers' attitudes towards the virtual agent. We found no influence of patients' demographics and clinical characteristics on their acceptance of the virtual agent. This shows that virtual agents are well accepted by patients and homecare providers, independently of their demographics and clinical characteristics. Positive regression coefficients observed between patients' and homecare providers' perceptions of the agent indicate that the opinions of both influence acceptance of the virtual agent in a homecare context. Virtual agents are new innovative digital solutions to be considered in homecare follow-up of apneic patients treated by CPAP.},

  abstract = {With the increase in global life expectancy and the advance of technology, the creation of age-friendly environments is a priority in the design of new products for elderly people healthcare. This paper presents a proposal for a real-time health monitoring system of older adults living in geriatric residences. This system was developed to help caregivers to have a better control in monitoring the health of their patients and have closer communication with their patients' family members. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposal, a prototype was built, using a biometric bracelet connected to a mobile application, which allows real-time visualization of all the information generated by the sensors (heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygenation) in the bracelet. Using these data, caregivers can make decisions about the health status of their patients. The evaluation found that the users perceived the system to be easy to learn and use, providing initial evidence that our proposal could improve the quality of the adult's healthcare.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance of a nonintrusive device placed under the mattress to detect sleep apnea syndrome. METHODS: One hundred eighteen patients suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea syndrome completed a night at a sleep clinic with a simultaneous polysomnography (PSG) and recording with the Withings Sleep Analyzers. PSG nights were scored twice: first as simple polygraphy, then as PSG. RESULTS: Average (standard deviation) apnea-hypopnea index from PSG was 31.2 events/h (25.0) and 32.8 events/h (29.9) according to the Withings Sleep Analyzers. The mean absolute error was 9.5 events/h. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve at thresholds of apnea-hypopnea index {$\geq$} 15 events/h were, respectively, sensitivity (Se)15 = 88.0\%, specificity (Sp)15 = 88.6\%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 15 = 0.926. At the threshold of apnea-hypopnea index {$\geq$} 30 events/h, results included Se30 = 86.0\%, Sp30 = 91.2\%, AUROC30 = 0.954. The average total sleep time from PSG and the Withings Sleep Analyzers was 366.6 (61.2) and 392.4 (67.2) minutes, sleep efficiency was 82.5\% (11.6) and 82.6\% (11.6), and wake after sleep onset was 62.7 (48.0) and 45.2 (37.3) minutes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Withings Sleep Analyzers accurately detect moderate-severe sleep apnea syndrome in patients suspected of sleep apnea syndrome. This simple and automated approach could be of great clinical value given the high prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome in the general population.

  abstract = {Cold exposure has been considered an essential risk factor for the global disease burden, while its role in cardiovascular diseases is still underappreciated. The increase in frequency and duration of extreme cold weather events like cold spells makes it an urgent task to evaluate the effects of ambient cold on different types of cardiovascular disease and to understand the factors contributing to the population's vulnerability. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane. We included original research that explored the association between cold exposure (low temperature and cold spell) and cardiovascular disease outcomes (mortality and morbidity). We did a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) of the association between a 1{\textcelsius} decrease in temperature or cold spells and cardiovascular disease outcomes. In total, we included 159 studies in the meta-analysis. As a result, every 1{\textcelsius} decrease in temperature increased cardiovascular disease-related mortality by 1.6\% (RR 1.016; [95\% CI 1.015--1.018]) and morbidity by 1.2\% (RR 1.012; [95\% CI 1.010--1.014]). The most pronounced effects of low temperatures were observed in the mortality of coronary heart disease (RR 1.015; [95\% CI 1.011--1.019]) and the morbidity of aortic aneurysm and dissection (RR 1.026; [95\% CI 1.021--1.031]), while the effects were not significant in hypertensive disease outcomes. Notably, we identified climate zone, country income level and age as crucial influential factors in the impact of ambient cold exposure on cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the impact of cold spells on cardiovascular disease outcomes is significant, which increased mortality by 32.4\% (RR 1.324; [95\% CI 1.234--1.421]) and morbidity by 13.8\% (RR 1.138; [95\% CI 1.015--1.276]). In conclusion, cold exposure is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and the cold effect varies between disease types and climate zones.},

There are numerous potential benefits in using these devices, especially among seniors. Yet, little is known about seniors' adoption behavior. Through a mixed-methods approach, this study investigates the factors that impact seniors' intention to use wearable devices. Results from an online survey and interviews showed that seniors' perception of the complexity of working with these devices is a barrier to their adoption decisions. Looking more deeply into the role of complexity revealed that seniors' concern about the complexity of reading and interpreting the output of wearable devices is the main deterring element. Furthermore, we explored the role of two important elements: seniors' cognitive age, and the influence of their subjective well-being on their adoption behavior. Results demonstrated that cognitive age does not significantly impact use intention by itself; nonetheless, subjective well-being moderates its effect. This result revealed an interesting finding, which is that the influence of cognitive age on seniors' use intention depends on seniors' level of subjective well-being. When seniors' subjective well-being is low, surprisingly, cognitive age increases seniors' intention to use the device. These findings provide interesting implications for practice and future research.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess how cohabitation with a social robot for seven days night and day is perceived by elderly potential users and to suggest technological improvements for future home integration. Methods: Fifteen participants were invited to interact with PepperVR , 24 h a day and 7 days a week. Perceived utility assessment was achieved using a dedicated questionnaire. Usability assessment was carried out by measuring satisfaction with the human-robot interaction and listing malfunctions. Results: Seventy-eight tasks out of 115 tasks were reported respectively as very high and high. On day 1, satisfaction was at its higher level with a mean of 6.8. On day 8, it maintained at 6.0 despite technical malfunctions and failures, listed with details in this paper. Acceptability was positive. Pepper was mainly considered as an assistant and a link with family and friends and never as an enemy or intruder. Pepper has proven to be potentially able to meet five needs: making the person's environment safe by alerting contact persons, reminding the user of health-related tasks, enabling ``doubt removal'', maintaining social relationships and following the user. Conclusions: Pepper is more than a ``demonstration'' device classified as level 6 of the nine-point Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale for the hard and software and level 5 in behavioural terms. Once the technological locks and malfunctions have been overcome, Pepper should be applicable in the home, allowing users to test it in a more familiar environment.},

While much attention has been paid to robots that provide assistance to people through physical contact (which we call contact assistive robotics), and to robots that entertain through social interaction (social interactive robotics), so far there is no clear definition of socially assistive robotics. We summarize active social assistive research projects and classify them by target populations, application domains, and interaction methods. While distinguishing these from socially interactive robotics endeavors, we discuss challenges and opportunities that are specific to the growing field of socially assistive robotics.},

An important prerequisite for effective use is knowledge about which factors facilitate and hinder the acceptance of social robots. The aim of this review at the intersection of health care research and human--robot interaction research is to understand factors facilitating and hindering the acceptance of social robots for older adults and people living with dementia in nursing homes based on the Almere model and to identify research gaps. We conducted a scoping review, systematically searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Compendex. The Almere model of acceptance was used to guide the development and conduct of this review. We used the principles of deductive content analysis, and we narratively present the review results. Twenty-six studies were included in the review. We found facilitating and/or hindering factors for all constructs of the Almere model. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment were the most studied constructs, whereas trust and intention to use were the least studied constructs. Across constructs, seeing robots positively impacting residents was one of the key facilitating factors, and practical difficulties were a hindering factor. The Almere model provided useful insight into the acceptance of social robots. Nevertheless, we found the concept of engagement, the nursing home context, the intervention characteristics and the individual user groups important for the acceptance of social robots in nursing homes and therefore argue for future research expanding on the model.},

The development of wearable solutions for telemonitoring biological signals has been viewed as a strategy to enhance older adults' healthcare sustainability. This study aims to review the biological signals remotely monitored by technologies in older adults. PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Web of Science, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were systematically searched in December 2021. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses of remote health-related biological and environmental monitoring signals in older adults were considered, with publication dates between 2016 and 2022, written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Studies referring to conference proceedings or articles with abstract access only were excluded. The data were extracted independently by two reviewers, using a predefined table form, consulting a third reviewer in case of doubts or concerns. Eighteen studies were included, fourteen systematic reviews and four meta-analyses. Nine of the reviews included older adults from the community, whereas the others also included institutionalized participants. Heart and respiratory rate, physical activity, electrocardiography, body temperature, blood pressure, glucose, and heart rate were the most frequently measured biological variables, with physical activity and heart rate foremost. These were obtained through wearables, with the waist, wrist, and ankle being the most mentioned body regions for the device's placement. Six of the reviews presented the psychometric properties of the systems, most of which were valid and accurate. In relation to environmental signals, only two articles presented data on this topic. Luminosity, temperature, and movement were the most mentioned variables. The need for large-scale long-term health-related telemonitoring implementation of studies with larger sample sizes was pointed out by several reviews in order to define the feasibility levels of wearable devices.},

However, their use is also associated with substantial ethical challenges. In this chapter a typology of different social robots for assessment and monitoring purposes is provided, including telepresence, testing and surveillance robots, and the ethical challenges associated with their use will be explored. The chapter proposes to distinguish three groups of relevant values that need to be ethically considered with regard to these robots: (1) values related to assessment and monitoring, specifically assessment quality and privacy, (2) values related to the social aspects of the robots, specifically acceptability and transparency, and finally (3) the value of caring. Three prototypical uses of social robots for assessment and monitoring will be described, drawing on these identified values: telepresence-facilitated remote diagnosis in hospital settings, testing and interventions for children with autism, and ongoing domestic monitoring and assistance for persons with dementia. It will be argued that in order to address the ethical concerns effectively, value-sensitive design and deployment planning as well as tailored training of professionals to use those robots are essential requirements.},

From a semantic perspective most of these terms emphasize a diversity of positive conditions across the ageing process and during old age, such as physical fitness and health, optimal cognitive functioning, positive emotional states, and social involvement. Three important methodological issues emerge from the field: (1) although it is generally considered a multidimensional concept there are also researchers who reduce positive ageing to just one of its components, (2) moreover, those components can be assessed by objective and/or subjective indicators; and, finally, (3) this conceptual and methodological diversity determines that the prevalence of positive ageing reported is extremely broad. Since empirical definition of any scientific concept requires consensus, this paper discusses several definitions of ageing well with reference to the results yielded by the ELEA Study (Longitudinal Study of Active Ageing). Results support a multidimensional concept of positive ageing, composed of objective and subjective measures, with a similar structure to well considered definitions of positive ageing: health, cognition, activity, positive affect, and physical fitness are the major domains for ageing well and this structure is not affected by age or gender. Also, when prevalence of ageing well is calculated through simple and multi-domain measure assessed by objective and subjective indicators, multi-domain measures show more realistic results.},

Objective: This study aims to adapt and co-design the World Health Organization's Self-Help Plus intervention into a mobile health intervention for these target groups. Methods: On the basis of the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials and Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management models, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes were developed. Prototypes were evaluated by 13 domain experts from diverse sectors and 15 participants from the target groups to assess usability, attractiveness, and functionality through semantic differential scales, the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale questionnaire, and semistructured interviews. Results: Feedback from participants indicated positive perceptions of the mobile health intervention, highlighting its ease of use, appropriate language, and attractive multimedia content. Areas identified for improvement included enhancing user engagement through reminders, monitoring features, and increased personalization. The quality of the content and adherence to initial protocols were positively evaluated. Conclusions: This research provides valuable insights for future studies aiming to enhance the usability, efficacy, and effectiveness of the app, suggesting the potential role of a chatbot-delivered Self-Help Plus intervention as a supportive tool for pregnant women and women with a breast cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Future social robots should have personalized behaviors based on user emotional state to fit more in ordinary users' activities and to improve the human--robot interaction. Several, literature works use cameras to record emotions. However, these approaches may not be effective in everyday life, due to camera obstructions and different types of stimulation, which can be related also with the interaction with other human beings. Therefore, in this work, it is investigated the electrocardiogram, the electrodermal activity, and the electric brain activity physiological signals as main informative channels. The aforementioned signals have been acquired through the use of a wireless wearable sensor network. An experimental methodology was proposed to induce three different emotional states by means of social interaction. Two different combinations of sensors were analyzed using three different time-window frames (180s, 150s, and 120s) and classified with three unsupervised machine learning approaches (K-Means, K-medoids and Self-organizing maps). Finally, their classification performances were compared to the ones obtained by four commonly used supervised techniques (i.e. Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and k-nearest neighbor) to discuss the optimal combination of sensors, time-window length, and unsupervised classifier. Fifteen healthy young participants were recruited in the study and more than 100 instances were analyzed. The proposed approaches achieve an accuracy of 77\% in the best-unsupervised case and 85\% with the best-supervised ones.},

Based on related conceptions, we propose affinity for technology interaction (ATI), defined as the tendency to actively engage in intensive technology interaction, as a key personal resource for coping with technology. We present the 9-item ATI scale, an economical unidimensional scale that assesses ATI as an interaction style rooted in the construct need for cognition (NFC). Results of multiple studies (n~{$>~$}1500) showed that the scale achieves good to excellent reliability, exhibits expected moderate to high correlations with geekism, technology enthusiasm, NFC, self-reported success in technical problem-solving and technical system learning success, and also with usage of technical systems. Further, correlations of ATI with the Big Five personality dimensions were weak at most. Based on the results, the ATI scale appears to be a promising tool for research applications such as the characterization of user diversity in system usability tests and the construction of general models of user-technology interaction.}

  abstract = {To integrate social robots in real-life contexts, it is crucial that they are accepted by the users. Acceptance is not only related to the functionality of the robot but also strongly depends on how the user experiences the interaction. Established design principles from usability and user experience research can be applied to the realm of human--robot interaction, to design robot behavior for the comfort and well-being of the user. Focusing the design on these aspects alone, however, comes with certain ethical challenges, especially regarding the user's privacy and autonomy. Based on an example scenario of human--robot interaction in elder care, this paper discusses how established design principles can be used in social robotic design. It then juxtaposes these with ethical considerations such as privacy and user autonomy. Combining user experience and ethical perspectives, we propose adjustments to the original design principles and canvass our own design recommendations for a positive and ethically acceptable social human--robot interaction design. In doing so, we show that positive user experience and ethical design may be sometimes at odds, but can be reconciled in many cases, if designers are willing to adjust and amend time-tested design principles.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, but they still face challenges in practical applications, such as hallucinations, slow knowledge updates, and lack of transparency in answers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge bases before answering questions with LLMs. RAG has been demonstrated to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce model hallucination, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks. By citing sources, users can verify the accuracy of answers and increase trust in model outputs. It also facilitates knowledge updates and the introduction of domain-specific knowledge. RAG effectively combines the parameterized knowledge of LLMs with non-parameterized external knowledge bases, making it one of the most important methods for implementing large language models. This paper outlines the development paradigms of RAG in the era of LLMs, summarizing three paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. It then provides a summary and organization of the three main components of RAG: retriever, generator, and augmentation methods, along with key technologies in each component. Furthermore, it discusses how to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG models, introducing two evaluation methods for RAG, emphasizing key metrics and abilities for evaluation, and presenting the latest automatic evaluation framework. Finally, potential future research directions are introduced from three aspects: vertical optimization, horizontal scalability, and the technical stack and ecosystem of RAG.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development.},

  abstract = {The population in developed countries is aging and this fact results in high elderly health costs, as well as a decrease in the number of active working members to support these costs. This could lead to a collapse of the current systems. One of the first insights of the decline in elderly people is frailty, which could be decelerated if it is detected at an early stage. Nowadays, health professionals measure frailty manually through questionnaires and tests of strength or gait focused on the physical dimension. Sensors are increasingly used to measure and monitor different e-health indicators while the user is performing Basic Activities of Daily Life (BADL). In this paper, we present a system based on microservices architecture, which collects sensory data while the older adults perform Instrumental ADLs (IADLs) in combination with BADLs. IADLs involve physical dimension, but also cognitive and social dimensions. With the sensory data we built a machine learning model to assess frailty status which outperforms the previous works that only used BADLs. Our model is accurate, ecological, non-intrusive, flexible and can help health professionals to automatically detect frailty.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective The assessment of dependence in older adults currently requires a manual collection of data taken from questionnaires. This process is time consuming for the clinicians and intrudes the daily life of the elderly. This paper aims to semi-automate the acquisition and analysis of health data to assess and predict the dependence in older adults while executing one instrumental activity of daily living (IADL). Methods In a mobile-health (m-health) scenario, we analyze whether the acquisition of data through wearables during the performance of IADLs, and with the help of machine learning techniques could replace the traditional questionnaires to evaluate dependence. To that end, we collected data from wearables, while older adults do the shopping activity. A trial supervisor (TS) labelled the different shopping stages (SS) in the collected data. We performed data pre-processing techniques over those SS and analyzed them with three machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results Our results confirm that it is possible to replace the traditional questionnaires with wearable data. In particular, the best learning algorithm we tried reported an accuracy of 97\% in the assessment of dependence. We tuned the hyperparameters of this algorithm and used embedded feature selection technique to get the best performance with a subset of only 10 features out of the initial 85. This model considers only features extracted from four sensors of a single wearable: accelerometer, heart rate, electrodermal activity and temperature. Although these features are not observational, our current proposal is semi-automatic, because it needs a TS labelling the SS (with a smartphone application). In the future, this labelling process could be automatic as well. Conclusions Our method can semi-automatically assess the dependence, without disturbing daily activities of elderly people. This method can save clinicians' time in the evaluation of dependence in older adults and reduce healthcare costs.},

One of its phases consists of performing different tests to the patient or relatives. In this paper we present the challenges to apply Automated Planning to control an autonomous robot helping the clinician to perform such tests. On the one hand the paper focuses on the modelling decisions taken, from an initial approach where each test was encoded using slightly different domains, to the final unified domain allowing any test to be represented. On the other hand, the paper deals with practical issues arisen when executing the plans. Preliminary tests performed with real users show that the proposed approach is able to seamlessly handle the patient-robot interaction in real time, recovering from unexpected events and adapting to the users' preferred input method, while being able to gather all the information needed by the clinician.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim Loneliness is a common problem in older adults and contributes to poor health. This scoping review aimed to synthesize and report evidence on the effectiveness of interventions using social robots or computer agents to reduce loneliness in older adults and to explore intervention strategies. Methods The review adhered to the Arksey and O'Malley process for conducting scoping reviews. The SCOPUS, PUBMED, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore databases were searched in November, 2020. A two-step selection process identified eligible research. Information was extracted from papers and entered into an Excel coding sheet and summarised. Quality assessments were conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results Twenty-nine studies were included, of which most were of moderate to high quality. Eighteen were observational and 11 were experimental. Twenty-four used robots, four used computer agents and one study used both. The majority of results showed that robots or computer agents positively impacted at least one loneliness outcome measure. Some unintended negative consequences on social outcomes were reported, such as sadness when the robot was removed. Overall, the interventions helped to combat loneliness by acting as a direct companion (69\%), a catalyst for social interaction (41\%), facilitating remote communication with others (10\%) and reminding users of upcoming social engagements (3\%). Conclusion Evidence to date suggests that robots can help combat loneliness in older adults, but there is insufficient research on computer agents. Common strategies for reducing loneliness include direct companionship and enabling social interactions. Future research could investigate other strategies used in human interventions (eg, addressing maladaptive social cognition and improving social skills), and the effects of design features on efficacy. It is recommended that more robust experimental and mixed methods research be conducted, using a combination of validated self-report, observational, and interview measures of loneliness.},

The proposed assessment of the robotic functionalities are based on end-user perception of attractiveness, usability and potential societal impact of the device. The methods of evaluation applied consist of User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), AttrakDiff and the societal impact inventory tailored for the project purposes. The prototype version of the Robotic Assistant for MCI patients at Home (RAMCIP) was tested in a semi-controlled environment at the Department of Neurology (Lublin, Poland). Eighteen elderly participants, 10 healthy and 8 MCI, performed everyday tasks and functions facilitated by RAMCIP. The tasks consisted of semi-structuralized scenarios like: medication intake, hazardous events prevention, and social interaction. No differences between the groups of subjects were observed in terms of perceived attractiveness, usability nor-societal impact of the device. The robotic assistant societal impact and attractiveness were highly assessed. The usability of the device was reported as neutral due to the short time of interaction.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 has prompted a surge in the adoption of technology, highlighting a number of potential applications for Socially Assistive Robots (SARs). Our entire healthcare system has been under unprecedented strain, and going forward, we must consider how robotic technology could help improve the quality of care and day-to-day functionality of our care facilities. Herein, we present our human-robot interaction study in a local long-term care centre during the pandemic and the lessons learned from deploying a SAR to screen staff members. We investigate staff acceptance and the influence of demographics on perceptions of the SAR. Results show that overall, staff were positive about the screening robot, and that autonomous screening with a social robot is a potential application in long-term care homes. We further detail the challenges and future opportunities to develop SARs, including recommendations to successfully implement and adopt these robots in a post-pandemic society.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the globe has increased the need to adopt autonomous social robots within our healthcare systems. In particular, socially assistive robots can help to improve the day-to-day functioning of our healthcare facilities including long-term care, while keeping residents and staff safe by performing repetitive tasks such as health screening. In this paper, we present the first human-robot interaction study with an autonomous multi-task socially assistive robot used for non-contact screening in long-term care homes. The robot monitors temperature, checks for face masks, and asks screening questions to minimize human-to-human contact. We investigated staff perceptions of 7 attributes: screening experience without and with the robot, efficiency, cognitive attitude, freeing up staff, safety, affective attitude, and intent to use the robot. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of demographics on these attributes. Study results show that, overall, staff rated these attributes high for the screening robot, with a statistically significant increase in cognitive attitude and safety after interacting with the robot. Differences between gender and occupation were also determined. Our study highlights the potential application of an autonomous screening robot for long-term care homes.},

  abstract = {Background               Wrist-worn devices that incorporate photoplethysmography (PPG) sensing represent an exciting means of measuring heart rate (HR). A number of studies have evaluated the accuracy of HR measurements produced by these devices in controlled laboratory environments. However, it is also important to establish the accuracy of measurements produced by these devices outside the laboratory, in real-world, consumer use conditions.                                         Objective               This study sought to examine the accuracy of HR measurements produced by the Withings ScanWatch during free-living activities.                                         Methods               A sample of convenience of 7 participants volunteered (3 male and 4 female; mean age 64, SD 10 years; mean height 164, SD 4 cm; mean weight 77, SD 16 kg) to take part in this real-world validation study. Participants were instructed to wear the ScanWatch for a 12-hour period on their nondominant wrist as they went about their day-to-day activities. A Polar H10 heart rate sensor was used as the criterion measure of HR. Participants used a study diary to document activities undertaken during the 12-hour study period. These activities were classified according to the 11 following domains: desk work, eat or drink, exercise, gardening, household activities, self-care, shopping, sitting, sleep, travel, and walking. Validity was assessed using the Bland-Altman analysis, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).                                         Results               Across all activity domains, the ScanWatch measured HR with MAPE values {$<$}10\%, except for the shopping activity domain (MAPE=10.8\%). The activity domains that were more sedentary in nature (eg, desk work, eat or drink, and sitting) produced the most accurate HR measurements with a small mean bias and MAPE values {$<$}5\%. Moderate to strong correlations (CCC=0.526-0.783) were observed between devices for all activity domains, except during the walking activity domain, which demonstrated a weak correlation (CCC=0.164) between devices.                                         Conclusions               The results of this study show that the ScanWatch measures HR with a degree of accuracy that is acceptable for general consumer use; however, it would not be suitable in circumstances where more accurate measurements of HR are required, such as in health care or in clinical trials. Overall, the ScanWatch was less accurate at measuring HR during ambulatory activities (eg, walking, gardening, and household activities) compared to more sedentary activities (eg, desk work, eat or drink, and sitting). Further larger-scale studies examining this device in different populations and during different activities are required.},

We explore the reasons for the know-do gap and the principles of how these barriers to implementation might be overcome. We explore how these principles should affect the conduct of applied health research to close the know gap. We propose that impaired flow of knowledge is an important contributory factor in the failure to implement evidence-based practice in CGA; this could be addressed through specific knowledge mobilisation techniques. We describe that implementation failures are also produced by an inadequate evidence base that requires the co-production of research, addressing not only effectiveness but also the feasibility and acceptability of new services, the educational needs of practitioners, the organisational requirements of services, and the contribution made by policy. Only by tackling these issues in concert and appropriate proportion, will the know and know-do gaps for CGA be closed.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions: Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients' daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

A patient-oriented frailty website is a virtual health resource where community-dwelling older adults and their caregiver can navigate to and answer a series of health related questions and receive an automated frailty / health evaluation with a summary fit-frail score. This information can then be shared with a healthcare professionals, to help with the understanding of health status prior to acute illness, as well as to screen and identify older adult individuals for frailty. Our viewpoints were drawn from two discussion sessions comprised of caregivers and care providers, and community-dwelling older adults. Our aim is to report that barriers of a patient-oriented frailty website include but are not limited to: its inherent restrictiveness to frail persons, concerns over data privacy, time commitment worries, and the need for health / lifestyle resources in addition to a summary score. For each barrier we discuss potential solutions and caveats to those solutions, including assistance from caregivers, hosting the website from a trusted source, reducing the number of health questions that need to be answered, and resources tailored to each users' responses, respectively. In addition to screening and identifying frail older adults, a patient-oriented frailty website will help promote healthy aging in non-frail adults, encourage aging in place, support real-time monitoring, and enable personalized and preventative care.},

However, authors often reported discordant effects of both barometric pressure and air temperature on stroke occurrence. The present study investigated whether there was an association between weather parameters (barometric pressure and temperature) and ischemic stroke hospitalization. The aim of the study was to find out whether daily barometric pressure may be used as a prognostic variable to evaluate the workload change of a neurological intensive care unit. We conducted a retrospective review study in which we collected the independent (barometric pressure and temperature) and dependent variables (stroke hospitalization) every 24~h for the periods 10/1/2016--4/30/2017 at Augusta University Medical Center of Augusta, GA. We analyzed the data with zero-inflated Poisson model to assess the relationship between the barometric pressure, temperature, and daily stroke hospitalization. The results showed that there was a significantly correlation between daily barometric pressure variation and daily stroke hospitalization, especially on elder male patients ({$\geq$}\,65). Stroke events were more likely to occur in the patients with risk factors than in those without risk factors when exposed to barometric pressure and temperature changes. Decreased barometric pressure and increased temperature were associated with increased daily stroke hospitalization. Furthermore, there was a potential delayed effect of increased stroke events after cold temperature exposure. Barometric pressure and temperature changes over the preceding 24~h are associated with daily stroke hospitalization. These findings may enhance our understanding of relationship between stroke and weather and maybe used in the development of public health strategies to minimize the weather-related stroke risk.},

We conducted a pilot trial of individuals with AF using a smartphone to provide a relational agent as well as rhythm monitoring. We employed our pilot to measure acceptability and adherence and to assess its effectiveness in improving HRQoL and adherence.                                         Objective               This study aims to measure acceptability and adherence and to assess its effectiveness to improve HRQoL and adherence.                                         Methods               Participants were recruited from ambulatory clinics and randomized to a 30-day intervention or usual care. We collected baseline characteristics and conducted baseline and 30-day assessments of HRQoL using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) measure and self-reported adherence to anticoagulation. The intervention consisted of a smartphone-based relational agent, which simulates face-to-face counseling and delivered content on AF education, adherence, and symptom monitoring with prompted rhythm monitoring. We compared differences in AFEQT and adherence at 30 days, adjusted for baseline values. We quantified participants' use and acceptability of the intervention.

The control group had a 95\% follow-up, and the intervention group had a 93\% follow-up. The intervention group demonstrated significantly higher improvement in total AFEQT scores (adjusted mean difference 4.5; 95\% CI 0.6-8.3; P=.03) and in daily activity (adjusted mean difference 7.1; 95\% CI 1.8-12.4; P=.009) compared with the control between baseline and 30 days. The intervention group showed significantly improved self-reported adherence to anticoagulation therapy at 30 days (intervention 3.5\%; control 23.2\%; adjusted difference 16.6\%; 95\% CI 2.8\%-30.4\%; P{$<$}.001). Qualitative assessments of acceptability identified that participants found the relational agent useful, informative, and trustworthy.                                         Conclusions               Individuals randomized to a 30-day smartphone intervention with a relational agent and rhythm monitoring showed significant improvement in HRQoL and adherence. Participants had favorable acceptability of the intervention with both objective use and qualitative assessments of acceptability.},

Examples of functions that such robots would need to be able to execute are greeting visitors, reception check-in/out of patients, answering common questions they may have, showing them where to sit, helping them locate missing objects, providing directions to facilities, guiding them to different locations, etc. In this paper we describe current progress towards developing a multimodal conversational AI system integrated in a Social Conversational Robot (an ARI robot) that will act as a receptionist in a hospital waiting room. We present the developed architecture of the system and report on an initial experimental validation study carried out in laboratory conditions with the ARI robot.},

The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk?Methods:This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al.Results:Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities.Conclusions:A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.},

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture is the foundation of ChatGPT. On the internet, ChatGPT has been rapidly growing. This chatbot enables users to discuss with the AI by inputting prompts, and it is based on OpenAI's language model. Although ChatGPT is fantastic and produces exciting results for writing tales, poetry, songs, essays, and other things, it has certain restrictions. Users may ask the bot questions, and it will reply with pertinent, convincing subjects and replies. ChatGPT has now risen to the top of several academic agendas. Administrators create task teams and hold institution-wide meetings to react to the tools, with most of the advice being to adopt this technology. This paper briefs about the ChatGPT and its need. Further, various Progressive Work Flow Processes of the ChatGPT Tool are stated diagrammatically. Specific features and capabilities of the ChatGPT Support System are studied in this paper. Finally, we identified and discussed the significant roles of ChatGPT in the current scenario. The neural language models that form the foundation of character AI have been developed from the bottom up with talks in mind. This technology implies that the programme uses deep learning methods to analyse and produce text. The model ``understands'' the subtleties of human-produced natural language using vast amounts of data from the internet.},

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.},

Methods: Translation was performed by a forward--backward process. Validity was assessed as convergent validity in comparison with another self-perceived assessment of oral health (OHIP-14) and as group validity (n = 218; mean age 73 years). Reliability was proved in terms of internal consistency, inter-item and item-scale correlations, and stability (test--retest procedure; n = 36; mean age 77 years). The responsiveness to change in oral health status was assessed by pre- and post-treatment comparison (n = 21; mean age 63 years). Results: A German version of the GOHAI is presented. Convergent validity was sufficient (r = -0.76 compared with OHIP-14); group validity could be demonstrated for self-perceived need for treatment, chewing problems, number of own teeth, caries lesions present and dental status. The internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) as were inter-item and item-scale correlations, for which good homogeneity of the index was apparent. The test--retest correlation for the summary score was r = 0.84, single item correlations ranged from r = 0.36 to r = 0.89. The GOHAI sum score increased significantly after patients received new dentures, indicating responsiveness of the GOHAI to clinical change in the expected direction. Conclusions: The German version of the GOHAI had sufficient reliability, validity and responsiveness to be used as measure of oral health-related quality of life in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the elderly.},

As technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire. Driven by the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on 'Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a provisional answer to the question of what is meant by 'the user experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal~-~a stimulus for further UX research.}

  abstract = {The Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) has been proposed as an open platform for integrating heterogeneous medical devices and coordinating their activities to automate clinical workflows. A key element of the ICE vision is that pieces of an ICE system are verified and receive regulatory clearance in a component-wise fashion (instead of a pair-wise fashion) that will enable the cor-rectness and safety of all possible valid configurations to follow as a corollary of the correctness and safety of its components. In this paper, we sketch elements of a possible oversight ap-proach for ICE systems that we believe will allow regulatory agen-cies to move beyond the pair-wise clearance paradigm that exists today to one that accommodates component-wise clearance while still achieving agency mandates of assuring safety and effective-ness. We describe several concepts that we believe will be needed in this new regulatory paradigm including third-party certifica-tion of compliance to ICE interface standards, tool support for development of ICE components and evidence-based regulatory artifacts, and a security framework that will allow for automatic verification that ICE components are being used as intended in the clinical context, and that they has been cleared for safety and effectiveness.}

  abstract = {Background               Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical, psychological, social, and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC.                                         Objective               The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated.                                         Methods               Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data.                                         Results               From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4\%) and men (14/102, 13.6\%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants' comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients' own comments.                                         Conclusions               SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants' intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.

After adjusting for age, gender, country, body mass index, measurement days, mean blood pressure, and total time in bed, the odds ratio of having high BPV for those in the top tertile of sleep interruptions (poor sleep) was 1.37 (95\% CI, 1.28--1.47) and 1.44 (95\% CI, 1.35--1.54) for those in the lowest tertile of step count (physically inactive).

Comparing individuals with the worst exposure status (lowest step count and highest sleep interruptions, n = 2,690) to those with the most optimal status (highest step count and lowest sleep interruptions, n = 3,531) yielded an odds ratio of 2.01 (95\% CI, 1.80--2.25) for high BPV.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new pre-trained language model, DeBERTaV3, which improves the original DeBERTa model by replacing mask language modeling (MLM) with replaced token detection (RTD), a more sample-efficient pre-training task. Our analysis shows that vanilla embedding sharing in ELECTRA hurts training efficiency and model performance. This is because the training losses of the discriminator and the generator pull token embeddings in different directions, creating the "tug-of-war" dynamics. We thus propose a new gradient-disentangled embedding sharing method that avoids the tug-of-war dynamics, improving both training efficiency and the quality of the pre-trained model. We have pre-trained DeBERTaV3 using the same settings as DeBERTa to demonstrate its exceptional performance on a wide range of downstream natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Taking the GLUE benchmark with eight tasks as an example, the DeBERTaV3 Large model achieves a 91.37\% average score, which is 1.37\% over DeBERTa and 1.91\% over ELECTRA, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the models with a similar structure. Furthermore, we have pre-trained a multi-lingual model mDeBERTa and observed a larger improvement over strong baselines compared to English models. For example, the mDeBERTa Base achieves a 79.8\% zero-shot cross-lingual accuracy on XNLI and a 3.6\% improvement over XLM-R Base, creating a new SOTA on this benchmark. We have made our pre-trained models and inference code publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa.},

The research in this paper develops and tests an adaptation and theoretical extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by explaining intent to use not only in terms of variables related to functional evaluation like perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but also variables that relate to social interaction. The new model was tested using controlled experiment and longitudinal data collected regarding three different social agents at elderly care facilities and at the homes of older adults. The model was strongly supported accounting for 59--79\% of the variance in usage intentions and 49--59\% of the variance in actual use.

The data are large in scale, collected at low cost in the ``wild'', and often recorded in an automatic fashion, providing a powerful complement to traditional surveillance studies and controlled trials. These data are helping to reveal, for example, new insights about environmental and social influences on physical activity. The observational nature of the datasets and collection via commercial devices and apps pose challenges, however, including the potential for measurement, population, and/or selection bias, as well as missing data. In this article, we review insights gleaned from these datasets and propose best practices for addressing the limitations of large-scale data from apps and wearables. Our goal is to enable researchers to effectively harness the data from smartphone apps and wearable devices to better understand what drives physical activity and other health behaviors.},

We have developed a UX KPI for use in organizations based on the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). To achieve this, we added six questions to the UEQ to measure the importance of the UEQ scales. Based on the UEQ scales and the scores given for importance, we then developed a User Experience Questionnaire KPI (UEQ KPI). In a first study with 882 participants, we calculated and discussed the UEQ KPI using Amazon and Skype. The results show that the six supplementary questions could be answered independently of the UEQ itself. In our opinion, the extension can be implemented without any problems. The resulting UEQ KPI can be used for communication within an organization as a key performance indicator.},

This paper reviews the application of one such theory, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), to health care. We reviewed 16 data sets analyzed in over 20 studies of clinicians using health IT for patient care. Studies differed greatly in samples and settings, health ITs studied, research models, relationships tested, and construct operationalization. Certain TAM relationships were consistently found to be significant, whereas others were inconsistent. Several key relationships were infrequently assessed. Findings show that TAM predicts a substantial portion of the use or acceptance of health IT, but that the theory may benefit from several additions and modifications. Aside from improved study quality, standardization, and theoretically motivated additions to the model, an important future direction for TAM is to adapt the model specifically to the health care context, using beliefs elicitation methods.},

In this study, we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human--computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about               what               constructs influence the experiential component of human--computer interactions and about               how               these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear               why               the relations exist and               under which conditions               the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes. We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research.},

  abstract = {Advancement of sensor technologies has conducted to the rapid evolution of platforms, tools and approaches such as Internet of Things (IoT) for developing behavioral and physiological monitoring systems. Nowadays, According to growing number of elderlies living alone without their relatives scattered over the wide geographical areas, it is significantly essential to track their health function status continuously. In this paper, an IoT-based health monitoring system is proposed to check vital signs and detect biological and behavioral changes via smart elderly care technologies. It provides a health monitoring system for the involved medical teams to continuously monitor and assess a disabled or elderly's behavioral activity as well as the biological parameters, applying sensor technology through the IoT devices. In this approach, vital data is collected via IoT monitoring objects and then, data analysis is carried out through different machine learning methods such as Decision Tree (J48), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB) classifiers for detecting the level of probable risks of elderly's physiological and behavioral changes. The experimental results confirm that the SMO, MLP and NB classifiers meet approximately close performance considering the accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score factors. However, the J48 method shows the highest performance for health function status predicting in our scenario with 99\%, of accuracy and precision, 100\% of recall and 97\% of f-score. Moreover, the J48 performs with the lowest execution time in comparison to the other applied classifiers.},

  abstract = {Social and service robots are designed to achieve complex tasks that are increasing daily. Cloud resources enhance service robots with strong computing capabilities and higher data storage centers. One of the major drawbacks of the cloud robotics model is the network latency that edge computing addresses. Considering the capabilities that a service robot must have to achieve somehow human-like capabilities, we propose a hybrid service-oriented fog robotic architecture. The proposed architecture follows the fog robotics approach to distribute the computations through the cloud, edge, and robot in a clear way. Robotic control systems are significantly varied based on the required tasks, environment, robot specifications, user and business needs, or programming tools that were used. The paper introduces several concepts to facilitate the designing or developing process of the robotic system based on the desired robot's type and functions. Furthermore, automated planning, one of the most important factors to an intelligent and autonomous robot, has been evaluated based on several scenarios. These cases address the computational and the planning aspects through either the Edge or the Cloud server.},

These can vary based on robot users' existing routines and personal preferences. As part of a larger project to design a conversational robot that can assist older adults in recognizing and maintaining their ikigai (sense of meaning and purpose in life), we explored the question "when might be good times for the robot to engage older adults in activities?". 11 older adults who were familiar with our prototype robot from prior participation in our research took part in a two week-long "diary study" to identify their habits and preferred times of engagement with the robot. The diary was performed by sending text messages to the older adults twice daily, asking what they were doing at the moment and whether this was a suitable time for interacting with the robot. The findings of the study allowed us to determine optimal times for interaction with the robot' - commonly before and after lunch and before sleep. Insights from this approach contribute to designing robots that can be integrated into the daily lives of older adults.},

Methods 59 ADHC participants (95\% male, mean age = 78 years) completed sleep questionnaires and 72 continuous hours of wrist actigraphy. Linear regression was used to examine agreement between methods and explore discrepancies in subjective/objective measures. Results Disturbed sleep was common, yet there was no agreement between subjective and objective sleep assessment methods. Compared with objective measures, one-half of participants reported worse sleep efficiency (SE) on questionnaires while one-quarter over-estimated SE. Participants reporting worse pain had a greater discrepancy between subjective and objective SE. Conclusions Vulnerable older adults demonstrated unique patterns of reporting sleep quality when comparing subjective and objective methods. Additional research is needed to better understand how vulnerable older adults evaluate sleep problems. Clinical Implications Objective and subjective sleep measures may represent unique and equally important constructs in this population. Clinicians should consider utilizing both objective and subjective sleep measures to identify individuals who may benefit from behavioral sleep treatments, and future research is needed to develop and validate appropriate sleep assessments for vulnerable older adults.},

  abstract = {Sentiment Analysis is probably one of the best-known area in text mining. However, in recent years, as big data rose in popularity more areas of text classification are being explored. Perhaps the next task to catch on is emotion detection, the task of identifying emotions. This is because emotions are the finer grained information which could be extracted from opinions. So besides writer sentiments, writer emotion is also a valuable data. Emotion detection can be done using text, facial expressions, verbal communications and brain waves; however, the focus of this review is on text-based sentiment analysis and emotion detection. The internet has provided an avenue for the public to express their opinions easily. These expressions not only contain positive or negative sentiments, it contains emotions as well. These emotions can help in social behaviour analysis, decision and policy makings for companies and the country. Emotion detection can further support other tasks such as opinion mining and early depression detection. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the shift in recent trends from text sentiment analysis to emotion detection and the challenges in these tasks. We summarize some of the recent works in the last five years and look at the methods they used. We also look at the models of emotion classes that are generally referenced. The trend of text-based emotion detection has shifted from the early keyword-based comparisons to machine learning and deep learning algorithms that provide more flexibility to the task and better performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Stress, burnout, and mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are common, and can significantly impact workplaces through absenteeism and reduced productivity. To address this issue, organizations must first understand the extent of the difficulties by mapping the mental health of their workforce. Online surveys are a cost-effective and scalable approach to achieve this but typically have low response rates, in part due to a lack of interactivity. Chatbots offer one potential solution, enhancing engagement through simulated natural human conversation and use of interactive features. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore if a text-based chatbot is a feasible approach to engage and motivate employees to complete a workplace mental health assessment. This paper describes the design process and results of a pilot implementation. Methods: A fully automated chatbot (``Viki'') was developed to evaluate employee risks of suffering from depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, burnout, and work-related stress. Viki uses a conversation style and gamification features to enhance engagement. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to gain first insights of a pilot implementation within a small to medium--sized enterprise (120 employees). Results: The response rate was 64.2\% (77/120). In total, 98 employees started the assessment, 77 of whom (79\%) completed it. The majority of participants scored in the mild range for anxiety (20/40, 50\%) and depression (16/28, 57\%), in the moderate range for stress (10/22, 46\%), and at the subthreshold level for insomnia (14/20, 70\%) as defined by their questionnaire scores. Conclusions: A chatbot-based workplace mental health assessment seems to be a highly engaging and effective way to collect anonymized mental health data among employees with response rates comparable to those of face-to-face interviews.},

Social robots have the potential to perform more added value tasks within healthcare. So, the aim of our paper was to study the acceptance of a social robot in a rehabilitation centre. This paper reports on three studies conducted with the Pepper robot. We first conducted an acceptance study in which patients (N~=~6) and nurses (N~=~10) performed different tasks with the robot and rated their acceptance of the robot at different time points. These participants were also interviewed afterwards to gather more qualitative data. The second study conducted was a flash mob study in which patients (N~=~23) could interact with the robot via a chatbot and complete a questionnaire. Afterwards, 15 patients completed a short evaluation questionnaire about the easiness and intention to use the robot and possible new functionalities for a social robot. Finally, a Social Return on Investment analysis was conducted to assess the added value of the Pepper robot. Considering the findings from these three studies, we conclude that the use of the Pepper robot for health-related tasks in the context a rehabilitation centre is not yet feasible as major steps are needed to have the Pepper robot able to take over these health-related tasks.},

  abstract = {The ageing population's problems directly impact countries' socio-economic structure, as more resources are required to monitor the aged population's health. The growth in human life expectancy is increasing due to medical technologies and nutritional science innovations. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the connectivity of physical objects called things to the Internet. IoT has a wide range of health monitoring applications based on biomedical sensing devices to monitor health conditions. This paper proposes elderly patients' health monitoring architecture based on an intelligent task mapping approach for a closed-loop IoT healthcare environment. As a case study, a health monitoring system was developed based on the proposed architecture for elderly patients' health monitoring in the home, ambulance, and hospital environment. The system detects and notifies deteriorating conditions to the authorities based on biomedical sensors for faster interventions. Wearable biomedical sensors are used for monitoring body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose level, and patient body position. Threshold and machine learning-based approaches were used to detect anomalies in the health sensing data. The proposed architecture's performance analysis is evaluated in terms of round trip time, reliability, task drop rate, and latency performance metrics. Performance results show that the proposed architecture of the elderly patient health monitoring can provide reliable solutions for critical tasks in IoT environments.},

All these circumstances generate significant risk factors that drastically influence peoples' bad health status and conditions.On the other hand, in a lot of, even highly developed countries, health and medical support is getting more and more limited and out of normal working conditions due to different reasons.So, a very important question in this highly technologically developed society is if and how information communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and virtual agent technologies can help in changing and improving the current situation.One important scientific and research direction is oriented towards the development of high quality and reliable personalized medical and health services. The development of sophisticated, intelligent virtual agents i.e. a specific kind of medical e-coaching can help people in getting adequate advices and recommendations in order to improve their health conditions and quality of key life indicators.The use of agents in personalized and social medical and health platforms can open new possibilities for producing tailored recommendations during human-intelligent virtual agents' conversation and support. Some opportunities and challenges of human-agent communication are considered in order to increase human living and health conditions. Several paradigmatic cases of intelligent virtual agents are presented and challenges for future development.},

The companion-like robot was shown to be the most effective in building a positive therapeutic alliance with people, enhancing participants' well-being and readiness for change.

  abstract = {Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are computer-generated animated humanlike characters that interact with users through verbal and nonverbal behavioral cues. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify the current practice in the development and evaluation of ECAs for chronic diseases. Methods: We applied a methodological framework in this review. A total of 6 databases (ie, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Web of Science) were searched using a combination of terms related to ECAs and health in October 2023. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. Results: The literature search found 6332 papers, of which 36 (0.57\%) met the inclusion criteria. Among the 36 studies, 27 (75\%) originated from the United States, and 28 (78\%) were published from 2020 onward. The reported ECAs covered a wide range of chronic diseases, with a focus on cancers, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes, primarily to promote screening and self-management. Most ECAs were depicted as middle-aged women based on screenshots and communicated with users through voice and nonverbal behavior. The most frequently reported evaluation outcomes were acceptability and effectiveness. Conclusions: This scoping review provides valuable insights for technology developers and health care professionals regarding the development and implementation of ECAs. It emphasizes the importance of technological advances in the embodiment, personalized strategy, and communication modality and requires in-depth knowledge of user preferences regarding appearance, animation, and intervention content. Future studies should incorporate measures of cost, efficiency, and productivity to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the benefits of using ECAs in health care.},

  abstract = {The global population is ageing and the likelihood of living alone increases with age. Services are necessary to help older people living alone to optimise health and wellbeing. This systematic review aimed to summarise the effectiveness and accessibility of interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of older people living alone. Relevant electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus) were searched for all years up to August 2018. Studies were included if they involved older people (aged ⩾55 years) living alone, and an intervention with measured health and wellbeing outcomes. All study types were included. The Theory of Access was used to assess interventions across dimensions of accessibility, availability, acceptability, affordability, adequacy and awareness. Twenty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria; 17 studies focused on ageing safely in place and 11 on psychological and social wellbeing. Studies comprised quantitative (N = 19), qualitative (N = 4) and mixed-methods (N = 5) approaches. Dimensions from the Theory of Access were poorly addressed in the studies, particularly those of higher-quality methodology. Studies were heterogeneous, preliminary in scope and lacked consistent study design, methodology or measurement. Services that do not address user accessibility in design or evaluation may be limited in their uptake and impact. It is recommended that dimensions of access and co-creation principles be integrated into service design processes and be evaluated alongside clinical effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Although its inclusion in medical research is relatively recent and its interpretation is often variable, quality of life is increasingly being recognized as one of the most important parameters to be measured in the evaluation of medical therapies, including those for pain management. Pain, when it is not effectively treated and relieved, has a detrimental effect on all aspects of quality of life. This negative impact has been found to span every age and every type and source of pain in which it has been studied. Effective analgesic therapy has been shown to improve quality of life by relieving pain. Opioid analgesics, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (or coxibs), and several adjuvant analgesics for neuropathic pain have been demonstrated to significantly improve quality-of-life scores in patients with pain. Coxibs provide effective, well-tolerated analgesia without some of the issues faced with opioids-benefits that should translate into improved quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated that the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib significantly improves quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis and chronic, lower back pain. Quality-of-life measurements, especially symptom distress scales, can also be used as sensitive means of differentiating one agent from another in the same class. In future pharmacotherapeutic research, quality of life should be included as an outcome domain as are the traditionally measured variables of efficacy and safety. In particular, future studies of coxibs should include symptom distress scores as important quality-of-life measurements, to identify meaningful differences between this new class of analgesics and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: {\textbackslash}emph\{Gradient-based One-Side Sampling\} (GOSS) and {\textbackslash}emph\{Exclusive Feature Bundling\} (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB {\textbackslash}emph\{LightGBM\}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

Flexible, bidirectional and real-time control of communication allows development of a rich set of healthcare applications that can provide interactivity with the participant and adapt dynamically to their changing environment. Additionally, smartwatches have a variety of sensors suitable for collecting physical activity and location data. The combination of all these features makes it possible to transmit the collected data to a remote server, and thus, to monitor physical activity and potentially social activity in real time. As smartwatches exhibit high user acceptability and increasing popularity, they are ideal devices for monitoring activities for extended periods of time to investigate the physical activity patterns in free-living condition and their relationship with the seemingly random occurring illnesses, which have remained a challenge in the current literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a smartwatch-based framework for real-time and online assessment and mobility monitoring (ROAMM). The proposed ROAMM framework will include a smartwatch application and server. The smartwatch application will be used to collect and preprocess data. The server will be used to store and retrieve data, remote monitor, and for other administrative purposes. With the integration of sensor-based and user-reported data collection, the ROAMM framework allows for data visualization and summary statistics in real-time.},

Continuous glucose monitoring addresses the limitations of finger-stick blood testing and provides the opportunity for optimal therapeutic interventions. This article reviews recent advances and challenges toward the development of non-invasive epidermal electrochemical glucose sensing systems. Recent reports claim success in glucose monitoring in human subjects using skin-worn electrochemical sensors. Such epidermal electrochemical biosensors obviate the disadvantages of minimally-invasive subcutaneous glucose biosensors and offer promise for improved glycemic control. The ability of such systems to monitor glucose non-invasively offers an attractive route toward advancing the management of diabetes and achieving improved glycemic control. However, realizing the potential diagnostic impact of these new epidermal sensing strategies would require extensive efforts toward addressing key technological challenges and establishing a reliable correlation to gold standard blood glucose meters.},

Artificial intelligence has been undergoing a purported ``paradigm shift'' initiated by new machine learning models, large language models (e.g., BERT, LAMMA, and that behind ChatGPT). These models have led to unprecedented accuracy over most computerized language processing tasks, from web searches to automatic machine translation and question answering, while their dialogue-based forms, like ChatGPT have captured the interest of over a million users. The success of the large language model is mostly attributed to its capability to numerically represent words in their context, long a weakness of previous attempts to automate psychological assessment from language. While potential applications for automated therapy are beginning to be studied on the heels of chatGPT's success, here we present evidence that suggests, with thorough validation of targeted deployment scenarios, that AI's newest technology can move mental health assessment away from rating scales and to instead use how people naturally communicate, in language.},

However, ECAs have not yet been found to be capable of engendering behaviour change, which is partly attributed to the absence of a match with users' practices, needs and preferences. Hence, we describe a co-design process with older adults that informs both the content and the appearance of an ECA. Data was gathered through three consecutive iterations of co-design sessions with two groups of community-dwelling older adults in the Netherlands. Prior to the first session, participants completed a seven-day lifestyle diary. This study adds knowledge on the meaning of healthy eating, as well as on specific barriers to, and opportunities for, giving advice using an ECA in this target group. Furthermore, we translate this knowledge into general advice for designing an ECA in the context of health behaviour change, while reflecting on a co-design process with older adults.},

Both of these disorders are associated with considerable disability. OBJECTIVE: When the disorders co-occur, the disability is even greater. Authors sought to test an ultra-brief screening tool for both. METHOD: Validated two-item ultra-brief screeners for depression and anxiety were combined to constitute the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (the PHQ-4). Data were analyzed from 2,149 patients drawn from 15 primary-care clinics in the United States. RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed two discrete factors (Depression and Anxiety) that explained 84\% of the total variance. Increasing PHQ-4 scores were strongly associated with functional impairment, disability days, and healthcare use. Anxiety had a substantial effect on functional status that was independent of depression. CONCLUSION: The PHQ-4 is a valid ultra-brief tool for detecting both anxiety and depressive disorders.},

However, the design, development, and deployment of mHealth applications is challenging in many ways. To address these challenges, several generic mobile sensing frameworks have been researched in the past decade. Such frameworks assist developers and researchers in reducing the complexity, time, and cost required to build and deploy health-sensing applications. The main goal of this article is to provide the reader with an overview of the state-of-the-art of health-focused generic mobile and wearable sensing frameworks. This review gives a detailed analysis of functional and non-functional features of existing frameworks, the health studies they were used in, and the stakeholders they support. Additionally, we also analyze the historical evolution, uptake, and maintenance after the initial release. Based on this analysis, we suggest new features and opportunities for future generic mHealth sensing frameworks.},

  abstract = {Objectives Heart rate variability (HRV) has gained recognition as a noninvasive marker of autonomic activity. HRV is considered a promising tool in various clinical scenarios. The optimal electrocardiogram (ECG) sampling frequency required to ensure sufficient precision of R--R intervals for HRV analysis has not yet been determined. Here, we aimed to determine the acceptable ECG sampling frequency range by analyzing ECG signals from patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute intoxication or overdose. Methods The study included 83 adult patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute poisoning. The original 1,000-Hz ECG signals were down-sampled to 500-, 250-, 100-, and 50-Hz sampling frequencies with linear interpolation. R--R interval data were analyzed for time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters. Parameters derived from the data on down-sampled frequencies were compared with those derived from the data on 1,000-Hz signals, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. Results Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and Poincar{\'e} plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time- and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors. Conclusions A 250-Hz sampling frequency would be acceptable for HRV analysis. When frequency-domain analysis is not required, a 100-Hz sampling frequency would also be acceptable.},

Early PTSD symptoms, often observed shortly after trauma exposure, abate with time in the majority of those who initially express them, yet leave a significant minority with chronic PTSD. While the past several decades of PTSD research have produced substantial knowledge regarding the mechanisms and consequences of this debilitating disorder, the diagnosis of and available treatments for PTSD still face significant challenges. Here, we discuss how novel therapeutic interventions involving social robots can potentially offer meaningful opportunities for overcoming some of the present challenges. As the application of social robotics-based interventions in the treatment of mental disorders is only in its infancy, it is vital that careful, well-controlled research is conducted to evaluate their efficacy, safety, and ethics. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that robotics-based solutions could advance the quality, availability, specificity and scalability of care for PTSD.},

We propose to improve telehealth systems' features to include the ability to serve patients with their needs, operating as human caregivers. The objective is to support the independent living of patients at home without losing the opportunity to monitor their health status. Application scenarios are several, and they spread from simple clinical assisting scenarios to an emergency one. For instance, in the case of a nursing home, the system would support in continuously monitoring the elderly patients. In contrast, in the case of an epidemic diffusion, such as COVID-19 pandemic, the system may help in all the early triage phases, significantly reducing the risk of contagion. However, the system has to let medical assistants perform actions remotely such as changing therapies or interacting with patients that need support. The paper proposes and describes a multi-agent architecture for intelligent medical care. We propose to use the beliefs-desires-intentions agent architecture, part of it is devised to be deployed in a robot. The result is an intelligent system that may allow robots the ability to select the most useful plan for unhandled situations and to communicate the choice to the physician for his validation and permission.},

Many users, however, do not need the broad capabilities of generative LLMs when they only want to automate a classification task. Smaller BERT-like models can also learn universal tasks, which allow them to do any text classification task without requiring fine-tuning (zeroshot classification) or to learn new tasks with only a few examples (fewshot), while being significantly more efficient than generative LLMs. This paper (1) explains how Natural Language Inference (NLI) can be used as a universal classification task that follows similar principles as instruction fine-tuning of generative LLMs, (2) provides a step-by-step guide with reusable Jupyter notebooks for building a universal classifier, and (3) shares the resulting universal classifier that is trained on 33 datasets with 389 diverse classes. Parts of the code we share has been used to train our older zeroshot classifiers that have been downloaded more than 55 million times via the Hugging Face Hub as of December 2023. Our new classifier improves zeroshot performance by 9.4\%.},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning is an increasingly popular tool for analyzing large political text corpora. The main disadvantage of supervised machine learning is the need for thousands of manually annotated training data points. This issue is particularly important in the social sciences where most new research questions require new training data for a new task tailored to the specific research question. This paper analyses how deep transfer learning can help address this challenge by accumulating ``prior knowledge'' in language models. Models like BERT can learn statistical language patterns through pre-training (``language knowledge''), and reliance on task-specific data can be reduced by training on universal tasks like natural language inference (NLI; ``task knowledge''). We demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning on a wide range of eight tasks. Across these eight tasks, our BERT-NLI model fine-tuned on 100 to 2,500 texts performs on average 10.7 to 18.3 percentage points better than classical models without transfer learning. Our study indicates that BERT-NLI fine-tuned on 500 texts achieves similar performance as classical models trained on around 5,000 texts. Moreover, we show that transfer learning works particularly well on imbalanced data. We conclude by discussing limitations of transfer learning and by outlining new opportunities for political science research.},

The market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7.92\% from USD 2.06 billion in 2023 and reach an estimated USD 3.02 billion by the end of 2028 [1]. Among this growth, smart and AI-based wearable sleep trackers, offering functions akin to polysomnographic (PSG) studies, have gained popularity in the digital health revolution [2--5]. Such devices, designed in various form-factors ranging from smartwatches, wristbands, and rings to chest bands, headbands, and armbands [6], are continuously innovated to create more accurate and personalized sleep-tracking experiences [7, 8]. Furthermore, integrating cutting-edge biometric sensors and AI-driven analytics into these devices enhances their capability to measure total sleep duration and cycles and parameters such as heart rate variability, sleep positions, and brainwave patterns. The interoperability of diverse sensors is key to customizing wearable sleep trackers. By enabling data sharing between sensors, these devices can adapt to each user's unique sleep patterns and health conditions, providing a personalized monitoring experience. The increasing awareness of the critical role of sleep in overall health, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mental health and sleep-related difficulties, has further fueled the demand for these devices [9, 10]. With the nonstop innovations of wearable sleep trackers and the rising demands for personalized sleep health trackers, the standardization and rigorous validation of these devices have become paramount [11].},

The elderlies taken care of by Senior Welfare Centers are chosen as the target sector, for which the following five service scenarios are designed: infotainment, video chatting, game playing, medicine alarm and, in particular, errand services. Unlike conventional approaches, the scenarios are designed here to ensure the overall quality of service by maximizing the synergy under an elderly-caregiver-service robot ecosystem. The unique features implemented in HomeMate include 1) the principle of affordance in appearance design by matching functionality and anthropomorphism indices, 2) the sociability implemented by balancing between autonomy and user controllability as well as by integrating multimodal interactions into HomeMate avatar, and 3) the emphasis on dependability to inspire confidence on HomeMate as a trusted assistant, for which the principle of dependability is proposed and implemented with a cognitive framework. Experiments and user studies strongly support the proposed design principles and verify the dependability in performance.},

  abstract = {Background Frailty in older people is a syndrome related to aging that is becoming increasingly common and problematic as the average age of the world population increases. Detecting frailty in its early stages or, even better, predicting its appearance can greatly benefit health in later years of life and save the healthcare system from high costs. Machine Learning models fit the need to develop a tool for supporting medical decision-making in detecting or predicting frailty. Methods In this review, we followed the PRISMA methodology to conduct a systematic search of the most relevant Machine Learning models that have been developed so far in the context of frailty. We selected 41 publications and compared them according to their purpose, the type of dataset used, the target variables, and the results they obtained, highlighting their shortcomings and strengths. Results The variety of frailty definitions allows many problems to fall into this field, and it is often challenging to compare results due to the differences in target variables. The data types can be divided into gait data, usually collected with sensors, and medical records, often in the context of aging studies. The most common algorithms are well-known models available from every Machine Learning library. Only one study developed a new framework for frailty classification, and only two considered Explainability. Conclusions This review highlights some gaps in the field of Machine Learning applied to the assessment and prediction of frailty, such as the need for a universal quantitative definition. It emphasizes the need for close collaboration between medical professionals and data scientists to unlock the potential of data collected in hospital and clinical settings. As a suggestion for future work, the area of Explainability, which is crucial for models in medicine and health care, was considered in very few studies.},

BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report ablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance.},

However, participants did not respond differently to physical robots and virtual agents when both were displayed digitally on a screen -- suggesting that physical presence, rather than physical embodiment, characterizes people׳s responses to social robots.

  abstract = {COVID-19 has severely impacted mental health in vulnerable demographics, in particular older adults, who face unprecedented isolation. Consequences, while globally severe, are acutely pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) confronting pronounced gaps in resources and clinician accessibility. Social robots are well-recognized for their potential to support mental health, yet user compliance (i.e., trust) demands seamless affective human-robot interactions; natural `human-like' conversations are required in simple, inexpensive, deployable platforms. We present the design, development, and pilot testing of a multimodal robotic framework fusing verbal (contextual speech) and nonverbal (facial expressions) social cues, aimed to improve engagement in human-robot interaction and ultimately facilitate mental health telemedicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the design optimization of a hybrid face robot, which combines digital facial expressions based on mathematical affect space mapping with static 3D facial features. We further introduce a contextual virtual assistant with integrated cloud-based AI coupled to the robot's facial representation of emotions, such that the robot adapts its emotional response to users' speech in real-time. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90\% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions. When separated, stern and disgusted are occasionally transposed (70\%+ accuracy overall) but are easily distinguishable from other emotions. A qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework. The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs. The mechanically simple and low-cost social robot has been deployed in pilot tests to support older individuals and PwD at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, India. A procedure for deployment addressing challenges in cultural acceptance, end-user acclimatization and resource allocation is further introduced. Results indicate strong promise to stimulate human-robot psychosocial interaction through the hybrid-face robotic system. Future work is targeting deployment for telemedicine to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults and PwD in both LMICs and higher income regions.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable sensing and information and communication technologies are key enablers driving the transformation of health care delivery toward a new model of connected health (CH) care. The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. Methods: This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. Results: The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. Conclusions: This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain. The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.},

Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants' literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45--65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a ``one-week diabetics scenario''. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.},

This scoping review aims to assess the current situation of low digital health literacy in terms of its definition, reach, impact on health and interventions for its mitigation. Methods A comprehensive literature search strategy was composed by a qualified medical librarian. Literature databases [Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Scopus, and Google Scholar] were queried using appropriate natural language and controlled vocabulary terms along with hand-searching and citation chaining. We focused on recent and highly cited references published in English. Reviews were excluded. This scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley. Results A total of 268 articles were identified (263 from the initial search and 5 more added from the references of the original papers), 53 of which were finally selected for full text analysis. Digital health literacy is the most frequently used descriptor to refer to the ability to find and use health information with the goal of addressing or solving a health problem using technology. The most utilized tool to assess digital health literacy is the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), a self-reported measurement tool that evaluates six core dimensions and is available in various languages. Individuals with higher digital health literacy scores have better self-management and participation in their own medical decisions, mental and psychological state and quality of life. Effective interventions addressing poor digital health literacy included education/training and social support. Conclusions Although there is interest in the study and impact of poor digital health literacy, there is still a long way to go to improve measurement tools and find effective interventions to reduce the digital health divide.},

  abstract = {Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly used in healthcare and other settings to improve self-management and provide companionship. Their ability to form close relationships with people is important for enhancing effectiveness and engagement. Several studies have looked at enhancing relationships with ECAs through design features focused on behaviours, appearance, or language. However, this evidence is yet to be systematically synthesized. This systematic review evaluates the effect of different design features on relationship quality with ECAs. A systematic search was conducted on electronic databases EMBASE, PsychInfo, PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science in January--February 2019. 43 studies were included for review that evaluated the effect of a design feature on relationship quality and social perceptions or behaviours towards an ECA. Results synthesize effective design features and lay a scientific framework for improving relationships with ECAs in healthcare and other applications. Risk of bias for included studies was generally low, however there were some limitations in the research quality pertaining to outcome measurement and the reporting of statistics. Further research is needed to understand how to make ECAs effective and engaging for all consumers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the development of an assistance system for the elderly that combines robots with a network of sensors and actuators is described. The architecture was developed with the aim of interaction. With this reason, the system incorporates particular solutions that are adaptable to the needs of the user, such as a pyramid interaction system, a telepresence robot, a biometric bracelet, and others. In the software, the system is composed of two servers: local and web. The local server is in charge of different modules that interact with direct users and their needs. The web server provides different facilities to external users to access the system remotely. A use case is analyzed where the proposed system is validated.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- Previous research has focused on how trustworthiness can be evoked by the physical design of on-screen characters (OSCs) within the e-commerce interface. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether or not the OSCs representation, along with user differences, influence, how likeable, appropriate and trustworthy they are. Design/methodology/approach -- A web site was created for a simulated online bookseller and 183 people from various countries participated in the experiments. OSC representations were tested under four conditions in the main experiment: facial appearance (human-like vs cartoon-like) and gender (male vs female). Findings -- The results suggest that the human-like characters are more likeable, appropriate and trustworthy in general terms. However, when perceived capabilities of OSCs are measured, a mismatch can occur between expectations and capabilities of the human-like OSCs. In fact, cartoon-like OSCs, especially female, had more positive effects on the web site interface. Research limitations/implications -- This study was limited to simulations of on-screen scenarios. Future work, with access to the huge database required, could investigate the effects of truly interactive OSCs. Larger national sub-samples would permit generalisations about cross-cultural differences. Practical implications -- For e-tailers and web designers, this study suggests critical design variables and response-moderating variables that mediate the effects of OSCs in e-retailing. It helps to understand customers' interaction needs in establishing and maintaining para-social relationships, potentially increasing purchase intentions and persuasion. Originality/value -- The efficacy of different representations of OSCs to retail situations has been little investigated previously; this study measured how likeable, appropriate and trustworthy different OSC design formats are to different customer types.},

  abstract = {Background: Approximately one-half of American adults exhibit low health literacy and thus struggle to find and use health information. Low health literacy is associated with negative outcomes including overall poorer health. Health information technology (HIT) makes health information available directly to patients through electronic tools including patient portals, wearable technology, and mobile apps. The direct availability of this information to patients, however, may be complicated by misunderstanding of HIT privacy and information sharing. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether health literacy is associated with patients' use of four types of HIT tools: fitness and nutrition apps, activity trackers, and patient portals. Additionally, we sought to explore whether health literacy is associated with patients' perceived ease of use and usefulness of these HIT tools, as well as patients' perceptions of privacy offered by HIT tools and trust in government, media, technology companies, and health care. This study is the first wide-scale investigation of these interrelated concepts. Methods: Participants were 4974 American adults (n=2102, 42.26\% male, n=3146, 63.25\% white, average age 43.5, SD 16.7 years). Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign measure of health literacy and indicated their actual use of HIT tools, as well as the perceived ease of use and usefulness of these applications. Participants also answered questions regarding information privacy and institutional trust, as well as demographic items. Results: Cross-tabulation analysis indicated that adequate versus less than adequate health literacy was significantly associated with use of fitness apps (P=.02), nutrition apps (P{$<$}.001), activity trackers (P{$<$}.001), and patient portals (P{$<$}.001). Additionally, greater health literacy was significantly associated with greater perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness across all HIT tools after controlling for demographics. Regarding privacy perceptions of HIT and institutional trust, patients with greater health literacy often demonstrated decreased privacy perceptions for HIT tools including fitness apps (P{$<$}.001) and nutrition apps (P{$<$}.001). Health literacy was negatively associated with trust in government (P{$<$}.001), media (P{$<$}.001), and technology companies (P{$<$}.001). Interestingly, health literacy score was positively associated with trust in health care (P=.03). Conclusions: Patients with low health literacy were less likely to use HIT tools or perceive them as easy or useful, but they perceived information on HIT as private. Given the fast-paced evolution of technology, there is a pressing need to further the understanding of how health literacy is related to HIT app adoption and usage. This will ensure that all users receive the full health benefits from these technological advances, in a manner that protects health information privacy, and that users engage with organizations and providers they trust.},

  abstract = {Background: Poor diet and physical inactivity are leading modifiable causes of death and disease. Advances in artificial intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized support at scale. Objective: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach. Methods: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide, Australia, from March to August 2019. Participants were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years, recruited through news stories, social media posts, and flyers. The program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot, Paola, who guided participants through a computer-based individualized introductory session, weekly check-ins, and goal setting, and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps, a website with educational materials and recipes, and a printed diet and activity log sheet. Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure. Results: Over 4 weeks, 99 potential participants registered expressions of interest, with 81 of those screened meeting eligibility criteria. Participants completed a mean of 109.8 (95\% CI 1.9-217.7) more minutes of physical activity at week 12 compared with baseline. Mediterranean diet scores increased from a mean of 3.8 out of 14 at baseline, to 9.6 at 12 weeks (mean improvement 5.7 points, 95\% CI 4.2-7.3). After 12 weeks, participants lost an average 1.3 kg (95\% CI --0.1 to --2.5 kg) and 2.1 cm from their waist circumference (95\% CI --3.5 to --0.7 cm). There were no significant changes in blood pressure. Feasibility was excellent in terms of recruitment, retention (90\% at 12 weeks), and safety (no adverse events). Conclusions: An artificially intelligent virtual assistant-led lifestyle-modification intervention was feasible and achieved measurable improvements in physical activity, diet, and body composition at 12 weeks. Future research examining artificially intelligent interventions at scale, and for other health purposes, is warranted.},

In the area of preventive care, chatbots can provide personalized and timely solutions that aid individuals in maintaining their well-being and forestalling the development of chronic conditions. This paper presents GECA, a chatbot designed specifically for preventive care, that offers information, advice, and monitoring to patients who are undergoing home treatment, providing a cost-effective, personalized, and engaging solution. Moreover, its adaptable architecture enables extension to other diseases and conditions seamlessly. The chatbot's bilingual capabilities enhance accessibility for a wider range of users, including those with reading or writing difficulties, thereby improving the overall user experience. GECA's ability to connect with external resources offers a higher degree of personalization, which is a crucial aspect in engaging users effectively. The integration of standards and security protocols in these connections allows patient privacy, security and smooth adaptation to emerging healthcare information sources. GECA has demonstrated a remarkable level of accuracy and precision in its interactions with the diverse features, boasting an impressive 97\% success rate in delivering accurate responses. Presently, preparations are underway for a pilot project at a Portuguese hospital that will conduct exhaustive testing and evaluate GECA, encompassing aspects such as its effectiveness, efficiency, quality, goal achievability, and user satisfaction.},

This article aims to develop a framework that enables social robots to conduct regular clinical screening interviews in geriatric care, such as cognitive evaluation, falls' risk evaluation, and pain rating. We develop a social robot with essential features to enable clinical screening interviews, including a conversational interface, face tracking, an interaction handler, attention management, robot skills, and cloud service management. Besides, a general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model is proposed and implemented. The GCSIM enables social robots to handle various types of clinical questions and answers, evaluate and score responses, engage interviewees during conversations, and generate reports on their well-being. These reports can be used to evaluate the progression of cognitive impairment, risk of falls, pain level, and so on by caregivers or physicians. Such a clinical screening capability allows for early detection and treatment planning in geriatric care. The framework was developed and implemented on our 3-D-printed social robot. It was tested on 30 older adults with different ages, achieved satisfying results, and received their high confidence and trust in the use of this robot for human well-being assessment. Note to Practitioners---This article is motivated by the goal of using a social robot to perform geriatric well-being assessment through clinical screening interviews. In order to conduct clinical screening interviews, the social robot needs the following essential features: having a verbal conversational interface, adapting to different types of clinical screening interviews, scoring and evaluating answers, having nondirective listening responses, and enabling directive listening responses. The proposed general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model demonstrates these capabilities on the social robot. The robot can give structured clinical screening interviews with different question--answer sheets. This will help advance assistive technologies for use by geriatric physicians, nurses, and social service professionals to keep older adults healthy, safe, and independent at home. Robots will become more and more essential in working alongside geriatric practitioners to help monitor older adults at home and to provide early detection and warning of cognitive/mental health problems, falls' risk, and so on. This early detection property can improve quality-of-care and help older adults remain living at home.},

  abstract = {The population of the world is ageing, particularly in developed countries. As the population's age increases, the healthcare workforce is becoming progressively unable to meet the high healthcare demands of the elderly population. Increasingly, technology is being used to solve this dilemma. Using a sample from the general population (n=65), this study examined how people interacted with either a robot or a tablet computer delivering healthcare instructions. During this interaction, the robot/tablet asked them several health-related questions, and to perform limited physical tests and a relaxation exercise. Results showed participants had more positive interactions with the robot compared to the computer tablet, including increased speech and positive emotion (smiling), and participation in the relaxation exercise. Further results showed the robot was rated higher on scales of trust, enjoyment, and desire for future interaction. This suggests that robots may offer benefits over and above computer tablets in delivering healthcare. These results further demonstrate that the physical nature of technology is important in determining responses to healthcare interactions.},

The main objective is the provisioning of the effectiveness and cost-estimation model for deploying assistive technology solutions in elderly care intended for evaluation and showing specificity to the costs and associated benefits of providing smart technological solutions for seniors.Methods The model uses demographic projections taken from Eurostat for EU countries and the disability incidence from the annual report of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic as an input. The model was implemented in the software Stella Professional dedicated to system dynamics modelling.Results In relation to the combination of five assistive devices for the elderly the optimal solution the cost savings are 37.8\% or182 billion CZK, cumulatively in the simulated time period 2021--2060. The model allows adjustments regarding price levels of various countries through the caregivers' wage. Obtained results showed robustness of the model to this uncertainty as percentage savings varied only from 37.6\% to 39.8\%, a mere 2.2\% difference.Conclusion With respect to the ongoing demographic transition, the need to employ smart device solutions should further increase and their price could decline. The highest savings will come from countries with higher wages for carers.},

  abstract = {There are great physical and cognitive benefits for older adults who are engaged in active aging, a process that should involve daily exercise. In our previous work on the PHysical Assistant RObot System (PHAROS), we developed a system that proposed and monitored physical activities. The system used a social robot to analyse, by means of computer vision, the exercise a person was doing. Then, a recommender system analysed the exercise performed and indicated what exercise to perform next. However, the system needed certain improvements. On the one hand, the vision system captured the movement of the person and indicated whether the exercise had been done correctly or not. On the other hand, the recommender system was based purely on a ranking system that did not take into account temporal evolution and preferences. In this work, we propose an evolution of PHAROS, PHAROS 2.0, incorporating improvements in both of the previously mentioned aspects. In the motion capture aspect, we are now able to indicate the degree of completeness of each exercise, identifying the part that has not been done correctly, and a real-time performance correction. In this way, the recommender system receives a greater amount of information and so can more accurately indicate the exercise to be performed. In terms of the recommender system, an algorithm was developed to weigh the performance, temporal evolution and preferences, providing a more accurate recommendation, as well as expanding the recommendation to a batch of exercises, instead of just one.},

  abstract = {Background: The global percentage of older people has increased significantly over the last decades. Information and communication technologies have become essential to develop and motivate them to pursue healthier ways of living. This paper examines a personalized coaching health care service designed to maintain living conditions and active aging among older people. Among the technologies the service includes, we highlight the use of both gamification and cognitive assistant technologies designed to support older people and an application combining a cognitive virtual assistant to directly interact with the older person and provide feedback on their current health condition and several gamification techniques to motivate the older person to stay engaged with the application and pursuit of healthier daily habits. Objective: This pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a gamified agent-based system for older people and obtain preliminary results on the effectiveness of the intervention regarding physical activity health outcomes. Methods: The study was designed as an intervention study comparing pre- and posttest results. The proposed gamified agent-based system was used by 12 participants over 7 days (1 week), and step count data were collected with access to the Google Fit application programming interface. Step count data after the intervention were compared with average step count data before the intervention (average daily values over a period of 4 weeks before the intervention). A　1-tailed Student t test was used to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Usability was measured using the System Usability Scale questionnaire, which was answered by 8 of the 12 participants in the study. Results: The posttest results showed significant pre- to posttest changes (P=.30; 1-tailed Student t test) with a moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.65). The application obtained an average usability score of 78. Conclusions: The presented pilot was validated, showing the positive health effects of using gamification techniques and a virtual cognitive assistant. Additionally, usability metrics considered for this study confirmed high adherence and interest from most participants in the pilot.},

  abstract = {Background Large language models (LLMs) are generative artificial intelligence that have ignited much interest and discussion about their utility in clinical and research settings. Despite this interest there is sparse analysis of their use in qualitative thematic analysis comparing their current ability to that of human coding and analysis. In addition, there has been no published analysis of their use in real-world, protected health information. Objective Here we fill that gap in the literature by comparing an LLM to standard human thematic analysis in real-world, semi-structured interviews of both patients and clinicians within a psychiatric setting. Methods Using a 70 billion parameter open-source LLM running on local hardware and advanced prompt engineering techniques, we produced themes that summarized a full corpus of interviews in minutes. Subsequently we used three different evaluation methods for quantifying similarity between themes produced by the LLM and those produced by humans. Results These revealed similarities ranging from moderate to substantial (Jaccard similarity coefficients 0.44--0.69), which are promising preliminary results. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that open-source LLMs can effectively generate robust themes from qualitative data, achieving substantial similarity to human-generated themes. The validation of LLMs in thematic analysis, coupled with evaluation methodologies, highlights their potential to enhance and democratize qualitative research across diverse fields.},

  abstract = {Attenuating the physical decline and increases in disability associated with the aging process is an important public health priority. Evidence suggests that regular physical activity participation improves functional performance, such as walking, standing balance, flexibility, and getting up out of a chair, and also plays an important role in the disablement process by providing a protective effect against functional limitations. Whether these effects are direct or indirect has yet to be reliably established. In this review, the authors take the perspective that such relationships are indirect and operate through self-efficacy expectations. They first provide an introduction to social cognitive theory followed by an overview of self-efficacy's reciprocal relationship with physical activity. They then consider the literature that documents the effects of physical activity on functional performance and functional limitations in older adults and the extent to which self-efficacy might mediate these relationships. Furthermore, they also present evidence that suggests that self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in a model in which the protective effects conferred by physical activity on functional limitations operate through functional performance. The article concludes with a brief section making recommendations for the development of strategies within physical activity and rehabilitative programs for maximizing the major sources of efficacy information.},

  abstract = {The use of humanoid robot technologies within global healthcare settings is rapidly evolving; however, the potential of robots in health promotion and health education is not established. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of a social humanoid robot on individuals' knowledge of influenza (flu) prevention and attitudes towards influenza vaccination. A multi-methods approach involving pre and post-test questions and interviews was used. The study was undertaken in a publicly funded tertiary level hospital in northern Queensland, Australia. Of the 995 participants, the majority were visitors (53.07\%). The mean age of the participants was 42.25 (SD=19.54)~years. Based on the three knowledge questions that were posed at the two-point interactions of participants with the humanoid robot `Pepper', the results showed that there was a significant difference in the correct responses pre- and post-test regarding the best way to avoid getting the flu (Exact McNemar significance probability {$<$}.0001), how long the flu virus can live outside the human body (p {$<$}.0001) and the length of time for handwashing to be effective against spreading germs (p {$<$}.0001). The results also showed that there was a significant difference in attitudes associated with influenza vaccination when pre-test was compared to post-test (p=.0019). Interaction of the participants with the humanoid robot demonstrated immediate knowledge gains and attitudinal change that suggests that humanoid robots may be an important intervention for health promotion in prevention of influenza and other respiratory viruses.},

  abstract = {Background: Assessment of sleep quality is essential to address poor sleep quality and understand changes. Owing to the advances in the Internet of Things and wearable technologies, sleep monitoring under free-living conditions has become feasible and practicable. Smart rings and smartwatches can be employed to perform mid- or long-term home-based sleep monitoring.~However, the validity of such wearables should be investigated in terms of sleep parameters. Sleep validation studies are mostly limited to short-term laboratory tests; there is a need for a study to assess the sleep attributes of wearables in everyday settings, where users engage in their daily routines. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the sleep parameters of the Oura ring along with the Samsung Gear Sport watch in comparison with a medically approved actigraphy device in a midterm everyday setting, where users engage in their daily routines. Methods: We conducted home-based sleep monitoring in which the sleep parameters of 45 healthy individuals (23 women and 22 men) were tracked for 7 days. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) of the ring and watch were assessed using paired t tests, Bland-Altman plots, and Pearson correlation. The parameters were also investigated considering the gender of the participants as a dependent variable. Results: We found significant correlations between the ring's and actigraphy's TST (r=0.86; P\&lt;.001), WASO (r=0.41; P\&lt;.001), and SE (r=0.47; P\&lt;.001). Comparing the watch with actigraphy showed a significant correlation in TST (r=0.59; P\&lt;.001). The mean differences in TST, WASO, and SE of the ring and actigraphy were within satisfactory ranges, although there were significant differences between the parameters (P\&lt;.001); TST and SE mean differences were also within satisfactory ranges for the watch, and the WASO was slightly higher than the range (31.27, SD 35.15). However, the mean differences of the parameters between the watch and actigraphy were considerably higher than those of the ring. The watch also showed a significant difference in TST (P\&lt;.001) between female and male groups. Conclusions: In a sample population of healthy adults, the sleep parameters of both the Oura ring and Samsung watch have acceptable mean differences and indicate significant correlations with actigraphy, but the ring outperforms the watch in terms of the nonstaging sleep parameters.},

  abstract = {Questionnaires are a popular method to measure User Experience (UX). These UX questionnaires cover different UX aspects with their scales. However, UX includes a huge number of semantically different aspects of a user's interaction with a product. It is therefore practically impossible to cover all these aspects in a single evaluation study. A researcher must select those UX aspects that are most important to the users of the product under investigation. Some papers examined which UX aspects are important for specific product categories. Participants in these studies rated the importance of UX aspects for different product categories. These categories were described by a category name and several examples for products in this category. In principle, the results of these studies can be used to indicate which UX aspects should be measured for a particular product in the corresponding product category. This is especially useful for modular frameworks, e.g., the UEQ+, that allow to create a questionnaire by selecting the relevant scales from a catalog of predefined scales. In this paper, it is investigated how accurate the UX aspect suggestions derived from category-level studies are for individual products. The results show that the predicted importance of a UX aspect from the category is fairly precise.},

  abstract = {Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are advanced human-like interfaces that engage users in natural face-to-face conversations and interactions. These traits position ECAs as innovative tools for delivering interventions for promoting health-related behavior adoption. This includes motivational interviewing (MI), a therapeutic approach that combines brief interventions with motivational techniques to encourage the adoption of healthier behaviors. Objective: This study aims to identify the health issues addressed by ECAs delivering MI interventions, explore the key characteristics of these ECAs (eg, appearance, dialogue mechanism, emotional model), analyze the implementation of MI principles and techniques within ECAs, and examine the evaluation methods and primary outcomes of studies that use ECAs providing MI interventions. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) methodology. Our systematic search covered the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital, and PsycINFO databases for papers published between January 2008 and December 2022. We included papers describing ECAs developed for delivering MI interventions targeting health-related behaviors and excluded articles that did not describe ECAs with human appearances and without the necessary evaluation or MI explanation. In a multistage process, 3 independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction, and the collected data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results: The initial search identified 404 articles, of which 3.5\% (n=14) were included in the review. ECAs primarily focused on reducing alcohol use (n=5, 36\%), took on female representations (n=9, 64\%), and gave limited consideration to user ethnicity (n=9, 64\%). Most of them used rules-driven dialogue mechanisms (n=13, 93\%), include emotional behavior to convey empathy (n=8, 57\%) but without an automatic recognition of user emotions (n=12, 86\%). Regarding MI implementation, of 14 studies, 3 (21\%) covered all MI principles, 4 (29\%) included all processes, and none covered all techniques. Most studies (8/14, 57\%) conducted acceptability, usability, and user experience assessments, whereas a smaller proportion (4/14, 29\%) used randomized controlled trials to evaluate behavior changes. Overall, the studies reported positive results regarding acceptability, usability, and user experience and showed promising outcomes in changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Conclusions: This study revealed significant advancements in the use of ECAs for delivering MI interventions aimed at promoting healthier behaviors over the past 15 years. However, this review emphasizes the need for a more in-depth exploration of ECA characteristics. In addition, there is a need for the enhanced integration of MI principles, processes, and techniques into ECAs. Although acceptability and usability have received considerable attention, there is a compelling argument for placing a stronger emphasis on assessing changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Consequently, inclusion of more randomized controlled trials is essential for comprehensive intervention evaluations.},

  abstract = {The aging population has resulted in interest in remote monitoring of elderly individuals' health and well being. This paper describes a simple unsupervised monitoring system that can automatically detect if an elderly individual's pattern of presence deviates substantially from the recent past. The proposed system uses a small set of low-cost motion sensors and analyzes the produced data to establish an individual's typical presence pattern. Then, the algorithm uses a distance function to determine whether the individual's observed presence for each day significantly deviates from their typical pattern. Empirically, the algorithm is validated on both synthetic data and data collected by installing our system in the residences of three older individuals. In the real-world setting, the system detected, respectively, five, four, and one deviating days in the three locations. The deviating days detected by the system could result from a health issue that requires attention. The information from the system can aid caregivers in assessing the subject's health status and allows for a targeted intervention. Although the system can be refined, we show that otherwise hidden but relevant events (e.g., fall incident and irregular sleep patterns) are detected and reported to the caregiver.},

  abstract = {Older patients' health problems in general practice (GP) are often complex and cannot be assigned to a specific disease. This requires a paradigm shift to goal-oriented, personalized care for clinical decision-making. Geriatric diagnostics is the key to prevent the loss of function with older adults at risk for adverse outcomes by a preventive approach in GP---therefore the role of a general practitioner is highly important in the geriatric care of older adults. Geriatric diagnostics includes geriatric screening, which should be performed in all older adults to identify those in need for further diagnostics. If a patient is screened positive, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) should be performed to assess the domain or function where the patient displays the risk of adverse outcomes in order to intervene. Approaching single geriatric syndromes might be needed to develop a specific, goal-oriented care plan. Ideally, the CGA should be performed together with a multidisciplinary geriatric team. Problems in the implementation of CGA in primary care include lack of awareness due to poor access to current scientific evidence, lack of time, sceptical physicians' attitudes and the missing opportunity of a geriatric team in an outpatient setting. However, there is growing evidence that the goal-oriented, systematic implementation of CGA in GP settings is realistic and feasible when mediated by authentic comanagement and intersectoral cooperation of geriatricians and GP physicians.},

However, the effects of ISRs on the daily activity, especially the sleep patterns, of older people have not been clarified; moreover, it is unclear whether the effects of ISRs depend on the levels of cognitive function. To investigate these effects, we introduced an ISR into the actual living environment and then quantified induced changes according to the levels of cognitive function. Older people who maintained their cognitive function demonstrated the following behavioral changes after using the ISR: faster wake-up times, reduced sleep duration, and increased amount of activity in the daytime (p \&lt; 0.05, r = 0.77; p \&lt; 0.05, r = 0.89, and p \&lt; 0.1, r = 0.70, respectively). The results suggest that the ISR is beneficial in supporting the independence of older people living alone since living alone is associated with disturbed sleep patterns and low physical activity. The impact of the ISR on daily activity was more remarkable in the subjects with high cognitive function than in those with low cognitive function. These findings suggest that cognitive function is useful information in the ISR adaptation process. The present study has more solid external validity than that of a controlled environment study since it was done in a personal residential space.},

Optimal sleep quality is vital for overall health and quality of life, yet many individuals struggle with sleep-related difficulties. In the past, polysomnography (PSG) has served as the gold standard for assessing sleep, but its bulky nature, cost, and the need for expertise has made it cumbersome for widespread use. By recognizing the need for a more accessible and user-friendly approach, wearable home monitoring systems have emerged. EEG technology plays a pivotal role in sleep monitoring, as it captures crucial brain activity data during sleep and serves as a primary indicator of sleep stages and disorders. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in wearable sleep monitoring leveraging EEG technology. We summarize the latest EEG devices and systems available in the scientific literature, highlighting their design, form factors, materials, and methods of sleep assessment. By exploring these developments, we aim to offer insights into cutting-edge technologies, shedding light on wearable EEG sensors for advanced at-home sleep monitoring and assessment. This comprehensive review contributes to a broader perspective on enhancing sleep quality and overall health using wearable EEG sensors.},

There is no knowledge on the permanent effects of documenting electronically and whether it takes away significant time from patient care when the healthcare information system is mature. To understand the time spent on documentation, direct patient care tasks, and other clinical tasks in a mature information system, we conducted an observational and interview study in a midwestern academic hospital. The hospital implemented an electronic medical record system 11 years ago. We observed 22 health care workers across intensive care units, inpatient floors, and an outpatient clinic in the hospital. Results show that healthcare workers spend more time on documentation activities compared to patient care activities. Clinical roles have no influence on the time spent on documentation. This paper describes results on the time spent between documentation and patient care tasks, and discusses implications for future practice.

  abstract = {Background: Older adults may use wearable devices for various reasons, ranging from monitoring clinically relevant health metrics or detecting falls to monitoring physical activity. Little is known about how this population engages with wearable devices, and no qualitative synthesis exists to describe their shared experiences with long-term use. Objective: This study aims to synthesize qualitative studies of user experience after a multi-day trial with a wearable device to understand user experience and the factors that contribute to the acceptance and use of wearable devices. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase (2015-2020; English) with fixed search terms relating to older adults and wearable devices. A meta-synthesis methodology was used. We extracted themes from primary studies, identified key concepts, and applied reciprocal and refutational translation techniques; findings were synthesized into third-order interpretations, and finally, a ``line-of-argument'' was developed. Our overall goal was theory development, higher-level abstraction, and generalizability for making this group of qualitative findings more accessible. Results: In total, we reviewed 20 papers; 2 evaluated fall detection devices, 1 tested an ankle-worn step counter, and the remaining 17 tested activity trackers. The duration of wearing ranged from 3 days to 24 months. The views of 349 participants (age: range 51-94 years) were synthesized. Four key concepts were identified and outlined: motivation for device use, user characteristics (openness to engage and functional ability), integration into daily life, and device features. Motivation for device use is intrinsic and extrinsic, encompassing many aspects of the user experience, and appears to be as, if not more, important than the actual device features. To overcome usability barriers, an older adult must be motivated by the useful purpose of the device. A device that serves its intended purpose adds value to the user's life. The user's needs and the support structure around the device---aspects that are often overlooked---seem to play a crucial role in long-term adoption. Our ``line-of-argument'' model describes how motivation, ease of use, and device purpose determine whether a device is perceived to add value to the user's life, which subsequently predicts whether the device will be integrated into the user's life. Conclusions: The added value of a wearable device is the resulting balance of motivators (or lack thereof), device features (and their accuracy), ease of use, device purpose, and user experience. The added value contributes to the successful integration of the device into the daily life of the user. Useful device features alone do not lead to continued use. A support structure should be placed around the user to foster motivation, encourage peer engagement, and adapt to the user's preferences. Trial Registration:},

The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), derived from the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) seems reliable enough to serve this purpose, but despite the several versions developed over the past 15 years, it lacks a self-administered and brief version. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the agreement between an abbreviated form of the SELFY-MPI (i.e., SELFY-BRIEF-MPI) and the standard version of the MPI. Four Italian hospitals consecutively enrolled outpatients and inpatients {$>$}65 years. The sample included 105 participants (mean age = 78.8 years, 53.3\% females). Overall, the two versions showed non-statistically significant differences (Standard-MPI 0.42 {\textpm} 0.19 vs.. SELFY-BRIEF-MPI 0.41 {\textpm} 0.18; p = 0.104) and a very strong correlation (R = 0.86, p {$<$} 0.001). The Bland--Altman Plot revealed that only 5/105 measurements (4.76\%) were outside the limits of agreement. The accuracy of the SELFY-BRIEF-MPI in identifying frail people (defined as a Standard-MPI {$>$} 0.66) was optimal (area under the curve, AUC = 0.90, p {$<$} 0.001). To predict multidimensional frailty, a SELFY-BRIEF-MPI score of 0.60 exhibited the greatest sensitivity/specificity ratio. In conclusion, the SELFY-BRIEF-MPI reported a good agreement with the standard version of the MPI, indicating its application in the screening of multidimensional frailty among older people.},

We propose a framework for designing CAs to support older adult self-care, which organizes a review of work in this area and integration with the pedagogical agent literature.ResultsOur review of the pedagogical agent literature revealed an evolution from teaching machines to interactive, social systems that influence student motivational as well as learning outcomes. To integrate this review with work on CAs and self-care, we developed a framework that specifies how self-care goals evolve with stages of an illness, communication goals that support self-care at each stage, patient needs, and requirements for CAs to support these needs.

  abstract = {Background As the field of robotics and smart wearables continues to advance rapidly, the evaluation of their usability becomes paramount. Researchers may encounter difficulty in finding a suitable questionnaire for evaluating the usability of robotics and smart wearables. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the most commonly utilized questionnaires for assessing the usability of robots and smart wearables. Methods A comprehensive search of databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, was conducted for this scoping review. Two authors performed the selection of articles and data extraction using a 10-field data extraction form. In cases of disagreements, a third author was consulted to reach a consensus. The inclusions were English-language original research articles that utilized validated questionnaires to assess the usability of healthcare robots and smart wearables. The exclusions comprised review articles, non-English publications, studies not focused on usability, those assessing clinical outcomes, articles lacking questionnaire details, and those using non-validated or researcher-made questionnaires. Descriptive statistics methods (frequency and percentage), were employed to analyze the data. Results A total of 314 articles were obtained, and after eliminating irrelevant and duplicate articles, a final selection of 50 articles was included in this review. A total of 17 questionnaires were identified to evaluate the usability of robots and smart wearables, with 10 questionnaires specifically for wearables and 7 questionnaires for robots. The System Usability Scale (50\%) and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (19.44\%) were the predominant questionnaires utilized to assess the usability of smart wearables. Moreover, the most commonly used questionnaires for evaluating the usability of robots were the System Usability Scale (56.66\%), User Experience Questionnaire (16.66\%), and Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (10\%). Conclusion Commonly employed questionnaires serve as valuable tools in assessing the usability of robots and smart wearables, aiding in the refinement and optimization of these technologies for enhanced user experiences. By incorporating user feedback and insights, designers can strive towards creating more intuitive and effective robotic and wearable solutions.},

  abstract = {Smart healthcare is a framework that utilizes technologies such as wearable devices, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and wireless communication technology to seamlessly access health records, link individuals, resources, and organizations, and then effectively handle and react to health environment demands intelligently. One of the main ingredients of smart healthcare is medical sensors or IoMT. Due to the complex nature of diseases, in many cases, there is a need for multimodal medical signals for their diagnoses. While using multimodal signals, the most important issue is how to fuse them -- an area of burgeoning interest within the research community. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of multimodal medical signals fusion schemes that have been proposed for smart healthcare applications. Research works included in major repositories, such as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer Link, and ACM digital library have been surveyed to address several related research questions. Focus is placed on recent developments, thus only works published between 2014-2020 are considered. Finally, key research challenges and possible future directions are also provided.},

Embodied Conversational Agents---animated characters that simulate face-to-face conversation---can provide a medium for automated pain assessment in which multimodal pain narratives are elicited, clarified, and grounded. These agents can also use facial displays and nonverbal behavior to provide simulated empathic responses to help patients feel understood. We describe work towards a conversational agent that elicits various aspects of a pain experience, followed by an empathic summary. Our preliminary findings indicate that individuals are comfortable reporting their pain experiences to the agent, and are largely satisfied with this assessment methodology. We also find evidence that patients prefer the conversational empathic summary to standard self-report measures.},

  abstract = {There has been a tremendous increase in the costs of caring for older adults owing to the fact that societies are aging around around the world. This has led to a decrease in the number of caregivers who are able to assist. Investigative studies indicate that older adults require social as well as physical support for their well-being which prompted researchers to use social and cognitive robots and advanced human machine interaction devices. However, most of these studies have shortcomings when it comes to providing means of a natural interaction with the machine. With speech being the most natural way for human communication and the huge developments in the Internet of Things and smart homes, equipping a robotic system with powerful natural speech interaction capabilities to maintain a conversation with an elderly while being linked to other smart home devices shows a promising direction. This paper describes a scalable and expandable system with main goal of designing a natural speech-enabled system for older adults that is capable of linking to multiple active agents with minimal integration efforts. The system makes use of the power of commercially available digital assistant systems, integrated with an intelligent conversational agent, robotics, and smart wearables. The main advantage of the system is that it could provide a portion of the population, namely older adults and the disabled, the flexibility of interacting naturally with powerful social robots in smart home environments, hence providing them with much needed independence.},

Additionally, the paper demonstrates software integration architectures that are very significant to create smart healthcare systems, integrating seamlessly the benefit of data analytics and other tools of AI. The explained developed systems focus on several facets: the contribution of each developed framework, the detailed working procedure, the performance as outcomes, and the comparative merits and limitations. The current research challenges with potential future directions are addressed to highlight the drawbacks of existing systems and the possible methods to introduce novel frameworks, respectively.

To promote their autonomy while also supporting their caregivers, we propose a health monitoring system comprised of a social robot, and various wearable and non-wearable sensors. Through the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), captured in conversation with the social robot, the subjective health status of the user is determined. This is supplemented by objective information gathered from wearable and non-wearable sensors used to measure numerous biosignals. By combining the subjective data obtained from interaction with the user and the objective data from the sensor network, a health report for both users and caregivers is generated. The data are visualized for the user and caregiver in a customizable and easily accessible health monitoring dashboard, which also warns the user and their caregivers when the data deviate from the expected values or ranges. The goal is to use this information to improve the quality of care, as changes in the user's health status can be determined more quickly by themselves and their caregivers. The proposed system establishes a good base for further testing and optimization together with the user, to ensure a useful and appropriate combination of sensors and technological devices that the user is comfortable with.},

In this work, we present a study on the interface preference of 35 older adults for a health monitoring system which they will be evaluating for eight weeks in their own homes. We found that participants who prefer the social robot have a higher affinity for technology interaction (ATI) score and are more likely to use assistance systems in their daily lives, while participants with a slightly lower ATI score prefer the virtual agent. Participants cited more personality and an interest in robots as reasons for the robot preference, and space and flexibility as reasons to prefer the virtual agent. These results underscore the importance of a personalized introduction of social technologies for health monitoring into the daily lives of older adults.},

  abstract = {Respiratory rate is a fundamental vital sign that is sensitive to different pathological conditions (e.g., adverse cardiac events, pneumonia, and clinical deterioration) and stressors, including emotional stress, cognitive load, heat, cold, physical effort, and exercise-induced fatigue. The sensitivity of respiratory rate to these conditions is superior compared to that of most of the other vital signs, and the abundance of suitable technological solutions measuring respiratory rate has important implications for healthcare, occupational settings, and sport. However, respiratory rate is still too often not routinely monitored in these fields of use. This review presents a multidisciplinary approach to respiratory monitoring, with the aim to improve the development and efficacy of respiratory monitoring services. We have identified thirteen monitoring goals where the use of the respiratory rate is invaluable, and for each of them we have described suitable sensors and techniques to monitor respiratory rate in specific measurement scenarios. We have also provided a physiological rationale corroborating the importance of respiratory rate monitoring and an original multidisciplinary framework for the development of respiratory monitoring services. This review is expected to advance the field of respiratory monitoring and favor synergies between different disciplines to accomplish this goal.},

It involves the skills and motivation of people to obtain and understand health information. To improve health understanding and assessment of health literacy, many instruments have been developed to measure health competences in different populations. Among them there is the multidimensional, comprehensive questionnaire HLS-EU-Q16, developed by the Consortium of European Countries.                                         Aim.               Review of health literacy studies using the European Health Competence Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16) based on literature analysis.                                         Method.               Thematic review, unsystematic literature covering the years 2010-2018. The number of 17 source items was analyzed by the authors.                                         Results.               The overall level of health literacy was higher in European research than in non-European research. Low levels of health literacy were found in the elderly and chronically ill, immigrants and prisoners, as well as people with low education. The analysis of the research shows that the limited health skills of the respondents are related to the deterioration of the functional state and cognitive skills in the elderly. The decisive determinant of the low level of health literacy among immigrants and prisoners is unemployment and low level of education. Adequate health education plays a key role in improving the social level of health awareness and contributes to the long-term health of the entire population.},

With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a ``medium'' example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

  abstract = {In recent years, communication robots aiming to offer mental support to the elderly have attracted increasing attention. Dialogue systems consisting of two robots could provide the elderly with opportunities to hold longer conversations in care homes. In this study, we conducted an experiment to compare two types of scenario-based dialogue systems with different types of bodies---physical and virtual robots---to investigate the effects of embodying such dialogue systems. Forty elderly people aged from 65 to 84 interacted with either an embodied desktop-sized humanoid robot or computer graphic agent displayed on a monitor. The elderly participants were divided into groups depending on the success of the interactions. The results revealed that (i) in the group where the robots responded more successfully with the expected conversation flow, the elderly are more engaged in the conversation with the physical robots than the virtual robots, and (ii) the elderly in the group in which robots responded successfully are more engaged in the conversation with the physical robots than those in the group in which the robots responded with ambiguous responses owing to unexpected utterances from the elderly. These results suggest that having a physical body is advantageous in promoting high engagement, and the potential advantage appears depending on whether the system can handle the conversation flow. These findings provide new insight into the development of dialogue systems assisting elderly in maintaining a better mental health.},

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

To explore this idea, we developed two virtual agents that attempt to motivate users to perform healthy behaviors - either to increase exercise or fruit and vegetable consumption - and systematically vary whether they use humor or not in their counseling conversations. Human-authored jokes were selected from a large corpus based on the nature of the humor (empathetic affiliative humor that serves to build relational closeness), health topic relevance, and subjective ratings of funniness, as well as relevance to user stage of behavior change. We evaluated our agents in a two-treatment counterbalanced within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a humorous and non-humorous agent motivating either exercise or healthy diet. We found the interaction with the humorous agent led to a significantly greater change in motivation to engage in the target behavior than interacting with the non-humorous agent.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been introduced as standardised outcomes, but have not been implemented widely for disease targeted pathways of care, nor for geriatric patients who prefer functional performance and quality of life. DISCUSSION: We describe innovative multipurpose implementation of PROMs as evidenced by two best practices of PROMs application in geriatric and physiotherapy practice. We show that PROMs can show meaningful outcomes in older subjects' patient journeys, which can at the same time serve individuals and groups of both patients and professionals. KEY LESSON: PROMs can deliver generic outcomes relevant for older patients, may improve patient-physician relationship, quality of care and prediction of future outcomes in geriatric care, if they are valid, reliable and responsive, but still short and simple. A precondition to make the hard tip from research to practice is that PROMs are carefully positioned in the clinical encounters and in electronic health records.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most research on the prevalence of mental disorders in primary care has been conducted in practices that serve middle- and upper-income patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of major mental disorders in a primary care practice that serves a predominantly low-income immigrant patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey; criterion standard. SETTING: Urban general medicine practice. PARTICIPANTS: Systematic sample of consecutive adult patients with scheduled appointments. Of 1266 approached eligible patients, 1007 (80\%) participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, alcohol use disorder, and suicidal ideation; drug use disorder; functional status; work loss; family distress; and mental health treatment. RESULTS: Major depression (18. 9\%), generalized anxiety (14.8\%), panic (8.3\%), and substance use (7. 9\%) disorders and suicidal ideation (7.1\%) were highly prevalent. Many patients had more than 1 disorder (range, 36.3\% [substance use disorder] to 76.9\% [panic disorder]). In multivariate analyses, each disorder was significantly associated with an increase in impairment after controlling for demographic characteristics, perceived health, and the other disorders. A minority of patients with each disorder (range, 22.5\% [substance use disorder] to 46.4\% [panic disorder]) reported receiving mental health treatment in the last month. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal ideation are quite common in this practice and associated with significant functional impairment. Primary care practices that serve poor urban immigrant populations have a critical need to provide access to mental health services. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:876-883},

  abstract = {A migraine is a severe, throbbing, or pulsing headache that typically affects one side of the head. A migraine attack can be so painful that it interferes with daily activities and can last for hours or even days. Migraine is a common health issue that affects approximately 1 in every 5 women and 1 in every 15 men. Additionally, millions of people worldwide suffer from migraine attacks due to the inability to anticipate or adapt to their environment. In today's globalized world, mobile phones have become a necessity for the general public, enabling communication, internet shopping, food purchases, and even health applications. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop a mobile application that serves as an online migraine management system that is responsive to meteorological conditions. The app was created using development tools such as Android Studio, Visual Code Studio, Flutter framework, and Firebase Firestore, which act as databases. This report also includes essential information on migraines and a comparison of similar or existing applications. In addition, the research is designed to provide a reliable and user-friendly interface for collecting migraine data for robust evidence, processing relevant demographic features such as medical history, and generating reports. While researching topics relevant to the application, we found a scarcity of data on weather-based migraines. As a result, the system will predict the impact and risk of migraine based on Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) data provided by migraine patients as well as weather forecasts. With the features of this research, migraine patients can hopefully better prepare themselves for their daily routine and manage their symptoms more effectively.},

Since the global geriatric population is anticipated to rise, the number of people seeking to obtain caregiving services and wishing to be more actively engaged in life will be more apparent. Therefore, seniors aspiring day-to-day special care in home settings, interested in improving their living standards can likewise benefit from an amiable companion. A comprehensive search strategy was developed and selected databases were looked through with relevant keywords. This scoping review qualitatively examines the literature on the use of companion robots, including both pet-like and humanoid robots, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) security, coupled with the new 5G technology for the home-based elder care. From 355 full-text articles that were found, 90 articles were selected to be investigated respectively. In order to ascertain their operation in the future, we discuss remaining challenges, unused opportunities, security risks and suggested remedies and suggest a dementia-centred concept and an implementation framework.},

  abstract = {As telecommunications technology progresses, telehealth frameworks are becoming more widely adopted in the context of long-term care (LTC) for older adults, both in care facilities and in homes. Today, robots could assist healthcare workers when they provide care to elderly patients, who constitute a particularly vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous work on user-centered design of assistive technologies in LTC facilities for seniors has identified positive impacts. The need to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the benefits of this approach, but also highlights some new challenges for which robots could be interesting solutions to be deployed in LTC facilities. This requires customization of telecommunication and audio/video/data processing to address specific clinical requirements and needs. This paper presents OpenTera, an open source telehealth framework, aiming to facilitate prototyping of such solutions by software and robotic designers. Designed as a microservice-oriented platform, OpenTera is an end-to-end solution that employs a series of independent modules for tasks such as data and session management, telehealth, daily assistive tasks/actions, together with smart devices and environments, all connected through the framework. After explaining the framework, we illustrate how OpenTera can be used to implement robotic solutions for different applications identified in LTC facilities and homes, and we describe how we plan to validate them through field trials.},

  abstract = {1 IntroductionSocial robots have great potential to provide social, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive support to people with diverse characteristics and needs. Although still in its infancy, the field of social robotics has explored various aspects of human-robot interaction (HRI), such as multimodal communication and personalized interaction, and their applications in different domains including education and patient care. However, to evaluate the acceptance and efficacy of social robots and to understand their broader impacts in the real world, it is necessary to deploy these robots in the ``wild'' field for an extended period of time. Such deployment typically involves collaboration with different disciplines such as medicine, social psychology, clinical therapy, industrial design, public health, marketing, and education.Thus, this Research Topic focuses on social robotics research with novel algorithms and computational modeling that have been or are being evaluated with intended users/consumers, patients, or individuals with special needs. A special focus has been given to results that arose from multidisciplinary studies in which the roles and impacts of social robots are evaluated in ``real-world'' settings, especially in collaboration between engineering, industrial design, clinical science, medicine, social psychology, marketing, and education.2 Research Topic FormationThis Research Topic emerged from a discussion among young and active researchers in HRI---Dr. Park and Dr. Huang from the U.S.A., Dr. Ros from Spain, Dr. Kwak from South Korea, and Dr. Lemaignan from the United Kingdom---who have all realized the emergent and crucial needs to explore the topic further and get further input from the many researchers in HRI.3 Contents of the Research TopicAs anticipated, the submitted and accepted papers showed multi-disciplinary characteristics and combined themes from the proposed Research Topic outline. Out of the multiple mixed themes, however, we could identify the following four major important research themes and trends, where the social robots are taking active roles in the ``wild'' of the human-robot interaction frontiers.3.1 HRI Theories and Computational ModelingWe have seen continuous efforts in applying theories from psychology with more sound experimental settings in the real world. One recent example is by Agriogoroaie et al. [1] who have applied the regulatory focus theory in human-robot communication, with which a Tiago robot approached people with two communication methodologies based on either promotion type or prevention type, and evaluated its effectiveness in correlation with the regulatory focus types of the individuals (N=29).We have also found increased efforts in designing computational models for HRI in the wild, especially in the clinical domains. Clabaugh et al. [2] propose a math tutoring system for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (aged 4-7), where Reinforcement Learning is used to personalize instruction and robot feedback. Javed et al. [3] apply machine learning algorithms to derive personalized models for acquiring social engagement measures for children with ASD (aged 4-12).3.2 Longitudinal and Large-group HRIFor the past 10 years, longitudinal and larger-group studies in HRI have gained great interest from the community aiming at building systems that can engage and adapt to different users through time with the ambition of getting closer to a world where robots can truly be part of our daily lives. The educational setting is one of the typical areas where the application of social robots has been studied. A math tutoring system proposed by Clabaugh et al. [2] has been evaluated with 17 children with ASD over month-long interventions at their homes. A peer-like social robot for language learning designed by Kory-Westlund \&amp;amp; Breazeal [4] has been developed, and the role of ``rapport'' has been investigated in their two months long study with 17 children. Besides education, social robots are used for elderly care; Van Maris et al. [6] explored the longitudinal effects of older adults (N=17) interacting with social robots.HRI in public, especially interacting with a large group of people is another emerging research topic. Fraune et al. [5] have studied the impact of group characteristics and norms in interacting with a robot in public settings and its influences on people's behavior changes.3.3 HRI in Healthcare and Special EducationASD is one of the areas in special education where socially assistive robot (SAR) systems have shown potential benefits, typically supporting social development, though not limited to. An example is a work proposed by Clabaugh et al. [2], where they propose a tutoring system for space-themed mathematics problems addressed to young children with ASD while embedding social contexts in the learning environment. Another work by Javed et al. [3] exhibits a robotic playmate with socio-emotional interventions with personalized engagement monitoring.Management of diabetes is another healthcare-related domain where in-the-wild long-term interventions are key. Neerincx et al. [7] present the results of a 4-years European project, where they deploy the Socio-Cognitive Engineering methodology to design and integrate a SAR, tested for several months with large groups of children.Though evaluating SAR systems with end-users is vital, it is equally important to consider the views of other stakeholders to guide the design of such systems. As such, Alcorn et al. [8] present an analysis of educators' views on the use of SAR systems in ASD suggesting guidelines to the HRI community, not only regarding the design of robotic systems but also proposing areas of research that should be further considered.3.4 Emotions and EthicsWhile socially assistive robots are uniquely characterized by their potential in participating in social-emotional interactions with people, these robots are currently not as emotionally capable as humans do. Indeed, emotive behaviors displayed by robots can be considered as emotional deception, possibly leading to broader ethical concerns. Van Maris et al. [6] studied how deceptively emotive behaviors by a social robot might influence older adult's perceptions of the robot.On the other hand, social robots' behaviors could possibly help mitigate human negative psychological states such as stress. Bj\&\#246;rling et al. [9] explored how teens may interact with social robots in the school environment where teens might feel stressed. Little research on robotics and teens has been conducted to date: this article, relying on mixed-methods where the teens are in turn users, experimenters, and witnesses, offers a very novel glimpse into how socially assistive robots could support this population.4 ConclusionsWith the development of robotic technologies, it is imperative to develop social robots that support people in their daily lives. The papers published in this issue collectively show the recent and advanced application of theories from various academic fields such as healthcare, education, social psychology on social robots and HRI. More efforts are found to be focusing on child/adolescents and older adults who are in need of or can benefit from the company of robots. We believe that these collective endeavors will help to further extract knowledge regarding the nature of the interaction between humans and robots, which we hope to be utilized in building successful social robots ``in the wild,'' expanding into wider areas of applications in diverse human domains (age, gender, culture, etc.). Specifically, topics presented by the papers including HRI Theories and Computational Modeling, Longitudinal and Larger-group HRI, HRI in Healthcare and Special Education, and Emotions and Ethics provide the readers with a vast array of applicable areas of social robots, focused on their effectiveness in various real-world settings. These studies will enlighten further research avenues regarding social robots that are closely connected to the users, which enrich their satisfaction with their lives by successfully fulfilling their needs. We believe that these collaborative efforts will contribute to the further development of the theory and knowledge regarding HRI, boosting the people's acceptance of social robots in their daily lives.},

  abstract = {Background: Respondent engagement of questionnaires in health care is fundamental to ensure adequate response rates for the evaluation of services and quality of care. Conventional survey designs are often perceived as dull and unengaging, resulting in negative respondent behavior. It is necessary to make completing a questionnaire attractive and motivating. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the user experience of a chatbot questionnaire, which mimics intelligent conversation, with a regular computer questionnaire. Methods: The research took place at the preoperative outpatient clinic. Patients completed both the standard computer questionnaire and the new chatbot questionnaire. Afterward, patients gave their feedback on both questionnaires by the User Experience Questionnaire, which consists of 26 terms to score. Results: The mean age of the 40 included patients (25 [63\%] women) was 49 (SD 18-79) years; 46.73\% (486/1040) of all terms were scored positive for the chatbot. Patients preferred the computer for 7.98\% (83/1040) of the terms and for 47.88\% (498/1040) of the terms there were no differences. Completion (mean time) of the computer questionnaire took 9.00 minutes by men (SD 2.72) and 7.72 minutes by women (SD 2.60; P=.148). For the chatbot, completion by men took 8.33 minutes (SD 2.99) and by women 7.36 minutes (SD 2.61; P=.287). Conclusions: Patients preferred the chatbot questionnaire over the computer questionnaire. Time to completion of both questionnaires did not differ, though the chatbot questionnaire on a tablet felt more rapid compared to the computer questionnaire. This is an important finding because it could lead to higher response rates and to qualitatively better responses in future questionnaires.},

  abstract = {Purpose To provide an overview of factors influencing the acceptance of electronic technologies that support aging in place by community-dwelling older adults. Since technology acceptance factors fluctuate over time, a distinction was made between factors in the pre-implementation stage and factors in the post-implementation stage. Methods A systematic review of mixed studies. Seven major scientific databases (including MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) original and peer-reviewed research, (2) qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods research, (3) research in which participants are community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older, and (4) research aimed at investigating factors that influence the intention to use or the actual use of electronic technology for aging in place. Three researchers each read the articles and extracted factors. Results Sixteen out of 2841 articles were included. Most articles investigated acceptance of technology that enhances safety or provides social interaction. The majority of data was based on qualitative research investigating factors in the pre-implementation stage. Acceptance in this stage is influenced by 27 factors, divided into six themes: concerns regarding technology (e.g., high cost, privacy implications and usability factors); expected benefits of technology (e.g., increased safety and perceived usefulness); need for technology (e.g., perceived need and subjective health status); alternatives to technology (e.g., help by family or spouse), social influence (e.g., influence of family, friends and professional caregivers); and characteristics of older adults (e.g., desire to age in place). When comparing these results to qualitative results on post-implementation acceptance, our analysis showed that some factors are persistent while new factors also emerge. Quantitative results showed that a small number of variables have a significant influence in the pre-implementation stage. Fourteen out of the sixteen included articles did not use an existing technology acceptance framework or model. Conclusions Acceptance of technology in the pre-implementation stage is influenced by multiple factors. However, post-implementation research on technology acceptance by community-dwelling older adults is scarce and most of the factors in this review have not been tested by using quantitative methods. Further research is needed to determine if and how the factors in this review are interrelated, and how they relate to existing models of technology acceptance.},

  abstract = {Background: Older adults, a population particularly susceptible to misinformation, may experience attempts at health-related scams or defrauding, and they may unknowingly spread misinformation. Previous research has investigated managing misinformation through media literacy education or supporting users by fact-checking information and cautioning for potential misinformation content, yet studies focusing on older adults are limited. Chatbots have the potential to educate and support older adults in misinformation management. However, many studies focusing on designing technology for older adults use the needs-based approach and consider aging as a deficit, leading to issues in technology adoption. Instead, we adopted the asset-based approach, inviting older adults to be active collaborators in envisioning how intelligent technologies can enhance their misinformation management practices. Objective: This study aims to understand how older adults may use chatbots' capabilities for misinformation management. Methods: We conducted 5 participatory design workshops with a total of 17 older adult participants to ideate ways in which chatbots can help them manage misinformation. The workshops included 3 stages: developing scenarios reflecting older adults' encounters with misinformation in their lives, understanding existing chatbot platforms, and envisioning how chatbots can help intervene in the scenarios from stage 1. Results: We found that issues with older adults' misinformation management arose more from interpersonal relationships than individuals' ability to detect misinformation in pieces of information. This finding underscored the importance of chatbots to act as mediators that facilitate communication and help resolve conflict. In addition, participants emphasized the importance of autonomy. They desired chatbots to teach them to navigate the information landscape and come to conclusions about misinformation on their own. Finally, we found that older adults' distrust in IT companies and governments' ability to regulate the IT industry affected their trust in chatbots. Thus, chatbot designers should consider using well-trusted sources and practicing transparency to increase older adults' trust in the chatbot-based tools. Overall, our results highlight the need for chatbot-based misinformation tools to go beyond fact checking. Conclusions: This study provides insights for how chatbots can be designed as part of technological systems for misinformation management among older adults. Our study underscores the importance of inviting older adults to be active co-designers of chatbot-based interventions.},

The aim of this study was 1) to test the performance of a diagnostic system for major depressive disorders (MDD), based on the identification by an ECA of specific symptoms (the MDD DSM 5 criteria) in outpatients; 2) to evaluate the acceptability of such an ECA. Patients completed two clinical interviews in a randomized order (ECA versus psychiatrist) and filled in the Acceptability E-scale (AES) to quantify the acceptability of the ECA. 179 outpatients were included in this study (mean age 46.5\,{\textpm}\,12.9 years, 57.5\% females). Among the 35 patients diagnosed with MDD by the psychiatrist, 14 (40\%) patients exhibited mild, 12 (34.3\%) moderate and 9 (25.7\%) severe depressive symptoms. Sensitivity increased across the severity level of depressive symptoms and reached 73\% for patients with severe depressive symptoms, while specificity remained above 95\% for all three severity levels. The acceptability of the ECA evaluated by the AES was very good (25.4). We demonstrate here the validity and acceptability of an ECA to diagnose major depressive disorders. ECAs are promising tools to conduct standardized and well-accepted clinical interviews.},

  abstract = {Background Almost two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer are age 65 years or older. In order to follow up on older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy at home, we implemented remote phone monitoring conducted by skilled oncology nurses. However, given the rising number of patients assessed and the limited time that hospital professionals can spend on their patients after discharge, we needed to modernize this program. In this paper we present the preliminary results and the ongoing evaluation. Method We implemented a semi-automated messaging application to upgrade the current follow-up procedures. The primary aim is to collect patient's key data over time and to free up nurses' time so that during phone calls they can focus on education and support. The Chatbot feasibility was assessed in a sub-sample of unselected patients before its wider dissemination and pragmatic evaluation. Main results During the first deployment period, 9 unselected patients benefited from the Chatbot (mean 83 y.o.) with a total of 52 completed remote evaluations. Each participant answered 6 questionnaires over 7 weeks with an 86\% compliance rate. The average completion time for the questionnaires was 3.5\,min and the answer rate was 100\%. The `free text' field was used in 58\% of the questionnaires. The Chatbot solution is currently proposed to all eligible patients thanks to the regional cancer network support. We are measuring acceptability, health outcomes and health network impact. Discussion and conclusion The results of this first phase are encouraging. The integration of the solution into the health care organization was feasible and acceptable. Moreover, the answers revealed serious health (e.g. fever) or adherence (e.g. blood test) issues that require timely interventions. The major strength of this solution is to rely on end-users' current knowledge of technologies (text-messaging), which allows a seamless integration into a complex clinical network.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidimensional impairment of older patients may influence the clinical outcome of diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment predicts short-term mortality in older patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective study with a 1-month follow-up, 376 patients aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of heart failure were enrolled. A standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment that included information on functional (activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), cognitive (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire), and nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment), as well as on risk of pressure sore (Exton-Smith Scale), comorbidities (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale Index), medications, and social support network, was used to calculate the MPI for mortality using a previously validated algorithm. The New York Heart Association, the Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment, and the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry regression model scores were also calculated. Higher MPI values were significantly associated with higher 30-day mortality, both in men (MPI-1, 2.8\%; MPI-2, 15.3\%; MPI-3, 47.4\%; P=0.000) and women (MPI-1, 0\%; MPI-2, 6.5\%; MPI-3, 14.6\%; P=0.011). The discrimination of the MPI was also good, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (men: 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.90; women: 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.89) greater than receiver operating characteristic areas of New York Heart Association (men: 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.69; P=0.015; women: 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.75; P=0.064), Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment (men: 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.79; P=0.045; women: 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; P=0.443), and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry scores (men: 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 0.78; P=0.023; women: 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.49 to 0.83, P=0.171). CONCLUSIONS: The MPI, calculated from information collected in a standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment, is useful to estimate the risk of 1-month mortality in older patients with heart failure.},

  abstract = {The multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)-based tool that accurately predicts negative health outcomes in older subjects with different diseases and settings. To calculate the MPI several validated tools are assessed by health care professionals according to the CGA, whereas self-reported information by the patients is not available, but it could be of importance for the early identification of frailty. We aimed to develop and validate a self-administered MPI (SELFY-MPI) in community-dwelling subjects. For this reason, we enrolled 167 subjects (mean age\,=\,67.3, range\,=\,20--88 years, 51\%\,=\,men). All subjects underwent a CGA-based assessment to calculate the MPI and the SELFY-MPI. The SELFY-MPI included the assessment of (1) basic and instrumental activities of daily living, (2) mobility, (3) memory, (4) nutrition, (5) comorbidity, (6) number of medications, and (7) socioeconomic situation. The Bland--Altman methodology was used to measure the agreement between MPI and SELFY-MPI. The mean MPI and SELFY-MPI values were 0.147 and 0.145, respectively. The mean difference was +0.002\,{\textpm}\,standard deviation of 0.07. Lower and upper 95\% limits of agreement were -0.135 and +0.139, respectively, with only 5 of 167 (3\%) of observations outside the limits. Stratified analysis by age provided similar results for younger ({$\leq$}65 years old, n\,=\,45) and older subjects ({$>$}65 years, n\,=\,122). The analysis of variances in subjects subdivided according to different year decades showed no differences of agreement according to age. In conclusion, the SELFY-MPI can be used as a prognostic tool in subjects of different ages.},

  abstract = {Rapidly developing robotics products offer potential solutions for numerous social and health care sector challenges. In a care context, special attention must be focused on the ethical use of the robots. One important aspect is to listen and involve the users in the development and implementation process. In this study, we presented the Pepper robot within two elderly service homes in Finland. Pepper is a social humanoid robot able to recognize faces, communicate and interact with humans. The aim was to study: 1. how elderly perceive interaction with Pepper, 2. what kind of attitudes they have related to the robot, and 3. how and where they would or would not use Pepper. Content in the test events was provided by Pepper, who presented personal digital stories about each senior (using facial recognition), free discussion with Pepper and having Pepper demonstrate its skills, such as dance moves and telling jokes. Information was collected by subjective measures, through direct observation and semistructured interviews in the test events, as well as test event video recordings' analysis following test events. The general attitude of participants was positive; showing willingness to communicate with Pepper despite occasional flaws and clumsiness experienced in the test events. The flaws even created empathy towards the robot. The event was an enjoyable and social situation. Even though not everyone was interested in participating actively, most were willing to observe. Multiple ideas arose regarding Pepper's potential application areas. These are discussed in more detail in this paper. Overall, findings indicate that humanoid robots (such as Pepper) have the potential to offer meaningful content to older adults.},

The goal of most qualitative studies is not to generalize but rather to provide a rich, contextualized understanding of some aspect of human experience through the intensive study of particular cases. Yet, in an environment where evidence for improving practice is held in high esteem, generalization in relation to knowledge claims merits careful attention by both qualitative and quantitative researchers. Issues relating to generalization are, however, often ignored or misrepresented by both groups of researchers. Three models of generalization, as proposed in a seminal article by Firestone, are discussed in this paper: classic sample-to-population (statistical) generalization, analytic generalization, and case-to-case transfer (transferability). Suggestions for enhancing the capacity for generalization in terms of all three models are offered. The suggestions cover such issues as planned replication, sampling strategies, systematic reviews, reflexivity and higher-order conceptualization, thick description, mixed methods research, and the RE-AIM framework within pragmatic trials.},

  abstract = {Background: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence--driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. Objective: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Methods: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. Results: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2\% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2\% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3\% (73/101) were employed. Participants' W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94\% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1\% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95\% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5\% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P\&lt;.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change -9.3, SD 14.1; P\&lt;.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change -1.3, SD 2.6; P\&lt;.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change -1.2, SD 2.0; P\&lt;.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change -2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6\% vs 47.1\% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76\%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80\%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43\%). Conclusions: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

Their combination leads to CatBoost outperforming other publicly available boosting implementations in terms of quality on a variety of datasets. Two critical algorithmic advances introduced in CatBoost are the implementation of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic algorithm, and an innovative algorithm for processing categorical features. Both techniques were created to fight a prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all currently existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of this problem and demonstrate that proposed algorithms solve it effectively, leading to excellent empirical results.},

  abstract = {Due to importantly beneficial effects on physical and mental health and strong association with many rehabilitation programs, Physical Activity Recognition and Measure (PARM) has been widely recognised as a key paradigm for a variety of smart healthcare applications. Traditional methods for PARM relies on designing and utilising Data fusion or machine learning techniques in processing ambient and wearable sensing data for classifying types of physical activity and removing their uncertainties. Yet they mostly focus on controlled environments with the aim of increasing types of identifiable activity subjects, improved recognition accuracy and measure robustness. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technology is transferring PARM studies to an open and dynamic uncontrolled ecosystem by connecting heterogeneous cost-effective wearable devices and mobile apps and various groups of users [35]. Little is currently known about whether traditional Data fusion techniques can tackle new challenges of IoT environments and how to effectively harness and improve these technologies. In an effort to understand potential use and opportunities of Data fusion techniques in IoT enabled PARM applications, this paper will give a systematic review, critically examining PARM studies from a perspective of a novel 3D dynamic IoT based physical activity collection and validation model. It summarized traditional state-of-the-art data fusion techniques from three plane domains in the 3D dynamic IoT model: devices, persons and timeline. The paper goes on to identify some new research trends and challenges of data fusion techniques in the IoT enabled PARM studies, and discusses some key enabling techniques for tackling them.},

  abstract = {Background Heart rate is routinely measured as part of the clinical examination but is rarely acted upon unless it is well outside a population-based normal range. With wearable sensor technologies, heart rate can now be continuously measured, making it possible to accurately identify an individual's ``normal'' heart rate and potentially important variations in it over time. Our objective is to describe inter- and intra-individual variability in resting heart rate (RHR) collected over the course of two years using a wearable device, studying the variations of resting heart rate as a function of time of year, as well as individuals characteristics like age, sex, average sleep duration, and body mass index (BMI). Methods and findings Our retrospective, longitudinal cohort study includes 92,457 de-identified individuals from the United States (all 50 states), who consistently---over at least 35 weeks in the period from March 2016 to February 2018, for at least 2 days per week, and at least 20 hours per day---wore a heart rate wrist-worn tracker. In this study, we report daily RHR and its association with age, BMI, sex, and sleep duration, and its variation over time. Individual daily RHR was available for a median of 320 days, providing nearly 33 million daily RHR values. We also explored the range in daily RHR variability between individuals, and the long- and short-term changes in the trajectory of an individual's daily RHR. Mean daily RHR was 65 beats per minute (bpm), with a range of 40 to 109 bpm among all individuals. The mean RHR differed significantly by age, sex, BMI, and average sleep duration. Time of year variations were also noted, with a minimum in July and maximum in January. For most subjects, RHR remained relatively stable over the short term, but 20\% experienced at least 1 week in which their RHR fluctuated by 10 bpm or more. Conclusions Individuals have a daily RHR that is normal for them but can differ from another individual's normal by as much as 70 bpm. Within individuals, RHR was much more consistent over time, with a small but significant seasonal trend, and detectable discrete and infrequent episodes outside their norms.},

  abstract = {As the obesity rate continues to increase persistently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective weight loss management strategy. Nowadays, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technologies coupled with the rapid spread of messaging platforms and mobile technology with easier access to internet technology offers professional dietitians an opportunity to provide extensive monitoring support to their clients through a chatbot with artificial empathy. This study aimed to design a chatbot with artificial empathic motivational support for weight loss called ``SlimMe'' and investigate how people react to a diet bot. The SlimMe infrastructure was built using Dialogflow as the natural language processing (NLP) platform and LINE mobile messenger as the messaging platform. We proposed a text-based emotion analysis to simulate artificial empathy responses to recognize the user's emotion. A preliminary evaluation was performed to investigate the early-stage user experience after a 7-day simulation trial. The result revealed that having an artificially empathic diet bot for weight loss management is a fun and exciting experience. The use of emoticons, stickers, and GIF images makes the chatbot response more interactive. Moreover, the motivational support and persuasive messaging features enable the bot to express more empathic and engaging responses to the user. In total, there were 1,007 bot responses from 892 user input messages. Of these, 67.38\% (601/1,007) of the chatbot-generated responses were accurate to a relevant user request, 21.19\% (189/1,007) inaccurate responses to a relevant request, and 10.31\% (92/1,007) accurate responses to an irrelevant request. Only 1.12\% (10/1,007) of the chatbot does not answer. We present the design of an artificially empathic diet bot as a friendly assistant to help users estimate their calorie intake and calories burned in a more interactive and engaging way. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot designed with artificial empathy features, and it looks very promising in promoting long-term weight management. More user interactions and further data training and validation enhancement will improve the bot's in-built knowledge base and emotional intelligence base.},

Furthermore, Tina encourages participants to describe, in their own words, their most bothersome problems and what makes them better or worse, through the Patient Report of Problems (PROP) instrument. The PROP captures unfiltered verbatim replies of patients, in contrast with traditional patient reported outcomes that typically rely on categorical assessments. We argue that combining these patient reports (i.e., what they say) with objective biomarkers (i.e., how they say it and what they do) can greatly enhance the quality of telemedicine and improve the efficacy of siteless trials and digital therapeutic interventions.},

However, concerns over loneliness were not prioritized by caregivers, though they did perceive older adults' worries around this issue. Additionally, caregivers saw a number of ways a social robot could be designed to address this, as well as its ability to go beyond loneliness in promoting more fulfilling lives among older adults.

  abstract = {Background: Health apps are increasingly becoming an integral part of health care. Especially in older adults, the self-management of chronic diseases by health apps might become an integral part of health care services. Objective: The aim of this explorative study was to investigate the prevalence of health app use and related demographic factors, as well as health status among older adults in Germany. Methods: A nationwide postal survey was conducted. Of the 5000 individuals contacted, a total of 576 participants completed this survey. On the basis of their self-indicated assignment to one of the three predefined user groups (health app users, general app users, and nonusers of apps), participants answered various questions regarding app and health app use, including frequency of use and number of installed apps, demographic factors, and health status. Results: In total, 16.5\% (95/576) used health apps, whereas 37.5\% (216/576) indicated only using general apps, and 46.0\% (265/576) reported using no apps at all. The number of installed health apps was most frequently reported as between 1 and 5 apps per participant, which were usually used on a weekly basis. The most frequently cited type of health apps were exercise-related ones. Individuals using health apps were found to be younger (MeanmHealth 66.6, SD 4.7) and to have a higher level of technical readiness compared with general app users and nonusers of apps (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=4.02 [95\% CI 2.23-7.25] for technical readiness, and AOR=0.905 [95\% CI 0.85-0.97] for age). The most frequently mentioned sources of information about apps within the group of health and general app users were family and friends. Identified barriers against the use of health apps were a lack of trust, data privacy concerns, and fear of misdiagnosis. Conclusions: Health apps are already used by older adults in Germany. The main type of apps used are exercise-related ones. Barriers to and incentives for the use of health apps and associations with health status and users' demographics were revealed.},

  abstract = {Mental health issues are at the forefront of healthcare challenges facing contemporary human society. These issues are most prevalent among working-age people, impacting negatively on the individual, his/her family, workplace, community, and the economy. Conventional mental healthcare services, although highly effective, cannot be scaled up to address the increasing demand from affected individuals, as evidenced in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversational agents, or chatbots, are a recent technological innovation that has been successfully adapted for mental healthcare as a scalable platform of cross-platform smartphone applications that provides first-level support for such individuals. Despite this disposition, mental health chatbots in the extant literature and practice are limited in terms of the therapy provided and the level of personalisation. For instance, most chatbots extend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) into predefined conversational pathways that are generic and ineffective in recurrent use. In this paper, we postulate that Behavioural Activation (BA) therapy and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are more effectively materialised in a chatbot setting to provide recurrent emotional support, personalised assistance, and remote mental health monitoring. We present the design and development of our BA-based AI chatbot, followed by its participatory evaluation in a pilot study setting that confirmed its effectiveness in providing support for individuals with mental health issues.},

  abstract = {Background: Contactless sleep technologies (CSTs) hold promise for longitudinal, unobtrusive sleep monitoring in the community and at scale. They may be particularly useful in older populations wherein sleep disturbance, which may be indicative of the deterioration of physical and mental health, is highly prevalent. However, few CSTs have been evaluated in older people. Objective: This study evaluated the performance of 3 CSTs compared to polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy in an older population. Methods: Overall, 35 older men and women (age: mean 70.8, SD 4.9 y; women: n=14, 40\%), several of whom had comorbidities, including sleep apnea, participated in the study. Sleep was recorded simultaneously using a bedside radar (Somnofy [Vital Things]: n=17), 2 undermattress devices (Withings sleep analyzer [WSA; Withings Inc]: n=35; Emfit-QS [Emfit; Emfit Ltd]: n=17), PSG (n=35), and actigraphy (Actiwatch Spectrum [Philips Respironics]: n=18) during the first night in a 10-hour time-in-bed protocol conducted in a sleep laboratory. The devices were evaluated through performance metrics for summary measures and epoch-by-epoch classification. PSG served as the gold standard. Results: The protocol induced mild sleep disturbance with a mean sleep efficiency (SEFF) of 70.9\% (SD 10.4\%; range 52.27\%-92.60\%). All 3 CSTs overestimated the total sleep time (TST; bias: \&gt;90 min) and SEFF (bias: \&gt;13\%) and underestimated wake after sleep onset (bias: \&gt;50 min). Sleep onset latency was accurately detected by the bedside radar (bias: \&lt;6 min) but overestimated by the undermattress devices (bias: \&gt;16 min). CSTs did not perform as well as actigraphy in estimating the all-night sleep summary measures. In an epoch-by-epoch concordance analysis, the bedside radar performed better in discriminating sleep versus wake (Matthew correlation coefficient [MCC]: mean 0.63, SD 0.12, 95\% CI 0.57-0.69) than the undermattress devices (MCC of WSA: mean 0.41, SD 0.15, 95\% CI 0.36-0.46; MCC of Emfit: mean 0.35, SD 0.16, 95\% CI 0.26-0.43). The accuracy of identifying rapid eye movement and light sleep was poor across all CSTs, whereas deep sleep (ie, slow wave sleep) was predicted with moderate accuracy (MCC: \&gt;0.45) by both Somnofy and WSA. The deep sleep duration estimates of Somnofy correlated (r2=0.60; P\&lt;.01) with electroencephalography slow wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) derived from PSG, whereas for the undermattress devices, this correlation was not significant (WSA: r2=0.0096, P=.58; Emfit: r2=0.11, P=.21). Conclusions: These CSTs overestimated the TST, and sleep stage prediction was unsatisfactory in this group of older people in whom SEFF was relatively low. Although it was previously shown that CSTs provide useful information on bed occupancy, which may be useful for particular use cases, the performance of these CSTs with respect to the TST and sleep stage estimation requires improvement before they can serve as an alternative to PSG in estimating most sleep variables in older individuals.},

  abstract = {We present a conversational agent designed to provide realistic conversational practice to older adults at risk of isolation or social anxiety, and show the results of a content analysis on a corpus of data collected from experiments with elderly patients interacting with our system. The conversational agent, represented by a virtual avatar, is designed to hold multiple sessions of casual conversation with older adults. Throughout each interaction, the system analyzes the prosodic and nonverbal behavior of users and provides feedback to the user in the form of periodic comments and suggestions on how to improve. Our avatar is unique in its ability to hold natural dialogues on a wide range of everyday topics---27 topics in three groups, developed in collaboration with a team of gerontologists. The three groups vary in ``degrees of intimacy,'' and as such in degrees of cognitive difficulty for the user. After collecting data from nine participants who interacted with the avatar for seven to nine sessions over a period of 3 to 4 weeks, we present results concerning dialogue behavior and inferred sentiment of the users. Analysis of the dialogues reveals correlations such as greater elaborateness for more difficult topics, increasing elaborateness with successive sessions, stronger sentiments in topics concerned with life goals rather than routine activities, and stronger self-disclosure for more intimate topics. In addition to their intrinsic interest, these results also reflect positively on the sophistication and practical applicability of our dialogue system.},

A new approach in alleviating the social exclusion of older people involves the use of assistive robots. As robots rapidly invade everyday life, the need of new software paradigms in order to address the user's unique needs becomes critical. In this paper we present a novel architectural design, the RAPP [a software platform to deliver smart, user empowering robotic applications (RApps)] framework that attempts to address this issue. The proposed framework has been designed in a cloud-based approach, integrating robotic devices and their respective applications. We aim to facilitate seamless development of RApps compatible with a wide range of supported robots and available to the public through a unified online store.},

  abstract = {Background: Many older adults now use technologies such as wearable devices and telehealth services to support their health and well-being while living independently at home. However, older adults vary in how they use these technologies, and there is a lack of knowledge regarding the motivations that influence their acceptance and use of health-related technologies in home environments. Objective: This study aimed to understand the types of technologies that older adults use to support their health and the factors that motivate them to use their chosen technologies to support their health. In addition, we aimed to understand the factors that enable the effective use of technologies for health self-management and to identify the barriers that can negatively affect the adoption of technologies. Methods: A total of 22 older adults participated in semistructured interviews regarding their experiences of using technologies for health self-management. Interview transcripts were analyzed through an in-depth thematic analysis. Results: The interviews revealed that a range of technologies, such as videoconferencing software, fitness trackers, and other devices, were being used by older adults to support their health. Interviews showed that participants were motivated to use technologies to monitor health issues, to stay active and connected, and to record and change their behavior in the light of foreseen risks related to their future health status. Enablers that facilitated the effective use of technologies include social and organizational influence, convenient access to health care and safety provided by the technology, and easy setup and low cost of the technology. Barriers include information overload and a sense of futility about future health decline; telehealth being an inadequate substitute for in-person consultation; concerns about trust related to privacy and accuracy; and technologies being stigmatizing, uncomfortable to use, expensive, and unfamiliar. Conclusions: This study suggested that older adults were using a variety of technologies to prevent or prepare for future health decline, evidencing a resilient attitude toward health and aging. In addition, older adults were willing to continue using the technology when there was a perceived need. The enabler mentioned by most participants was the social and organizational influence that included health care staff, family, friends, and organizations. This analysis provides a better understanding of how older adults use technologies to support their health and can guide the provision of appropriate health technologies for them.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a number of challenges HCI designers and researchers deal with when designing digital technologies for older people. We conducted a 5-year research-through-design study, which combined ethnography, participatory design and real-life evaluation, to explore the design and use of technologies aimed to enhance the social life of older people. The paper explores widespread assumptions about the social category of older people and the meaning of technologies for them. This paper argues that assuming that (i) older people have unique needs and interests that set them apart from other user groups and (ii) the meaning of technologies remains unaltered on completion of co-design activities are both problematic, because they do not consider carefully enough the sociocultural contexts in which older people interact and engage in their daily lives. The paper posits that the meaning of technologies for older people and their own identities as individuals of a certain age are shaped within situated communities. Thus, technologies designed `for older people' should be designed to meet situated and dynamic needs/interests of the communities (and not only of care) to which they belong. We draw upon our findings and other situated epistemological discourses in HCI to introduce a different perspective, a turn to community, in the design of technologies for an ever-increasing ageing population.},

We show that PROMs can show meaningful outcomes in older subjects' patient journeys, which can at the same time serve individuals and groups of both patients and professionals.Key lesson: PROMs can deliver generic outcomes relevant for older patients, may improve patient-physician relationship, quality of care and prediction of future outcomes in geriatric care, if they are valid, reliable and responsive, but still short and simple. A precondition to make the hard tip from research to practice is that PROMs are carefully positioned in the clinical encounters and in electronic health records.},

  abstract = {Background The most important factor in controlling diabetes is self-care behaviors; improving self-care behaviors is the first step in helping patients to better control and manage their diseases and health literacy is recognized as a vital and important indicator of outcomes and costs in healthcare. Therefore, the effectiveness of health-care systems requires that people have the desirable health literacy level. Therefore, this research intended to study the relationship between health literacy levels in patients with diabetes and their self-care behaviors. Patients and Methods This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted during two months on 400 patients with diabetes selected using the census method in diabetes clinics in Mashhad County. Information was collected through a demographic survey questionnaire, the Health Literacy Questionnaire and a self-care behavior questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21 and Spearman correlation coefficient, the independent t-test, and ANOVA. Results The total mean score for self-care was 33.52 (SD{\textpm}13.27). There was a significant relationship between self-care and health literacy in this study (P {$<$}0.05) so that people with higher levels of self-care literacy had better self-care behaviors. There was also a significant relationship between education level and monthly income and self-care behaviors and health literacy (P {$<$}0.001). Conclusion Patients received an average score for self-care behaviors. Given the impact of health literacy on patients' self-care behaviors, and considering its inclusion in educational, therapeutic, and caregiver programs, it is possible to reduce complications in patients, and improve their quality of life, by improving their self-care behaviors. Special attention should also be paid to health literacy levels of the audience when designing the related educational programs.},

  abstract = {Many indicators point to an increase in the life span of adults in the developed world since the middle of the twentieth century. For example, the number of people reaching the age of 100 years has never been greater than it is today. These demographic changes raise two main types of questions. The first is whether life expectancy in good health can increase as much as total life expectancy or whether this increase in longevity comes at the cost of an increase in years of life in poor health and/or disability. The second type of question is whether these demographic changes are simply a new transition, after the elimination of infant mortality and premature mortality of young adults, increasing total life expectancy but without changing the characteristics of human longevity, or whether they are more fundamentally the beginnings of a change in the characteristics of human longevity, a real revolution in adult longevity. This technical paper does not claim to answer these questions but simply to present the demographic and epidemiological data that have been accumulating for more than 70 years and that still need to be analysed in order to try to answer these new questions.},

This 8-week feasibility trial explored a robot-delivered talk-based program for adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes to coach diabetes management with a focus on healthy eating habits. Trial objectives were to assess initial recruitment uptake, treatment effects, and evaluations of the program before a larger deployment. A NAO robot delivered two 60-minute coaching sessions and two 15-minute videos over an 8-week period. Initial findings revealed the robot program had a 44\% uptake rate (n = 4). The robot program helped two participants achieve a 70\% reduction in their high-sugar food and drink consumption, including increased motivation and self-efficacy scores. Program evaluation found the robot-delivered content did elicit discussion around personal incentives, goals, strategies, goal planning and consideration to improve diabetes management. Robot evaluation scores increased over time for improved likability, helpfulness, trust, and capacity to help change behavior. Qualitative evaluation found sessions were rated as interactive, supportive, and helpful for their self-management. Results found preliminary support for a robot-delivered program to be offered in conjunction with a hospital outpatient clinic, but more recruitment to increase sample size is needed. The next stage involves technical refinement, better integration into an existing service, and trial extension or replication in a larger sample to further substantiate these findings.},

Important behaviors to address and monitor include actions that can be modified, such as physical activity. These behaviours often require different personalised recommendations. Robots could be an effective way to give personalised health feedback based on scores, including in acute medical settings. This trial involved an automated social robot interaction in a health clinic to collect health data and provide personalized feedback on four key factors: exercise, diet, alcohol and cigarette use. Patients completed an 20-minute health questionnaire with a Pepper Robot in a clinic room during a health visit. The interaction was programmed to run autonomously with automatic scoring and feedback based on health scores. Instructions were delivered using co-verbal speech and detailed text on the tablet. Questions also included ratings on comfort to discuss health topics with a human or robot. Patients could choose to receive an optional follow-up in four weeks' time. A total of 47 patients completed the session. Patients reported being as comfortable to discuss health-related topics with a robot or human for exercise, diet, alcohol, cigarette use, and mental health. Program evaluation received moderate ratings for the robot on ease of use, usefulness and motivation to change a health behavior. No significant health changes were found 30 days later due to high initial health scores, leaving little room for improvement. This initial proof-of-concept trial found that a robot-delivered service could be deployed in a live health clinic in conjunction with patient visits.},

  abstract = {Social robots have been used to promote health education and coaching to provide health information. Important behaviors to address and monitor include actions that can be modified, such as physical activity. These behaviours often require different personalised recommendations. Robots could be an effective way to give personalised health feedback based on scores, including in acute medical settings. This trial involved an automated social robot interaction in a health clinic to collect health data and provide personalized feedback on four key factors: exercise, diet, alcohol and cigarette use. Patients completed an 20-minute health questionnaire with a Pepper Robot in a clinic room during a health visit. The interaction was programmed to run autonomously with automatic scoring and feedback based on health scores. Instructions were delivered using co-verbal speech and detailed text on the tablet. Questions also included ratings on comfort to discuss health topics with a human or robot. Patients could choose to receive an optional follow-up in four weeks' time. A total of 47 patients completed the session. Patients reported being as comfortable to discuss health-related topics with a robot or human for exercise, diet, alcohol, cigarette use, and mental health. Program evaluation received moderate ratings for the robot on ease of use, usefulness and motivation to change a health behavior. No significant health changes were found 30 days later due to high initial health scores, leaving little room for improvement. This initial proof-of-concept trial found that a robot-delivered service could be deployed in a live health clinic in conjunction with patient visits.},

  abstract = {Background: Several studies have recently reported on the correlation between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms in patients with affective disorders (unipolar and bipolar disorders). However, individual studies have reported on different and sometimes contradicting results, and no quantitative systematic review of the correlation between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms has been published. Objective: The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) provide an overview of the correlations between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms reported in the literature and (2) investigate the strength and statistical significance of these correlations across studies. The answers to these questions could potentially help identify which objective features have shown most promising results across studies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Web of Sciences, PsychINFO, PubMed, DBLP computer science bibliography, HTA, DARE, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched and supplemented by hand examination of reference lists. The search ended on April 27, 2017, and was limited to studies published between 2007 and 2017. Results: A total of 46 studies were eligible for the review. These studies identified and investigated 85 unique objective behavioral features, covering 17 various sensor data inputs. These features were divided into 7 categories. Several features were found to have statistically significant and consistent correlation directionality with mood assessment (eg, the amount of home stay, sleep duration, and vigorous activity), while others showed directionality discrepancies across the studies (eg, amount of text messages [short message service] sent, time spent between locations, and frequency of mobile phone screen activity). Conclusions: Several studies showed consistent and statistically significant correlations between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms. Hence, continuous and everyday monitoring of behavioral aspects in affective disorders could be a promising supplementary objective measure for estimating depressive mood symptoms. However, the evidence is limited by methodological issues in individual studies and by a lack of standardization of (1) the collected objective features, (2) the mood assessment methodology, and (3) the statistical methods applied. Therefore, consistency in data collection and analysis in future studies is needed, making replication studies as well as meta-analyses possible.},

  abstract = {Mit  dem zweiten Pflegest{\"a}rkungsgesetz (PSG  II) hat  der  Bundesgesetzgeber  die  Vertragsparteien nach  {\S}113  SGB  XI  beauftragt,  im  Einvernehmen  mit  dem  Bundesministerium  f{\"u}r  Gesundheit  und dem  Bundesministerium  f{\"u}r  Familie,  Senioren,  Frauen  und  Jugend  die  Entwicklung  und  Erprobung eines  wissenschaftlich  fundierten  Verfahrens  zur  einheitlichen  Bemessung  des  Personalbedarfs  in Pflegeeinrichtungen nach qualitativen und quantitativen Ma{\ss}st{\"a}ben sicherzustellen. Die Entwicklung und Erprobung ist bis zum 30.  Juni 2020 abzuschlie{\ss}en. Nach  der  Vorgabe  des  Gesetzgebers  ist  ein strukturiertes,  empirisch  abgesichertes  und  valides  Verfahren  f{\"u}r  die  Personalbemessung  in  Pflege-einrichtungen  auf  der  Basis  des  durchschnittlichen  Versorgungsaufwands  f{\"u}r  direkte  und  indirekte pflegerische Ma{\ss}nahmen sowie f{\"u}r Hilfen bei der Haushaltsf{\"u}hrung unter Ber{\"u}cksichtigung der fachlichen Ziele  und Konzeption des  neuen Pflegebed{\"u}rftigkeitsbegriffs  zu erstellen.  Hierzu sind einheitliche Ma{\ss}st{\"a}be zu ermitteln, die insbesondere Qualifikationsanforderungen, quantitative Bedarfe und die fachliche Angemessenheit der Ma{\ss}nahmen ber{\"u}cksichtigen. Der Auftrag f{\"u}r die Entwicklung und Erprobung wurde an die Universit{\"a}t Bremen vergeben. Nach dem mit den Auftraggebern abgestimmten  Projektzeitplan sind  beide  Projektteilefristgerecht  mit  Vorlage  des  nachfolgenden Ab-schlussberichts abgeschlossen worden. Zur Bestimmung fachlich angemessener Personalmengen und -strukturen im voll- und teilstation{\"a}ren Sektor  war  ein analytischer  Zugang zwingend,  bei  dem  festgelegt  wird,  welche  Pflegepersonal-mengen  in  welchem  Qualifikationsmix  f{\"u}r  eine  fachgerechte  Leistungserbringung  notwendig  sind. Um derartige SOLL-Zahlen zu ermitteln,  wurden die  drei  Dimensionen der  Leistungserbringung -- die fachlich angemessene Zahl  der  Interventionen  pro pflegebed{\"u}rftiger  Person,  die fachlich  angemessene Zeit  pro  Interventionserbringung  f{\"u}r  den  entsprechenden  Bewohner bzw.  die entsprechende Bewohnerin und  das fachlich  angemessene Qualifikationsniveau  der  leistungserbringenden  Person f{\"u}r diese Intervention --analytisch unterschieden. Die Projektkonzeption sah dabei vor, jeweils interventionsbezogen das IST zu messen und simultan zu pr{\"u}fen, inwieweit f{\"u}r eine fachlich angemessene Versorgung auf Grundlage des Pflegeverst{\"a}ndnisses des neuen  Pflegebed{\"u}rftigkeitsbegriffshierbei Zu- oder Abschl{\"a}ge (bei Mengen, Zeit und/oder Qualifikationsniveau) notwendig sind. Diese Zu- und Abschl{\"a}ge wurden  als Deltabezeichnet  und  dazu  verwendet,  durch  Addition  mit  den  gemessenen IST-Werten die SOLL-Werte einer fachlich angemessenen Versorgung zu konstruieren. F{\"u}r jede dieser Interventionen wurden daher fachlich gesetzte Teilschritte und Anforderungen sowie Qualifikations-anforderungen festgelegt, bei denen f{\"u}r jede*n Pflegebed{\"u}rftige*n eine Individualisierung in Abh{\"a}ngigkeit  von  der  im  Rahmen  des  Begutachtungsinstrumentes  abgebildeten  Art  und  dem  Ausma{\ss}  der Pflegebed{\"u}rftigkeit  erfolgte.  Je  nach  individuellem  Begutachtungsergebnis  wurden  also  f{\"u}r  jede*n Pflegebed{\"u}rftige*n  entsprechend  differenzierte  Notwendigkeiten  einer  fachgerechten  Leistungserbringung  definiert. Die  Datenerhebung  erfolgte  durch 241  speziell auf  die konsentierten Erhebungs-instrumente geschulte Pflegefachpersonen in einer ,,Beschattung``, also einer eins-zu-eins-Zuordnung zwischen  den  leistungserbringenden  Pflegekr{\"a}ften  der  Einrichtungen  und  den  Datenerhebenden. Von April bis Oktober 2018 wurden Datenerfassungen in insgesamt 62vollstation{\"a}ren Erhebungseinheiten und  7  teilstation{\"a}ren  Einrichtungen unter  der  Beteiligung  von insgesamt  1.380Bewoh-ner*innen und 163Tagespflegeg{\"a}sten durchgef{\"u}hrt. Ein  wesentlicher Aspekt  bei  der  Entwicklung  der  SOLL-Werte  war  die  vom  Gesetzgeber  gew{\"u}nschte Ber{\"u}cksichtigung der fachlichen Ziele und Konzeption des neuen Pflegebed{\"u}rftigkeitsbegriffs, um die Umsetzung  in  der  Praxis  weiter  zu  bef{\"o}rdern. Ein  zus{\"a}tzlicher  Schwerpunkt  der  Datenerhebung wurde  deshalb  auf  die  doppelte  Betrachtung  von Interaktionsarbeit gelegt.  Einerseits  wurden  die Teile der Interaktionsarbeit, die innerhalb der direkten Pflegeinterventionen regelm{\"a}{\ss}ig fachlich notwendiger  Teil  der Leistungserbringung  sind,  in  die  Formulierung  der  interventionsspezifischen  Teil-schritte  und  Anforderungen  aufgenommen.  Von  den  Datenerhebenden konnte  also  bei  jeder  Leistungserbringung  die  Bedarfsgerechtigkeit  der  Interaktionsarbeit  mitbewertet  werden. Andererseits wurde  als  eigener  Studienteil  eine  Beobachtungs- und  Interviewstudie  durchgef{\"u}hrt,  in  der  alle  Aspekte  der  Interaktionsarbeit --somit  auch  die  in  Interventionen  nicht  zu  beobachtenden  Teile wie Selbstreflexion und Bew{\"a}ltigung --erforscht wurden. Damit wurde dem Gesetzgeber gefolgt, der klargestellt  hat, dass  es  nicht  das  Ziel  ist,  die  Leistungserbringung  unter  den  gegenw{\"a}rtigen  Rahmenbedingungen fortzuschreiben, sondern dass das Personalbemessungsverfahren bereits fachliche Entwicklungen in der Pflege ber{\"u}cksichtigen soll, die in der  gegenw{\"a}rtigen Praxis noch nicht umfassend gelebt werden (k{\"o}nnen). Dieser Ansatz f{\"u}hrt dazu, dass ein deutlich h{\"o}herer Personalbedarf ermittelt wird als es bei  einer  klassischen Aufwandsstudie  der  Fall w{\"a}re.  Denn mit  dem  Personalbemessungs-verfahren wird zugleich die ,,Pflege der Zukunft`` beschrieben. Gleichzeitig ist zu ber{\"u}cksichtigen, dass die Aufwandserfassung  in  der  gegenw{\"a}rtigen  Praxis erfolgt  und deren  Fortschreibung  in  die  Zukunft auch die  Fortschreibung bestehender Organisationsstrukturen  und ggf. bestehender Ineffizienzen in der indirekten Pflege impliziert. Diese beiden Aspekte sollten als Kernpunkte bei der Konzeption und Umsetzung  einer modellhaften Einf{\"u}hrung ber{\"u}cksichtigt  werden,  so  dass  im Rahmen  der modell-haften Einf{\"u}hrung sichergestellt werden kann,  dass  die  mit dem Pflegebed{\"u}rftigkeitsbegriff  initiierte fachliche Entwicklung fortschreitet und eine hierauf bezogene Arbeits- und Organisationsentwicklung so stattfindet,  dass bestehende Ineffizienzen  in  der  Versorgung,  in  den  betrieblichen  Abl{\"a}ufen  und beim Personaleinsatz reduziert werden. Als Ergebnis des Projektes wird f{\"u}r den vollstation{\"a}ren und teilstation{\"a}ren Sektor ein Personalbemessungsinstrument vorgelegt, mit  dem  die fachlich  angemessene Personalmenge  f{\"u}r  die  Bewohnerschaft  einer  Einrichtung  nach  Qualifikationsniveaus  differenziert  ausgewiesen  wird. F{\"u}r den  voll-station{\"a}ren Sektor wird der zuk{\"u}nftige Einsatz des Instrumentes wissenschaftlich empfohlen. F{\"u}r den teilstation{\"a}ren Sektor wird weiterer Forschungsbedarf festgestellt, der vor allem darin begr{\"u}ndet ist, dass  in  diesem  Leistungsbereich  die  Leistungsdefinition  und -abgrenzung zurzeit wesentlich  dynamischer ist. Es wird daher empfohlen die Einf{\"u}hrung im teilstation{\"a}ren Sektor zur{\"u}ckzustellen. Die  Berechnung  erfolgt  unter  Einsatz  eines als  Algorithmus  1.0  bezeichneten mathematischen  Modells, dessen Parametrisierung auf Basis der empirisch erhobenen fachgerechten SOLL-Werte erfolgt ist. Im Algorithmus wird die bisher f{\"u}r alle Einrichtungen geltende einheitliche Fachkraftquote durch einrichtungsindividuelle  Personalmengen  und -mixe  ersetzt. M{\"o}glich  ist  dabei  sowohl  eine  Berechnung nach Pflegegraden als auch nach anderen Klassierungen von Pflegebed{\"u}rftigen. Die Pflegegradeweisen dabei eine so hohe Voraussagekraft (Pr{\"a}diktionskraft)in Bezug auf die fachlich angemessene Personalmenge  auf,  dass  eine  differenziertere  Klassierung  nicht  zu  nennenswert  besseren  Vorher-sagen f{\"u}hrt. Es  wird daher  empfohlen,  f{\"u}r  den Praxiseinsatz  auf  eine  Klassierung  nach Pflegegraden zur{\"u}ckzugreifen. Die  Ergebnisse zeigen --im  Verh{\"a}ltnis  zur  heutigen  Personalausstattung  der  Pflegeeinrichtungen --durchgehend Pflegepersonalmehrbedarfe. Diese  Personalmehrbedarfe  sind dabei  einrichtungsindividuell abh{\"a}ngig vom Bewohnermix und der Ausgangspersonalausstattung. Nach Qualifikationsniveaus differenziert  entstehen  hier  sehr  unterschiedliche  Effekte: W{\"a}hrend  sich  f{\"u}r  Fachkr{\"a}fte  ein nur geringer durchschnittlicher Personalmehrbedarf zeigt, ist  dieser  f{\"u}r  Assistenzkr{\"a}fte  erheblich. Die st{\"a}rksten Effekte zeigen sich dabei f{\"u}r die Pflegekr{\"a}fte mit ein- oder zweij{\"a}hrigen Ausbildungen nach Landesrecht (QN 3). F{\"u}r den teilstation{\"a}ren Sektor ist der Personalmehrbedarf deutlich geringer aus-gepr{\"a}gt. Die Entwicklung eines mit dem f{\"u}r den station{\"a}ren Bereich methodisch vergleichbaren Personalbemessungsverfahrens  f{\"u}r  ambulante  Pflegeeinrichtungen  ist  in  dieser  Form  nicht  m{\"o}glich,  da sich Art und Ausma{\ss} der Hilfen vor allem danach richten, welche Hilfen in einem Pflegehaushalt von diesem f{\"u}r  wichtig  und  relevant  erachtet  werden und nicht  notwendigerweise  nach  einem  objektiv feststellbaren Bedarf. Von  wissenschaftlicher  Seite  wurde  bereits  mit  dem  zweiten  Zwischenbericht  empfohlen, eine  modellhafte Einf{\"u}hrung des Algorithmus 1.0 unter Realbedingungendurchzuf{\"u}hren, die von einer Organisations- und  Personalentwicklung  begleitet  wird,  um  die  durch  die  Personalmehrung  erm{\"o}glichte Entlastung  der  Pflegepersonen  und  Qualit{\"a}tssteigerung  f{\"u}r  Pflegebed{\"u}rftige  zu  optimieren.  Diese modellhafte Einf{\"u}hrung  des  Algorithmus  sollte --so  die  wissenschaftliche  Empfehlung --mit  einem parallelen stufenweisen Aufwuchs von Stellen insbesondere f{\"u}r Assistenzkr{\"a}fte f{\"u}r alle Pflegeeinrichtungen  verbunden  werden.  Beide Schritte  wurden im  Rahmen  der  sich  an  die  Entwicklung  an-schlie{\ss}enden Erprobungsphase bereits auf ihre Umsetzbarkeit hin konzeptionell {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. In der konzeptionellen Erprobung teilten die  befragten  Expert*innen {\"u}berwiegend die Einsch{\"a}tzung, dass  das  Konzept  des  Personalbemessungsinstrumentes  sinnvoll  in  Bezug  auf  eine  bedarfsgerechte Personalausstattung umsetzbar ist. Je nach fachlicher Perspektive wurde dabei eine Vielzahl von Anforderungen an  die  Einf{\"u}hrung  benannt,  die entweder  zu einer  effizienten  Umsetzung  oder  zu einer Verfeinerung  des  Bemessungsverfahrens  als  erforderlich angesehen  werden.  Den  Erprobungsergebnissen  folgend  ist  die Umsetzung  der  empfohlenen Einf{\"u}hrungsphase somit  sowohl  zur  Definition und  Schaffung  von  Rahmenbedingungen  des  Personaleinsatzes geeignet,  als  auch zur  Generierung weiterer Erkenntnisse, die eine zuk{\"u}nftige Verfeinerung und Aktualisierung des Personalbemessungs-instrumentes erm{\"o}glichen. So zeigen die in der Studie mit Hilfe des Algorithmus 1.0 f{\"u}r die teil- und vollstation{\"a}ren Sektoren ermittelten Personalmehrbedarfe den zuk{\"u}nftigen Fach- und Assistenzkr{\"a}ftebedarf unter Annahme unver{\"a}nderter Organisationsstrukturen.  Die Einf{\"u}hrung des  Personalbemessungsverfahrens entsprechend der wissenschaftlichen Empfehlungen kann im Rahmen einer modellhaften Einf{\"u}hrung weitere Erkenntnisse  dazu  liefern,  wie  die  pflegerische  Langzeitversorgung  der  Zukunft  aussehen  soll  und kann zu Weiterentwicklungen und ggf. Verfeinerungen des Algorithmus f{\"u}hren. Dabei k{\"o}nnen insbesondere zwei Erg{\"a}nzungen realisiert werden, die bisher Limitationen der Studie darstellen: m{\"o}gliche Effizienzgewinne  in  der  indirekten  Pflege aufgrund  der  dann  ver{\"a}nderten  Organisationsstrukturen sowie weitere fachlich erg{\"a}nzende Faktoren, die sich insbesondere durch eine fortschreitende Ausgestaltung  des  neuen  Pflegeverst{\"a}ndnisses  ergeben. Ma{\ss}st{\"a}be f{\"u}r  eine Weiterentwicklung  des  Algorithmus  sind  dabei  eine  qualitativ  angemessene  Versorgung  und  ein  ad{\"a}quater  Personaleinsatz  im Rahmen  einer  mitarbeiterorientiert  gestalteten,  effizienten  Betriebsorganisation  bei  der  die  Pflege-kr{\"a}fte kompetenzorientiert eingesetzt werden. Bei der Frage nach der Deckung des zuk{\"u}nftigen Personalbedarfs sind auch die Entwicklungen in an-deren Bereichen, die Einfluss auf die tats{\"a}chliche Personalverf{\"u}gbarkeit und die Attraktivit{\"a}t des Berufsbildes  haben,  zu ber{\"u}cksichtigen. Hier  sind insbesondere  die  Ma{\ss}nahmen  der Konzertierten  Aktion  Pflege  zu  nennen,  die  sich  in  ihren  Wirkungen  gegenw{\"a}rtig  noch  schwer  quantifizieren  lassen, die  aber  ein  gro{\ss}es  Potential  f{\"u}r  die  Verbesserung  der  Arbeits- und  Ausbildungsbedingungen  und aufgrund  dessen  f{\"u}r  ein  h{\"o}heres  Arbeitskr{\"a}fteangebot bieten, sowie Produktivit{\"a}tsfortschritte z.B. durch Ma{\ss}nahmen der Digitalisierung.},

  abstract = {Context Few remote care technologies have been able to integrate clinical routines in the health sector, one of the reasons is the non-acceptance of these technologies by end-users who are health professionals. Objective Identify from a review of the literature the research that has studied the acceptance behavior of remote care technologies by health professionals and that has used technology acceptance model (TAM) and Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical framework. Methods An electronic search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases during the period between May and June 2021. The articles were identified using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All search results have been exported to an Excel file. Next, the titles and abstracts of the publications were assessed by two independent reviewers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select relevant studies from those found in the database, Any conflict in decision-making during the selection phase was resolved by discussion among reviewers or, if necessary, with the research coordinator until consensus was reached. Results Of 531 potentially relevant titles (duplicates excluded), 32 studies were included in this systematic review. These studies did not test a single model, there was a variety of models tested, 7 studies tested the original TAM model and 6 tested the original UTAUT model. While 13 studies tested an extension of TAM (or modified TAM) and 6 tested an extension of UTAUT (or modified UTAUT). There are studies on a wide variety of remote health care applications in the articles included in this systematic review. In the majority of cases (21 studies 66\%), the authors did not specify the type of application they studied, i.e. they used generic terms such as eHealth, mHealth, Telehealth, or telemedicine. Conclusions The main finding of this review shows that these two models TAM and UTAUT are still valid and used to predict the acceptance behavior of remote care technologies by health professionals, even if they date back several years and even if they were not originally formulated to be used in the context of remote care technologies.},

Our main result is that the Pepper robot is capable of administering the MMSE and that cognitive status is not a determinant in the effective use of a social robot. People with mild cognitive impairment appreciate the robot, as it interacts with them. Acceptability does not relate strictly to the user experience, but the willingness to interact with the robot is an important variable for engagement. We demonstrate the feasibility of a novel approach that, in the future, could lead to more natural human--machine interaction when delivering cognitive tests with the aid of a social robot and a Computational Psychophysiology Module (CPM).},

  abstract = {Background:~           Higher cardiovascular mortality in winter may be partly explained by increased blood pressure (BP) because of cold exposure. However, this winter excess mortality is higher in countries with moderate winter than those with severe winter climate.           Objectives:~           Although higher BP in low outdoor temperatures has been reported, the magnitude of association of indoor temperature with ambulatory BP remained unclear. We aimed to compare the associations of indoor and outdoor temperature with ambulatory BP.           Methods:~           From repeated measurements on two consecutive days during colder months (October--April) among 868 elderly individuals, we assessed the association of indoor and outdoor temperatures with ambulatory BP using multilevel analysis with random intercept for each individual.           Results:~           Correlation between indoor and outdoor temperature got weak along with decreasing outdoor temperature. Outdoor temperature was not significantly associated with ambulatory BP. In contrast, a 1{$^\circ$}C lower indoor temperature was significantly associated with 0.22 mmHg higher daytime SBP, 0.18\% higher nocturnal BP fall, 0.34 mmHg higher sleep-trough morning BP surge independent of potential confounders including physical activity. The models with indoor temperature showed better fit of the model than those with outdoor temperature. Night-time SBP did not show significant association with indoor and outdoor temperature but with bed temperature.           Discussion:~           Our results suggest the importance to assess the association of indoor temperature with cardiovascular mortality to determine whether improving housing thermal environment reduces winter excess mortality.           Conclusion:~           Indoor temperature showed stronger association than outdoor temperature with BP in colder months.},

  abstract = {The growing populations around the world are closely associated with rising levels of air pollution. The impact is not restricted to outdoor areas. Moreover, the health of building occupants is also deteriorating due to poor indoor air quality. As per the World Health Organization, indoor air pollution is a leading cause of 1.6 million premature deaths annually. Therefore, numerous companies have started the development of low-cost sensors to monitor indoor air pollution with the Internet of Things--based applications. However, due to the close association of air pollution levels to the mortality and morbidity rates, communities face several limitations while selecting sensors to address this public health challenge. The main contribution of this systematic review is to present a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of low-cost sensors while providing deep insights into the selection criteria for adequate monitoring. The authors in this paper discussed studies published after the year 2015, and it includes an analysis of papers published in the English language only. Moreover, this study highlights crucial research questions, states answers, and provides recommendations for future research studies. The outcomes of this paper will be useful for students, researchers, and industry members concerning the upcoming research and manufacturing activities. The results show that 28 studies (70\%) include indoor thermal comfort assessment, 26 (65\%) and 12 (30\%) studies include CO2 and CO sensors, respectively. In total, 32 (45.7\%) out of 71 sensors (whose prices are available) discussed in this study are available in a price below the US \$20 over online marketplaces. Furthermore, the authors conclude that 77.5\% of the analyzed literature does not include calibration details, and the accuracy specification is missing for 39.4\% sensors.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Background  : With the remarkable increasing in the numbers of patients, the triaging and prioritizing patients into multi-emergency level is required to accommodate all the patients, save more lives, and manage the medical resources effectively. Triaging and prioritizing patients becomes particularly challenging especially for the patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system. To this end, the researchers exploiting the useful tool of machine learning to address this challenge. Hence, carrying out an intensive investigation and in-depth study in the field of using machine learning in E-triage and patient priority are essential and required.    Objectives  : This research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the roles of machine learning in the fields of electronic emergency triage (E-triage) and prioritize patients for fast healthcare services in telemedicine applications. (2) highlight the effectiveness of machine learning methods in terms of algorithms, medical input data, output results, and machine learning goals in remote healthcare telemedicine systems. (3) present the relationship between machine learning goals and the electronic triage processes specifically on the: triage levels, medical features for input, outcome results as outputs, and the relevant diseases. (4), the outcomes of our analyses are subjected to organize and propose a cross-over taxonomy between machine learning algorithms and telemedicine structure. (5) present lists of motivations, open research challenges and recommendations for future intelligent work for both academic and industrial sectors in telemedicine and remote healthcare applications.    Methods  : An intensive research is carried out by reviewing all articles related to the field of E-triage and remote priority systems that utilise machine learning algorithms and sensors. We have searched all related keywords to investigate the databases of ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline for the articles, which have been published from January 2012 up to date.    Results  : A new crossover matching between machine learning methods and telemedicine taxonomy is proposed. The crossover-taxonomy is developed in this study to identify the relationship between machine learning algorithm and the equivalent telemedicine categories whereas the machine learning algorithm has been utilized. The impact of utilizing machine learning is composed in proposing the telemedicine architecture based on synchronous (real-time/ online) and asynchronous (store-and-forward / offline) structure. In addition to that, list of machine learning algorithms, list of the performance metrics, list of inputs data and outputs results are presented. Moreover, open research challenges, the benefits of utilizing machine learning and the recommendations for new research opportunities that need to be addressed for the synergistic integration of multidisciplinary works are organized and presented accordingly.    Discussion  : The state-of-the-art studies on the E-triage and priority systems that utilise machine learning algorithms in telemedicine architecture are discussed. This approach allows the researchers to understand the modernisation of healthcare systems and the efficient use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In particular, the growing worldwide population and various chronic diseases such as heart chronic diseases, blood pressure and diabetes, require smart health monitoring systems in E-triage and priority systems, in which machine learning algorithms could be greatly beneficial.    Conclusions  : Although research directions on E-triage and priority systems that use machine learning algorithms in telemedicine vary, they are equally essential and should be considered. Hence, we provide a comprehensive review to emphasise the advantages of the existing research in multidisciplinary works of artificial intelligence, machine learning and healthcare services.},

The proportion of the population aged {$\geq$}65 years is expected to peak at 25\% of the total population around 2050 (1-4). Most elderly people live at home. However, aging involves decreased mobility, decreased strength and stamina, and reduced sensory acuity. Frailty develops as a consequence of age-related decline in many physiological parameters leading to increased risk of falls, progressive disability, need for long-term care and increased mortality. Frailty diagnosis is mainly based on grip strength, walking speed (gait speed), clinical frailty scales, self-reported exhaustion, low physical activity and non-intentional weight loss. All these parameters can be measured by existing devices and may be used to monitor health status and indicators of frailty. Monitoring of these parameters is used to get preventive as well as emergency information. The goal is to maintain a good health status, to prevent frailty, to improve quality of life, to increase safety and to avoid false alarms. The advantages of collecting longitudinal data about people's physiological, physical, psychological, cognitive and behavioral data combined with the recent availability of technologies to enable such data collection, have led to important research act...},

There is an inherent need to reduce the number of TOPICS-MDS survey items to core outcomes to allow it to be more easily applied as a patient-reported outcome measure in clinical settings. Objectives To create a TOPICS-short form (TOPICS-SF) and examine its validity. Methods Data in the TOPICS-MDS from persons aged 65 years and older in the Netherlands were used for the following analyses. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to select the items and to derive domain weights of TOPICS-SF. A priori hypotheses were made on the basis of psychometric properties of the full-length TOPICS-MDS preference-weighted score (TOPICS-CEP). The validity of TOPICS-SF was evaluated by 1) examining the meta-correlation of the TOPICS-SF score with TOPICS-CEP and two quality-of-life measures, that is, the Cantril Ladder score and the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire utility index, and 2) performing mixed multiple regression of TOPICS-SF scores across key sociodemographic characteristics. Results TOPICS-SF scores were strongly correlated with the TOPICS-CEP (r = 0.96) and had stronger correlation with the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire utility index compared with the Cantril Ladder (r = 0.61 and 0.38, respectively). TOPICS-SF scores were higher among older persons who were married, living independently, and having higher levels of education. Conclusions We have developed the 22-item TOPICS-SF and demonstrated its validity, supporting its use as a patient-reported outcome measure in geriatric care.},

While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.},

  abstract = {Learning to use information and communication technologies (ICT) may be more difficult for older people due to decreases in fluid intelligence, generational effects, and other age-related effects. Especially older people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are at a high risk of digital exclusion. To enable all older adults to use ICT, individualized technology training may be provided. However, little is known about the ICT learning preferences among older people with ID. Based on semi-structured interviews with older adults (n = 7, mean age = 76.6 years) and older adults with ID (n = 14, mean age = 62.4 years), this paper analyzes learning strategies, preferences, and learning settings. The results from content analysis show that guided learning with personal explanations in a one-to-one setting is the most preferred learning format in both groups of older adults. While many older adults without ID additionally favor self-regulated learning (i.e., learning with manuals or videos), older adults with ID mostly rely on guided learning with personal assistance. The differences can be explained by different abilities (e.g., reading skills) and social networks (e.g., living situation, having children). Not all older adults have a family or an institutional support network to help them learn ICT and community organizations may provide additional support. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the diverse knowledge backgrounds and competencies in the group of older adults. ICT training in old age should be ideally composed in a modular way embedding self-regulated learning formats into guided learning modules.},

In this paper, we describe the development and first validation studies of a modular framework that allows the creation of user experience questionnaires that fit perfectly to a given research question. The framework contains several scales that measure different UX aspects. These scales can be combined to cover the relevant research questions.},

They also discuss the newly created classification of character strengths and virtues, a positive complement to the various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (e. g., American Psychiatric Association, 1994), and present some cross-cultural findings that suggest a surprising ubiquity of strengths and virtues. Finally, the authors focus on psychological interventions that increase individual happiness. In a 6-group, random-assignment, placebo-controlled Internet study, the authors tested 5 purported happiness interventions and 1 plausible control exercise. They found that 3 of the interventions lastingly increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms. Positive interventions can supplement traditional interventions that relieve suffering and may someday be the practical legacy of positive psychology.

  abstract = {Biosensing and microfluidics technologies are transforming diagnostic medicine by accurately detecting biomolecules in biological samples. Urine is a promising biological fluid for diagnostics due to its noninvasive collection and wide range of diagnostic biomarkers. Point-of-care urinalysis, which integrates biosensing and microfluidics, has the potential to bring affordable and rapid diagnostics into the home to continuing monitoring, but challenges still remain. As such, this review aims to provide an overview of biomarkers that are or could be used to diagnose and monitor diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the different materials and techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic structures along with the biosensing technologies often used to detect and quantify biological molecules and organisms are reviewed. Ultimately, this review discusses the current state of point-of-care urinalysis devices and highlights the potential of these technologies to improve patient outcomes. Traditional point-of-care urinalysis devices require the manual collection of urine, which may be unpleasant, cumbersome, or prone to errors. To overcome this issue, the toilet itself can be used as an alternative specimen collection and urinalysis device. This review then presents several smart toilet systems and incorporated sanitary devices for this purpose.},

Another fact is the use of various technologies to increase the effectiveness and quality of health services across all primary and secondary users. These technologies range from telemedicine systems, decision making tools, online and self-services applications and virtual agents; all providing information and assistance. The common thread between all these digital implementations, is they all require human machine interfaces. These interfaces must be interactive, user friendly and inviting, to create user involvement and cooperation incentives. The challenge is to design interfaces which will best fit the target users and enable smooth interaction especially, for the elderly users. Avatars and Virtual Agents are one of the interfaces used for both home care monitoring and companionship. They are also inherently multimodal in nature and allow an intimate relation between the elderly users and the Avatar. This study discusses the need and nature of these relationship models, the challenges of designing for the elderly. The study proposes key features for the design and evaluation in the area of assistive applications using Avatar and Virtual agents for the elderly users.},

A systematic review of various sensors and systems for AQ management may strengthen our understanding of the monitoring and management of AQ. Thus, the current review presents details on sensors/systems available for AQ assessment, monitoring, and management. First, we had gone through the published literature based on special keywords including AQM, Particulate Matter (PM), Carbon Mono-oxide (CO), Sulfur di-Oxide (SO2), and Nitrogen di-Oxide (NO2) among others, and identified the current scenario of research in AQ management. We discussed various sensors/systems available for the AQ management based on self-conceptualised five major categories including, ground-based AQS (wet chemistry) systems, ground-based digital sensors systems, aerial sensors systems, satellite-based sensors systems, and integrated systems. The prospects in the field of AQ assessment and management (AQA\&M) were then discussed in detail. We concluded that the AQA\&M can be better achieved by coupling new technologies like ground-based smart sensors, satellite remote sensing sensors, Geospatial technologies, and computational technologies like machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT). The current work may lead to a junction of information for connecting these sensors/systems, which is expected to be beneficial in future AQ research and management.},

  abstract = {Social robots, understood as the category of embodied robots extending into social domains through reciprocal social interaction, are still a practical novelty in most of these domains today. However, the phenomenon of novelty effects is only eclectically and peripherally addressed within most research into social human-robot interaction, and even when treated more extensively, it is usually framed as a source of noise in need of reduction. In this paper, I will argue a reframing of novelty effects that posits the phenomenon as a valuable source of information. In the first part of the paper, I present a tentative account of what I call experiential novelty in order to illustrate (1) that novelty should be understood as an `original feature of experience', (2) that novelty arises in the engagement between an experiencer and an experience where the experiencer's possessed knowledge is inadequate in making sense of the experience, and (3) that novelty effects should be seen as cognitive and behavioural expressions of a `search for meaning'. In the latter part of the paper, I discuss some of the current research lines within social human-robot interaction research from the perspective of this account of novelty. Most notably, I argue that retrospectively, the account holds explanatory utility in analyzing many of the findings in this research-field, and prospectively, the account holds generative utility in pointing to new ways in which participant experiences of novelty may be employed in research.},

The purpose of this paper is to describe the needs and opportunities embedded in the assistive product lifecycle as well as issues relating to the various stages of assistive product mobilization worldwide.The paper discusses assistive technology product terminology and the dangers of focusing on products outside the context and rolling out products without a plan. Additionally, the paper reviews concepts and issues around technology transfer, particularly in relation to meeting global needs and among countries with limited resources. Several opportunities are highlighted including technology advancement and the world nearing a state of readiness through a developing capacity of nations across the world to successfully adopt and support the assistive technology products and applications.The paper is optimistic about the future of assistive technology products reaching the people that can use it the most and the excitement across large and small nations in increasing their own capacities for implementing assistive technology. This is expressed as hope in future students as they innovate and in modern engineering that will enable assistive technology to pervade all corners of current and potential marketplaces. Importantly, the paper poses numerous topics where discussions are just superficially opened. The hope is that a set of sequels will follow to continue this critical dialog.Implications for RehabilitationSuccessful assistive technology product interventions are complex and include much more than the simple selection of the right product.Assistive technology product use is highly context sensitive in terms of an individual user's environment.The development of assistive technology products is tricky as it must be contextually sensitive to the development environment and market as well.As a field we have much to study and develop around assistive technology product interventions from a global perspective.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveVirtual conversational agents, or chatbots, have emerged as a novel approach to health data collection. However, research on patient perceptions of chatbots in comparison to traditional online forms is sparse. This study aimed to compare and assess the experience of completing a health assessment using a chatbot vs. an online form.MethodsA counterbalanced, within-subject experimental design was used with participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Participants completed a standardized health assessment using a chatbot (i.e., Dokbot) and an online form (i.e., REDCap), each followed by usability and experience questionnaires. To address poor data quality and preserve integrity of mTurk responses, we employed a thorough data cleaning process informed by previous literature. Quantitative (descriptive and inferential statistics) and qualitative (thematic analysis and complex coding query) approaches were used for analysis.ResultsA total of 391 participants were recruited, 185 of whom were excluded, resulting in a final sample size of 206 individuals. Most participants (69.9\%) preferred the chatbot over the online form. Average Net Promoter Score was higher for the chatbot (NPS\,=\,24) than the online form (NPS\,=\,13) at a statistically significant level. System Usability Scale scores were also higher for the chatbot (i.e. 69.7 vs. 67.7), but this difference was not statistically significant. The chatbot took longer to complete but was perceived as conversational, interactive, and intuitive. The online form received favorable comments for its familiar survey-like interface.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that a chatbot provided superior engagement, intuitiveness, and interactivity despite increased completion time compared to online forms. Knowledge of patient preferences and barriers will inform future design and development of recommendations and best practice for chatbots for healthcare data collection.}

We investigate the domestication of robot technology in the context of what in Scandinavia is called ``welfare technology'' (relating to the terms ``gerontechnology'' and ``Active Assisted Living,'') that especially aims to mitigate older adults{\textasciiacute} challenges with living in their own homes. Through our case study, we investigate a system called eWare, where a flowerpot robot called ``Tessa'' works in symbiosis with a sensor technology ``SensaraCare.'' Together, they create a socio-technical ecosystem involving older adult end-users living at home, formal caregivers (e.g. healthcare workers), and informal caregivers (normally family members). We analyze our ethnographic fieldwork through the theoretical concept of ``domestication of technology,'' focusing on an established three-dimensional model that includes practical, symbolic, and cognitive levels of analysis. We found that social bonds and different ways of using the same technology ecosystem were crucial, and so we supplement this model by suggesting a fourth dimension, which we term the social dimension of the domestication of technology.},

In particular virtual body ownership, where the feeling of ownership over a virtual body is elicited in the participant, has become a useful tool in the study of body representation in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, concerning how the brain represents the body. Although VR has been shown to be a useful tool for exploring body ownership illusions, integrating the various technologies necessary for such a system can be daunting. In this paper, we discuss the technical infrastructure necessary to achieve virtual embodiment. We describe a basic VR system and how it may be used for this purpose, and then extend this system with the introduction of real-time motion capture, a simple haptics system and the integration of physiological and brain electrical activity recordings.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: Information and communication technologies are tools that are able to support cognitive functions, monitor health and movements, provide reminders to maintain residual memory abilities, and promote social support, especially among patients with dementia. Among these technologies, embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are seen as screen-based entities designed to stimulate human face-to-face conversation skills, allowing for natural human-machine interaction. Unfortunately, the evidence that such agents deliver care benefits in supporting people affected by dementia and their caregivers has not yet been well studied. Therefore, research in this area is essential for the entire scientific community. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the virtual agent Anne by people living with dementia. The study is also designed to assess the ability of target users to use the system independently and receive valuable information from it. Methods: We conducted a 4-week trial that involved 20 older adults living with dementia and 14 family caregivers in home environment settings in Italy. This study used a mixed methods approach, balancing quantitative and qualitative instruments to gather data from users. Telemetry data were also collected. Results: Older users were particularly engaged in providing significant responses and participating in system improvements. Some of them clearly discussed how technical problems related to speech recognition had a negative impact on the intention to use, adaptiveness, usefulness, and trust. Moreover, the usability of the system achieved an encouraging score, and half of the sample recognized a role of the agent Anne. This study confirms that the quality of automatic speech recognition and synthesis is still a technical issue and has room for improvement, whereas the touch screen modality is almost stable and positively used by patients with dementia. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the ability of target users to use the system independently in their home environment; overall, the involved participants shared good engagement with the system, approaching the virtual agents as a companion able to support memory and enjoyment needs. Therefore, this research provides data that sustain the use of ECAs as future eHealth systems that are able to address the basic and higher-level needs of people living with dementia. This specific field of research is novel and poorly discussed in the scientific community. This could be because of its novelty, yet there is an urgent need to strengthen data, research, and innovation to accelerate the implementation of ECAs as a future method to offer nonpharmacological support to community-dwelling people with dementia.},

Miscommunication was abundant in the data, with some types of repair being more common than others. These were mainly related to "hearing trouble" on the side of the robot, leading to participants' repeats and rephrasings. Interactional trouble was also found to escalate, with multiple repair initiations, sometimes leading to "second best answers". This appeared to be a strategy for participants to avoid repair in the service of progressivity. Overall, miscommunication and repair in these task-oriented human-robot interactions require substantial adaptation from the human.},

Because of their natural interface, virtual agents are promising assistants for people in need of support. To engage people during an interaction with these technologies, such assistants need to match the users{\textasciiacute} needs and preferences, especially with regard to social outcomes. Objective: Prior research has already determined the importance of an agent's appearance in a human-agent interaction. As seniors can particularly benefit from the use of virtual agents to maintain their autonomy, it is important to investigate their special needs. However, there are almost no studies focusing on age-related differences with regard to appearance effects. Methods: A 2{\texttimes}4 between-subjects design was used to investigate the age-related differences of appearance effects in a human-agent interaction. In this study, 46 seniors and 84 students interacted in a health scenario with a virtual agent, whose appearance varied (cartoon-stylized humanoid agent, cartoon-stylized machine-like agent, more realistic humanoid agent, and nonembodied agent [voice only]). After the interaction, participants reported on the evaluation of the agent, usage intention, perceived presence of the agent, bonding toward the agent, and overall evaluation of the interaction. Results: The findings suggested that seniors evaluated the agent more positively (liked the agent more and evaluated it as more realistic, attractive, and sociable) and showed more bonding toward the agent regardless of the appearance than did students. In addition, interaction effects were found. Seniors reported the highest usage intention for the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent, whereas students reported the lowest usage intention for this agent. The same pattern was found for participant bonding with the agent. Seniors showed more bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent or voice only agent, whereas students showed the least bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent. Conclusions: In health-related interactions, target group--related differences exist with regard to a virtual assistant's appearance. When elderly individuals are the target group, a humanoid virtual assistant might trigger specific social responses and be evaluated more positively at least in short-term interactions.},

  abstract = {In this article, we introduce a new information system evaluation method and report on its application to a collaborative information seeking system, AntWorld. The key innovation of the new method is to use precisely the same group of users who work with the system as judges, a system we call Cross-Evaluation. In the new method, we also propose to assess the system at the level of task completion. The obvious potential limitation of this method is that individuals may be inclined to think more highly of the materials that they themselves have found and are almost certain to think more highly of their own work product than they do of the products built by others. The keys to neutralizing this problem are careful design and a corresponding analytical model based on analysis of variance. We model the several measures of task completion with a linear model of five effects, describing the users who interact with the system, the system used to finish the task, the task itself, the behavior of individuals as judges, and the self-judgment bias. Our analytical method successfully isolates the effect of each variable. This approach provides a successful model to make concrete the ``three-realities'' paradigm, which calls for ``real tasks,'' ``real users,'' and ``real systems.''},

Data on the distribution of health literacy in general populations and how health literacy impacts health behavior and general health remains scarce. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of health literacy levels and associations of health literacy with socioeconomic position, health risk behavior, and health status at a population level.                                         Methods               A nationwide cross-sectional survey linked to administrative registry data was applied to a randomly selected sample of 15,728 Danish individuals aged {$\geq$}25\,years. By the short form HLS-EU-Q16 health literacy was measured for the domains of healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of health literacy with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health risk behavior (physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight), and health status (sickness benefits, self-assessed health).                                         Results               Overall, 9007 (57.3\%) individuals responded to the survey. Nearly 4 in 10 respondents faced difficulties in accessing, understanding, appraising, and applying health information. Notably, 8.18\% presented with inadequate health literacy and 30.94\% with problematic health literacy. Adjusted for potential confounders, regression analyses showed that males, younger individuals, immigrants, individuals with basic education or income below the national average, and individuals receiving social benefits had substantially higher odds of inadequate health literacy. Among health behavior factors (smoking, high alcohol consumption, and inactivity), only physical behavior [sedentary: OR: 2.31 (95\% CI: 1.81; 2.95)] was associated with inadequate health literacy in the adjusted models. The long-term health risk indicator body-weight showed that individuals with obesity [OR: 1.78 (95\% CI: 1.39; 2.28)] had significantly higher odds of lower health literacy scores. Poor self-assessed health [OR: 4.03 (95\% CI: 3.26; 5.00)] and payments of sickness absence compensation benefits [OR: 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.35; 2.23)] were associated with lower health literacy scores.                                         Conclusions               Despite a relatively highly educated population, the prevalence of inadequate health literacy is high. Inadequate health literacy is strongly associated with a low socioeconomic position, poor health status, inactivity, and overweight, but to a lesser extent with health behavior factors such as smoking and high alcohol consumption.},

Individuals can customize the level of detail in the information they view. Health Agents ``speak'' natural language to humans and formal language to the computational infrastructure, possibly outputting the mathematics of personalized homeostatic health as part of their reinforcement learning agent behavior. As an AI health interface, the agent facilitates the management of precision medicine as a service. Healthy longevity is a high-profile area characterized by the increasing acceptance of medical intervention, longevity biotech venture capital investment, and global priority as 2 billion people will be over 65 in 2050. Aging hallmarks, biomarkers, and clocks provide a quantitative measure for intervention. Some of the leading interventions include metformin, rapamycin, spermidine, NAD+/sirtuins, alpha-ketoglutarate, and taurine. AI-driven digital biology, longevity medicine, and Web3 personalized healthcare come together in the idea of Health Agents. This Web3 genAI tool for automated health management, specifically via digital-biological twins and pathway2vec approaches, demonstrates human-AI intelligence amplification and works towards healthy longevity for global well-being.},

Worldwide, around 3.2 million deaths per year are being attributed to inactivity. In industrialised countries where people are living longer lives, the levels of chronic health conditions are increasing and the levels of physical activity are declining. Key factors in improving health are exercising at a moderate-to-vigorous level for at least 5\>days per week and including both aerobic and strengthening exercises. Few older adults achieve the level of physical activity or exercise that accompanies health improvements. A challenge for health professionals is to increase physical activity and exercise participation in older adults. Some success in this has been reported when physicians have given specific, detailed and localised information to their patients, but more high quality research is needed to continue to address this issue of non-participation in physical activity and exercise of a high enough level to ensure health benefits.},

They have the potential advantages of objectivity and sensitivity of measurement, richness of high-frequency sensor data, and opportunity for passive collection of health-related data. Thus, DHTTs promise to provide patient phenotyping at an order of granularity several times greater than is possible with traditional clinical research tools. While the conceptual development of novel DHTTs is keeping pace with technological and analytical advancements, an as yet unaddressed gap is how to develop robust and meaningful outcome measures based on sensor data. Here, we describe two roadmaps which were developed to generate outcome measures based on DHTT data: one using a data-centric approach and the second a patient-centric approach. The data-centric approach to develop digital outcome measures summarizes those sensor features maximally sensitive to the concept of interest, exemplified with the quantification of disease progression. The patient-centric approach summarizes those sensor features that are optimally relevant to patients' functioning in everyday life. Both roadmaps are exemplified for use in tracking disease progression in observational and clinical interventional studies, and with a DHTT designed to evaluate motor symptom severity and symptom experience in Parkinson's disease. Use cases other than disease progression (e.g., case-finding) are considered summarily. DHTT research requires methods to summarize sensor data into meaningful outcome measures. It is hoped that the concepts outlined here will encourage a scientific discourse and eventual consensus on the creation of novel digital outcome measures for both basic clinical research and clinical drug development.},

Objective                This is one of the first studies that investigates how the appearance of an ECA implemented within a health app affects users' likeliness of following agent advice, their perception of agent characteristics, and their feeling of rapport. In addition, we assessed usability and intention to use.                                            Methods                The ECA was implemented within a frailty assessment app in which three health questionnaires were translated into agent dialogues. In a within-subject experiment, questionnaire dialogues were randomly offered by a young female agent or an older male agent. Participants were asked to think aloud during interaction. Afterward, they rated the likeliness of following the agent's advice, agent characteristics, rapport, usability, and intention to use and participated in a semistructured interview.                                            Results                A total of 20 older adults (72.2 [SD 3.5] years) participated. The older male agent was perceived as more authoritative than the young female agent (P=.03), but no other differences were found. The app scored high on usability (median 6.1) and intention to use (median 6.0).

The aim of this research is to investigate which design features establish a positive first impression of an agent in this context. A set of eight static agent images, different in age, gender and role, were subjected to testing in an online questionnaire. Respondents (n~=~155) selected their preferred design and rated the characteristics -- friendliness, expertise, reliability, involvement and authority -- and the likeliness of following the agent's advice for all designs. In addition, focus groups (n~=~13) were conducted for detailed understandings supporting these impressions. Our results show that, for both a general and elderly population, (1) people seem to prefer images of young, female agents over old, male agents, (2) the (a) age, (b) gender and (c) role of the agent image affect the perception of the agent's characteristics and the likeliness of following the agent's advice, and that (3) both the general and elderly population prefer an agent image that is similar in (a) age and (b) gender. A next step would be to investigate how the characteristics of the agent designs are perceived after interaction with the agent.},

In this literature review, we identify the researched design features for ECAs in eHealth, the outcome variables that were used to measure the effect of these design features and what the found effects for each variable were. Searches were performed in Scopus, ACM Digital Library, PsychINFO, Pubmed and IEEE Xplore Digital Library, resulting in 1284 identified articles of which 33 articles were included. The agents speech and/or textual output and its facial and gaze expressions were the most common design features. Little research was performed on the agent's looks. The measured effect of these design features was often on the perception of the agent's and user's characteristics, relation with the agent, system usage, intention to use, usability and behaviour change. Results show that emotion and relational behaviour seem to positively affect the perception of the agents characteristics and that relational behaviour also seems to positively affect the relation with the agent, usability and intention to use. However, these design features do not necessarily lead to behaviour change. This review showed that consensus on design features of ECAs in eHealth is far from established. Follow-up research should include more research on the effects of all design features, especially research on the effects in a long-term, daily life setting, and replication of studies on the effects of design features performed in other contexts than eHealth.},

Objective               This is an exploratory, long-term study on the design of ECAs for eHealth. The study investigates how patients perceive the design of the ECA over time with regard to the ECA's characteristics (friendliness, trustworthiness, involvement, expertise, and authority), small talk interaction, and likeliness of following the agent's advice.                                         Methods               We developed an ECA within an eHealth self-management intervention for patients with both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF), which we offered for 4 months. Patients rated 5 agent characteristics and likeliness of following the agent's advice before use and after 3 and 9 weeks of use. The amount of patients' small talk interaction was assessed by log data. Lastly, individual semistructured interviews were used to triangulate results.                                         Results               Eleven patients (7 male and 4 female) with COPD and CHF participated (median age 70 years). Patients' perceptions of the agent characteristics did not change over time (P{$>$}.05 for all characteristics) and only 1 participant finished all small talk dialogues. After 3 weeks of use, the patients were less likely to follow the agent's advice (P=.01). The agent's messages were perceived as nonpersonalized and the feedback as inappropriate, affecting the agent's perceived reliability.                                         Conclusions               This exploratory study provides first insights into ECA design for eHealth. The first impression of an ECA's design seems to remain during long-term use.

Technology applications may provide a platform for such an assessment, but have not been validated. We set out to demonstrate whether e-health applications could support the assessment of older adults' wellness in community-dwelling older adults. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven residents of independent retirement community were followed over 8 weeks. Subjects engaged in the use of diverse technologies to assess cognitive performance, physiological and functional variables, as well as psychometric components of wellness. Data were integrated from various e-health sources into one study database. Correlations were assessed between different parameters, and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to explore the validity of the wellness model. Results: We found strong associations across multiple parameters of wellness within the conceptual model, including cognitive, functional, and physical. However, spirituality did not correlate with any other parameter studied in contrast to prior studies of older adults. Participants expressed overall positive attitudes toward the e-health tools and the holistic approach to the assessment of wellness, without expressing any privacy concerns. Conclusions: Parameters were highly correlated across multiple domains of wellness. Important clusters were noted to be formed across cognitive and physiological domains, giving further evidence of need for an integrated approach to the assessment of wellness. This finding warrants further replication in larger and more diverse samples of older adults to standardize and deploy these technologies across population groups.},

METHODS: Data from the population-based European Project on OSteoArthritis were used. The American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were used to diagnose OA in older people (65-85 yrs). After the baseline interview, at 6 months, and after the 12-18 months followup interview, joint pain was assessed using 2-week pain calendars. Daily values for temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed were obtained from local weather stations. Multilevel regression modelling was used to examine the pain-weather associations, adjusted for several confounders. RESULTS: The study included 810 participants with OA in the knee, hand, and/or hip. After adjustment, there were significant associations of joint pain with daily average humidity (B = 0.004, p {$<$} 0.01) and 3-day average humidity (B = 0.004, p = 0.01). A significant interaction effect was found between daily average humidity and temperature on joint pain. The effect of humidity on pain was stronger in relatively cold weather conditions. Changes in weather variables between 2 consecutive days were not significantly associated with reported joint pain. CONCLUSION: The associations between pain and daily average weather conditions suggest that a causal relationship exist between joint pain and weather variables, but the associations between day-to-day weather changes and pain do not confirm causation. Knowledge about the relationship between joint pain in OA and weather may help individuals with OA, physicians, and therapists to better understand and manage fluctuations in pain.},

Henceforth, the aim of the study is to present and validate such a tool. (2) Methods: The study group included 720 subjects (mean age 52.0 {\textpm} 37.0, 541 females) who agreed to fill the Users' Needs, Requirements, and Abilities Questionnaire (UNRAQ). The validation part of the study included 125 persons. (3) Results: the acceptance of the robot was good in the whole group. The social functions were rated worse than assistive ones. A correlation was found between the scores of social and assistive functions. The respondents claimed that older adults were not prepared to interact with the robot and not very good at handling it, and were sceptical about their willingness to learn to operate the robot. The Cronbach alpha value for the whole questionnaire was 0.95 suggesting excellent internal consistency, and the ICC value of 0.88 represents excellent agreement; (4) Conclusions: We observed a good overall acceptance of the robot across the studied group. There is considerable demand for the use of a social robot in care for older people.},

We develop machine learning models that predict long-term user engagement in three longitudinal virtual agent-based health interventions. We achieve accuracies of 74\% to 90\% in predicting user dropout in a given prediction period of the intervention based on the user's past interactions with the agent. Our models contain features related to session frequency and duration, health behavior, and user-agent dialogue content. We find that the features most predictive of dropout include number of user utterances, percent of user utterances that are questions, and the percent of user health behavior goals met during the observation period. Ramifications for the design of virtual agents for longitudinal applications are discussed.},

This room integrates different sensor modalities in a natural and non-invasive way inside the environment. The information gathered by the sensors is processed and sent to a centralized management system, which makes it available to a service robot assisting the people. One important restriction of our intelligent room is reducing as much as possible any interference with daily activities.

These technologies have the potential to improve the quality of life of the elderly population while reducing strain on healthcare systems and minimizing their operational cost. Although IoT and wearable applications for elderly healthcare purposes were reviewed previously, there is a further need to summarize their current applications in this fast-developing area. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of IoT and wearable technologies' applications including the types of data collected and the types of devices for elderly healthcare. This paper provides insights into existing areas of IoT/wearable applications while presenting new research opportunities in emerging areas of applications, such as robotic technology and integrated applications.

  abstract = {Objective:~           Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring is one of the tools recommended in hypertension management. However, its influence in older adults is seldom investigated. We aimed to assess whether regular home BP monitoring leads to a reduction of BP and an improvement in hypertension control in older adults.           Methods:~           In a 24-month trial, individuals aged 73--97 years were randomized in a control (office and home BP measured at 0, 12, and 24 months) or an intervention (office measured at 0, 12, and 24 months; home BP measured every 3 months) group. The primary outcome was the difference in means office BP over 24 months in hypertensive patients. Secondary outcomes included differences in mean home BP over follow-up in hypertensive patients, and frequency of hypertension and of drug use at 24 months in the total sample. Intention-to-treat analyses comprised 1733 persons, among which 1043 were hypertensive.           Results:~           Hypertensive patients in the intervention group experienced a significantly greater fall in office systolic BP (SBP) [mean between-group difference -2.1 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -4.1; -0.2, P = 0.03], home SBP (mean between-group difference -3.4, 95\% CI -4.8; -2.1, P {$<$} 0.0001), and home diastolic BP (mean between-group difference -1.1, 95\% CI -1.8; -0.4, P = 0.002) than those in the control group, in the main model. No overall differences were observed for office diastolic BP (P = 0.74), frequency of hypertension (P = 0.92), or drug use (P = 0.51) over time. Similar results were observed after adjustment for known predictors of BP though attenuated for office SBP (P = 0.07).           Conclusion:~           Regular home BP monitoring every 3 months without co-intervention results in small but greater reductions of BP over time. Further research in large trials focused on older adults is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this intervention in a variety of settings.},

Commercial-grade wearable monitors are objective, low burden tools to capture PA but are less well validated in older adults. Self-report PA questionnaires are widely accepted and more frequently used but carry inherent limitations. We aimed to compare these commonly used PA measures against one another and examine their convergent validity with a host of relevant outcomes. We also examined the factors that drive differences in PA self-reporting styles in older adults. 179 older adults completed 30-day Fitbit Flex2™ monitoring and reported PA levels {$<$}italic{$>$}via{$<$}/italic{$>$} two widely used PA questionnaires: PASE and CHAMPS-METs (metabolic expenditure calories burned). Participants also completed measures of cardiometabolic (hypertension diagnosis, resting heart rate, A1C levels), cognitive (memory, processing speed, executive functioning), and brain MRI (medial temporal lobe volume) outcomes. The discrepancy between objective Fitbit monitoring and self-reported PA was evaluated using a sample-based z difference score. There were only modest relationships across all PA metrics. Fitbit step count demonstrated a stronger association with the PASE, whereas Fitbit calories burned was more strongly associated with CHAMPS-MET. Fitbit outcomes had more consistent convergence with relevant outcomes of interest (e.g., cardiometabolic and brain health indices) when compared to subjective measures; however, considerable heterogeneity within these associations was observed. A higher degree of overreporting was associated with worse memory and executive performances, as well as hypertension diagnoses. We build on prior findings that wearable, digital health indicators of PA demonstrate greater construct validity than self-report in older adults. We further show important clinical features (e.g., poorer cognitive status) of older adults that could contribute to a higher level of overreporting on self-report measures. Characterization of what PA measures truly operationalize will help elucidate relationships between most relevant facets of PA and outcomes of interest.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Emotional deception and emotional attachment are regarded as ethical concerns in human-robot interaction. Considering these concerns is essential, particularly as little is known about longitudinal effects of interactions with social robots. We ran a longitudinal user study with older adults in two retirement villages, where people interacted with a robot in a didactic setting for eight sessions over a period of 4 weeks. The robot would show either non-emotive or emotive behavior during these interactions in order to investigate emotional deception. Questionnaires were given to investigate participants' acceptance of the robot, perception of the social interactions with the robot and attachment to the robot. Results show that the robot's behavior did not seem to influence participants' acceptance of the robot, perception of the interaction or attachment to the robot. Time did not appear to influence participants' level of attachment to the robot, which ranged from low to medium. The perceived ease of using the robot significantly increased over time. These findings indicate that a robot showing emotions---and perhaps resulting in users being deceived---in a didactic setting may not by default negatively influence participants' acceptance and perception of the robot, and that older adults may not become distressed if the robot would break or be taken away from them, as attachment to the robot in this didactic setting was not high. However, more research is required as there may be other factors influencing these ethical concerns, and support through other measurements than questionnaires is required to be able to draw conclusions regarding these concerns.},

However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

  abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.}

Graded chronic pain status was associated with psychological impairment, unfavorable appraisal of health status, and frequency of use of pain medications and health care. The presence of severe and persistent pain increased the likelihood of multiple indicators of pain dysfunction, but there was considerable heterogeneity in pain dysfunction among persons with comparable pain experience.

  abstract = {This research develops and evaluates a simple method of grading the severity of chronic pain for use in general population surveys and studies of primary care pain patients. Measures of pain intensity, disability, persistence and recency of onset were tested for their ability to grade chronic pain severity in a longitudinal study of primary care back pain (n = 1213), headache (n = 779) and temporomandibular disorder pain (n = 397) patients. A Guttman scale analysis showed that pain intensity and disability measures formed a reliable hierarchical scale. Pain intensity measures appeared to scale the lower range of global severity while disability measures appeared to scale the upper range of global severity. Recency of onset and days in pain in the prior 6 months did not scale with pain intensity or disability. Using simple scoring rules, pain severity was graded into 4 hierarchical classes: Grade I, low disability-low intensity; Grade II, low disability-high intensity; Grade III, high disability-moderately limiting; and Grade IV, high disability-severely limiting. For each pain site, Chronic Pain Grade measured at baseline showed a highly statistically significant and monotonically increasing relationship with unemployment rate, pain-related functional limitations, depression, fair to poor self-rated health, frequent use of opioid analgesics, and frequent pain-related doctor visits both at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Days in Pain was related to these variables, but not as strongly as Chronic Pain Grade. Recent onset cases (first onset within the prior 3 months) did not show differences in psychological and behavioral dysfunction when compared to persons with less recent onset. Using longitudinal data from a population-based study (n = 803), Chronic Pain Grade at baseline predicted the presence of pain in the prior 2 weeks, Chronic Pain Grade and pain-related functional limitations at 3-year follow-up. Grading chronic pain as a function of pain intensity and pain-related disability may be useful when a brief ordinal measure of global pain severity is required. Pain persistence, measured by days in pain in a fixed time period, provides useful additional information.},

During the last decades, new data sources have been suggested as an alternative or complement to traditional data. This paper aims to present the theoretical background of well-being, by distinguishing between objective and subjective approaches, their relevant dimensions, the new data sources used for their measurement and relevant studies.

As a result, these devices are limited in their usefulness for clinical and research applications, despite holding much promise. We used a mobile application of our own creation to collect raw acceleration data and heart rate from the Apple Watch worn by participants undergoing polysomnography, as well as during the ambulatory period preceding in lab testing. Using this data, we compared the contributions of multiple features (motion, local standard deviation in heart rate, and ``clock proxy'') to performance across several classifiers. Best performance was achieved using neural nets, though the differences across classifiers were generally small. For sleep-wake classification, our method scored 90\% of epochs correctly, with 59.6\% of true wake epochs (specificity) and 93\% of true sleep epochs (sensitivity) scored correctly. Accuracy for differentiating wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep was approximately 72\% when all features were used. We generalized our results by testing the models trained on Apple Watch data using data from the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and found that we were able to predict sleep with performance comparable to testing on our own dataset. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction.},

  abstract = {This article presents the results of video-based Human Robot Interaction (HRI) trials which investigated people's perceptions of different robot appearances and associated attention-seeking features and behaviors displayed by robots with different appearance and behaviors. The HRI trials studied the participants' preferences for various features of robot appearance and behavior, as well as their personality attributions towards the robots compared to their own personalities. Overall, participants tended to prefer robots with more human-like appearance and attributes. However, systematic individual differences in the dynamic appearance ratings are not consistent with a universal effect. Introverts and participants with lower emotional stability tended to prefer the mechanical looking appearance to a greater degree than other participants. It is also shown that it is possible to rate individual elements of a particular robot's behavior and then assess the contribution, or otherwise, of that element to the overall perception of the robot by people. Relating participants' dynamic appearance ratings of individual robots to independent static appearance ratings provided evidence that could be taken to support a portion of the left hand side of Mori's theoretically proposed `uncanny valley' diagram. Suggestions for future work are outlined.},

  abstract = {Background: An increasing number of mobile and wearable devices are available in the market. However, the extent to which these devices can be used to assist older adults to age in place remains unclear. Objective: This study aimed to assess older adults' perceptions of using mobile and connected health technologies. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 51 participants were recruited from a senior community center. Demographics and usage of mobile or wearable devices and online health communities were collected using a survey questionnaire. Descriptive statistics assessed usage of devices and online health communities. The Fisher exact test was used to examine the relationship between technology usage and having access to a smartphone. Results: The sample was primarily comprised non-Hispanic white (35/51, 69\%), educated (39/51, 76\% any college), and female (36/51, 71\%) participants, with an average age of 70 (SD 8) years. All participants were insured and nearly all lived at home (49/51, 94\%). A total of 86\% (44/51) of the participants had heard of wearable health devices, but only 18 out of 51 (35\%) had ever used them. Over 80\% (42/51) expressed interest in using such devices and were interested in tracking exercise and physical activity (46/51, 90\%), sleep (38/51, 75\%), blood pressure (34/51, 67\%), diet (31/51, 61\%), blood sugar (28/51, 55\%), weight (26/51, 51\%), and fall risk (23/51, 45\%). The greatest concerns about using wearable devices were cost (31/51, 61\%), safety (14/51, 28\%), and privacy (13/51, 26\%); one-fourth (12/51) reported having no concerns. They were mostly interested in sharing data from mobile and connected devices with their health care providers followed by family, online communities, friends, and no one. About 41\% (21/51) of the older adults surveyed reported having ever heard of an online health community, and roughly 40\% (20/51) of the participants reported being interested in joining such a community. Most participants reported having access to a smartphone (38/51, 74\%), and those with such access were significantly more likely to show interest in using a wearable health device (P{$<$}.001) and joining an online health community (P=.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, although few older adults are currently using mobile and wearable devices and connected health technologies for managing health, they are open to this idea and are mostly interested in sharing such data with their health care providers. Further studies are warranted to explore strategies to balance the data sharing preference of older adults and how to best integrate mobile and wearable device data with clinical workflow for health care providers to promote healthy aging in place.},

  abstract = {Background: Telehealth is an effective means to assist existing health care systems, particularly for the current aging society. However, most extant telehealth systems employ individual data sources by offline data processing, which may not recognize health deterioration in a timely way. Objective: Our study objective was two-fold: to design and implement an integrated, personalized telehealth system on a community-based level; and to evaluate the system from the perspective of user acceptance. Methods: The system was designed to capture and record older adults' health-related information (eg, daily activities, continuous vital signs, and gait behaviors) through multiple measuring tools. State-of-the-art data mining techniques can be integrated to detect statistically significant changes in daily records, based on which a decision support system could emit warnings to older adults, their family members, and their caregivers for appropriate interventions to prevent further health deterioration. A total of 45 older adults recruited from 3 elderly care centers in Hong Kong were instructed to use the system for 3 months. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to summarize the collected datasets. For system evaluation, we used a customized acceptance questionnaire to examine users' attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention on the system. Results: A total of 179 follow-up sessions were conducted in the 3 elderly care centers. The results of exploratory data analysis showed some significant differences in the participants' daily records and vital signs (eg, steps, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure) among the 3 centers. The participants perceived that using the system is a good idea (ie, attitude: mean 5.67, SD 1.06), comfortable (ie, self-efficacy: mean 4.92, SD 1.11), useful to improve their health (ie, perceived usefulness: mean 4.99, SD 0.91), and easy to use (ie, perceived ease of use: mean 4.99, SD 1.00). In general, the participants showed a positive intention to use the first version of our personalized telehealth system in their future health management (ie, behavioral intention: mean 4.45, SD 1.78). Conclusions: The proposed health monitoring system provides an example design for monitoring older adults' health status based on multiple data sources, which can help develop reliable and accurate predictive analytics. The results can serve as a guideline for researchers and stakeholders (eg, policymakers, elderly care centers, and health care providers) who provide care for older adults through such a telehealth system.},

  abstract = {With the advances in sensor technology, big data, and artificial intelligence, unobtrusive in-home health monitoring has been a research focus for decades. Following up our research on smart vehicles, within the framework of unobtrusive health monitoring in private spaces, this work attempts to provide a guide to current sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home monitoring by a literature review of the state of the art and to answer, in particular, the questions: (1) What types of sensors can be used for unobtrusive in-home health data acquisition? (2) Where should the sensors be placed? (3) What data can be monitored in a smart home? (4) How can the obtained data support the monitoring functions? We conducted a retrospective literature review and summarized the state-of-the-art research on leveraging sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home health monitoring. For structured analysis, we developed a four-category terminology (location, unobtrusive sensor, data, and monitoring functions). We acquired 912 unique articles from four relevant databases (ACM Digital Lib, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and screened them for relevance, resulting in n=55 papers analyzed in a structured manner using the terminology. The results delivered 25 types of sensors (motion sensor, contact sensor, pressure sensor, electrical current sensor, etc.) that can be deployed within rooms, static facilities, or electric appliances in an ambient way. While behavioral data (e.g., presence (n=38), time spent on activities (n=18)) can be acquired effortlessly, physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) are measurable on a limited scale (n=5). Behavioral data contribute to functional monitoring. Emergency monitoring can be built up on behavioral and environmental data. Acquired physiological parameters allow reasonable monitoring of physiological functions to a limited extent. Environmental data and behavioral data also detect safety and security abnormalities. Social interaction monitoring relies mainly on direct monitoring of tools of communication (smartphone; computer). In summary, convincing proof of a clear effect of these monitoring functions on clinical outcome with a large sample size and long-term monitoring is still lacking.},

For a full form  word the tagger tries to find the sequence of morphemes that is most likely to generate that word.  From this sequence of tags we can easily derive the stem, the lemma and the part of speech (PoS) of the word. We show (i) that the quality of this approach is comparable to state of the art methods and (ii) that we can improve the results of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging when we include the morphological analysis of each word.},

This research has developed a robot-assisted learning system to explore the possibility of significantly improving health literacy and learning perception through interaction with robots. In particular, this study adopted an experimental design, in which the experiment lasted for 90 min. A total of 60 participants over the age of 50 were randomly assigned to different learning modes. The RobotLS group learned by interacting with robots, while the VideoLS group watched health education videos on a tablet computer. The content dealt with hypertension related issues. This study used the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16), Health Knowledge Questionnaire, Reduced Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (RIMMS), and Flow Scale as evaluation tools. The result shows no significant difference in the pre-test scores between the two groups. Compared with the video-assisted learning system, the robot-assisted learning system can significantly improve health knowledge, health literacy, learning motivation, and flow perception. According to the findings of this study, a robot-assisted learning system can be introduced in the future into homes and care institutions to enhance the health literacy of the elderly.},

In the present study we provide an update of normative data from the German general population. METHODS: Data was collected in two randomly selected samples representative of the German general population in 2020 (N~=~2503) and 2021 (N~=~2519). We computed percentile norm values for the total sample (N~=~5022) and for different age groups, stratified by gender. RESULTS: Compared to previous data, only minor changes in normative values were observed. 95~\%-thresholds were at a score of 6-7 for the PHQ-4, and 3-4 for PHQ-2 and GAD-2 respectively. The scales showed acceptable reliability with McDonald's omega of {$\omega~$}=~0.77 for PHQ-2, {$\omega~$}=~0.78 for GAD-2, and {$\omega~$}=~0.85 for PHQ-4. LIMITATIONS: Lack of a diagnostic gold standard and suboptimal response proportion (44.2~\%) are limitations of this study. CONCLUSION: This update supports the continued use of PHQ-4 scales as reliable instruments. For psychometric application, the reported normative data for PHQ-2, GAD-2 and PHQ-4 facilitates more up-to-date comparisons.},

The principal areas of focus of the CGA include the patient's functional, physical, mental, emotional, pharmacotherapeutic, and socioeconomic status. Methods We describe the role of CGA in the identification and management of frail elderly patients. The literature is reviewed to outline the components, programmatic configurations, and process of CGA. Information from systematic reviews of clinical trials of different CGA program models is summarized, and observations relating to the research agenda concerning the applicability of CGA and CGA principles to management of older cancer patients are discussed. Results Since age itself is not predictive of outcome in an elderly cancer patient, the CGA helps to distinguish between elderly patients who should be treated with intent to cure and those who will benefit from clinical oncologic and geriatric co-management. Conclusions A more accurate evaluation of prognostic indicators that includes CGA parameters could lead to a higher number of older patients being included in clinical cancer trials and being treated effectively in practice. It would also identify those who would benefit from gero-oncologic CGA and ongoing management aimed at maintaining function and community living.},

  abstract = {Indoor environments have a large impact on health and well-being, so it is important to understand what makes them healthy and sustainable. There is substantial knowledge on individual factors and their effects, though understanding how factors interact and what role occupants play in these interactions (both causative and receptive) is lacking. We aimed to: (i) explore interactions between factors and potential risks if these are not considered from holistic perspective; and (ii) identify components needed to advance research on indoor environments. The paper is based on collaboration between researchers from disciplines covering technical, behavioural, and medical perspectives. Outcomes were identified through literature reviews, discussions and workshops with invited experts and representatives from various stakeholder groups. Four themes emerged and were discussed with an emphasis on occupant health: (a) the bio-psycho-social aspects of health; (b) interaction between occupants, buildings and indoor environment; (c) climate change and its impact on indoor environment quality, thermal comfort and health; and (d) energy efficiency measures and indoor environment. To advance the relevant research, the indoor environment must be considered a dynamic and complex system with multiple interactions. This calls for a transdisciplinary and holistic approach and effective collaboration with various stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Introduction                Virtual conversational agents (i.e., chatbots) are an intuitive form of data collection. Understanding older adults' experiences with chatbots could help identify their usability needs. This quality improvement study evaluated older adults' experiences with a chatbot for health data collection. A secondary goal was to understand how perceptions differed based on length of chatbot forms.                                            Methods                After a demographic survey, participants ({$\geq$}60 years) completed either a short (21 questions), moderate (30 questions), or long (66 questions) chatbot form. Perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, usability, likelihood to recommend, and cognitive load were measured post-test. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used.                                            Results                A total of 260 participants reported on usability and satisfaction metrics including perceived ease-of-use (5.8/7), usefulness (4.7/7), usability (5.4/7), and likelihood to recommend (Net Promoter Score\,=\,0). Cognitive load (12.3/100) was low. There was a statistically significant difference in perceived usefulness between groups, with a significantly higher mean perceived usefulness for Group 1 than Group 3. No other group differences were observed. The chatbot was perceived as quick, easy, and pleasant with concerns about technical issues, privacy, and security. Participants provided suggestions to enhance progress tracking, edit responses, improve readability, and have options to ask questions.                                            Discussion                Older adults found the chatbot to be easy, useful, and usable. The chatbot required low cognitive load demonstrating it could be an enjoyable health data collection tool for older adults. These results will inform the development of a health data collection chatbot technology.}

  abstract = {Background With the growing population of older adults as a potential user group of mHealth, the need increases for mHealth interventions to address specific aging characteristics of older adults. The existence of aging barriers to computer use is widely acknowledged. Yet, usability studies show that mHealth still fails to be appropriately designed for older adults and their expectations. To enhance designs of mHealth aimed at older adult populations, it is essential to gain insight into aging barriers that impact the usability of mHealth as experienced by these adults. Objectives This study aims to synthesize literature on aging barriers to digital (health) computer use, and explain, map and visualize these barriers in relation to the usability of mHealth by means of a framework. Methods We performed a scoping review to synthesize and summarize reported physical and functional age barriers in relation to digital (mobile) health applications use. Aging barriers reported in the literature were mapped onto usability aspects categorized by Nielsen to explain their influence on user experience of mHealth. A framework (MOLD-US) was developed summarizing the evidence on the influence of aging barriers on mHealth use experienced by older adults. Results Four key categories of aging barriers influencing usability of mHealth were identified: cognition, motivation, physical ability and perception. Effective and satisfactory use of mHealth by older adults is complicated by cognition and motivation barriers. Physical ability and perceptual barriers further increase the risk of user errors and fail to notice important interaction tasks. Complexities of medical conditions, such as diminished eye sight related to diabetes or deteriorated motor skills as a result of rheumatism, can cause errors in user interaction. Conclusions This research provides a novel framework for the exploration of aging barriers and their causes influencing mHealth usability in older adults. This framework allows for further systematic empirical testing and analysis of mHealth usability issues, as it enables results to be classified and interpreted based on impediments intrinsic to usability issues experienced by older adults. Importantly, the paper identifies a key need for future research on motivational barriers impeding mhealth use of older adults. More insights are needed in particular to disaggregating normal age related functional changes from specific medical conditions that influence experienced usefulness of mHealth by these adults.},

  abstract = {There is a long-standing dispute about indoor air humidity and perceived indoor air quality (IAQ) and associated health effects. Complaints about sensory irritation in eyes and upper airways are generally among top-two symptoms together with the perception ``dry air'' in office environments. This calls for an integrated analysis of indoor air humidity and eye and airway health effects. This overview has reviewed the literature about the effects of extended exposure to low humidity on perceived IAQ, sensory irritation symptoms in eyes and airways, work performance, sleep quality, virus survival, and voice disruption. Elevation of the indoor air humidity may positively impact perceived IAQ, eye symptomatology, and possibly work performance in the office environment; however, mice inhalation studies do not show exacerbation of sensory irritation in the airways by low humidity. Elevated humidified indoor air appears to reduce nasal symptoms in patients suffering from obstructive apnea syndrome, while no clear improvement on voice production has been identified, except for those with vocal fatigue. Both low and high RH, and perhaps even better absolute humidity (water vapor), favors transmission and survival of influenza virus in many studies, but the relationship between temperature, humidity, and the virus and aerosol dynamics is complex, which in the end depends on the individual virus type and its physical/chemical properties. Dry and humid air perception continues to be reported in offices and in residential areas, despite the IAQ parameter ``dry air'' (or ``wet/humid air'') is semantically misleading, because a sensory organ for humidity is non-existing in humans. This IAQ parameter appears to reflect different perceptions among other odor, dustiness, and possibly exacerbated by desiccation effect of low air humidity. It is salient to distinguish between indoor air humidity (relative or absolute) near the breathing and ocular zone and phenomena caused by moisture-damage of the building construction and emissions therefrom. Further, residential versus public environments should be considered as separate entities with different characteristics and demands of humidity. Research is needed about particle, bacteria and virus dynamics indoors for improvement of quality of life and with more focus on the impact of absolute humidity. ``Dry (or wet) air'' should be redefined to become a meaningful IAQ descriptor.},

Below is information about what self-care is, why it is so important and how you can get involved.What is self-care?~WHO defines self-care as individuals, families and communities'~promoting and maintaining their own health, preventing disease, and coping with illness and disability, with or without the support of a health worker.~I have heard about self-care interventions, what are they?~Self-care interventions are the evidence-based tools that support self-care. They include medicines, counselling, diagnostic kits, and digital technologies. Now is an exciting time with more and more tools being developed.~Why is self-care so important?~Self-care is about empowering people to be active agents in their own healthcare.~Doing so not only puts people at the centre of their own healthcare,~but also relieves pressures on health systems. Those pressures are growing and include:4.3 billion people with inadequate access to essential facility-based health services~an estimated global shortage of health workers of 10 million health workers,~mainly in low-and-middle income countries1 in 5 of the world's population living in humanitarian crises, during which health systems are particularly challenged to deliver essential services~pandemics, like COVID-19, armed conflicts and climate change also disrupting and stretching health services worldwide~Self-care interventions give people choice and the option to access healthcare wherever and whenever they want to. Self-care interventions do not replace health systems, they enhance them. They are part of a holistic approach to healthcare which improves Primary Health Care and contributes to Universal Health Coverage.How can I get involved?~There lots of things you can do:~learn more, visit WHO's self-care health topic~pagewatch our new video on self-carefollow us on Twitter: @HRPresearch and also check out WHO regional and country twitter feeds. During the month, WHO will share information, new developments and activities about self-care interventions.~find out if there are any Self-Care Month activities going on where you live and take part or organize your own activities and invite others to join youtake time to think about how you can practice self-care each day to help improve your health and well-being.~ ~~Infographics, social tiles and more videos},

Wearable devices are also used for patient management and disease management. The wearable applications can directly impact clinical decision making. Some believe that wearable technologies could improve the quality of patient care while reducing the cost of care, such as patient rehabilitation outside of hospitals. The big data generated by wearable devices is both a challenge and opportunity for researchers who can apply more artificial intelligence (AI) techniques on these data in the future.

These continuously evolving technology platforms do not only promise to help people pursue a healthier life style, but also provide continuous medical data for actively tracking metabolic status, diagnosis, and treatment. Advances in the miniaturization of flexible electronics, electrochemical biosensors, microfluidics, and artificial intelligence algorithms have led to wearable devices that can generate real-time medical data within the Internet of things. These flexible devices can be configured to make conformal contact with epidermal, ocular, intracochlear, and dental interfaces to collect biochemical or electrophysiological signals. This article discusses consumer trends in wearable electronics, commercial and emerging devices, and fabrication methods. It also reviews real-time monitoring of vital signs using biosensors, stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery, and closed-loop theranostic systems. It covers future challenges in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, communication modes, energy management, displays, conformity, and data safety. The development of patient-oriented wearable technologies and their incorporation in randomized clinical trials will facilitate the design of safe and effective approaches.},

Especially after the COVID-19 epidemic, sleep health issues have attracted more attention. In recent years, with the development of wearable electronic devices, there have been more and more studies, products, or solutions related to sleep monitoring. Many mature technologies, such as polysomnography, have been applied to clinical practice. However, it is urgent to develop wearable or non-contacting electronic devices suitable for household continuous sleep monitoring. This paper first introduces the basic knowledge of sleep and the significance of sleep monitoring. Then, according to the types of physiological signals monitored, this paper describes the research progress of bioelectrical signals, biomechanical signals, and biochemical signals used for sleep monitoring. However, it is not ideal to monitor the sleep quality for the whole night based on only one signal. Therefore, this paper reviews the research on multi-signal monitoring and introduces systematic sleep monitoring schemes. Finally, a conclusion and discussion of sleep monitoring are presented to propose potential future directions and prospects for sleep monitoring.},

CSC apps provide potential diagnoses for users and assist them with self-triaging based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using human-like conversations. Despite the popularity of such CSC apps, little research has been done to investigate their functionalities and user experiences. To do so, we conducted a feature review, a user review analysis, and an interview study. We found that the existing CSC apps lack the functions to support the whole diagnostic process of an offline medical visit. We also found that users perceive the current CSC apps to lack support for a comprehensive medical history, flexible symptom input, comprehensible questions, and diverse diseases and user groups. Based on these results, we derived implications for the future features and conversational design of CSC apps.},

We design a data-preparing scheme for acquiring data and processing data from multiple monitoring devices, and propose a personalized scheme for forecasting the elderly's one-day-ahead wellness condition via data integration and statistical learning. We conduct a pilot study at a nursing home in Hong Kong to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed system. The proposed forecasting scheme is validated by the collected data.},

This paper addresses the shift in question from a sociological perspective and proposes to bring it even further to include a systematic study of human 'lived experiences' taking place in the community contexts. The ultimate goal is to facilitate theoretical and methodological developments needed to systematically address and pursue research on the 'HRI of Everyday Life'.},

We provide a narrative review of mental illness detection using NLP in the past decade, to understand methods, trends, challenges and future directions. A total of 399 studies from 10,467 records were included. The review reveals that there is an upward trend in mental illness detection NLP research.

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) has been a long-standing research area in natural language processing. It can offer rich insights into human sentiments and opinions and has thus seen considerable interest from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a great potential for their employment on SA problems. However, the extent to which existing LLMs can be leveraged for different sentiment analysis tasks remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive investigation into the capabilities of LLMs in performing various sentiment analysis tasks, from conventional sentiment classification to aspect-based sentiment analysis and multifaceted analysis of subjective texts. We evaluate performance across 13 tasks on 26 datasets and compare the results against small language models (SLMs) trained on domain-specific datasets. Our study reveals that while LLMs demonstrate satisfactory performance in simpler tasks, they lag behind in more complex tasks requiring deeper understanding or structured sentiment information. However, LLMs significantly outperform SLMs in few-shot learning settings, suggesting their potential when annotation resources are limited. We also highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices in assessing LLMs' SA abilities and propose a novel benchmark, {\textbackslash}textsc\{SentiEval\}, for a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation.

Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enable various smart applications across various healthcare scenarios. As an essential technology powered by AI, natural language processing (NLP) plays a key role in smart healthcare due to its capability of analysing and understanding human language. In this work, we review existing studies that concern NLP for smart healthcare from the perspectives of technique and application. We first elaborate on different NLP approaches and the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare from the technical point of view. Then, in the context of smart healthcare applications employing NLP techniques, we introduce representative smart healthcare scenarios, including clinical practice, hospital management, personal care, public health, and drug development. We further discuss two specific medical issues, i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mental health, in which NLP-driven smart healthcare plays an important role. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current works and identify the directions for future works.},

  abstract = {Background: Sentiment analysis (SA) is a subfield of natural language processing whose aim is to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in a free text. It has found practical applications across a wide range of societal contexts including marketing, economy, and politics. This review focuses specifically on applications related to health, which is defined as ``a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.'' Objective: This study aimed to establish the state of the art in SA related to health and well-being by conducting a systematic review of the recent literature. To capture the perspective of those individuals whose health and well-being are affected, we focused specifically on spontaneously generated content and not necessarily that of health care professionals. Methods: Our methodology is based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In January 2019, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified a total of 86 relevant studies and extracted data about the datasets analyzed, discourse topics, data creators, downstream applications, algorithms used, and their evaluation. Results: The majority of data were collected from social networking and Web-based retailing platforms. The primary purpose of online conversations is to exchange information and provide social support online. These communities tend to form around health conditions with high severity and chronicity rates. Different treatments and services discussed include medications, vaccination, surgery, orthodontic services, individual physicians, and health care services in general. We identified 5 roles with respect to health and well-being among the authors of the types of spontaneously generated narratives considered in this review: a sufferer, an addict, a patient, a carer, and a suicide victim. Out of 86 studies considered, only 4 reported the demographic characteristics. A wide range of methods were used to perform SA. Most common choices included support vector machines, na{\"i}ve Bayesian learning, decision trees, logistic regression, and adaptive boosting. In contrast with general trends in SA research, only 1 study used deep learning. The performance lags behind the state of the art achieved in other domains when measured by F-score, which was found to be below 60\% on average. In the context of SA, the domain of health and well-being was found to be resource poor: few domain-specific corpora and lexica are shared publicly for research purposes. Conclusions: SA results in the area of health and well-being lag behind those in other domains. It is yet unclear if this is because of the intrinsic differences between the domains and their respective sublanguages, the size of training datasets, the lack of domain-specific sentiment lexica, or the choice of algorithms.},
