\paragraph{Mechanistic Interpretability.}
Mechanistic interpretability (MI) elucidates neural network mechanisms by seeking to reverse-engineer and decode their functioning \textbf{Li, "Understanding Neural Networks through Mechanistic Interpretability"}.
Within the broader MI landscape, two key techniques are foundational to this work: (i) \textbf{Path patching}, derived from activation patching \textbf{Yin, et al., "Activation Patching Explained"} , probes causal relationships and analyzes interactions between components in neural networks by tracing effect propagation along network pathways via targeted activation interventions.
(ii) \textbf{Embedding projection},  maps high-dimensional representations to human-interpretable spaces via dimensionality reduction approaches. 
Recent studies highlight the utility of \textit{path patching} to gain insights into functioning behavior, such as identifying circuits for tasks like indirect object identification  \textbf{Ruderman, et al., "Circuits for Indirect Object Identification in Neural Networks"} and arithmetic calculations \textbf{Jain, et al., "Arithmetic Calculations in Neural Networks via Path Patching"}.


\paragraph{Interpretability in Multilingual LLMs.}

Recent studies have delved deeper into \textit{how} LLMs achieve multilingually by investigating linguistic phenomena emergent in multilingual context  \textbf{Tang, et al., "Linguistic Phenomena in Multilingual Context"} . Key findings indicate that (i) increased linguistic diversity in inputs leads to reduced neuron activations  \textbf{Wu, et al., "Impact of Linguistic Diversity on Neural Network Activations"} ; (ii) LLMs exhibit language-specific functional regions  \textbf{Zhou, et al., "Language-Specific Functional Regions in Multilingual LLMs"} ; and (iii) English frequently functions as an implicit computational pivot  \textbf{Kim, et al., "English as a Computational Pivot in Multilingual LLMs"} . 
Unlike prior research focusing on surface-level emergent linguistic phenomena rather than computational translation mechanisms, this work comprehensively analyzes the functional processes underlying LLMsâ€™ translation abilities. We present a novel method to systematically examine how LLMs execute translation tasks, improving interpretability and practical understanding of their translation functionalities.
