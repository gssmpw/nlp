\paragraph{Mechanistic Interpretability.}
Mechanistic interpretability (MI) elucidates neural network mechanisms by seeking to reverse-engineer and decode their functioning____.
Within the broader MI landscape, two key techniques are foundational to this work: (i) \textbf{Path patching}____, derived from activation patching____, probes causal relationships and analyzes interactions between components in neural networks by tracing effect propagation along network pathways via targeted activation interventions.
(ii) \textbf{Embedding projection}____ maps high-dimensional representations to human-interpretable spaces via dimensionality reduction approaches. 
Recent studies highlight the utility of \textit{path patching} to gain insights into functioning behavior, such as identifying circuits for tasks like indirect object identification____ and arithmetic calculations____.


\paragraph{Interpretability in Multilingual LLMs.}

Recent studies have delved deeper into \textit{how} LLMs achieve multilingually by investigating linguistic phenomena emergent in multilingual context____. Key findings indicate that (i) increased linguistic diversity in inputs leads to reduced neuron activations____; (ii) LLMs exhibit language-specific functional regions____; and (iii) English frequently functions as an implicit computational pivot____. 
Unlike prior research focusing on surface-level emergent linguistic phenomena rather than computational translation mechanisms, this work comprehensively analyzes the functional processes underlying LLMsâ€™ translation abilities. We present a novel method to systematically examine how LLMs execute translation tasks, improving interpretability and practical understanding of their translation functionalities.
