\paragraph{Mechanistic Interpretability.}
Mechanistic interpretability (MI) elucidates neural network mechanisms by seeking to reverse-engineer and decode their functioning~\citep{NEURIPS2022_6f1d43d5,lan2024sparseautoencodersrevealuniversal,10.1145/3639372,rai2024practicalreviewmechanisticinterpretability}.
Within the broader MI landscape, two key techniques are foundational to this work: (i) \textbf{Path patching}~\citep{goldowsky2023localizing,wang2023interpretability}, derived from activation patching~\citep{heimersheim2024useinterpretactivationpatching,zhang2024towards}, probes causal relationships and analyzes interactions between components in neural networks by tracing effect propagation along network pathways via targeted activation interventions.
(ii) \textbf{Embedding projection}~\citep{geva-etal-2022-transformer,dar-etal-2023-analyzing} maps high-dimensional representations to human-interpretable spaces via dimensionality reduction approaches. 
Recent studies highlight the utility of \textit{path patching} to gain insights into functioning behavior, such as identifying circuits for tasks like indirect object identification\citep{wang2023interpretability} and arithmetic calculations\citep{wei2024interpreting}.


\paragraph{Interpretability in Multilingual LLMs.}

Recent studies have delved deeper into \textit{how} LLMs achieve multilingually by investigating linguistic phenomena emergent in multilingual context~\citep{bhattacharya2024understandingroleffnsdriving, peng-sogaard-2024-concept, ferrando-costa-jussa-2024-similarity, dumas2024how}. Key findings indicate that (i) increased linguistic diversity in inputs leads to reduced neuron activations~\citep{mu-etal-2024-revealing}; (ii) LLMs exhibit language-specific functional regions~\citep{tang-etal-2024-language}; and (iii) English frequently functions as an implicit computational pivot~\citep{wendler-etal-2024-llamas,zhao2024how}. 
Unlike prior research focusing on surface-level emergent linguistic phenomena rather than computational translation mechanisms, this work comprehensively analyzes the functional processes underlying LLMsâ€™ translation abilities. We present a novel method to systematically examine how LLMs execute translation tasks, improving interpretability and practical understanding of their translation functionalities.
