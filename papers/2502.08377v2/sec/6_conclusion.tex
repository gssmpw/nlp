\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel framework DS4D, which decouples dynamic-static information along temporal-spatial axes to enhance dynamic representations for high-quality 4D generation. Its DSFD decouples features by regarding the regions of current features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Moreover, TSSF is designed to enhance dynamic representations by selecting similar dynamic information. Overall, our method can produce high-quality 4D content and shows promise in 4D scene generation.
