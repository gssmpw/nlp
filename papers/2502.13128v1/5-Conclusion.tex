\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer for text-to-song generation. Operating within a unified framework, we devised a variety of token patterns. These patterns endow SongGen with the ability to support two distinct generation modes: the mixed mode and the dual-track mode. Experimental outcomes convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of our token pattern design. Moreover, they showcase the strong song generation capabilities of SongGen in both the mixed mode and the dual-track mode.
