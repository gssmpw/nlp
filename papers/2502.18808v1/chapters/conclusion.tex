\section{Conclusions}

Divergence estimation has been a critical challenge for diffusion models with optimal transport properties. However, the issue of large variance significantly impacts scalability concerning data size and dimension, making these models less effective for large-scale real-world generation tasks. To address this, we explore the use of Hutch++ to minimize variance in trace estimation within optimal transport-based generative models, observing significant speedups in training diffusion models while preserving optimal transportation plans. Our work paves the way for optimizing transport maps and shows potential for a deeper understanding of optimal transport in various scientific studies.
