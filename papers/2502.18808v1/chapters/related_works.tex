\section{Related Works}
\paragraph{Simulation-free Samplers} \cite{flow_matching} accelerated the training of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) in a simulation-free manner, motivating the development of straighter probability paths with more efficient transport. \citet{Albergo_stochastic_interpolants, Albergo_unified_framework} bridged the gap between diffusion models and flow models by stochastically interpolating the marginals. \cite{Rectified, Rectified_group} proposed the rectified flow, which iteratively rectifies couplings and probability paths. \citet{Multisample_flow_matching,CFM_Tong} studied optimal transport in big data settings using minibatch optimal transport. However, these methods primarily rely on convex transport costs, and extending them to nonlinear cases and developing a more principled approach to updating couplings remain open questions.

\paragraph{Optimal Transport} \citet{DSB, SBP_max_llk, forward_backward_SDE, mSB} explored Schr√∂dinger bridge diffusion models, a principled framework for studying optimal transport (OT). However, these models have been known to scale poorly to large-scale datasets. Inspired by flow matching and diffusion models, \cite{SB_matching, gSBM} investigated bridge matching to develop more scalable methodologies while preserving efficient transport maps. \cite{NLSB, NOT_LC} studied Lagrangian formulations to ensure more directional trajectories, especially when obstacles exist in the transport dynamics. Nonetheless, achieving optimality often incurs additional costs, especially the large variance issue, and finding ways to  reduce the training variance remains a longstanding challenge.
