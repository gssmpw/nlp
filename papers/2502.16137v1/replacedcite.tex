\section{Related Work}
We outline some related work and explain how our approach differs from these efforts.

Chain-of-Thought ____ (CoT) primarily aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of text LLMs by breaking down problems into step-by-step solutions. Our method is inspired by CoT, but our CoD is not a variant of CoT; it is a new strategy specifically designed for multi-modal inputs. In theory, CoD and CoT could be combined to bolster the performance of MLLMs.

____ focuses only on LVLMs and also mentions descriptions. However, their descriptions are related directly to the questions. In contrast, we do focus not on specific questions but explore a more general scenario and verify its effectiveness.
____ also concentrates on LVLMs, but their study emphasizes enhancing reasoning tasks, proposing rationale generation before answer inference. Our work is not limited to reasoning tasks but targets more general scenarios. 
____ introduced a method with the same name as ours, but their research direction is about improving the performance of Code LLM.
