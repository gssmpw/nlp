Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be defined based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efficient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classification benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.},

abstract = {While vision-language pre-training model (VLP) has shown revolutionary improvements on various vision-language (V+L) tasks, the studies regarding its adversarial robustness remain largely unexplored. This paper studied the adversarial attack on popular VLP models and V+L tasks. First, we analyzed the performance of adversarial attacks under different settings. By examining the influence of different perturbed objects and attack targets, we concluded some key observations as guidance on both designing strong multimodal adversarial attack and constructing robust VLP models. Second, we proposed a novel multimodal attack method on the VLP models called Collaborative Multimodal Adversarial Attack (Co-Attack), which collectively carries out the attacks on the image modality and the text modality. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieves improved attack performances on different V+L downstream tasks and VLP models. The analysis observations and novel attack method hopefully provide new understanding into the adversarial robustness of VLP models, so as to contribute their safe and reliable deployment in more real-world scenarios.},

abstract={People identify man-made objects by their visual appearance and the text on them e.g., does a bottle say water or shampoo? We use text as an important visual cue to help distinguish between similar looking objects. This thesis explores a novel joint model of visual appearance and textual cues for image classification.We perform this in three functions - (a) Isolating an object in an input image; (b) Extracting text from the image; (c) Training a joint vision/text model. We simplify the task by extracting text separately and presenting it to the model in machine readable format. Such a joint model has utility in many real world challenges where language is interpreted through a sensory perception like vision or sound.The aim of the research is to understand whether visual percepts, when understood in the context of extracted language, will provide a better classification of image objects than using only pure vision to perform image classification. In conclusion, we show that joint classifier models can successfully make use of text present in images to classify objects, provided that the extracted text from images is of high quality and we have the number of images proportional to the number of classification classes.},
