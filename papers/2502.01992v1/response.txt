The evolution of financial sentiment analysis has followed several key trajectories in the literature. Early work by Loughran and McDonald **McDonald, "Textual Analysis"** established the importance of domain-specific dictionaries for financial text analysis, highlighting how general-purpose sentiment tools often fail in financial contexts. In parallel, the development of comprehensive financial reinforcement learning frameworks like FinRL-Meta **Jiang et al., "FinRL-Meta: A Comprehensive Financial Reinforcement Learning Framework"** has provided standardized environments for developing and evaluating trading strategies.

Recent developments in prompt engineering have shown promising results in various domains. Wei et al. **Wei, "Eliciting Knowledge from Large Language Models with Naturally-Embedded Prompts"** demonstrated how carefully constructed prompts can elicit domain-specific knowledge from LLMs without fine-tuning, while Vatsal and Dubey **Vatsal and Dubey, "Prompt Engineering for Natural Language Processing Tasks: A Review"** provided various methods / frameworks for evaluating prompt effectiveness in various NLP tasks. However, applications in financial sentiment analysis have been limited, with most approaches focusing on model architecture modifications rather than prompt optimization.
