\BfPara{Benchmark}
To evaluate the performance of the proposed AutoBS framework, we compare it against two baseline methods: a heuristic-based deployment and an exhaustive search strategy. These baselines serve as the lower and upper bounds for performance comparison.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heuristic}:    
    The heuristic deployment method randomly places BSs within the deployable area (\ie $\mathcal{B}$), without incorporating learning or optimization. This simple approach serves as a performance lower bound, as it overlooks the impact of the site-specific information on the channel. It is also the assumption underlying stochastic-geometry system evaluations \cite{haenggi2012stochastic}.

    \item \textbf{Exhaustive}:    
    The exhaustive search provides an upper bound for performance by systematically evaluating all possible BS placement configurations across the site-specific map. It guarantees a global optimal solution in terms of coverage or capacity based on the configuration criteria. However, the computational cost is exceedingly high, particularly for multi-BS deployments, as the complexity grows exponentially with the number of BSs and map size. Due to this limitation, the exhaustive search is restricted to $50$ samples in our baseline experiments. Additionally, in multi-BS deployments, the exhaustive method operates synchronously, unlike the asynchronous deployment strategy used by AutoBS. While an asynchronous exhaustive method could be defined to reduce computation time somewhat, it would still be computationally intense and would yield suboptimal results. Our focus remains on synchronous exhaustive deployment as it provides a true upper bound for comparison with AutoBS.

    \item \textbf{AutoBS (Proposed)}:    
    The AutoBS leverages the PPO agent to make near-optimal BS deployment decisions in real time. It is trained using a fully connected neural network with four layers, each consisting of 128 nodes, to optimize both coverage and capacity. AutoBS achieves rapid deployment decisions at millisecond timescales. 
    %, aided by the PMNet framework for fast and accurate pathloss predictions. With its focus on balancing performance and computational efficiency, AutoBS offers a practical, scalable solution suitable for large-scale network deployments.

\BfPara{Comparison}
Table \ref{table:comparison_singlebs} presents the performance of Heuristic, Exhaustive, and AutoBS deployments. AutoBS achieves significant improvements in both coverage and capacity compared to Heuristic deployment. Its performance closely approaches that of the Exhaustive method, which represents the global optimal solution, highlighting the effectiveness of policy-guided BS placement.

AutoBS focuses on coverage optimization through a reward function based on pathloss predictions from PMNet. Although capacity metrics are not explicitly included in the reward function (\ie $\nu_2=0$), the observed capacity difference between AutoBS and Exhaustive search remains minimal—which will be further discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:appendix}. 
%By balancing computational efficiency and network performance, AutoBS offers a scalable and practical solution for real-world, large-scale deployments.

\BfPara{Coverage}
Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_coverage_singlebs} presents the coverage results for single BS deployment. The building map, representing the input state, includes key geographical features such as buildings and obstacles, which significantly affect BS placement and signal propagation.

In the \emph{Heuristic} method, BSs are placed randomly across the deployable area, leading to inefficient coverage with noticeable gaps. This highlights the limitations of non-optimized deployments. The \emph{Exhaustive} search method evaluates every possible BS placement option, achieving the best coverage by systematically considering all configurations, but at the price of much higher complexity. 
%While this guarantees optimal results, it is computationally expensive and impractical for larger maps or multi-BS scenarios.

The \emph{AutoBS} method, trained with the PPO algorithm and PMNet for fast pathloss predictions, achieves coverage performance close to the exhaustive search but at a fraction of the computational cost. 
%Although AutoBS doesn’t guarantee the absolute optimal solution, its learned policy effectively balances performance and efficiency.

It is important to note that AutoBS uses PMNet during training for fast and accurate pathloss map generation. \footnote{The plots are generated with SionnaRT purely because of its nicer graphical representation (the underlying numerical results are identical to those obtained with PMNet).} 
%, while SionnaRT, which is more detailed but computationally demanding, is used only for visualization purposes and not for training \footnote{}.

\BfPara{Convergence}
Fig. \ref{fig:convergence_singlebs} presents the convergence behavior for single BS deployment, comparing the AutoBS with Heuristic and Exhaustive methods (note that Heuristic and Exhaustive methods do not involve iterative learning). The AutoBS stabilizes between $50$ to $100$ training episodes, approaching the performance of the global optimal solution (\ie Exhaustive), demonstrating its efficient learning and stable convergence.

%It is important to note that the Heuristic and Exhaustive methods do not involve iterative learning. The Heuristic deployment serves as a baseline, reflecting non-optimized lower-bound performance, while the Exhaustive deployment represents the global optimum but at the cost of high computational complexity. AutoBS offers a practical balance between optimality and computational efficiency. 
% Further quantitative comparisons of coverage and capacity can be found in Table~\ref{table:comparison_singlebs}.

\BfPara{Multi-BS Deployment (Asynchronous)}
Table \ref{table:comparison_multibs} and Fig. \ref{fig:comparison_coverage_multibs} present the results for asynchronous multi-BS deployment. 
The reward function is computed based only on the specific metrics (e.g., coverage, capacity, and/or pathgain) of each newly deployed BS. For example, when deploying the second BS, only the performance metrics for that BS are considered in the reward calculation.

For the multi-BS case, AutoBS performs an asynchronous deployment, \ie adds one BS at a time,  in a "greedy" manner. This can be a practical requirement, \eg when adding BSs to an existing infrastructure. In a greenfield deployment (like investigated here), the sequential approach will give worse results than a synchronous approach. Potential iterations to fine-tune already-placed BSs will be subject of our future research.

\label{table:comparison_multibs}
\vspace{-.5em}
\end{table}

While the overall findings align with those from the single (static) BS deployment, some notable insights emerge. One key observation is that deploying two BSs using the Heuristic method performs similarly or even worse than deploying a single BS with AutoBS or Exhaustive search in terms of coverage and capacity. This emphasizes the critical role of optimized deployment strategies. As shown in Table \ref{table:comparison_multibs} for Heuristic and Table \ref{table:comparison_singlebs} for AutoBS and Exhaustive search, non-optimized deployments fall short even when more BSs are deployed.

These findings highlight two key aspects. First, AutoBS, despite using an asynchronous deployment strategy, achieves $90$\% of the capacity of the global optimum (\ie provided by the exhaustive method). Second, AutoBS’s ability to learn site-specific characteristics enables it to efficiently deploy BSs. 
% The results demonstrate that AutoBS offers a scalable, practical alternative to exhaustive search, achieving competitive performance without the prohibitive computational costs—which will be elaborated in the following.
% Another key insight is the minimal convergence gap between AutoBS and Exhaustive search, especially in the multi-BS scenario, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:convergence_multibs}.

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}
Table \ref{table:complexity} highlights the time complexity analysis, emphasizing a key advantage of AutoBS: its ability to drastically reduce inference time, achieving millisecond-level decisions even in multi-BS deployments. 
%AutoBS efficiently determines near-optimal deployment locations with minimal computational overhead, presenting high performance in both single and multi-BS scenarios.

The efficiency gains are particularly notable in multi-BS deployments, where exhaustive search faces exponential complexity. AutoBS’s asynchronous deployment strategy enables it to scale seamlessly with growing network size, making it well-suited for large-scale networks and real-time optimization. 
% By balancing computational efficiency with near-optimal performance, AutoBS offers a practical, scalable solution for network operators to manage complex deployment challenges in dynamic environments.
