\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents AutoBS, a RL-based framework for optimal BS deployment in 6G networks. By leveraging the PPO algorithm and integrating fast, accurate pathloss predictions from PMNet, AutoBS efficiently learns deployment strategies that adapt to site-specific channel dynamics, balancing coverage and capacity.

Our results show that AutoBS achieves up to $95 \%$ of the capacity obtained by exhaustive search methods, while dramatically reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. This makes AutoBS a practical solution for real-time deployments. With its ability to provide near-optimal performance and scale efficiently, AutoBS stands out as a powerful, automated solution tailored for the demands of large-scale 6G networks.

While AutoBS is designed for BS deployment in 6G networks, its framework can be easily adapted for other DT-based network optimization tasks, \eg mobility management and link adaptation, by modifying the reward function and state information to match specific application goals. Furthermore, the flexible design of AutoBS makes it well-suited for additional applications, including Wi-Fi access point (AP) placement and O-RAN radio unit (RU) deployment.
