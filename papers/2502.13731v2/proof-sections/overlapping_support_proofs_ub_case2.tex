\paragraph{Case 2: $\tilde{s}' \neq s_{t+1}$ and $\dfrac{P(s_{t+1} \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)}>\dfrac{P(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t)}$ and $P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t) > 0$}
\noindent
\begin{proof}
Because $\dfrac{P(s_{t+1} \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)}>\dfrac{P(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t)}$ and $P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t) > 0$, to satisfy CS \eqref{proofeq:counterfactual stability} we must always have $\tilde{P}_{t}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$, therefore $\tilde{P}_{t}^{UB}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$. From Case 1, we know that we can find an assignment of $\theta$ that satisfies CS \eqref{proofeq:counterfactual stability} for all transitions, when finding the upper bound of the transition $\tilde{s}, \tilde{a} \rightarrow s_{t+1}$. Therefore, we have already proven in Case 1 that there exists an assignment of $\theta$ where $\tilde{P}_{t}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$, that satisfies the constraints \eqref{proofeq:interventional constraint}-\eqref{proofeq:valid prob2}. Therefore, there exists an assignment of $\theta$ that satisfies $\tilde{P}_{t}^{UB}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$.
