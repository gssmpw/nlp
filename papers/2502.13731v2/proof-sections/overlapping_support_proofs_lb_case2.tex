\paragraph{Case 2: $\tilde{s}' \neq s_{t+1}$, $\dfrac{P(s_{t+1} \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)}>\dfrac{P(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t)}$ and $P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t) > 0$}
\noindent
\begin{proof}
Because $\dfrac{P(s_{t+1} \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)}>\dfrac{P(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a})}{P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t)}$ and $P(\tilde{s}' \mid s_t, a_t) > 0$, to satisfy CS \eqref{proofeq:counterfactual stability} $\tilde{P}_{t}^{LB}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$. We have already proven in Case 2 of the proof for Theorem \ref{proof theorem:ub overlapping} that there exists an assignment of $\theta$ that satisfies all the constraints, where $\tilde{P}_{t}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$. Therefore, the same assignment of $\theta$ will satisfy the constraints of the optimisation problem, and result in $\tilde{P}_{t}^{LB}(\tilde{s}' \mid \tilde{s}, \tilde{a}) = 0$.
