\section{Conclusion} \jl{This paper addresses a key limitation in existing counterfactual inference methods for MDPs, introducing the first partial counterfactual inference approach that can efficiently handle large state and action spaces in MDPs, eliminating the need for an assumed causal model.} A major contribution of this work is deriving exact analytical counterfactual probability bounds, which makes our method significantly faster than the (widely-used) Gumbel-max SCM method. Moreover, counterfactual policies derived from the interval CFMDP offer greater robustness to uncertainty about the true counterfactual MDP, especially in environments with high stochasticity.
As a result, our approach provides a more reliable explanation of how an observed policy could be improved, which is crucial for safety-critical applications.

\paragraph{Future Work} \jl{Like most existing methods, we assume access to the MDP's true transition probabilities and full state observability. Future work will focus on relaxing these assumptions by learning transition probabilities from data (with uncertainty bounds) and developing approaches for partially observable and continuous-state MDPs.}
