\label{sec:conclusions}

This work provides the first study on multi-die and multi-technology floorplanning, to the best of our knowledge. Post-placement analysis using a commercial tool demonstrates that the proposed techniques outperforms a na\"ive baseline in terms of wirelength, area, power, timing and die cost.
In our future research, we plan to extend this method to additionally address thermal and warpage issues.
