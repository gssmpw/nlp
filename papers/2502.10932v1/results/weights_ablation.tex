\subsection{Correlation Between Area, Cost and Power}
% \subsection{Correlation Between Area, Cost and PowerEffect of weights $\gamma, \beta$}

Although area is not explicitly included in our objective
function~\eqref{eq:objective}. It can be controlled by varying the weights $\gamma$ for cost
and $\beta$ for power, due to their correlation.  
%for emphasizes the cost and power reduction respectively. The cost model in Section~\ref{sec:cost_model} is a function of the die area, and power consumption is frequently correlated to the area as well. 
This is confirmed by running MMFP-RL on the \emph{vga\_lcd} design with various values of $\gamma$
and $\beta$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_weights}. Increasing either $\gamma$ or $\beta$ leads to a reduction in the total area.
%shows the area results as the weighting factors $\gamma$ and $\beta$ vary. Thus, the area reduction is indirectly determined by the optimization of cost and power. In addition, the area objective is limited as $\gamma$ and $\beta$ increase due to the HPWL and total negative slack objectives.
