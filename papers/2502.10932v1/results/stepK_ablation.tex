\subsection{Impact of Interval $K$ for Inter-die Refinement}
In our MMFP, inter-die refinement is performed
after every $K$ SA moves (or RL actions).
Figure~\ref{fig:step_K} shows the objective function
$f$ versus different values of $K$ for both MMFP-SA and MMFP-RL on the \emph{netcard} design. As expected, both too small or too large values of $K$ lead to degraded objective function results, and the best results are obtained when 
$K=20.$
