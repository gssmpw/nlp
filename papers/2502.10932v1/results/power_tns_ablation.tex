\subsection{Timing-Power Tradeoff}

Figure~\ref{fig:power_timing_tradeoff} shows the TNS-power tradeoff obtained by varying weighting factors for running MMFP-RL on the \emph{vga\_lcd} design.
$\beta$ is the weight for power, and $\tau$ the weight for TNS, in the objective function~\eqref{eq:objective}. As $\beta$ is increased, power decreases and TNS worsens. Likewise, as $\tau$ is increased, power increases and TNS becomes less negative. Therefore, by varying the weighting factors, we can easily obtain different timing-power tradeoffs.
