\subsection{Impact of Constraint $N_{max}$ in Results}
In Section~\ref{sec:formulation}, the number of nets between two dies is constrained by $N_{max}$ that also determines the spacing between dies as described in Section \ref{sec:refinement}. Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_nmax} shows that additional reductions in terms of area, HPWL, cost and power can be achieved for MMFP-RL as $N_{max}$ decreases at the cost of less improvement of the post-placement TNS. Moreover, the MMFP-RL solutions for $N_{max}{=}10$ and $20$ are similar  since the min spacing between dies is limited by $15$; however, the post-placement TNS for $10$ is worse compared to $20$ since the max nets limits the timing performance.
