\section{The Proposed Method}
\label{sec:method}

An overview of the proposed MMFP methodology is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}. It consists of the initial die assignment, intra-die floorplanning, and inter-die refinement. Two techniques are developed for intra-die floorplanning: simulated annealing and reinforcement learning. The details are described as follows.
