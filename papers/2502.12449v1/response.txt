The skyline detection algorithms can be grouped by two main categories. The first group methods are mainly designed based on feature descriptor and machine learning technologies. These methods are proposed for a long time, so they are regarded as traditional methods. For example, Cornall \textit{et al.}, "Feature-Based Skyline Detection" 
Chiu \textit{et al.}, "Brightness and Contrast Information-Based Skyline Curve Extraction"
Lie \textit{et al.}, "Edge Map Construction for Skyline Detection"
Dong \textit{et al.}, "Local Maximum Grayscale Complexity-Based Image Binarization"
They identified regions with relatively high complexity, such as the sea-to-sky convergence line, and used HT to find the skyline.. Fefilatyev \textit{et al.}, "Texture and Color Feature-Based Sky Region Classification Using SVM"
Ahmad \textit{et al.}, "Skyline Detection Using Machine Learning and Dynamic Programming"
In this approach, each pixel is assigned a classification score as a likelihood of the pixel belonging to the horizon line, and representing the classification map as a multi-stage graph. Using DP, the horizon line can be extracted by finding the path that maximizes the sum of classification scores. Ahmad \textit{et al.}, "Skyline Detection Using Learned Filters Based on Local Structure Tensors"
 Generally speaking, the traditional methods require manual design of image feature, and a few labeled data for the training of classifiers or filters. Because of  unreliability of feature design and small amount of model parameters, the robustness of traditional methods are usually unsatisfactory for variety of lightness and weather. 
\par The recent second group methods are mainly based on deep learning technologies, which employs trainable deep neural networks for skyline extraction. For example, Verbickas and Whitehead, "Convolutional Neural Networks for Horizon Detection"
Poriz \textit{et al.}, "Sky Segmentation Based on Improved U-Net Architecture", 
Frajberg \textit{et al.}, "Mountain Skyline Extraction Using CNN" 
Yang \textit{et al.}, "Sea-Sky-Line Detection Using YOLOv5"
Li \textit{et al.}, "Skyline Extraction Using Deep Neural Network Heatmap Output"
Ahmad \textit{et al.}, "Comparison of Four Sky Segment Approaches Including Edge-less Horizontal Detection, Automatic Labeling Environment, Fully Convolutional Network, and SegNet" 
 In this comparing work, the validation test indicated the performance of FCN is best for sky segmentation of mountainous imagery. The deep learning methods are mainly designed based on deep neural networks, which usually contain a large amount of parameters. Their robustness is better than those traditional methods. Simultaneously, the more labeled data is indispensable for the training of deep neural networks.
