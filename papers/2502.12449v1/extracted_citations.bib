abstract="Outdoor augmented reality applications are an emerging class of software systems that demand the fast identification of natural objects, such as plant species or mountain peaks, in low power mobile devices. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have exhibited superior performance in a variety of computer vision tasks, but their training is a labor intensive task and their execution requires non negligible memory and CPU resources. This paper presents the results of training a CNN for the fast extraction of mountain skylines, which exhibits a good balance between accuracy (94,45{\%} in best conditions and 86,87{\%} in worst conditions), memory consumption (9,36 MB on average) and runtime execution overhead (273 ms on a Nexus 6 mobile phone), and thus has been exploited for implementing a real-world augmented reality applications for mountain peak recognition running on low to mid-end mobile phones.",

abstract = {In this paper, a skyline image detection algorithm is proposed for navigation of mobile vehicles or planes in mountainous environments. First, edge detection and subsequent binary thresholding are applied on the luminance component to obtain the edge map, from which a multi-stage graph is constructed for determining the skyline curve by using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. In optimal DP search, characteristics (e.g., preferred position and orientation) of the skyline are utilized to help in correct linking of curves. The tolerance in short breakage of skyline curve is considered for robustness consideration. Experiments show that the processing speed is fast (approximately 0.12–0.21 s for a 352×240 pixel image on a Pentium-M 1.3 GHz CPU) and promising for real-time applications.}

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",
