abstract = {The utility of micro air vehicles (MAVs) has expanded significantly in the last decade, and there are now numerous commercial systems available at relatively low cost. This expansion has arisen mainly due to the miniaturisation of flight control systems and advances in energy storage and propulsion technologies. Several emerging applications involve routine operation of MAVs in complex urban environments such as parcel delivery, communications relay and environmental monitoring. However, MAVs currently rely on one or more operators-in-the-loop and, whilst desirable, full autonomous operation has not yet been achieved. In this review paper, autonomous MAV operation in complex environments is explored with conceptualisation for future MAV operation in urban environments. Limitations of current technologies are systematically examined through consideration of the state-of-the-art and future trends. The main limitations challenging the realisation of fully autonomous MAVs are mainly attributed to: computational power, communication and energy storage. These limitations lead to poor sensing and planning capabilities, which are essential components of autonomous MAVs. Possible solutions are explored with goal of enabling MAVs to reliably operate autonomously in urban environments.}

abstract = {In this paper, a skyline image detection algorithm is proposed for navigation of mobile vehicles or planes in mountainous environments. First, edge detection and subsequent binary thresholding are applied on the luminance component to obtain the edge map, from which a multi-stage graph is constructed for determining the skyline curve by using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. In optimal DP search, characteristics (e.g., preferred position and orientation) of the skyline are utilized to help in correct linking of curves. The tolerance in short breakage of skyline curve is considered for robustness consideration. Experiments show that the processing speed is fast (approximately 0.12–0.21 s for a 352×240 pixel image on a Pentium-M 1.3 GHz CPU) and promising for real-time applications.}

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

ABSTRACT = {Sky and ground are two essential semantic components in computer vision, robotics, and remote sensing. The sky and ground segmentation has become increasingly popular. This research proposes a sky and ground segmentation framework for the rover navigation visions by adopting weak supervision and transfer learning technologies. A new sky and ground segmentation neural network (network in U-shaped network (NI-U-Net)) and a conservative annotation method have been proposed. The pre-trained process achieves the best results on a popular open benchmark (the Skyfinder dataset) by evaluating seven metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. These seven metrics achieve 99.232%, 99.211%, 99.221%, 99.104%, 0.0077, 0.0427, and 98.223% on accuracy, precision, recall, dice score (F1), misclassification rate (MCR), root mean squared error (RMSE), and intersection over union (IoU), respectively. The conservative annotation method achieves superior performance with limited manual intervention. The NI-U-Net can operate with 40 frames per second (FPS) to maintain the real-time property. The proposed framework successfully fills the gap between the laboratory results (with rich idea data) and the practical application (in the wild). The achievement can provide essential semantic information (sky and ground) for the rover navigation vision.},

abstract="This paper is dedicated to the problem of automatic skyline extraction in digital images. The study is motivated by the needs, expressed by urbanists, to describe in terms of geometrical features, the global shape created by man-made buildings in urban areas. Skyline extraction has been widely studied for navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) or for geolocalization, both in natural and urban contexts. In most of these studies, the skyline is defined by the limit between sky and ground objects, and can thus be resumed to the sky segmentation problem in images. In our context, we need a more generic definition of skyline, which makes its extraction more complex and even variable. The skyline can be extracted for different depths, depending on the interest of the user (far horizon, intermediate buildings, near constructions, ...), and thus requires a human interaction. The main steps of our method are as follows: we use a Canny filter to extract edges and allow the user to interact with filter's parameters. With a high sensitivity, all the edges will be detected, whereas with lower values, only most contrasted contours will be kept by the filter. From the obtained edge map, an upper envelope is extracted, which is a disconnected approximation of the skyline. A graph is then constructed and a shortest path algorithm is used to link discontinuities. Our approach has been tested on several public domain urban and natural databases, and have proven to give better results that previously published methods.",
