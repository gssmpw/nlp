\section{Implementation Overview}

We implemented EdgeMLBalancer as a mobile application, designed to run on Android Devices. The application was developed using Android Studio \cite{b24}, with the primary algorithms written in Kotlin\footnote{\url{https://kotlinlang.org/}}. The TensorFlow Lite library\footnote{\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions}} was employed for on-device ML model inference, ensuring compatibility with edge-devices. The application integrates \textit{CameraX API}\footnote{\url{https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camerax}} for real-time video feed processing and \textit{MetricLogger} for monitoring and logging system metrics, including CPU usage, and model accuracy. The logging functionality write metrics to CSV file for later analysis. The source code, datasets, and ML models are available here.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sa4s-serc/EdgeMLBalancer}}
