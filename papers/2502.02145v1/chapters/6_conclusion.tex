\section{Conclusion \& Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper proposes a novel LLMs-based scenario analysis framework to assess the safety-criticality of driving scenarios from CommonRoad across different models and prompt templates. We empirically evaluate the performance of our framework and prove the reasoning and understanding ability of LLMs in driving scenario analysis. We also extend the proposed framework to generate new safety-critical scenarios by using the adversarial method in consideration of the feedback from LLMs. For future work, we could extend this framework to another simulator, such as in nuPlan and CARLA; we will also develop systematic templates to enhance the LLMs-based adversarial scenario generation.
