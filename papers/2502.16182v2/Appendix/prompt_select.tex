\section{Prompts}
\label{Prompts_table}
Based on the predefined categories, a pool of N prompts were generated using GPT. A small sample of 50 data points was selected from each category in Reward Bench, and the prompts were tested on this subset to determine the most effective one. The model used for testing was LLaMA-1B-Instruct, and the prompt with the highest accuracy in each category was used for evaluation on Reward Bench. The final set of selected prompts for Reward Bench evaluations are shown in Table \ref{Prompts} and those for DPO are shown in \ref{dpo_prompts} .

\textbf{Note:} For DPO-based training, instructions were classified into four categories

Categories of Prompts: 
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0.05em} % Adjust the space between items
  \item \textbf{Code:} Questions that involve generating or interpreting code.
  \item \textbf{Math:} Questions related to mathematical computations or reasoning.
  \item \textbf{Chat:} General conversational questions, often open-ended or casual.
  \item \textbf{Safety:} Questions focused on evaluating or ensuring safety in responses.
  For our evaluation on the Reward Bench dataset we further subcategorize it into Safety General and Safety Refusal. 
\end{itemize}
