\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

We have proposed a method for synthesis of neural-network certificates, based only on a finite number of trajectories from a system, in order to verify a number of core temporally extended specifications.  
These certificates allow providing assertions on the satisfaction of the properties of interest. 
In order to synthesize a certificate, we considered a novel algorithm for solving a non-convex optimization program where the loss function we seek to minimize encodes different conditions on the certificate to be learned. 
As a byproduct of our algorithm, we determine a quantity termed ``compression'', which is instrumental in obtaining scalable probabilistic guarantees. 
This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general
non-convex optimization problems.
Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on a number of examples, involving comparison with related methodologies in the literature. 

Current work concentrates towards extending our analysis to continuous-time dynamical systems, as well as on considering controlled systems, thus co-designing a controller and a certificate at the same time.
