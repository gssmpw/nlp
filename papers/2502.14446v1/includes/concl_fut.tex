\section{Conclusions}
We presented a LSH based algorithm for the motif discovery problem in multidimensional time series providing strong guarantees on the quality of the results with a user defined probability.
The developed approach and the correlated optimizations exhibit desirable properties, such as scalability, data adaptability, invariance to noisy dimensions, constrained search and anytime compatibility.
Experimental evidence supports the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, demonstrating that it is able to find motifs with only a fraction of all possible distance computations.
