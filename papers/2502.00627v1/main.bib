abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

  abstract = {GDELT—Global Data on Events, Location and Tone—is a new CAMEO-coded data
set containing more than 200-million geolocated events with global coverage for 1979 to
the present. The data are based on news reports from a variety of international news
sources coded using the Tabari system for events and additional software for location
and tone. The data is freely available and we expect to provide daily updates. This
paper describes the news sources and some of their characteristics, the various pro-
cessing steps that are used in generating the data, some comparisons with the KEDS
Levants/Reuters and ICEWS/Asia data sets, and some visualizations. We conclude
with an outline of planned enhancements to the data in the near future: these include
recoding with new WordNet-enhanced dictionaries, the extension of the CAMEO cod-
ing to incorporate codes for financial events, disease outbreaks and natural disasters,
and the development of an open-source Python-based successor to Tabari which will
use parsed input from existing natural language processing tools.},

In this work, we present SocialDrought, a novel and comprehensive dataset to facilitate research on the societal impacts of drought. In particular, SocialDrought consists of three major components: 1) over 1.5 million social media posts, 2) over 1,400 news articles collected and verified by domain experts, and 3) over 31,000 meteorological records from the U.S. Drought Monitor about drought severity. In addition, we also introduce an online analytical platform that enables interactive and real-time data exploration to gain timely insights into the societal impacts of drought. Our interdisciplinary dataset integrates both conventional meteorological data and unconventional social and news media data to provide a holistic understanding of drought impacts.

One active community on both Reddit and Discord is dankmemes. Our study aims to examine differences in harmful language usage across different platforms in a community. We scrape 15 communities that are active on both Reddit and Discord. We then identify and compare differences in type and level of toxicity, in the topics of the harmful discourse, in the temporal evolution of toxicity and its attribution to users, and in the moderation strategies communities across platforms. Our results show that most communities exhibit differences in toxicity depending on the platform. We see that toxicity is rooted in the different subcultures as well as in the way in which the platforms operate and their administrators moderate content. However, we note that in general terms Discord is significantly more toxic than Reddit. We offer a detailed analysis of the topics and types of communities in which this happens and why, which will help moderators and policymakers shape their strategies to mitigate the harm on the Web. In particular, we propose practical and effective strategies that Discord can implement to improve its platform moderation.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Singh, Ashwini Kumar and Ghafouri, Vahid and Such, Jose and Suarez-Tangil, Guillermo}, year={2024}, month={May}, pages={1463-1476} }

abstract="With the rise of social media, an increase of hateful content online can be observed. Even though the understanding and definitions of hate speech vary, platforms, communities, and legislature all acknowledge the challenge. Adolescents are a new and active group of social media users. The majority of adolescents experience or witness online hate speech. Research in the field of automated hate speech classification has been on the rise and focuses on aspects such as bias, generalizability, and performance. To increase generalizability and performance, it is important to understand biases within the data. This research addresses the bias of youth language within hate speech classification and contributes by providing a modern and anonymized hate speech youth language data set consisting of 88.395 annotated chat messages. The data set consists of publicly available online messages from the chat platform Discord. For 35.553 messages, the user profiles provided age annotations, setting the average author age to under 20 years old. 6,4{\%} of the total messages were classified as hate speech using the annotation schema, which was adapted for this data set.",

        abstract = {Discord is a platform for online communication. While its original audience
mostly consisted of people playing video games, a shift took place in its
usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowadays the same application is
used by book clubs, students and teachers and other communities. But what
role does the platform play in connecting these individuals? The versatility
of the platform means people can communicate in a multitude of different
ways. So how do people use the platform to reach each other? This paper
tries to give an insight into the relations between users within different
communities. A tool is created to extract data from the platform after which
it is used to create an overview of the nature of connections between users.
This data is then used to look at the usage of different mechanisms to enhance
messaging. Where mechanisms like mentions and replies to messages are
used quite extensively, other special mentions like @here and @everyone
are sparingly used. But why is this? In this paper we try to give explanations
for this phenomenon, providing an insight into how users connect on the
platform.},

abstract = {Adopting new technology is challenging for volunteer moderation teams of online communities. Challenges are aggravated when communities increase in size. In a prior qualitative study, Kiene et al. found evidence that moderator teams adapted to challenges by relying on their experience in other technological platforms to guide the creation and adoption of innovative custom moderation "bots." In this study, we test three hypotheses on the social correlates of user innovated bot usage drawn from a previous qualitative study. We find strong evidence of the proposed relationship between community size and the use of user innovated bots. Although previous work suggests that smaller teams of moderators will be more likely to use these bots and that users with experience moderating in the previous platform will be more likely to do so, we find little evidence in support of either proposition.},

abstract = {Research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like Wikipedia, Facebook Groups, and Reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. In this work I review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for researchers studying community self-moderation. I contrast community-based moderation research with platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. I provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion.},

    abstract = { Online communities provide a forum for rich social interaction and identity development for billions of Internet users worldwide. In order to manage these communities, platform owners have increasingly turned to commercial content moderation, which includes both the use of moderation algorithms and the employment of professional moderators, rather than user-driven moderation, to detect and respond to anti-normative behaviors such as harassment and spread of offensive content. We present findings from semi-structured interviews with 56 volunteer moderators of online communities across three platforms (Twitch, Reddit, and Facebook), from which we derived a generalized model categorizing the ways moderators engage with their communities and explaining how these communities develop as a result. This model contains three processes: being and becoming a moderator; moderation tasks, actions, and responses; and rules and community development. In this work, we describe how moderators contribute to the development of meaningful communities, both with and without algorithmic support. }

Koo, a microblogging platform based in India, has emerged as a major new social network hosting high profile politicians from several countries (India, Brazil, Nigeria) and many internationally renowned celebrities. This paper presents the largest publicly available Koo dataset, spanning from the platform’s founding in early 2020 to September 2023, providing detailed metadata for 72M posts, 75M comments, 40M shares, 284M likes and 1.4M user profiles. Along with the release of the dataset, we provide an overview of the platform including a discussion of the news ecosystem on the platform, hashtag usage, and user engagement. Our results highlight the pivotal role that new platforms play in shaping online communities in emerging economies and the Global South, connecting local politicians and public figures with their followers.

  abstract  = {Online social networks (OSNs) are rapidly growing and have become a huge source of all kinds of global and local news for millions of users. However, OSNs are a double-edged sword. Although the great advantages they offer such as unlimited easy communication and instant news and information, they can also have many disadvantages and issues. One of their major challenging issues is the spread of fake news. Fake news identification is still a complex unresolved issue. Furthermore, fake news detection on OSNs presents unique characteristics and challenges that make finding a solution anything but trivial. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are still incapable of overcoming this challenging problem. To make matters worse, AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning are leveraged to deceive people by creating and disseminating fake content. Consequently, automatic fake news detection remains a huge challenge, primarily because the content is designed in a way to closely resemble the truth, and it is often hard to determine its veracity by AI alone without additional information from third parties. This work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of fake news research as well as a fundamental review of existing approaches used to detect and prevent fake news from spreading via OSNs. We present the research problem and the existing challenges, discuss the state of the art in existing approaches for fake news detection, and point out the future research directions in tackling the challenges.},

abstract = {Online social media represent an oftentimes unique source of information, and having access to reliable and unbiased content is crucial, especially during crises and contentious events. We study the spread of propaganda and misinformation that circulated on Facebook and Twitter during the first few months of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. By leveraging two large datasets of millions of social media posts, we estimate the prevalence of Russian propaganda and low-credibility content on the two platforms, describing temporal patterns and highlighting the disproportionate role played by superspreaders in amplifying unreliable content. We infer the political leaning of Facebook pages and Twitter users sharing propaganda and misinformation, and observe they tend to be more right-leaning than the average. By estimating the amount of content moderated by the two platforms, we show that only about 8-15\% of the posts and tweets sharing links to Russian propaganda or untrustworthy sources were removed. Overall, our findings show that Facebook and Twitter are still vulnerable to abuse, especially during crises: we highlight the need to urgently address this issue to preserve the integrity of online conversations.},

abstract = {Low uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the US has been widely attributed to social media misinformation. To evaluate this claim, we introduce a framework combining lab experiments (total N = 18,725), crowdsourcing, and machine learning to estimate the causal effect of 13,206 vaccine-related URLs on the vaccination intentions of US Facebook users (N ≈ 233 million). We estimate that the impact of unflagged content that nonetheless encouraged vaccine skepticism was 46-fold greater than that of misinformation flagged by fact-checkers. Although misinformation reduced predicted vaccination intentions significantly more than unflagged vaccine content when viewed, Facebook users’ exposure to flagged content was limited. In contrast, unflagged stories highlighting rare deaths after vaccination were among Facebook’s most-viewed stories. Our work emphasizes the need to scrutinize factually accurate but potentially misleading content in addition to outright falsehoods. The COVID-19 pandemic was exacerbated by poor utilization of vaccines caused by the spread of misinformation. Fortunately, the impact of flagrant vaccine misinformation on Facebook was greatly attenuated once such posts were flagged and debunked as false by third-party fact-checkers. However, ambiguous misinformation remained unflagged. Allen et al. examined a gray area that eluded fact-checkers: factually accurate but deceptive content (see the Perspective by van der Linden and Kyrychenko). This unflagged content cast doubts on vaccine safety or efficacy and was 46-fold more consequential for driving vaccine hesitancy than flagged misinformation. Tech companies assert that unflagged content must be protected by First Amendment free speech rights. However, this study’s causal evidence that unflagged content posed the greatest threat to public health carries policy implications for government regulation needed to save lives. —Ekeoma Uzogara}}
