\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

This study introduces the Discord Unveiled Dataset, a comprehensive and ethically curated resource encompassing over 3,000 public servers and 2 billion messages exchanged on Discord. By leveraging Discord's API and implementing anonymization protocols, we ensured compliance with privacy standards while maintaining the analytical utility of the dataset. Spanning nearly a decade of public interactions, the dataset provides a robust foundation for investigating decentralized moderation, online community dynamics, and patterns of digital communication.

The dataset highlights the distinctive features of Discord as a platform, particularly its user-driven moderation model and the extensive use of bots to enhance functionality. These characteristics differentiate Discord from more centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter, offering a novel perspective on how decentralized platforms shape online interactions. Additionally, the dataset's multilingual and multifaceted nature opens avenues for research on underexplored languages and cultures in digital spaces, addressing gaps in computational social science. 

However, the dataset still has limitations, most notably the absence of detailed user-level data, such as demographic information and activity patterns, which could enrich analyses of individual behavior and group dynamics. This limitation reflects the constraints of Discord's API and underscores the need for complementary data sources to achieve a more granular understanding. Additionally, it is essential to address potential risks and ethical concerns. The dataset could be misused to develop tools that amplify misinformation, harassment, or other harmful behaviors. To mitigate these risks, we adhered to strict ethical guidelines during dataset creation, employing robust anonymization protocols and privacy-compliance measures to protect user identities. %We encourage researchers to engage with ethical review processes, critically assess the societal implications of their work, and ensure responsible data use. 

Despite these challenges, we believe the Discord Unveiled Dataset will serve as a valuable resource for advancing computational and social science research, fostering a deeper understanding of the complexities of modern digital platforms. %By releasing this dataset, we aim to bridge the gap in research on Discord and offer a valuable resource that fosters a nuanced understanding of the complexities of contemporary digital platforms.
