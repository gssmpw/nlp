abstract="With the rise of social media, an increase of hateful content online can be observed. Even though the understanding and definitions of hate speech vary, platforms, communities, and legislature all acknowledge the challenge. Adolescents are a new and active group of social media users. The majority of adolescents experience or witness online hate speech. Research in the field of automated hate speech classification has been on the rise and focuses on aspects such as bias, generalizability, and performance. To increase generalizability and performance, it is important to understand biases within the data. This research addresses the bias of youth language within hate speech classification and contributes by providing a modern and anonymized hate speech youth language data set consisting of 88.395 annotated chat messages. The data set consists of publicly available online messages from the chat platform Discord. For 35.553 messages, the user profiles provided age annotations, setting the average author age to under 20 years old. 6,4{\%} of the total messages were classified as hate speech using the annotation schema, which was adapted for this data set.",

  abstract = {GDELT—Global Data on Events, Location and Tone—is a new CAMEO-coded data
set containing more than 200-million geolocated events with global coverage for 1979 to
the present. The data are based on news reports from a variety of international news
sources coded using the Tabari system for events and additional software for location
and tone. The data is freely available and we expect to provide daily updates. This
paper describes the news sources and some of their characteristics, the various pro-
cessing steps that are used in generating the data, some comparisons with the KEDS
Levants/Reuters and ICEWS/Asia data sets, and some visualizations. We conclude
with an outline of planned enhancements to the data in the near future: these include
recoding with new WordNet-enhanced dictionaries, the extension of the CAMEO cod-
ing to incorporate codes for financial events, disease outbreaks and natural disasters,
and the development of an open-source Python-based successor to Tabari which will
use parsed input from existing natural language processing tools.},

While prior work has studied the impacts of drought using professionally measured data sources, the societal perspectives of drought impacts remain largely under-explored. In this work, we present SocialDrought, a novel and comprehensive dataset to facilitate research on the societal impacts of drought. In particular, SocialDrought consists of three major components: 1) over 1.5 million social media posts, 2) over 1,400 news articles collected and verified by domain experts, and 3) over 31,000 meteorological records from the U.S. Drought Monitor about drought severity. In addition, we also introduce an online analytical platform that enables interactive and real-time data exploration to gain timely insights into the societal impacts of drought. Our interdisciplinary dataset integrates both conventional meteorological data and unconventional social and news media data to provide a holistic understanding of drought impacts. SocialDrought opens new opportunities to study the societal impacts of drought through the lens of social and news media.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Shang, Lanyu and Chen, Bozhang and Vora, Anav and Zhang, Yang and Cai, Ximing and Wang, Dong}, year={2024}, month={May}, pages={2051-2062} }

One active community on both Reddit and Discord is dankmemes. Our study aims to examine differences in harmful language usage across different platforms in a community. We scrape 15 communities that are active on both Reddit and Discord. We then identify and compare differences in type and level of toxicity, in the topics of the harmful discourse, in the temporal evolution of toxicity and its attribution to users, and in the moderation strategies communities across platforms. Our results show that most communities exhibit differences in toxicity depending on the platform. We see that toxicity is rooted in the different subcultures as well as in the way in which the platforms operate and their administrators moderate content. However, we note that in general terms Discord is significantly more toxic than Reddit. We offer a detailed analysis of the topics and types of communities in which this happens and why, which will help moderators and policymakers shape their strategies to mitigate the harm on the Web. In particular, we propose practical and effective strategies that Discord can implement to improve its platform moderation.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Singh, Ashwini Kumar and Ghafouri, Vahid and Such, Jose and Suarez-Tangil, Guillermo}, year={2024}, month={May}, pages={1463-1476} }

Koo, a microblogging platform based in India, has emerged as a major new social network hosting high profile politicians from several countries (India, Brazil, Nigeria) and many internationally renowned celebrities. This paper presents the largest publicly available Koo dataset, spanning from the platform’s founding in early 2020 to September 2023, providing detailed metadata for 72M posts, 75M comments, 40M shares, 284M likes and 1.4M user profiles. Along with the release of the dataset, we provide an overview of the platform including a discussion of the news ecosystem on the platform, hashtag usage, and user engagement. Our results highlight the pivotal role that new platforms play in shaping online communities in emerging economies and the Global South, connecting local politicians and public figures with their followers. With Koo’s ambition to become the town hall for diverse non-English speaking communities, our dataset offers new opportunities for studying social media beyond a Western context.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Mekacher, Amin and Falkenberg, Max and Baronchelli, Andrea}, year={2024}, month={May}, pages={1991-2002} }
