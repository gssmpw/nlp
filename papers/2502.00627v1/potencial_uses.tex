\section{Potential Applications}

Our dataset represents the largest publicly available collection of textual data from Discord servers, offering an unprecedented resource for studying online interactions. The dataset spans a wide range of languages, cultures, and topics, making it uniquely suited to support a diverse cross-section of research efforts and laying a robust foundation for examining the complexities of online communities. Its breadth and depth enable researchers to explore critical areas such as discourse analysis, community governance, and political debate, making it an invaluable asset for interdisciplinary studies.\looseness=-1

\textbf{Online Community Governance.} Discord's user-driven moderation model stands apart from those used in platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which rely heavily on centralized moderation enforced by platform administrators or automated systems \cite{doi:10.1177/1461444818821316}. This decentralized approach enables server owners and moderators to define and enforce community-specific rules, offering an opportunity to explore how self-governance influences online interactions, social dynamics, and conflict resolution \cite{moderationbook}. Researchers can examine the efficacy of decentralized moderation in fostering inclusive and safe environments, the strategies employed by communities to address toxic behavior, and the broader impact of granting users autonomy in governing digital spaces \cite{succesfulcommunitybook}.

\textbf{Discourse analysis.} The dataset also provides a valuable resource for advancing research across multiple scientific domains, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). It enables the development and evaluation of models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, intent recognition, topic modeling, and toxic or abusive language detection. Moreover, the temporal structure of the data supports studies on conversational dynamics, social network analysis, and community behavior in digital environments. This dataset can also facilitate the creation of domain-specific chatbots, recommendation systems, and tools for automated moderation, fostering innovations that bridge computational techniques with the study of human communication and online interaction.

\textbf{Political Debate.} The political debate research community faces substantial challenges in understanding how both mainstream and decentralized platforms influence political opinions and behaviors. Social networks have become increasingly critical in shaping political landscapes, not only by amplifying voices and ideologies but also by contributing to the rapid dissemination of fake news and misinformation \cite{Aimeur2023}. While much of the existing research focuses on platforms like Facebook and Twitter \cite{10.1145/3578503.3583597, doi:10.1126/science.adk3451}, Discord’s semi-private and community-driven architecture offers a distinct and underexplored environment for political conversations. 
%This dynamic has raised significant concerns about the potential for unregulated spaces to facilitate polarization, radicalization, and the erosion of trust in democratic processes \cite{moderation-challenges}. At the same time, Discord's user-moderated model provides a valuable opportunity to study these phenomena in a decentralized context, contrasting with the centralized moderation models of mainstream platforms. -> Achei que estava redundante com outra parte do texto
Our dataset enables researchers to explore the impact of digital platforms on political discourse, the propagation of misinformation, and the development of effective moderation and regulation strategies tailored to such environments.

\textbf{Mental health.} The relationship between social media usage and the prevalence of mental health issues, including self-harm and suicidal behavior, has been extensively documented, particularly among younger demographics \cite{elia2020, pater2016characterizations}. Discord, as a platform with diverse communities and user-generated content, represents a critical environment for understanding these phenomena. Recent studies in Brazil have already looked at mental health in the context of Discord, underscoring the importance of examining how the platform’s semi-private and community-oriented spaces may influence mental health outcomes \cite{webmedia}. Our multilingual dataset significantly expands the scope for such research by enabling cross-cultural and cross-linguistic analyses of mental health trends and discourse on Discord, providing a valuable foundation for identifying patterns of at-risk behavior and explore critical questions such as the prevalence of harmful behaviors or supportive interactions.

% This dataset provides a unique opportunity to study user interactions, group dynamics, and information dissemination patterns within a controlled environment. Researchers can use it to examine the spread of trends, topics, and opinions over time, as well as analyze patterns of collaboration and conflict resolution in online communities. Such studies can reveal the underlying mechanisms of information flow and social influence within digital ecosystems.

% \subsection{Behavioral and Sentiment Analysis}
% With anonymized message content and metadata, the dataset enables researchers to detect behavioral trends and shifts in online activity. Sentiment analysis can be performed to measure emotional responses to events or announcements, offering insights into public sentiment on various issues. Additionally, the dataset can facilitate the study of how moderation policies affect user behavior, providing data-driven insights into the effectiveness of such interventions.

% \subsection{Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)}
% This dataset offers a robust foundation for developing and testing algorithms in machine learning and NLP. It can be used to train chatbots and virtual assistants for applications in customer service or education.
