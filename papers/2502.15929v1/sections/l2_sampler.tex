\subsection{Parallel Sampler}
\label{subsec:l2_sampler}
The sampler described here is a simple consequence of \Cref{lem:k_norm} and well-known statistical facts, and similar samplers have appeared for related mechanisms \cite{YRUF14, SU16}. We collect the relevant information here, with proofs in \Cref{subsec:appendix_sampler} for completeness.

By~\Cref{lem:k_norm}, we sample $rz$ where $r \sim \gammad{d+1}{\sigma}$ and $z \sim_U B_2^d$. In a parallel setting, suppose we have a worker for each of $d$ coordinates and a central manager. We first sample $r$.

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{gammaSample}
\label{lem:gamma_sample}
    Let $U_1, \ldots, U_{d+1} \sim_{iid} U(0,1)$ be uniform random samples. Then $-\sigma\sum_{i=1}^{d+1} \log(U_i) \sim \gammad{d+1}{\sigma}$.
\end{restatable}


By \Cref{lem:gamma_sample}, each worker $i$ can sample $\log(U_i)$, and the manager can add the combined sum to their own sample and scale the result by $-\sigma$ to obtain $r$. It remains to sample $z$.

\begin{restatable}{lemma}{ballSample}
\label{lem:l2_sample}
    Let $X_1, \ldots, X_d \sim_{iid} N(0,1)$, and let $Y \sim U(0,1)$ be a uniform sample from $[0,1]$. Then $Y^{1/d} \cdot \frac{(X_1, \ldots, X_d)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^d X_i^2}}$ is a uniform sample from $B_2^d$. 
\end{restatable}

To apply~\cref{lem:l2_sample}, each worker samples a standard Gaussian and reports its square in the same combine used to compute $r$ in \Cref{lem:gamma_sample}. The manager samples $Y$ and publishes it along with $r$ and the sum of squares. At this point, each worker can compute their coordinate of $rz$.
