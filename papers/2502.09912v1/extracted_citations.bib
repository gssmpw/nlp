abstract = {Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through workflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex goals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams -- familiarity with other members -- stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar) teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18 minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term, team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) researchers struggle to conduct remote studies. Previous work has focused on working around limitations imposed by traditional crowdsourcing methods. However, the potential for leveraging social VR platforms for HCI evaluations is largely unexplored. These platforms have large VR-ready user populations, distributed synchronous virtual environments, and support for user-generated content. We demonstrate how social VR platforms can be used to practically and ethically produce valid research results by replicating two studies using one such platform (VRChat): a quantitative study on Fitts’ Law and a qualitative study on tabletop collaboration. Our replication studies exhibited analogous results to the originals, indicating the research validity of this approach. Moreover, we easily recruited experienced VR users with their own hardware for synchronous, remote, and collaborative participation. We further provide lessons learned for future researchers experimenting using social VR platforms. This paper and all supplemental materials are available at osf.io/c2amz.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has experienced exponential growth in attention in the past five years. Many see it as a new communication mechanism through which people can come together in a way they have never been able to via traditional online interfaces. However, much is still unknown about how VR may affect how groups of users communicate. In this work, we present preliminary findings on how avatars, the customization choices users make to create them, and user perception of them may affect feelings of work group inclusion. We study this in the context of a formal classroom setting with work groups comprised of students. Avatars are known to transform user perception and behavior in virtual environments – both immersive and non-immersive – and can dictate the way social interactions play out in these scenarios. We produce results that align with this paradigm, showing that elements of work group inclusion are different between the physical world and VR, and that customization choices and user perceptions of avatars may shape the perception of inclusion.},

This spatiotemporal data forms a Kinetic Signature, which is a user-dependent behavioral biometric trait. Although kinetic signatures have been widely used in recent research, the factors contributing to their degree of identifiability remain mostly unexplored. Drawing from existing literature, this work systematically examines the influence of static and dynamic components in human motion. We conducted a user study (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;24) with two sessions to reidentify users across different VR sports and exercises after one week. We found that the identifiability of a kinetic signature depends on its inherent static and dynamic factors, with the best combination allowing for 90.91\% identification accuracy after one week had passed. Therefore, this work lays a foundation for designing and refining movement-based identification protocols in immersive environments.},

Our results, derived from a diverse group of participants, indicate that users demonstrate comparable performance in both environments. However, it was observed that users exhibit a higher tolerance for cognitive load in VR and travel further in AR.

    abstract = { While online spaces and communities were once seen to transcend geography, the ubiquity of location-aware mobile devices means that today’s online interactions are deeply intertwined with offline places and relationships. Systems such as online dating applications for meeting nearby others provide novel social opportunities, but can also complicate interaction by aggregating or “co-situating” diverse sets of individuals. Often this aggregation occurs across traditional spatial or community boundaries that serve as cues for self-presentation and impression formation. This paper explores these issues through an interview study of Grindr users. Grindr is a location-aware real-time dating application for men who have sex with men. We argue that co-situation affects how and whether Grindr users and their behavior are visible to others, collapses or erases contextual cues about normative behavior, and introduces tensions in users’ self-presentation in terms of their identifiability and the cues their profile contains relative to their behavior. }

This paper reviews the literature related to the issues of anonymity within the social context, particularly in CMC, demonstrating the usefulness of established social psychological theory to explain behavior in CMC and discussing the evolution of the current theoretical explanations in explaining the effects of anonymity in social behavior in CMC environments.

The use of these technologies in a hybrid work environment increases the importance of digital literacy in maintaining communication and social interactions. This paper aims to examine the role of digital literacy (and particularly the technical, cognitive, and socio-emotional dimensions) in the use of collaborative technologies, as well as the effect of the use of these technologies on perceived social proximity in a hybrid work environment. Data were collected from 5141 public service workers in 2023. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The technical dimension of digital literacy is associated with the use of collaborative technologies, though the cognitive and socio-emotional dimensions are not. The use of collaborative technologies is associated with perceived social proximity. The study's findings highlight the importance of technical digital literacy, as well as the positive effect of the use of collaborative technologies on perceived social proximity in the hybrid work environment.}

In turn, this creates a need for tractable, and reliable, tools for measuring fundamental aspects of social relationships. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' (IOS) Scale, a handy pictorial tool for measuring the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool is highly portable, very easy for subjects to understand and takes less than 1 minute to administer. Across our three online studies with a diverse adult population (n = 772) we show that six different scales designed to measure relationship closeness are all highly significantly positively correlated with the IOS Scale. We then conduct a Principal Component Analysis to construct an Index of Relationship Closeness and find that it correlates very strongly (ρ = 85) with the IOS Scale. We conclude that the IOS Scale is a psychologically meaningful and highly reliable measure of the subjective closeness of relationships.},

abstract = {Self-disclosure is rewarding and provides significant benefits for individuals, but it also involves risks, especially in social media settings. We conducted an online experiment to study the relationship between content intimacy and willingness to self-disclose in social media, and how identification (real name vs. anonymous) and audience type (social ties vs. people nearby) moderate that relationship. Content intimacy is known to regulate self-disclosure in face-to-face communication: people self-disclose less as content intimacy increases. We show that such regulation persists in online social media settings. Further, although anonymity and an audience of social ties are both known to increase self-disclosure, it is unclear whether they (1) increase self-disclosure baseline for content of all intimacy levels, or (2) weaken intimacy's regulation effect, making people more willing to disclose intimate content. We show that intimacy always regulates self-disclosure, regardless of settings. We also show that anonymity mainly increases self-disclosure baseline and (sometimes) weakens the regulation. On the other hand, an audience of social ties increases the baseline but strengthens the regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that anonymity has a more salient effect on content of negative valence.The results are critical to understanding the dynamics and opportunities of self-disclosure in social media services that vary levels of identification and types of audience.},

The investigation focused on the effect of four different communication media (text, audio, video, and face-to-face) on task performance and satisfaction of both, intellective and negotiation tasks. For the negotiation task, a social psychological factor, consonancy, was used to examine the effect of interaction on media and performance. Overall, the study did not support media-richness theory. There were no task–medium interaction effects on either decision quality or decision time. Decision quality was the same for both the tasks. Audio was the most efficient medium, but not necessarily the most satisfying. This study did not support the combined theory of media richness and social psychology for the negotiation task. There was no significant media-by-consonancy interaction in the negotiation payoff.}

We aim to clarify the construct of perceived diversity and organize the findings in this emergent line of research. To do so, we develop a framework integrating research emerging on perceived diversity from across several different research fields. We propose that the nature of perceived diversity and its effects can be best understood by identifying the focal point of the diversity perceptions being studied: perceptions of self-to-team dissimilarity, of subgroup splits, and of group heterogeneity. Our review concludes that perceived self-to-team dissimilarity and perceived subgroup splits mostly have been linked to negative effects for individuals and groups, whereas perceived group heterogeneity has been shown to exert both positive and negative effects on group outcomes. Our review also draws attention to the problem that research on perceived diversity varies not only in definitions and conceptualizations, but also in the methodological approaches towards operationalizing perceived diversity. We conclude by discussing potential areas for future research. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Previous studies on telework have exposed the risk of social isolation, which can lead workers to feel dehumanised. In this paper, we investigate how management adapts to co-presence by drawing on 28 semi-structured interviews conducted in February and March 2021 among employees and managers from private and public organisations in Belgium. Surprising results show that co-presence was mainly lived as a way to maintain proximity and constituted an opportunity for some managers to re-humanise their work approach, and for employees to feel humanely managed. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the study of humanisation and co-presence in management, including some critical considerations regarding the very notions of ‘de-’ and ‘re-humanisation’, and make recommendations in terms of technology, work organisation, and management.},

The article shows that Secret was not only based on pre-existing social networks but also drew on the network as a structure of thought. The concept of networked anonymity is introduced to account for the ways that anonymous actors imagine one another as “someone,” rather than as an unknown “anyone.” As such, the survivability of this communicative model is inherently limited by competing forces—the drive to connectivity, on the one hand, and to anonymity, on the other. }

Would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? We introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. Afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. In two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world. Our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot - and stay there.},

Past work has identified that whom you share with is important for choosing whether or not to share, but little work has explored which features of interpersonal relationships influence sharing. We present the results of a study of 42 participants, who self-report aspects of their relationships with 70 of their friends, including frequency of collocation and communication, closeness, and social group. Participants rated their willingness to share in 21 different scenarios based on information a UbiComp system could provide. Our findings show that (a) self-reported closeness is the strongest indicator of willingness to share, (b) individuals are more likely to share in scenarios with common information (e.g. we are within one mile of each other) than other kinds of scenarios (e.g. my location wherever I am), and (c) frequency of communication predicts both closeness and willingness to share better than frequency of collocation.},
