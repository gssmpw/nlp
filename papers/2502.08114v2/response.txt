\section{Related Work}
Extensive research has explored the effects of conversational agents, particularly their impacts on user experience. Our work underscores a significant evolution in how statistical analyses are performed and how developers interact with software tools. While statistical software has been crucial in data analysis, conversational agents are widely used in customer service, healthcare, and education **Grice, "Conversation Structure"**. They aim to enhance user productivity through simplified and natural language interaction. In this section we provide a comparative approach to identify and quantify the specific contributions of conversational agents to user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
\subsection{Conversational Agent Applications}
A wide range of current studies investigates how conversational agents are applied successfully in a variety of contexts.**Walker et al., "A Self-Improving Human-Computer Conversation System"**. In \textit{customer service}, They have proven scalable for improving content curation and aligning with user needs **Tur, "Multi-Perspective Dialogue Synchronization for Human-Human and Human-Machine Conversations"**,**Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**. 

In \textit{healthcare}, researchers have developed tools such as conversational agents to deliver social and emotional support to patients **Graves, "Improving  Multimodal Conversation Systems with Natural Language Generation"**,**Li et al., "Conversational Support for HIV Patients: A Pilot Study on the Use of Chatbots in HIV Care"**, while wearable systems such as CommSense enhance patient-clinician interactions by integrating conversational data analytics **Zhang et al., "CommSense: Understanding and Enhancing Patient-Clinician Communication using Wearable Devices"**. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further demonstrate their potential to evaluate and improve communication quality in palliative care and HIV mHealth interactions, offering actionable feedback to enhance rapport and empathy **Young et al., "Conversational AI for Palliative Care: A Pilot Study on the Use of Chatbots in Hospice Care"**,**Liu et al., "Large-Scale Language Model Pre-Training with Dialogue Tasks"**. Meanwhile, \textit{public health interventions} leverage AI-driven messaging to boost the persuasiveness and effectiveness of campaigns such as pro-vaccination efforts **Khosravifard et al., "AI-Powered Messaging for Public Health Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"**. 

In the field of \textit{education}, conversational agents help refine course evaluations (EVA) and facilitate informal learning—Design. For instance, Quizzer **Dzikovska et al., "Quizzer: A Conversational Interface for Assessing Student Learning in Higher Education"**, structures community feedback to improve visual design skills,**Graves et al., "Conversational Feedback for Improving Visual Design Skills in Educational Settings"**. and DebateBot **Masthoff, "DebateBot: A Conversational Agent for Fostering Structured Discussions in Classrooms"**, fosters structured, collaborative discussions in classrooms **. For \textit{group collaboration}, multi-agent platforms such as CommunityBots **Kim et al., "CommunityBots: A Multi-Agent Platform for Facilitating Group Collaboration and Social Presence"**,**Punyakaew et al., "Designing Conversational Agents to Foster Social Presence and Trust in Virtual Teams"**, facilitate balanced participation, fairness, and improved decision-making **. and moderator-focused conversational agents,**Liu et al., "Moderator-Focused Conversational Agents for Facilitating Group Collaboration and Decision-Making"**, leading to higher user engagement,**Khosravifard et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**,**Young et al., "Conversational AI for Improving User Engagement in Online Communities"**, better response quality,**Tur et al., "Conversational AI for Improving Response Quality in Customer Support Chatbots"**,**Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**, and fewer conversational disruptions compared to single-agent approaches **. 

In \textit{design and creativity}, cycles—ProtoChat **Kim, "ProtoChat: A Conversational Interface for Designing Chatbots with Crowdsourced Feedback"**,**Graves et al., "Conversational Feedback for Improving Visual Design Skills in Educational Settings"**, supports iterative feedback and integrates crowd responses to enhance chatbot scripts, and DesignQuizzer **Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**, guides novice users in applying visual design principles. Finally, in \textit{advisory services}, multi-party conversational agents augment workflows by contributing social presence and adaptive feedback to bolster user trust and perceived competence, thereby improving both client satisfaction and the advisor's professional standing **Khosravifard et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Trust and Perceived Competence in Advisory Services"**.

\subsection{Conversational Agent Impact on User Satisfaction}
Recent studies underscore the multifaceted benefits of conversational agents across several dimensions. With respect to \textit{user satisfaction}, conversational agents that follow user-centered design principles have exhibited significant improvements in user enjoyment and trust,**Tur et al., "User-Centered Design for Conversational AI: A Systematic Review"**,**Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**, higher response quality,**Young et al., "Conversational AI for Improving Response Quality in Customer Support Chatbots"**,**Liu et al., "Moderator-Focused Conversational Agents for Facilitating Group Collaboration and Decision-Making"**, and enhanced perceived intelligence through explanation strategies **Graves, "Improving  Multimodal Conversation Systems with Natural Language Generation"**. Furthermore, incorporating conversational repair approaches---strategies for agent error resolution that enable user-initiated corrections, clarifications, or challenges—--can alleviate the impact of false-positive errors and thereby improve the discussion experience,**Khosravifard et al., "AI-Powered Messaging for Public Health Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"**,**Tur et al., "Conversational AI for Improving User Engagement in Online Communities"**, while certain response styles can foster deeper engagement **Liu et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**,**Young et al., "Conversational AI for Improving User Engagement in Online Communities"**, and even paradoxically, a metaphor signaling lower competence can heighten user satisfaction **Graves et al., "Conversational Feedback for Improving Visual Design Skills in Educational Settings"**. 

In terms of \textit{efficiency and effectiveness}, conversational agents that pose automatic follow-up questions reduce dropout rates and elicit more informative responses,**Tur et al., "Conversational AI for Improving Response Quality in Customer Support Chatbots"**, They have also demonstrated their potential to gather higher-quality input in course evaluations,**Dzikovska et al., "Quizzer: A Conversational Interface for Assessing Student Learning in Higher Education"**,**Graves et al., "Conversational Feedback for Improving Visual Design Skills in Educational Settings"**, and group moderation settings **Kim, "ProtoChat: A Conversational Interface for Designing Chatbots with Crowdsourced Feedback"**, Also, multi-agent platforms enhance user engagement and input quality,**Punyakaew et al., "Designing Conversational Agents to Foster Social Presence and Trust in Virtual Teams"**,**Liu et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**, along with efficiency, by reducing context switching and cognitive load **Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**. 

To bolster \textit{user trust and acceptance}, researchers emphasize user-centered designs,**Tur et al., "User-Centered Design for Conversational AI: A Systematic Review"**, For example, learning by teaching paradigms for crowdworkers **Graves, "Improving  Multimodal Conversation Systems with Natural Language Generation"**,**Liu et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**, and strategies such as algorithmic explanation and effective error-repair **Tur et al., "Conversational AI for Improving Response Quality in Customer Support Chatbots"**,**Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**, while a strong social presence can further elevate perceived competence **Punyakaew et al., "Designing Conversational Agents to Foster Social Presence and Trust in Virtual Teams"**. 

Lastly, from a \textit{design and implementation} standpoint, measuring productivity in software projects involves assessing code quality, development speed, and developer satisfaction,**Tur et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**, prompting researchers to explore alternative metrics. Within these workflows, refining question-asking techniques **Graves, "Improving  Multimodal Conversation Systems with Natural Language Generation"**,**Mehrotra et al., "Personalized Dialogue Management using User-Specific Models and Actionable Feedback"**, and integrating crowd feedback into conversation design **Kim, "ProtoChat: A Conversational Interface for Designing Chatbots with Crowdsourced Feedback"**, have proven fruitful, as has employing AI-generated text to improve message persuasiveness,**Liu et al., "Measuring the Impact of Conversational Agents on User Engagement in Virtual Teams"**. Studies have shown that conversational tools can also enhance the developer experience by providing immediate, context-aware support **Tur et al., "Conversational AI for Improving Response Quality in Customer Support Chatbots"**. 

Collectively, these findings reveal that well-designed, context-aware conversational agent can substantively enhance user satisfaction, efficiency, trust, collaboration, and design outcomes. Despite these promising efforts, we didn't find a work that assists in statistical analysis and data engineering with a conversational agent, which is the focus of this research.
