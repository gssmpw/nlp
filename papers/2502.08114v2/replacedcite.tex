\section{Related Work}
Extensive research has explored the effects of conversational agents, particularly their impacts on user experience. Our work underscores a significant evolution in how statistical analyses are performed and how developers interact with software tools. While statistical software has been crucial in data analysis, conversational agents are widely used in customer service, healthcare, and education ____. They aim to enhance user productivity through simplified and natural language interaction. In this section we provide a comparative approach to identify and quantify the specific contributions of conversational agents to user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
\subsection{Conversational Agent Applications}
A wide range of current studies investigates how conversational agents are applied successfully in a variety of contexts.____ In \textit{customer service}, They have proven scalable for improving content curation and aligning with user needs ____, including machine-teaching strategies that lower the barriers to conversational agent adoption in areas like banking and telecommunications. 

In \textit{healthcare}, researchers have developed tools such as conversational agents to deliver social and emotional support to patients ____, while wearable systems such as CommSense enhance patient-clinician interactions by integrating conversational data analytics ____. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further demonstrate their potential to evaluate and improve communication quality in palliative care and HIV mHealth interactions, offering actionable feedback to enhance rapport and empathy ____. Meanwhile, \textit{public health interventions} leverage AI-driven messaging to boost the persuasiveness and effectiveness of campaigns such as pro-vaccination efforts ____. 

In the field of \textit{education}, conversational agents help refine course evaluations (EVA) and facilitate informal learning—Design. For instance, Quizzer ____ structures community feedback to improve visual design skills____, and DebateBot ____ fosters structured, collaborative discussions in classrooms ____. 

For \textit{group collaboration}, multi-agent platforms such as CommunityBots ____ and moderator-focused conversational agents facilitate balanced participation, fairness, and improved decision-making ____ and moderator-focused conversational agents____, leading to higher user engagement____, better response quality____, and fewer conversational disruptions compared to single-agent approaches ____. 

In \textit{design and creativity}, cycles—ProtoChat ____ supports iterative feedback and integrates crowd responses to enhance chatbot scripts, and DesignQuizzer ____ guides novice users in applying visual design principles. Finally, in \textit{advisory services}, multi-party conversational agents augment workflows by contributing social presence and adaptive feedback to bolster user trust and perceived competence, thereby improving both client satisfaction and the advisor's professional standing ____.

\subsection{Conversational Agent Impact on User Satisfaction}
Recent studies underscore the multifaceted benefits of conversational agents across several dimensions. With respect to \textit{user satisfaction}, conversational agents that follow user-centered design principles have exhibited significant improvements in user enjoyment and trust ____, higher response quality ____, and enhanced perceived intelligence through explanation strategies ____. Furthermore, incorporating conversational repair approaches---strategies for agent error resolution that enable user-initiated corrections, clarifications, or challenges—--can alleviate the impact of false-positive errors and thereby improve the discussion experience ____, while certain response styles can foster deeper engagement ____, and even paradoxically, a metaphor signaling lower competence can heighten user satisfaction ____. 

In terms of \textit{efficiency and effectiveness}, conversational agents that pose automatic follow-up questions reduce dropout rates and elicit more informative responses ____. They have also demonstrated their potential to gather higher-quality input in course evaluations ____ and group moderation settings ____. Also, multi-agent platforms enhance user engagement and input quality ____, along with efficiency, by reducing context switching and cognitive load ____. 

To bolster \textit{user trust and acceptance}, researchers emphasize user-centered designs ____. For example, learning by teaching paradigms for crowdworkers ____, and strategies such as algorithmic explanation and effective error-repair ____, while a strong social presence can further elevate perceived competence ____. 

Lastly, from a \textit{design and implementation} standpoint, measuring productivity in software projects involves assessing code quality, development speed, and developer satisfaction ____, prompting researchers to explore alternative metrics. Within these workflows, refining question-asking techniques ____ and integrating crowd feedback into conversation design ____ have proven fruitful, as has employing AI-generated text to improve message persuasiveness ____. Studies have shown that conversational tools can also enhance the developer experience by providing immediate, context-aware support ____. 

Collectively, these findings reveal that well-designed, context-aware conversational agent can substantively enhance user satisfaction, efficiency, trust, collaboration, and design outcomes. Despite these promising efforts, we didn't find a work that assists in statistical analysis and data engineering with a conversational agent, which is the focus of this research.
