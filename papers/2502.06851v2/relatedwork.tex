\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Classification:} Vision transformers have been used to classify images into categories. For instance, the ViT model [15] has achieved state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks like ImageNet [33].
    \item \textbf{Object Detection:} Transformers have also been applied to object detection tasks. DETR [6] is a notable example that uses transformers to detect objects directly from images without requiring predefined anchors, which is a significant departure from traditional object detection methods.
    \item \textbf{Semantic Segmentation:} Transformer models have been used for semantic segmentation tasks, where they can segment images into different categories. For example, SETR [18] and SegFormer [63] have been used to improve the performance of semantic segmentation tasks.
