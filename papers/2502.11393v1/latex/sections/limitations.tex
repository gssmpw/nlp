\section*{Limitations}

The limitations of our work are as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    % \setlength{}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item Our work only addresses everyday commonsense reasoning and does not encompass specific types, such as temporal or physical commonsense knowledge. Evaluating the robustness of LLMs on these specific types of commonsense reasoning tasks will be our future work.

    \item HellaSwag-Pro is concentrated on assessing the robustness of LLMs in commonsense reasoning tasks and does not investigate the underlying reasons for observed performance declines.

    \item For the sake of evaluation convenience, our setup utilizes multiple-choice questions. We plan to study the open-ended questions in future work.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ethics Statement}
This work requires manual annotation. We provide annotators with a salary above the local minimum hourly wage. We have also clearly informed them about the purpose of the data and the necessity to ensure that all the data in Hellaswag-Pro does not contain any social biases, ethical concerns, or privacy issues.

Additionally, we develop a challenging dataset for evaluating the robustness of commonsense reasoning in this work. It's important to emphasize that this dataset is intended solely for evaluation, not for training or fine-tuning purposes. We recognize that improper use of this dataset for model training or fine-tuning could lead to persistent inconsistencies in LLMs' understanding of commonsense knowledge, potentially creating a vicious cycle where more such datasets would be needed to address these issues. Therefore, we explicitly state that the intended use of this dataset is strictly limited to evaluation to prevent the formation of long-standing issues in LLMs. We look forward to promoting healthy development in LLM research through responsible use of these research findings.
