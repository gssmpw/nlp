\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \ours{}, a meta-reasoning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LRMs and optimize the inference-time reasoning efficiency. By operating as an \enquote{advisor}, meta-reasoner dynamically evaluates the reasoning process and provides high-level strategic guidance, addressing key limitations of o1-like reasoning chains, such as compounding errors and inefficiency in inference computing. Unlike conventional reasoning approaches, \ours{} focuses on global oversight rather than granular step-by-step processes, enabling LRMs to avoid unproductive lines of thought and better allocate computational resources. 
The experiments highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.
