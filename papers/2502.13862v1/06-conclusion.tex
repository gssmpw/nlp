In this report, we evaluated the performance of several state-of-the-art dynamic graph processing frameworks and demonstrated that our custom implementation, DiGraph --- which uses our CP2AA allocator, contiguous edge arrays, and a Struct-of-Arrays (SoA) approach --- achieves significant performance gains across key tasks, including graph loading, cloning, in-place dynamic graph updates, and graph algorithm execution (iterative traversal). Our results also highlight the benefits of lazy copying (SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS), and zero-cost snapshotting (Aspen) for applications which need to preserve the original graph, making in-place graph updates unsuitable. Future work could optimize for small batch updates.
