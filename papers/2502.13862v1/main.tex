\begin{abstract}
Research in graph-structured data has grown rapidly due to graphs' ability to represent complex real-world information and capture intricate relationships, particularly as many real-world graphs evolve dynamically through edge/vertex insertions and deletions. This has spurred interest in programming frameworks for managing, maintaining, and processing such dynamic graphs. In this report, we evaluate the performance of PetGraph (Rust), Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP), SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, cuGraph, Aspen, and our custom implementation in tasks including loading graphs from disk to memory, cloning loaded graphs, applying in-place edge deletions/insertions, and performing a simple iterative graph traversal algorithm. Our implementation demonstrates significant performance improvements: it outperforms PetGraph, SNAP, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, cuGraph, and Aspen by factors of $177\times$, $106\times$, $76\times$, $17\times$, and $3.3\times$ in graph loading; $20\times$, $235\times$, $0.24\times$, $1.3\times$, and $0\times$ in graph cloning; $141\times$/$45\times$, $44\times$/$25\times$, $13\times$/$11\times$, $28\times$/$34\times$, and $3.5\times$/$2.2\times$ in edge deletions/insertions; and $67\times$/$63\times$, $86\times$/$86\times$, $2.5\times$/$2.6\times$, $0.25\times$/$0.24\times$, and $1.3\times$/$1.3\times$ in traversal on updated graphs with deletions/insertions.

% Time taken to read and clone the graph
% Time taken to insert and delete edges (both in-place and copy-based)
% Why is clone slow?
% Present graph traversal performance with PageRank?
% We optimize for traversal performance
% Per-graph runtimes for each batch size
% Design of the AA allocator

% Already have 2 results, need 2 more to compare with
% I AM WAITING FOR PETGRAPH-MAP TO COMPLETE
% THEN I CAN RUN SNAP-READ BASED
% Also waiting for Snap (convert based), and Petgraph original

% OTHER COMPARISONS
% NetworkX is too slow (python)
% Gunrock is static only
% Ligra is static only
% Comparison with graph databases?
