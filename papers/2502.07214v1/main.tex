\begin{abstract}
%In real-world machine learning applications for decision-making, such as determining loan approvals or credit scores, significant efforts have been made recently to find diverse recommendations that explain the algorithmic decisions. These diverse recommendations provide actionable feedback to users, catering to a wide range of user preferences. 

In decision-making systems, algorithmic recourse aims to identify minimal-cost actions to alter an individual's features, thereby obtaining a desired outcome. This empowers individuals to understand, question, or alter decisions that negatively affect them. However, due to the variety and sensitivity of system environments and individual personalities, quantifying the cost of a single function is nearly impossible while considering multiple criteria situations. Most current recourse mechanisms use gradient-based methods that assume cost functions are differentiable, often not applicable in real-world scenarios, resulting in sub-optimal solutions that compromise various criteria. These solutions are typically intractable and lack rigorous theoretical foundations, raising concerns regarding interpretability, reliability, and transparency from the explainable AI (XAI) perspective. To address these issues, this work proposes an algorithmic recourse framework that handles non-differentiable and discrete multi-cost functions. By formulating recourse as a multi-objective optimization problem and assigning weights to different criteria based on their importance, our method identifies Pareto optimal recourse recommendations. To demonstrate scalability, we incorporate the concept of $\epsilon$-net, proving the ability to find approximated Pareto optimal actions. Experiments show the trade-off between different criteria and the method's scalability in large graphs. Compared to current heuristic practices, our approach provides a stronger theoretical foundation and better aligns recourse suggestions with real-world requirements.

%The multi-criteria decision-making paradigm holds promise for propelling recourse analysis toward more effective, generalizable, and transparent solutions, even in high-dimensional decision spaces characterizing numerous real-world applications.

\section{CONCLUSION}
In conclusion, our algorithm proposes a novel idea that can be generalized to non-differentiable or discrete cost functions in the field of recourse. The algorithm is applied to multi-cost scenarios where users can combine their background knowledge in professional fields, set the most suitable cost function, and then finally get a more practical counterfactual. We show that our algorithm can find all the Pareto recourse plans optimally and can be scaled to a large graph with the utilization of $\epsilon$-net. We conduct experiments on two data sets separately. For the MNIST data set, we compared the performance of Pareto optimal paths under different sampling sizes and showed the result that transfers from one handwriting number into another and offers the whole process. For Adults, we show the diversity in each cost function, and those diverse cost functions finally lead to multi-Pareto optimal solutions.
