\section{Conclusions}
We present VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation with simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction. It integrates Image2Cloud for 3D point cloud generation, ObjMotionNet for encoding sparse object trajectories, and a Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer for incorporating lighting direction. The VideoLightingDirection dataset and a three-stage training strategy address real-world annotation challenges. Experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in control granularity and visual coherence, advancing video generation toward more realistic and versatile applications.
