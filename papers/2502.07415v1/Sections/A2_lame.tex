The ill-posed nature of the problem arises from the fact that there are no direct observations of the stresses $\sig$, only noisy displacement fields $\uv$. This leads to an underdetermined system, requiring regularization to recover meaningful solutions. To address this, we employ an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) prior on the precision parameters $\lamc$. We aim to use the prior to preferring solutions in which the given material law is assumed to be correct unless strong evidence speaks against it, thus encouraging large values for $\lamc$. 

Therefore, note that the Gaussian virtual constitutive likelihood $p(\hRc | \z, \x, \ve \chi, \vlamc)$ and the Gamma prior on $\vlamc$ are conjugate, we can select a Gamma posterior as a natural choice. This enables us to update the approximate posterior $\q(\vlamc)$ in closed form as
\begin{equation}
    a_{\lamc_i} = a_0 + \frac{1}{2}, \quad \mathrm{and} \quad b_{\lamc_i} = b_0 + \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{\q} \left[ \left( \rc_i \right)^2 \right]. \label{eqn:lame_update}
\end{equation}
We then iteratively update the approximate posterior using the following scheme:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Updating the approximate posterior $\q(\vlamc)$ according to \eqref{eqn:lame_update} given samples of $\{ \z, \x, \ve \chi \}$, and
    \item Updating the approximate posterior $q(\z, \x, \ve \chi)$ according to the SVI scheme introduced in section \ref{sec:method}, where we can calculate $\left< \lamc_i \right> = \frac{a_{\lamc_i}}{b_{\lamc_i}}$ in closed form.
\end{enumerate}
