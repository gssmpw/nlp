	abstract = {In the field of industrial production, machine failures not only negatively affect productivity and product quality, but also lead to safety accidents, so it is crucial to accurately diagnose machine failures in time and take appropriate measures. However, machines cannot operate with faults for extended periods, and the diversity of fault modes results in limited data collection, posing challenges to building accurate fault prediction models. Despite recent advancements, intelligent fault diagnosis methods based on traditional sampling and machine learning have shown notable progress. Nonetheless, these methods heavily rely on human expertise, making it challenging to extract comprehensive feature information. To address these challenges, numerous imbalance fault diagnosis methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged, GANs can generate realistic samples that conform to the distribution of the original data, showing promising results in diagnosing imbalances in critical components such as bearings and gears, despite their great potential, GAN methods also face challenges, including difficulties in training and generating abnormal samples. However, whether it is GAN-based resampling technology or traditional sampling technology, there are fewer reviews on noise-containing imbalance, intra- and inter-class dual imbalance, multi-class imbalance, time series imbalance and other problems in small samples, and there is a lack of a more comprehensive summary of the solutions to the above imbalance problems. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to deeply explore the imbalance problems under various failure modes, and review and analyze the research methods and results based on GANs on this basis. By suggesting future research directions, this paper aims to provide guidance and reference for research in the field of industrial production maintenance.},

	abstract = {Training deep neural network classifiers for electrocardiograms (ECGs) requires sufficient data. However, imbalanced datasets pose a major problem for the training process and hence data augmentation is commonly performed. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can create synthetic ECG data to augment such imbalanced datasets. This review aims at identifying the present literature concerning synthetic ECG signal generation using GANs to provide a comprehensive overview of architectures, quality evaluation metrics, and classification performances. Thirty publications from the years 2019 to 2022 were selected from three separate databases. Nine publications used a quality evaluation metric neglecting classification, eleven performed a classification but omitted a quality evaluation metric, and ten publications performed both. Twenty different quality evaluation metrics were observed. Overall, the classification performance of databases augmented with synthetically created ECG signals increased by 7 \% to 98 \% in accuracy and 6 \% to 97 \% in sensitivity. In conclusion, synthetic ECG signal generation using GANs represents a promising tool for data augmentation of imbalanced datasets. Consistent quality evaluation of generated signals remains challenging. Hence, future work should focus on the establishment of a gold standard for quality evaluation metrics for GANs.},

	abstract = {Performance of neural networks greatly depends on quality, size and balance of training dataset. In a real environment datasets are rarely balanced and training deep models over such data is one of the main challenges of deep learning. In order to reduce this problem, methods and techniques are borrowed from the traditional machine learning. Conversely, generative adversarial networks (GAN) were created and developed, a relatively new type of generative models that are based on game theory and consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator?s task is to create a sample from the input noise that is based on training data distribution and the discriminator should detect those samples as fake. This process goes through a finite number of iterations until the generator successfully fools the discriminator. When this occurs, sample becomes a part of new (augmented) dataset. Even though the original GAN creates unlabeled samples, variants that soon appeared removed that limitation. Generating artificial data through these networks appears to be a meaningful solution to the imbalance problem since it turned out that artificial samples created by GAN are difficult to differentiate from the real ones. In this manner, new samples of minority class could be created and dataset imbalance ratio lowered.},

	abstract = {A small sample size and unbalanced sample distribution are two main problems when data-driven methods are applied for fault diagnosis in practical engineering. Technically, sample generation and data augmentation have proven to be effective methods to solve this problem. The generative adversarial network (GAN) has been widely used in recent years as a representative generative model. Besides the general GAN, many variants have recently been reported to address its inherent problems such as mode collapse and slow convergence. In addition, many new techniques are being proposed to increase the sample generation quality. Therefore, a systematic review of GAN, especially its application in fault diagnosis, is necessary. In this paper, the theory and structure of GAN and variants such as ACGAN, VAEGAN, DCGAN, WGAN, et al. are presented first. Then, the literature on GANs is mainly categorized and analyzed from two aspects: improvements in GAN’s structure and loss function. Specifically, the improvements in the structure are classified into three types: information-based, input-based, and layer-based. Regarding the modification of the loss function, it is sorted into two aspects: metric-based and regularization-based. Afterwards, the evaluation metrics of the generated samples are summarized and compared. Finally, the typical applications of GAN in the bearing fault diagnosis field are listed, and the challenges for further research are also discussed.},

With the recent development and proliferation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), researchers across a variety of disciplines have adapted the architecture of GANs and implemented them on imbalanced datasets to generate instances of the underrepresented class(es). Though the bulk of research has been centered on the application of this methodology in computer vision tasks, GANs are likewise being appropriated for use in tabular data, or data consisting of rows and columns with traditional structured data types. In this survey paper, we assess the methodology and efficacy of these modifications on tabular datasets, across domains such network traffic classification and financial transactions over the past seven years. We examine what methodologies and experimental factors have resulted in the greatest machine learning efficacy, as well as the research works and frameworks which have proven most influential in the development of the application of GANs in tabular data settings.

	abstract = {Objective:
Clinical data’s confidential nature often limits the development of machine learning models in healthcare. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can synthesise realistic datasets, but suffer from mode collapse, resulting in low diversity and bias towards majority demographics and common clinical practices. This work proposes an extension to the classic GAN framework that includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) and an external memory mechanism to overcome these limitations and generate synthetic data accurately describing imbalanced class distributions commonly found in clinical variables.
Methods:
The proposed method generated a synthetic dataset related to antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (ART for HIV). We evaluated it based on five metrics: (1) accurately representing imbalanced class distribution; (2) the realism of the individual variables; (3) the realism among variables; (4) patient disclosure risk; and (5) the utility of the generated dataset for developing downstream machine learning models.
Results:
The proposed method overcomes the issue of mode collapse and generates a synthetic dataset that accurately describes imbalanced class distributions commonly found in clinical variables. The generated data has a patient disclosure risk of 0.095\%, lower than the 9\% threshold stated by Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency, making it suitable for distribution to the research community with high security. The generated data also has high utility, indicating the potential of the proposed method to enable the development of downstream machine learning algorithms for healthcare applications using synthetic data.
Conclusion:
Our proposed extension to the classic GAN framework, which includes a VAE and an external memory mechanism, represents a promising approach towards generating synthetic data that accurately describe imbalanced class distributions commonly found in clinical variables. This method overcomes the limitations of GANs and creates more realistic datasets with higher patient cohort diversity, facilitating the development of downstream machine learning algorithms for healthcare applications.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Cancer is a serious global disease due to its high mortality, and the key to effective treatment is accurate diagnosis. However, limited by sampling difficulty and actual sample size in clinical practice, data imbalance is a common problem in cancer diagnosis, while most conventional classification methods assume balanced data distribution. Therefore, addressing the imbalanced learning problem to improve the predictive performance of cancer diagnosis is significant.
Methods
In the study, we dissect the data imbalance prevalent in cancer gene expression data and present an improved deep learning based Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) model, which provides a reliable training progress indicator and deeply explores the characteristics of data. The WGAN generates new samples from the minority class and solves the imbalance problem at the data level.
Results
We analyze three publicly available data sets on RNA-seq of three kinds of cancer using the proposed WGAN and compare the results with those from two commonly adopted sampling methods. According to the results, through addressing the data imbalance problem, the balanced data distribution and the expanding sample size increase the prediction accuracy in all three data sets.
Conclusions
Therefore, the proposed WGAN method is superior in solving the imbalanced learning problem of gene expression data, providing significantly better prediction performance in cancer diagnosis.},

	abstract = {High-quality tabular data is a crucial requirement for developing data-driven applications, especially healthcare-related ones, because most of the data nowadays collected in this context is in tabular form. However, strict data protection laws complicates the access to medical datasets. Thus, synthetic data has become an ideal alternative for data scientists and healthcare professionals to circumvent such hurdles. Although many healthcare institutions still use the classical de-identification and anonymization techniques for generating synthetic data, deep learning-based generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown a remarkable performance in generating tabular datasets with complex structures. This paper examines the GANs’ potential and applicability within the healthcare industry, which often faces serious challenges with insufficient training data and patient records sensitivity. We investigate several state-of-the-art GAN-based models proposed for tabular synthetic data generation. Healthcare datasets with different sizes, numbers of variables, column data types, feature distributions, and inter-variable correlations are examined. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation framework is defined to evaluate the quality of the synthetic records and the viability of each model in preserving the patients’ privacy. The results indicate that the proposed models can generate synthetic datasets that maintain the statistical characteristics, model compatibility and privacy of the original data. Moreover, synthetic tabular healthcare datasets can be a viable option in many data-driven applications. However, there is still room for further improvements in designing a perfect architecture for generating synthetic tabular data.},

	abstract = {In financial anti-fraud field, negative samples are small and sparse with serious sample imbalanced problem. Generating negative samples consistent with original data to naturally solve imbalanced problem is a serious problem. This article proposes a new method to solve this problem. We introduce a new generation model, combined Generative Adversarial Network with Long Short-Term Memory network for one-dimensional negative financial samples. The characteristic association between transaction sequences can be learned by long short-term memory layer, and the generator covers real data distribution by the adversarial discriminator with time-sequence. Mapping data distribution to feature space is a common evaluation method of synthetic data; however, relationships between data attributes have been ignored in online transactions. We define a comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the validity of generated samples from data distribution and attribute characteristics. Experimental results on real bank B2B transaction data show that the proposed model has higher overall ratings, which is 10\% higher than traditional generation models. Finally, well-trained model is used to generate negative samples and form new dataset. The classification results on new datasets show that precision and recall are all higher than baseline models. Our work has a certain practical value and provides a new idea to solve imbalanced problem in whatever fields.},

	abstract = {To build adequate predictive models, a substantial amount of data is desirable. However, when expanding to new or unexplored territories, this required level of information is rarely always available. To build such models, actuaries often have to: procure data from local providers, use limited unsuitable industry and public research, or rely on extrapolations from other better-known markets. Another common pathology when applying machine learning techniques in actuarial domains is the prevalence of imbalanced classes where risk events of interest, such as mortality and fraud, are under-represented in data. In this work, we show how an implicit model using the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can alleviate these problems through the generation of adequate quality data from very limited or highly imbalanced samples. We provide an introduction to GANs and how they are used to synthesize data that accurately enhance the data resolution of very infrequent events and improve model robustness. Overall, we show a significant superiority of GANs for boosting predictive models when compared to competing approaches on benchmark data sets. This work offers numerous of contributions to actuaries with applications to inter alia new sample creation, data augmentation, boosting predictive models, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation.},

	abstract = {Generating synthetic data is a complex task that necessitates accurately replicating the statistical and mathematical properties of the original data elements. In sectors such as finance, utilizing and disseminating real data for research or model development can pose substantial privacy risks owing to the inclusion of sensitive information. Additionally, authentic data may be scarce, particularly in specialized domains where acquiring ample, varied, and high-quality data is difficult or costly. This scarcity or limited data availability can limit the training and testing of machine-learning models. In this paper, we address this challenge. In particular, our task is to synthesize a dataset with similar properties to an input dataset about the stock market. The input dataset is anonymized and consists of very few columns and rows, contains many inconsistencies, such as missing rows and duplicates, and its values are not normalized, scaled, or balanced. We explore the utilization of generative adversarial networks, a deep-learning technique, to generate synthetic data and evaluate its quality compared to the input stock dataset. Our innovation involves generating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of the input elements without revealing complete information. For example, synthetic datasets can capture the distribution of stock prices, trading volumes, and market trends observed in the original dataset. The generated datasets cover a wider range of scenarios and variations, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore different market conditions and investment strategies. This diversity can enhance the robustness and generalization of machine-learning models. We evaluate our synthetic data in terms of the mean, similarities, and correlations.},

This study proposes a novel approach by constructing independent variables using early-stage information, incorporating founder attributes, and mitigating class imbalance through generative adversarial networks (GAN).

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques help to understand underlying patterns in datasets to develop defense mechanisms against cyber attacks. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) technique is a machine learning technique used in detecting attack vs. benign data. However, it is difficult to construct any effective model when there are imbalances in the dataset that prevent proper classification of attack samples in data. In this research, we use UGR'16 dataset to conduct data wrangling initially. This technique helps to prepare a test set from the original dataset to train the neural network model effectively. We experimented with a series of inputs of varying sizes (i.e. 10000, 50000, 1 million) to observe the performance of the MLP neural network model with distribution of features over accuracy. Later, we use Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model that produces samples of different attack labels (e.g. blacklist, anomaly spam, ssh scan) for balancing the dataset. These samples are generated based on data from the UGR'16 dataset. Further experiments with MLP neural network model shows that a balanced attack sample dataset, made possible with GAN, produces more accurate results than an imbalanced one.},

	abstract = {Detecting a large number of attack classes accurately applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques depends on the number of representative samples available for each attack class. In most cases, the data samples are highly imbalanced that results in a biased intrusion detection model towards the majority classes. Under-sampling, over-sampling and SMOTE are some techniques among the solutions that turn the imbalanced dataset to balanced one. These techniques have not had much impact on the improvement of detection accuracy. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) combined with an XGBoost Classifier. Gradient penalty along with the WCGAN is used for stable learning of the model. The proposed model is evaluated with some other GAN models (i.e., standard/vanilla GAN, Conditional GAN) which shows the significance of applying WCGAN in this paper. The loss on generated and real data shows a similar pattern and is lower for the Wasserstein variants of GAN compared to the other variants of the GAN model. The performance is benchmarked on three datasets NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The comparison of performance metrics before and after using the proposed framework with XGBoost classifier shows improvement in terms of higher precision, recall and F-1 score. However, comparatively less improvement is observed in FAR compared to other classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed work is also compared with a recent similar technique called DGM, which uses conditional GAN along with different ML classification models. The performance of the proposed model outperforms DGM. The proposed model creates a significant footprint (or, attack signatures) to tackle with the problem of data-imbalance during the design of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS).},

	abstract = {An intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a critical role in maintaining network security by continuously monitoring network traffic and host systems to detect any potential security breaches or suspicious activities. With the recent surge in cyberattacks, there is a growing need for automated and intelligent IDSs. Many of these systems are designed to learn the normal patterns of network traffic, enabling them to identify any deviations from the norm, which can be indicative of anomalous or malicious behavior. Machine learning methods have proven to be effective in detecting malicious payloads in network traffic. However, the increasing volume of data generated by IDSs poses significant security risks and emphasizes the need for stronger network security measures. The performance of traditional machine learning methods heavily relies on the dataset and its balanced distribution. Unfortunately, many IDS datasets suffer from imbalanced class distributions, which hampers the effectiveness of machine learning techniques and leads to missed detection and false alarms in conventional IDSs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel model-based generative adversarial network (GAN) called TDCGAN, which aims to improve the detection rate of the minority class in imbalanced datasets while maintaining efficiency. The TDCGAN model comprises a generator and three discriminators, with an election layer incorporated at the end of the architecture. This allows for the selection of the optimal outcome from the discriminators’ outputs. The UGR’16 dataset is employed for evaluation and benchmarking purposes. Various machine learning algorithms are used for comparison to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed TDCGAN model. Experimental results reveal that TDCGAN offers an effective solution for addressing imbalanced intrusion detection and outperforms other traditionally used oversampling techniques. By leveraging the power of GANs and incorporating an election layer, TDCGAN demonstrates superior performance in detecting security threats in imbalanced IDS datasets.},
