\section{Development of Moral Clusters}

The creation of our moral clusters framework is based on a structured analysis of ethical theories from ethics and philosophical literature. Our aim is to develop a comprehensive yet practical structure that represents major ethical paradigms and can serve as a foundation for implementing ethical reasoning in AI systems.

\subsubsection{Literature Review}

We began with a review of ethical theories spanning from classical to contemporary philosophy. This review focuses on widely recognized works in moral philosophy, including consequentialist, deontological, virtue-based, care-oriented, and justice-focused ethical frameworks. Key sources include seminal works such as Mill's \textit{Utilitarianism}, Kant's ethical writings, Aristotle's \textit{Nicomachean Ethics}, Gilligan's work on care ethics, and Rawls' \textit{[A] Theory of Justice}.

\subsubsection{Cluster Identification}

Based on our literature review, we identified five primary clusters of ethical thought:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consequentialist Ethics
    \item Deontological Ethics
    \item Virtue Ethics
    \item Care Ethics
    \item Social Justice Ethics
\end{enumerate}

These clusters were chosen because they represent distinct approaches to ethical reasoning, cover a broad spectrum of moral considerations, and are frequently discussed in both philosophical literature and applied ethics.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Framework Development}

For each identified cluster, we developed a structured framework consisting of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a general description of the ethical approach,
    \item a key principle that unifies theories within the cluster,
    \item representative ethical theories,
    \item key concepts for each theory,
    \item decision factors that could potentially be operationalized in an AI system.
\end{itemize}

This structure aims to balance philosophical depth with practical applicability for AI systems. The selection of representative theories, key concepts, and decision factors is based on their prominence in the literature and their potential for translation into computational models.

\subsubsection{Refinement Process}

The initial framework undergoes several iterations of refinement. This process involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item critically examining the coherence within each cluster,
    \item ensuring clear distinctions between clusters,
    \item verifying that the selected theories adequately represent the diversity within each ethical approach,
    \item refining key concepts and decision factors to ensure they capture the essence of each theory while remaining potentially quantifiable for AI applications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

We acknowledge several limitations of our approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The categorization of ethical theories into distinct clusters, while useful for structuring AI decision-making, may oversimplify the nuances and overlaps between different ethical approaches.
    \item Our focus on operationalizing these theories for AI applications may lead to some simplification of complex philosophical ideas.
    \item The selection of representative theories and decision factors, while based on their prominence in literature, inevitably involves a degree of subjectivity in judgment.
\end{itemize}

We make the following key assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item That these five clusters adequately represent the major streams of ethical thought relevant to AI decision-making.
    \item That the selected theories within each cluster are sufficiently representative of each kind of ethical approach.
    \item That the identified key concepts and decision factors can be meaningfully translated into computational models, while the specific implementation would require further research and development.
\end{itemize}
