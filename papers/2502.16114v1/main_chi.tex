  \caption{
  \tool helps analysts read and understand computational notebooks by linking text to code and outputs using a side-by-side layout.
  Clicking the icon in the toolbar (b1) activates \tool, switching the layout of the notebook from a linear layout (A) to a side-by-side layout (B).
  In (B), the ``observation'' cell, marked with the fixed icon (b2), indicates that it has been fixed in place through a click, ensuring it remains visible on the screen for easy reference.
  A linking line (b3) explicitly connects the ``observation'' cell to the code cell (b4).
  Visual cues (b5-b7), including colored underlines, dashed borders, and dashed sketches, indicate the existence of relationships between segments or cells.
