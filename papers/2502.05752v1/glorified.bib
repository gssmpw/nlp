  abstract = {Abstract Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, surface reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish correspondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspondences into alignment. A major difficulty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the ICP algorithm address this issue with a number of heuristics to prune or reweight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difficult to tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the ICP algorithm that avoids these difficulties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our new algorithm retains the simple structure of the ICP algorithm, while achieving superior registration results when dealing with outliers and incomplete data. The complete source code of our implementation is provided at http://lgg.epfl.ch/sparseicp.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of the environment structure simultaneously with the robot pose is a key capability of autonomous robotic vehicles. Classical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms rely on the static world assumption to formulate the estimation problem, however, the real world has a significant amount of dynamics that can be exploited for a more accurate localization and versatile representation of the environment. In this paper we propose a technique to integrate the motion of dynamic objects into the SLAM estimation problem, without the necessity of estimating the pose or the geometry of the objects. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of the pose change of rigid bodies in motion and show the benefits of integrating such information when performing SLAM in dynamic environments. Our experiments show consistent improvement in robot localization and mapping accuracy when using a simple constant motion assumption, even for objects whose motion slightly violates this assumption.}

Most of the systems developed thus far, however, are restricted to indoor scenarios, non-urban outdoor environments, or road usage with cars. Urban areas introduce numerous challenges to autonomous mobile robots as they are highly complex and in addition to that dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for pedestrian-like autonomous navigation with mobile robots in city environments. We describe different components including a SLAM system for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning approach for inferring feasible paths taking also into account the traversability and type of terrain, and a method for accurate localization in dynamic environments. The navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests in which the robot Obelix managed to autonomously navigate from our university campus over a 3.3 km long route to the city center of Freiburg.}

  abstract = {Mapping is a crucial task in robotics and a fundamental building block of most mobile systems deployed in the real world. Robots use different environment representations depending on their task and sensor setup. This paper showcases a practical approach to volumetric surface reconstruction based on truncated signed distance functions, also called TSDFs. We revisit the basics of this mapping technique and offer an approach for building effective and efficient real-world mapping systems. In contrast to most state-of-the-art SLAM and mapping approaches, we are making no assumptions on the size of the environment nor the employed range sensor. Unlike most other approaches, we introduce an effective system that works in multiple domains using different sensors. To achieve this, we build upon the Academy-Award-winning OpenVDB library used in filmmaking to realize an effective 3D map representation. Based on this, our proposed system is flexible and highly effective and, in the end, capable of integrating point clouds from a 64-beam LiDAR sensor at 20 frames per second using a single-core CPU. Along with this publication comes an easy-to-use C++ and Python library to quickly and efficiently solve volumetric mapping problems with TSDFs.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a novel dense surfel mapping system that scales well in different environments with only CPU computation. Using a sparse SLAM system to estimate camera poses, the proposed mapping system can fuse intensity images and depth images into a globally consistent model. The system is carefully designed so that it can build from room-scale environments to urban-scale environments using depth images from RGB-D cameras, stereo cameras or even a monocular camera. First, superpixels extracted from both intensity and depth images are used to model surfels in the system. superpixel-based surfels make our method both runtime efficient and memory efficient. Second, surfels are further organized according to the pose graph of the SLAM system to achieve O(1) fusion time regardless of the scale of reconstructed models. Third, a fast map deformation using the optimized pose graph enables the map to achieve global consistency in real-time. The proposed surfel mapping system is compared with other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets. The performances of urban-scale and room-scale reconstruction are demonstrated using the KITTI dataset [1] and autonomous aggressive flights, respectively. The code is available for the benefit of the community.},

Using the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), a sparse Gaussian Mixture Model, for representation of 3D range scan data, we propose a frame-to-model registration and data fusion algorithm NDT Fusion. The proposed approach uses a submap indexing system to achieve operation in arbitrarily-sized environments. The approach is evaluated on a publicly available city-block sized data set, achieving accuracy and runtime performance significantly better than current state of the art. In addition, the system is evaluated on a data set covering ten hours of operation and a trajectory of 7.2km in a real-world industrial environment, achieving centimeter accuracy at update rates of 5-10 Hz.},

  abstract  = {NeRF synthesizes novel views of a scene with unprecedented quality by fitting a neural radiance field to RGB images. However, NeRF requires querying a deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow rendering times, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.},

Using the CARLA simulator, we develop a parking lot environment and collect a dataset of human parking maneuvers. We then study the impact of model complexity and feature information by comparing a multi-modal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model and a Convolution Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM) to a physics-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) baseline. Our results show that 1) intent can be estimated well (roughly 85\% top-1 accuracy and nearly 100\% top-3 accuracy with the LSTM and CNN-LSTM model); 2) knowledge of the human driver's intended parking spot has a major impact on predicting parking trajectory; and 3) the semantic representation of the environment improves long term predictions.}

Agricultural robots can accelerate plant breeding and advance data-driven precision farming with significantly reduced labor inputs by providing task-appropriate sensing and actuation at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. This article highlights the distinctive challenges imposed on ground robots by agricultural environments, which are characterized by wide variations in environmental conditions, diversity and complexity of plant canopy structures, and intraspecies biological variation of physical and chemical characteristics and responses to the environment. Existing approaches to address these challenges are presented, along with their limitations; possible future directions are also discussed. Two key observations are that biology (breeding) and horticultural practices can reduce variabilities at the source and that publicly available benchmark data sets are needed to increase perception robustness and performance despite variability. }

We further investigated the usage of multi-LiDAR setup and its effect on the performance of the semantic segmentation task. Our evaluations are carried out on a large scale 3D object detection benchmark containing a LiDAR cocoon setup, along with KITTI dataset, where the per-point segmentation labels are derived from 3D bounding boxes. We show that VolMap achieved an excellent balance between high accuracy and real-time running on CPU.}

This paper reviews some of the latest achievements in agricultural robotics, specifically those that are used for autonomous weed control, field scouting, and harvesting. Object identification, task planning algorithms, digitalization and optimization of sensors are highlighted as some of the facing challenges in the context of digital farming. The concepts of multi-robots, human-robot collaboration, and environment reconstruction from aerial images and ground-based sensors for the creation of virtual farms were highlighted as some of the gateways of digital farming. It was shown that one of the trends and research focuses in agricultural field robotics is towards building a swarm of small scale robots and drones that collaborate together to optimize farming inputs and reveal denied or concealed information. For the case of robotic harvesting, an autonomous framework with several simple axis manipulators can be faster and more efficient than the currently adapted professional expensive manipulators. While robots are becoming the inseparable parts of the modern farms, our conclusion is that it is not realistic to expect an entirely automated farming system in the future.},

Image-based benchmark datasets have driven the development in computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking and segmentation of agents in the environment. Most autonomous vehicles, however, carry a combination of cameras and range sensors such as lidar and radar. As machine learning based methods for detection and tracking become more prevalent, there is a need to train and evaluate such methods on datasets containing range sensor data along with images. In this work we present nuTonomy scenes (nuScenes), the first dataset to carry the full autonomous vehicle sensor suite: 6 cameras, 5 radars and 1 lidar, all with full 360 degree field of view. nuScenes comprises 1000 scenes, each 20s long and fully annotated with 3D bounding boxes for 23 classes and 8 attributes. It has 7x as many annotations and 100x as many images as the pioneering KITTI dataset. We also define a new metric for 3D detection which consolidates the multiple aspects of the detection task: classification, localization, size, orientation, velocity and attribute estimation. We provide careful dataset analysis as well as baseline performance for lidar and image based detection methods. Data, development kit, and more information are available at www.nuscenes.org.}

  abstract = {Tracking 6D poses of objects from videos provides rich information to a robot in performing different tasks such as manipulation and navigation. In this work, we formulate the 6D object pose tracking problem in the Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering framework, where the 3D rotation and the 3D translation of an object are decoupled. This factorization allows our approach, called PoseRBPF, to efficiently estimate the 3D translation of an object along with the full distribution over the 3D rotation. This is achieved by discretizing the rotation space in a fine-grained manner, and training an auto-encoder network to construct a codebook of feature embeddings for the discretized rotations. As a result, PoseRBPF can track objects with arbitrary symmetries while still maintaining adequate posterior distributions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two 6D pose estimation benchmarks. A video showing the experiments can be found at https://youtu.be/lE5gjzRKWuA}

  abstract = {This work studies semantic segmentation using 3D LiDAR data. Popular deep learning methods applied for this task require a large number of manual annotations to train the parameters. We propose a new method that makes full use of the advantages of traditional methods and deep learning methods via incorporating human domain knowledge into the neural network model to reduce the demand for large numbers of manual annotations and improve the training efficiency. We first pretrain a model with autogenerated samples from a rule-based classifier so that human knowledge can be propagated into the network. Based on the pretrained model, only a small set of annotations is required for further fine-tuning. Quantitative experiments show that the pretrained model achieves better performance than random initialization in almost all cases; furthermore, our method can achieve similar performance with fewer manual annotations.}

  abstract = {A robust and reliable semantic segmentation in adverse weather conditions is very important for autonomous cars, but most state-of-the-art approaches only achieve high accuracy rates in optimal weather conditions. The reason is that they are only optimized for good weather conditions and given noise models. However, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their performance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable results is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as camera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks, since different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions. Hence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor data fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to disturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem can be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust Learning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle unknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for semantic segmentation are compared and evaluated on several datasets. Furthermore, it is shown that the RLM increases the robustness in adverse weather conditions enormously, and achieve good results although no disturbance model has been learned by the neural network.}

For safe operation, it is critical to have an accurate estimate of the position of all objects surrounding the vehicle. The contributions of this work are twofold: First, we present a new object detection and tracking dataset (UofTPed50), which uses GPS to ground truth the position and velocity of a pedestrian. To our knowledge, a dataset of this type for pedestrians has not been shown in the literature before. Second, we present a lightweight object detection and tracking system (aUToTrack) that uses vision, LIDAR, and GPS/IMU positioning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI Object Tracking benchmark. We show that aUToTrack accurately estimates the position and velocity of pedestrians, in real-time, using CPUs only. aUToTrack has been tested in closed-loop experiments on a real self-driving car, and we demonstrate its performance on our dataset.}

  abstract = {The ability to automatically monitor agricultural fields is an important capability in precision farming, enabling steps towards more sustainable agriculture. Precise, high-resolution monitoring is a key prerequisite for targeted intervention and the selective application of agro-chemicals. The main goal of this paper is developing a novel crop/weed segmentation and mapping framework that processes multispectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a deep neural network (DNN).  Most studies on crop/weed semantic segmentation only consider single images for processing and classification. Images taken by UAVs often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color and near-infrared (NIR) channels. Although a map can be generated by processing single segmented images incrementally, this requires additional complex information fusion techniques which struggle to handle high fidelity maps due to their computational costs and problems in ensuring global consistency. Moreover, computing a single large and accurate vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we adopt a stand sliding window approach that operates on only small portions of multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles), which are channel-wise aligned and calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define the tile size to be the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our baseline model (i.e., SegNet with 3 channel RGB inputs) yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of [background=0.607, crop=0.681, weed=0.576], our proposed model with 9 input channels achieves [0.839, 0.863, 0.782]. Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of 20 trained models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in order to evaluate the effects of varying input channels and tunable network hyperparameters. Furthermore, we release a large sugar beet/weed aerial dataset with expertly guided annotations for further research in the fields of remote sensing, precision agriculture, and agricultural robotics.}

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food-energy-water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.}

Our algorithm operates directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points. Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle state-estimation in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our implementation as open-source software.},

Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and DTAM achieves real-time performance using current commodity GPU hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

We then propose a linearization of the energy function which leads to a 6×6 normal equation for the twist coordinates representing the rigid body motion. To allow for larger motions, we solve this equation in a coarse-to-fine scheme. Extensive quantitative analysis on recently proposed benchmark datasets shows that the proposed solution is faster than a state-of-the-art implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm by two orders of magnitude. While ICP is more robust to large camera motion, the proposed method gives better results in the regime of small displacements which are often the case in camera tracking applications.},

While this can potentially be provided by a single omnidirectional camera, it can also be flexibly achieved by multiple cameras with standard optics mounted around the robot. However, such setups are difficult to calibrate. Here we present a general method for fully automatic extrinsic auto-calibration of a fixed multi camera rig, with no requirement for calibration patterns or other infrastructure, which works even in the case where the cameras have completely non-overlapping views. The robot is placed in a natural environment and makes a set of programmed movements including a full horizontal rotation and captures a synchronized image sequence from each camera. These sequences are processed individually with a monocular visual SLAM algorithm. The resulting maps are matched and fused robustly based on corresponding invariant features, and then all estimates are optimised full joint bundle adjustment, where we constrain the relative poses of the cameras to be fixed. We present results showing accurate performance of the method for various two and four camera configurations.},

Using an isomorphism between SE3 and SO̲3, together with a set of properties from SO̲3, we formulate closed-form simultaneous solutions for data recorded from any number of displacements. These solutions are free of coordinates and can easily be put into practice. Implementation algorithms are presented and numerical results are discussed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions.}

The extrinsic calibration between such sensors (i.e. finding their relative poses) is required to exploit effectively the sensor measurements and to perform data fusion. The approaches found in the literature to obtain such calibration either rely on the approximated parameters from the rig construction or propose ad-hoc solutions for specific LRF rigs. In this paper we present a novel solution for the extrinsic calibration of a set of at least three laser scanners from the information provided by the sensor measurements. This method only requires the lasers to observe a common planar surface from different orientations, thus there is no need of any specific calibration pattern. This calibration technique can be used with almost any geometric sensor configuration (except for sensors scanning parallel planes), and constitutes a versatile solution that is accurate, fast and easy to apply. This approach is validated with both simulated and real data.},

However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camerato-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experiments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions.},

Thus, the method does not require any specific pattern, which turns the calibration process fast and simpler to perform. The estimated relative pose has proven to be also very precise since it uses two different types of constraints, line-to-plane and point-to-plane, as a result of a richer configuration than previous proposals that relies on plane or V-shaped patterns.

In such situations, accurate knowledge of calibration parameters is critical for the safe operation of automated systems. However, most existing calibration methods for multisensor systems are computationally expensive, use installations of known fiducial patterns, and require expert supervision. We propose an alternative approach called infrastructure-based calibration that is efficient, requires no modification of the infrastructure, and is completely unsupervised. In a survey phase, a computationally expensive simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method is used to build a highly accurate map of a calibration area. Once the map is built, many other vehicles are able to use it for calibration as if it were a known fiducial pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of a multi-camera system. The method does not assume that the cameras have an overlapping field of view and it does not require an initial guess. As the camera rig moves through the previously mapped area, we match features between each set of synchronized camera images and the map. Subsequently, we find the camera poses and inlier 2D-3D correspondences. From the camera poses, we obtain an initial estimate of the camera extrinsics and rig poses, and optimize these extrinsics and rig poses via non-linear refinement. The calibration code is publicly available as a standalone C++ package.},

In the case of the AX = Y B problem, the relative hand-eye (X) and robotworld (Y ) transformations must be determined to provide accurate data for use in control. As an added difficulty, the exact correspondence between the streams of sensor data (As and Bs) is typically unknown due to asynchrony in sampling rates and processing time. One common scenario is a constant shift between the two data streams. Therefore, in this paper we present a probabilistic method to simultaneously solve for X and Y without a priori knowledge of the correspondence between the streams of As and Bs. We begin by discussing probability density functions on SE(3) and then use Euclideangroup invariants to obtain an exact solution for X and Y . We then present a method to simultaneously recover X and Y and the correspondence between temporally shifted data sets using a correlation method. Following this, we show how to solve the problem in the case when the data are completely scrambled, corresponding to a complete loss of temporal information. Finally, we numerically simulated the proposed method with asynchronous data and noise added to the stream of Bs to verify its efficiency and robustness.},

To robustly deal with the potentially restricted overlap between the fields of view, our approach only requires a dynamic object, e.g., a person, moving through the observed area. We employ a RANSAC-like algorithm to find the correspondences between the measurements of the different laser range finders.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we describe a new approach for the extrinsic calibration of a camera with a 3D laser range finder, that can be done on the fly. This approach does not require any calibration object. Only few point correspondences are used, which are manually selected by the user from a scene viewed by the two sensors. The proposed method relies on a novel technique to visualize the range information obtained from a 3D laser scanner. This technique converts the visually ambiguous 3D range information into a 2D map where natural features of a scene are highlighted. We show that by enhancing the features the user can easily find the corresponding points of the camera image points. Therefore, visually identifying lasercamera correspondences becomes as easy as image pairing. Once point correspondences are given, extrinsic calibration is done using the well-known PnP algorithm followed by a nonlinear refinement process. We show the performance of our approach through experimental results. In these experiments, we will use an omnidirectional camera. The implication of this method is important because it brings 3D computer vision systems out of the laboratory and into practical use.},

  abstract  = {Laser based detection and tracking of persons can be used for numerous tasks. While a single laser range finder (LRF) is sufficient for detecting and tracking persons on a mobile robot platform, a network of multiple LRF is required to observe persons in larger spaces. Calibrating multiple LRF into a global coordinate system is usually done by hand in a time consuming procedure. An automatic calibration mechanism for such a sensor network is introduced in this paper. Without the need of prior knowledge about the environment, this mechanism is able to obtain the positions and orientations of all LRF in a global coordinate system. By comparing person tracks, determined for each individual LRF unit and matching them, constrains between the LRF units can be calculated. We are able to estimate the poses of all LRF by resolving these constrains. We evaluate and compare our method to the current state of the art approach methodically and experimentally. Experiments show that our calibration approach outperforms this approach.},

While there are many different approaches to determining X and Z, including linear and iterative methods, we parameterize the rotation components using Euler angles and find a solution using Levenberg-Marquadt iterative approach. We also offer a method to determine A, X, and Z, by formulating the robot-world, hand-eye calibration problem in terms of camera reprojection error. We compare both of these approaches to the state-ofthe-art and conclude that our approaches yield lower values of camera reprojection error. In addition, we demonstrate the improved reconstruction accuracy when using the robot-world, hand-eye calibrations produced from our methods.},

Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimal parameters for this model. This method requires no markers to be placed in the scene. While the system can use a set of scans, unlike many existing techniques it can also automatically calibrate the system reliably using a single scan.

Our approach takes inspiration from medical imaging, in particular from multi-modal image registration. Most of the algorithms developed in this domain, where the images to register come from different sensors (CT, X-ray, PET), are based on Mutual Information, a statistical measure of non-linear correlation between two data sources. The main idea is to use mutual information as a similarity measure between the image to be registered and renderings of the model geometry, in order to drive the registration in an iterative optimization framework. We demonstrate that some illumination-related geometric properties, such as surface normals, ambient occlusion and reflection directions can be used for this purpose. After a comprehensive analysis of such properties we propose a way to combine these sources of information in order to improve the performance of our automatic registration algorithm. The proposed approach can robustly cover a wide range of real cases and can be easily extended.}

One is to add the seed selection procedure based on local shape information to avoid blind growth. The other is to simplify the plane fitting mean square error computation complex. Second, a novel algorithm called grid-based region growing is presented for structured environments. The point cloud is divided into small patches based on neighborhood information when it is viewed as a range image. The small patch is called grid. Then the grids are classified into different categories according to their local appearance, including sparse, planar, spherical and linear. Finally, the planar grids are clustered into big patches by region growing. The plane parameters are incrementally computed whenever a new grid is added. The resulting planes can be used for 3D plane simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Experimental results show promising plane detecting speed for both structured and unstructured environments.},

  abstract = {Visual odometry can be augmented by depth information such as provided by RGB-D cameras, or from lidars associated with cameras. However, such depth information can be limited by the sensors, leaving large areas in the visual images where depth is unavailable. Here, we propose a method to utilize the depth, even if sparsely available, in recovery of camera motion. In addition, the method utilizes depth by structure from motion using the previously estimated motion, and salient visual features for which depth is unavailable. Therefore, the method is able to extend RGB-D visual odometry to large scale, open environments where depth often cannot be sufficiently acquired. The core of our method is a bundle adjustment step that refines the motion estimates in parallel by processing a sequence of images, in a batch optimization. We have evaluated our method in three sensor setups, one using an RGB-D camera, and two using combinations of a camera and a 3D lidar. Our method is rated #4 on the KITTI odometry benchmark irrespective of sensing modality—compared to stereo visual odometry methods which retrieve depth by triangulation. The resulting average position error is 1.14\% of the distance traveled.},

We show that LS-VCE is a simple, flexible, and attractive VCE-method. The LS-VCE method is simple because it is based on the well-known principle of least-squares. With this method the estimation of the (co)variance components is based on a linear model of observation equations. The method is flexible since it works with a user-defined weight matrix. Different weight matrix classes can be defined which all automatically lead to unbiased estimators of (co)variance components. LS-VCE is attractive since it allows one to apply the existing body of knowledge of least-squares theory to the problem of (co)variance component estimation. With this method, one can 1) obtain measures of discrepancies in the stochastic model, 2) determine the covariance matrix of the (co)variance components, 3) obtain the minimum variance estimator of (co)variance components by choosing the weight matrix as the inverse of the covariance matrix, 4) take the a-priori information on the (co)variance component into account, 5) solve for a nonlinear (co)variance component model, 6) apply the idea of robust estimation to (co)variance components, 7) evaluate the estimability of the (co)variance components, and 8) avoid the problem of obtaining negative variance components.}

These two limitations prevent them from being fully automatic. The method presented in this paper removes these restrictions. By combining information extracted from both, platform's motion estimates and external observations, our approach eliminates the need for special markers and also removes the need for manual initialisation. A third advantage is that the motion-based automatic initialisation does not require overlapping field of view between sensors. The paper also provides a method to estimate the accuracy of the resulting calibration. We illustrate the generalisation of our approach and validate its performance by showing results with two contrasting datasets. The first dataset was collected in a city with a car platform, and the second one was collected in a tree-crop farm with a Segway platform.}

It contrasts with the vast majority of existing approaches which use image to image database matching. We use highly compact binary descriptors to represent semantic features at locations, significantly increasing scalability compared with existing methods and having the potential for greater invariance to variable imaging conditions. The approach is also more akin to human map reading, making it more suited to human-system interaction. The binary descriptors indicate the presence or not of semantic features relating to buildings and road junctions in discrete viewing directions. We use CNN classifiers to detect the features in images and match descriptor estimates with a database of location tagged descriptors derived from the 2-D map. In isolation, the descriptors are not sufficiently discriminative, but when concatenated sequentially along a route, their combination becomes highly distinctive and allows localisation even when using non-perfect classifiers. Performance is further improved by taking into account left or right turns over a route. Experimental results obtained using Google StreetView and OpenStreetMap data show that the approach has considerable potential, achieving localisation accuracy of around 85\% using routes corresponding to approximately 200 meters.}

  abstract = {Monocular visual odometry approaches that purely rely on geometric cues are prone to scale drift and require sufficient motion parallax in successive frames for motion estimation and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to leverage deep monocular depth prediction to overcome limitations of geometry-based monocular visual odometry. To this end, we incorporate deep depth predictions into Direct Sparse Odometry as direct virtual stereo measurements. For depth prediction, we design a novel deep network that refines predicted depth from a single image in a two-stage process. We train our network in a semi-supervised way on photoconsistency in stereo images and on consistency with accurate sparse depth reconstructions from Stereo DSO. Our deep predictions excel state-of-the-art approaches for monocular depth on the KITTI benchmark. Moreover, our Deep Virtual Stereo Odometry clearly exceeds previous monocular and deep-learning based methods in accuracy. It even achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art stereo methods, while only relying on a single camera.}

  abstract  = {Pose estimation and mapping are key capabilities of most autonomous vehicles and thus a number of localization and SLAM algorithms have been developed in the past. Autonomous robots and cars are typically equipped with multiple sensors. Often, the sensor suite includes a camera and a laser range finder. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental ego-motion estimation, using both, a monocular camera and a laser range finder jointly. We propose a new algorithm, that exploits the advantages of both sensors---the ability of cameras to determine orientations well and the ability of laser range finders to estimate the scale and to directly obtain 3D point clouds. Our approach estimates the five degree of freedom relative orientation from image pairs through feature point correspondences and formulates the remaining scale estimation as a new variant of the iterative closet point problem with only one degree of freedom. We furthermore exploit the camera information in a new way to constrain the data association between laser point clouds. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach is able to accurately estimate the ego-motion of a vehicle and that we obtain more accurate frame-to-frame alignments than with one sensor modality alone.},

  booktitle = iros,
  year      = 2018,
  abstract  = {Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to- end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance.},

  abstract = {Reducing the use of agrochemicals is an important component towards sustainable agriculture. Robots that can perform targeted weed control offer the potential to contribute to this goal, for example, through specialized weeding actions such as selective spraying or mechanical weed removal. A prerequisite of such systems is a reliable and robust plant classification system that is able to distinguish crop and weed in the field. A major challenge in this context is the fact that different fields show a large variability. Thus, classification systems have to robustly cope with substantial environmental changes with respect to weed pressure and weed types, growth stages of the crop, visual appearance, and soil conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel crop-weed classification system that relies on a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences. Exploiting the crop arrangement information that is observable from the image sequences enables our system to robustly estimate a pixel-wise labeling of the images into crop and weed, i.e., a semantic segmentation. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation, which shows that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions --- a key capability to actually use such systems in precision framing. We provide comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our system substantially improves the accuracy of crop-weed classification without requiring a retraining of the model.},

Experiments on SUN RGBD and KITTI shows the efficiency and accuracy over existing approaches. Then in the second part, multi-view bundle adjustment with novel measurement functions is proposed to jointly optimize camera poses, objects and points, utilizing single view detection results.

In the current appearance-based SLAM methods, the visual inputs are usually affected by illumination, appearance and viewpoints changes. Comparing to the visual inputs, with the active property, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based point-cloud inputs are invariant to the illumination and appearance changes. In this paper, we extract 3D voxel maps and 2D top view maps from LiDAR inputs, and the former could capture the local geometry into a simplified 3D voxel format, the later could capture the local road structure into a 2D image format. However, the most challenge problem is to obtain efficient features from 3D and 2D maps to against the viewpoints difference. In this paper, we proposed a synchronous adversarial feature learning method for the LCD task, which could learn the higher level abstract features from different domains without any label data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to extract multi-domain adversarial features for the LCD task in real time. To investigate the performance, we test the proposed method on the KITTI odometry dataset. The extensive experiments results show that, the proposed method could largely improve LCD accuracy even under huge viewpoints differences.}

While the problem is well studied for certain sensory modalities such as image data, few works exist that address this detection task using 2D range data. However, a widespread sensory setup for many mobile robots in service and domestic applications contains a horizontally mounted 2D laser scanner. Detecting people from 2D range data is challenging due to the speed and dynamics of human leg motion and the high levels of occlusion and self-occlusion particularly in crowds of people. While previous approaches mostly relied on handcrafted features, we recently developed the deep learning based wheelchair and walker detector DROW. In this paper, we show the generalization to people, including small modifications that significantly boost DROW's performance. Additionally, by providing a small, fully online temporal window in our network, we further boost our score. We extend the DROW dataset with person annotations, making this the largest dataset of person annotations in 2D range data, recorded during several days in a real-world environment with high diversity. Extensive experiments with three current baseline methods indicate it is a challenging dataset, on which our improved DROW detector beats the current state-of-the-art.}

Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and mid-summer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

This includes a need for realistic three-dimensional (3D) representations of plant shoots for quantification and modeling. Previous limitations in single-view or multiple-view stereo algorithms have led to a reliance on volumetric methods or expensive hardware to record plant structure. We present a fully automatic approach to image-based 3D plant reconstruction that can be achieved using a single low-cost camera. The reconstructed plants are represented as a series of small planar sections that together model the more complex architecture of the leaf surfaces. The boundary of each leaf patch is refined using the level-set method, optimizing the model based on image information, curvature constraints, and the position of neighboring surfaces. The reconstruction process makes few assumptions about the nature of the plant material being reconstructed and, as such, is applicable to a wide variety of plant species and topologies and can be extended to canopy-scale imaging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on data sets of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) plants as well as a unique virtual data set that allows us to compute quantitative measures of reconstruction accuracy. The output is a 3D mesh structure that is suitable for modeling applications in a format that can be imported in the majority of 3D graphics and software packages.Glossary3Dthree-dimensionalLIDARlight detection and ranging laserPMVSpatch-based multiple-view stereo2Dtwo-dimensional},

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.}

Under the constrained SLAM formulation, we study the robustness of an incremental SLAM algorithm against local minima and outliers as a constraint/loopclosure cycle selection problem. We find a constraint metric that can predict the objective function growth after including the constraint. By the virtue of the constraint metric, we select constraints into the incremental SLAM according to a least objective function growth principle to increase robustness against local minima, and perform 2 difference test on the constraint metric to increase robustness against outliers. Finally, using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the solver, an incremental SLAM algorithm (iSQP) is proposed. Experimental validations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the constraint metric, and the robustness of the proposed incremental SLAM algorithm. Nonetheless, the proposed approach is currently confined to datasets with sparse loop-closures due to its computational cost.},

  abstract  = {We present a self-supervised approach to ignoring distractors in camera images for the purposes of robustly estimating vehicle motion in cluttered urban environments. We leverage offline multi-session mapping approaches to automatically generate a per-pixel ephemerality mask and depth map for each input image, which we use to train a deep convolutional network. At run-time we use the predicted ephemerality and depth as an input to a monocular visual odometry (VO) pipeline, using either sparse features or dense photometric matching. Our approach yields metric-scale VO using only a single camera and can recover the correct egomotion even when 90\% of the image is obscured by dynamic, independently moving objects. We evaluate our robust VO methods on more than 400km of driving from the Oxford RobotCar Dataset and demonstrate reduced odometry drift and significantly improved egomotion estimation in the presence of large moving vehicles in urban traffic.},

  abstract = {Recent direct visual odometry and SLAM algorithms have demonstrated impressive levels of precision. However, they require a photometric camera calibration in order to achieve competitive results. Hence, the respective algorithm cannot be directly applied to an off-the-shelf-camera or to a video sequence acquired with an unknown camera. In this work we propose a method for online photometric calibration which enables to process auto exposure videos with visual odometry precisions that are on par with those of photometrically calibrated videos. Our algorithm recovers the exposure times of consecutive frames, the camera response function, and the attenuation factors of the sensor irradiance due to vignetting. Gain robust KLT feature tracks are used to obtain scene point correspondences as input to a nonlinear optimization framework. We show that our approach can reliably calibrate arbitrary video sequences by evaluating it on datasets for which full photometric ground truth is available. We further show that our calibration can improve the performance of a state-of-theart direct visual odometry method that works solely on pixel intensities, calibrating for photometric parameters in an online fashion in realtime.},

  abstract  = {Visual robot navigation within large-scale, semistructured environments deals with various challenges such as computation intensive path planning algorithms or insufficient knowledge about traversable spaces. Moreover, many stateof-the-art navigation approaches only operate locally instead of gaining a more conceptual understanding of the planning objective. This limits the complexity of tasks a robot can accomplish and makes it harder to deal with uncertainties that are present in the context of real-time robotics applications. In this work, we present Topomap, a framework which simplifies the navigation task by providing a map to the robot which is tailored for path planning use. This novel approach transforms a sparse feature-based map from a visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system into a three-dimensional topological map. This is done in two steps. First, we extract occupancy information directly from the noisy sparse point cloud. Then, we create a set of convex free-space clusters, which are the vertices of the topological map. We show that this representation improves the efficiency of global planning, and we provide a complete derivation of our algorithm. Planning experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that we achieve similar performance as RRT* with significantly lower computation times and storage requirements. Finally, we test our algorithm on a mobile robotic platform to prove its advantages.}

While this work is related to the descriptor Kalman filter, it also represents a step towards batch optimization and allows the integration of further techniques such as robust weighting for outlier rejection. We derive recursive filter equations which exhibit similar computational complexity when compared to their Kalman filter counterpart the extended information filter.

NBV planning approaches often use either volumetric (e.g., voxel grids) or surface (e.g., triangulated meshes) representations. Volumetric approaches generalise well between scenes as they do not depend on surface geometry but do not scale to high-resolution models of large scenes. Surface representations can obtain high-resolution models at any scale but often require tuning of unintuitive parameters or multiple survey stages. This paper presents a scene-model-free NBV planning approach with a density representation. The Surface Edge Explorer (SEE) uses the density of current measurements to detect and explore observed surface boundaries. This approach is shown experimentally to provide better surface coverage in lower computation time than the evaluated state-of-the-art volumetric approaches while moving equivalent distances.},

Our first contribution is to develop robust estimators that can cope with heavy-tailed measurement noise, hence increasing robustness to the presence of outliers. Since the resulting estimators require solving nonconvex optimization problems, we further develop convex relaxations that approximately solve those problems via semidefinite programming. We then provide conditions for testing the exactness of the proposed relaxations. Contrary to existing approaches, our convex relaxations do not rely on the availability of an initial guess for the unknown poses, hence they are more suitable for setups in which such guess is not available (e.g., multi robot localization, recovery after localization failure). We tested the proposed techniques in extensive simulations, and we show that some of the proposed relaxations are indeed tight (i.e., they solve the original nonconvex problem exactly) and ensure accurate estimation in the face of a large number of outliers.},

Being visual, it relies on cheap, lightweight and versatile cameras, and, being decentralized, it does not rely on communication to a central entity. In this work, we integrate state-of-theart decentralized SLAM components into a new, complete decentralized visual SLAM system. To allow for data association and optimization, existing decentralized visual SLAM systems exchange the full map data among all robots, incurring large data transfers at a complexity that scales quadratically with the robot count. In contrast, our method performs efficient data association in two stages: first, a compact full-image descriptor is deterministically sent to only one robot. Then, only if the first stage succeeded, the data required for relative pose estimation is sent, again to only one robot. Thus, data association scales linearly with the robot count and uses highly compact place representations. For optimization, a state-of-theart decentralized pose-graph optimization method is used. It exchanges a minimum amount of data which is linear with trajectory overlap. We characterize the resulting system and identify bottlenecks in its components. The system is evaluated on publicly available datasets and we provide open access to the code.},

The competitive accuracy and robustness of these algorithms compared to state-of-the-art feature-based methods, as well as their natural ability to yield dense maps, makes them an appealing choice for a variety of mobile robotics applications. However, direct methods remain brittle in the face of appearance change due to their underlying assumption of photometric consistency, which is commonly violated in practice. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this problem by training deep convolutional encoder-decoder models to transform images of a scene such that they correspond to a previously-seen canonical appearance. We validate our method in multiple environments and illumination conditions using high-fidelity synthetic RGB-D datasets, and integrate the trained models into a direct visual localization pipeline, yielding improvements in visual odometry (VO) accuracy through timevarying illumination conditions, as well as improved metric relocalization performance under illumination change, where conventional methods normally fail. We further provide a preliminary investigation of transfer learning from synthetic to real environments in a localization context.},

  abstract  = {Flying robots require a combination of accuracy and low latency in their state estimation in order to achieve stable and robust flight. However, due to the power and payload constraints of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities under the computational constraints of embedded hardware. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) satisfy these power and payload constraints, so visualinertial odometry (VIO) algorithms are popular choices for state estimation in these scenarios, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is not clear from existing results in the literature, however, which VIO algorithms perform well under the accuracy, latency, and computational constraints of a flying robot with onboard state estimation. This paper evaluates an array of publicly-available VIO pipelines (MSCKF, OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-Mono, SVO+MSF, and SVO+GTSAM) on different hardware configurations, including several singleboard computer systems that are typically found on flying robots. The evaluation considers the pose estimation accuracy, per-frame processing time, and CPU and memory load while processing the EuRoC datasets, which contain six degree of freedom (6DoF) trajectories typical of flying robots.

Measurements of a 3D laser scanner are aggregated in local multiresolution maps by means of surfel-based registration. The local maps are used in a multi-level graph for allocentric mapping and localization. In order to incorporate corrections when refining the alignment, the individual 3D scans in the local map are modeled as a sub-graph and graph optimization is performed to account for drift and misalignments in the local maps. Furthermore, in each sub-graph, a continuous-time representation of the sensor trajectory allows to correct measurements between scan poses.

We propose two algorithms to place a number of charging stations so that a robot is always capable of reaching one of the charging stations from any obstacle-free location in the workspace without aborting its task too early. We reduce the charging-station placement problem to a series of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) problems and use the off-the-shelf SMT solver Z3 to implement our algorithm. The algorithm produces as output the locations of the charging stations in the workspace and the trajectories from any obstacle-free locations to one of the charging stations. Our experimental results show how our algorithm can efficiently find the locations of the charging stations and robot trajectories to reach the charging stations. We demonstrate through simulation how the generated trajectories can be effectively used by a robot to reach a charging stations autonomously without getting depleted with power.},

This paper proposes an incremental approach addressing this problem efficiently. The presented method first accumulates the measurements in a dynamic voxel grid and selectively updates the point normals affected by the insertion. An incremental segmentation algorithm, based on region growing, tracks the evolution of single segments which enables an efficient recognition strategy using partitioning and caching of geometric consistencies. We show that the incremental method can perform global localization at 10Hz in a urban driving environment, a speedup of x7.1 over the compared batch solution. The efficiency of the method makes it suitable for applications where realtime localization is required and enables its usage on cheaper, lowenergy systems. Our implementation is available open source along with instructions for running the system.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns surveillance planning for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is requested to periodically take snapshots of areas of interest by visiting a given set of waypoint locations in the shortest time possible. The studied problem can be considered as a variant of the combinatorial traveling salesman problem in which trajectories between the waypoints respect the kinematic constraints of the UAV. Contrary to the existing formulation for curvature-constrained vehicles known as the Dubins traveling salesman problem, the herein addressed problem is motivated by planning for multirotor UAVs which are not limited by the minimal required forward velocity and minimal turning radius as the Dubins vehicle, but rather by the maximal speed and acceleration. Moreover, the waypoints to be visited can be at different altitudes, and the addressed problem is to find a fast and smooth trajectory in 3D space from which all the areas of interest can be captured. The proposed solution is based on unsupervised learning in which the requested 3D smooth trajectory is determined as a sequence of Bezier curves in a finite number of learning epochs. The reported results support feasibility of the proposed solution which has also been experimentally verified with a real UAV.},

  abstract  = {We would like robots to be able to safely navigate at high speed, efficiently use local 3D information, and robustly plan motions that consider pose uncertainty of measurements in a local map structure. This is hard to do with previously existing mapping approaches, like occupancy grids, that are focused on incrementally fusing 3D data into a common world frame. In particular, both their fragile sensitivity to state estimation errors and computational cost can be limiting. We develop an alternative framework, NanoMap, which alleviates the need for global map fusion and enables a motion planner to efficiently query pose-uncertainty-aware local 3D geometric information. The key idea of NanoMap is to store a history of noisy relative pose transforms and search over a corresponding set of depth sensor measurements for the minimum-uncertainty view of a queried point in space. This approach affords a variety of capabilities not offered by traditional mapping techniques: (a) the pose uncertainty associated with 3D data can be incorporated in motion planning, (b) poses can be updated (i.e., from loop closures) with minimal computational effort, and (c) 3D data can be fused lazily for the purpose of planning. We provide an open-source implementation of NanoMap, and analyze its capabilities and computational efficiency in simulation experiments. Finally, we demonstrate in hardware its effectiveness for fast 3D obstacle avoidance onboard a quadrotor flying up to 10 m/s.},

  abstract  = {When a human drives a car along a road for the first time, they later recognize where they are on the return journey typically without needing to look in their rear view mirror or turn around to look back, despite significant viewpoint and appearance change. Such navigation capabilities are typically attributed to our semantic visual understanding of the environment [1] beyond geometry to recognizing the types of places we are passing through such as passing a shop on the left or moving through a forested area. Humans are in effect using place categorization [2] to perform specific place recognition even when the viewpoint is 180 degrees reversed. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled high performance semantic understanding of visual places and scenes, opening up the possibility of emulating what humans do. In this work, we develop a novel methodology for using the semantics-aware higher-order layers of deep neural networks for recognizing specific places from within a reference database. To further improve the robustness to appearance change, we develop a descriptor normalization scheme that builds on the success of normalization schemes for pure appearance-based techniques such as SeqSLAM [3]. Using two different datasets one road-based, one pedestrian-based, we evaluate the performance of the system in performing place recognition on reverse traversals of a route with a limited field of view camera and no turn-back-and-look behaviours, and compare to existing stateof-the-art techniques and vanilla off-the-shelf features. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the existing state of the art, especially for extreme perceptual challenges that involve both great viewpoint change and environmental appearance change. We also provide experimental analyses of the contributions of the various system components: the use of spatio-temporal sequences, place categorization and placecentric characteristics as opposed to object-centric semantics.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework to recover the extrinsic calibration parameters of a lidarIMU sensing system. Unlike global-shutter cameras, lidars do not take single snapshots of the environment. Instead, lidars collect a succession of 3D-points generally grouped in scans. If these points are assumed to be expressed in a common frame, this becomes an issue when the sensor moves rapidly in the environment causing motion distortion. The fundamental idea of our proposed framework is to use preintegration over interpolated inertial measurements to characterise the motion distortion in each lidar scan. Moreover, by using a set of planes as a calibration target, the proposed method makes use of lidar point-to-plane distances to jointly calibrate and localise the system using on-manifold optimisation. The calibration does not rely on a predefined target as arbitrary planes are detected and modelled in the first lidar scan. Simulated and real data are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

The main difficulties in these situations come from both the limitations of the sensors and the inability to perform a successful tracking of interest points because of the bold assumptions in VO, such as brightness constancy. We address this problem from a deep learning perspective, for which we first fine-tune a deep neural network with the purpose of obtaining enhanced representations of the sequences for VO. Then, we demonstrate how the insertion of long short term memory allows us to obtain temporally consistent sequences, as the estimation depends on previous states. However, the use of very deep networks enlarges the computational burden of the VO framework; therefore, we also propose a convolutional neural network of reduced size capable of performing faster. Finally, we validate the enhanced representations by evaluating the sequences produced by the two architectures in several state-of-art VO algorithms, such as ORB-SLAM and DSO.},

Rather than focusing on a limited set of objects or training a model at test-time to track a specific instance, we pretrain our generic tracker on a large variety of objects and efficiently update on the fly; Re3 simultaneously tracks and updates the appearance model with a single forward pass. This lightweight model is capable of tracking objects at 150 FPS, while attaining competitive results on challenging benchmarks.

We propose a gradient-informed post-smoothing algorithm, called GRIPS, that deforms given trajectories by locally optimizing the placement of vertices while satisfying the systems kinodynamic constraints. We show experimentally that GRIPS typically produces trajectories of significantly smaller length and higher smoothness than several existing post-smoothing algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Long-term situation prediction plays a crucial role for intelligent vehicles. A major challenge still to overcome is the prediction of complex downtown scenarios with multiple road users, e.g., pedestrians, bikes, and motor vehicles, interacting with each other. This contribution tackles this challenge by combining a Bayesian filtering technique for environment representation, and machine learning as long-term predictor. More specifically, a dynamic occupancy grid map is utilized as input to a deep convolutional neural network. This yields the advantage of using spatially distributed velocity estimates from a single time step for prediction, rather than a raw data sequence, alleviating common problems dealing with input time series of multiple sensors. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks have the inherent characteristic of using context information, enabling the implicit modeling of road user interaction. Pixelwise balancing is applied in the loss function counteracting the extreme imbalance between static and dynamic cells. One of the major advantages is the unsupervised learning character due to fully automatic label generation. The presented algorithm is trained and evaluated on multiple hours of recorded sensor data and compared to Monte-Carlo simulation. Experiments show the ability to model complex interactions.},

The preintegrated IMU measurements are loosely-coupled with the dense visual odometry (VO) estimation and tightly-coupled with the planar measurements in a full SLAM framework. The poses, velocities, and IMU biases are optimized together with the planar landmarks in a global factor graph using incremental smoothing and mapping with the Bayes Tree (iSAM2). With odometry estimation using both RGB-D and IMU data, our system can keep track of the poses of the sensors even without sufficient planes or visual information (e.g. textureless walls) temporarily. Modeling planes and IMU states in the fully probabilistic global optimization reduces the drift that distorts the reconstruction results of other SLAM algorithms. Moreover, structural constraints between nearby planes (e.g. right angles) are added into the DPI-SLAM system, which further recovers the drift and distortion. We test our DPI-SLAM on large indoor datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance as the first planar-inertial SLAM system.},

With the ability to estimate relative distance, a heuristic policy is proposed to navigate a robot to the retrieved closest place. Note that the network is designed to take advantage of the omnidirectional view by incorporating circular padding and rotation invariance. To train a powerful OCNN, we build a virtual world for training on a large scale. We also propose a continuous lifted structured feature embedding loss to learn the concept of distance efficiently.

By using this entropy weighted image gradient, we introduce an optimal exposure value for vision-based approaches. Using this newly invented metric, we also propose an effective exposure control scheme that covers a wide range of light conditions. When evaluating the function (e.g., image frame grab) is expensive, the next best estimation needs to be carefully considered.

However, multiple orthogonal planes are required to be visible throughout the entire motion estimation process; otherwise, these VO approaches fail. We propose a new approach to estimate drift-free rotational motion jointly from both lines and planes by exploiting environmental regularities. We track the spatial regularities with an efficient SO(3)-manifold constrained mean shift algorithm. Once the drift-free rotation is found, we recover the translational motion from all tracked points with and without depth by minimizing the de-rotated reprojection error. We compare the proposed algorithm to other stateof-the-art visual odometry methods on a variety of RGB-D datasets (including especially challenging pure rotations) and demonstrate improved accuracy and lower drift error.}

  abstract  = {In this study, we propose a novel Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based localization method for localization of a mobile robot. In localization using the LiDAR sensor, localization errors occur when real range measurements differ from reference distances computed from a map. This study focuses on three factors that cause differences between real range measurements and reference distances. The first factor corresponds to optical characteristics of the LiDAR sensor for objects such as glass walls and mirrors. The second factor corresponds to occlusions by dynamic obstacles. The third factor corresponds to static changes in the environment. In practical applications, three factors often simultaneously occur. Although there have been many previous works, robust localization to overcome these three difficulties is still a challenging problem. This study proposes a novel robust localization scheme that exploits only reliable range measurements. A LiDAR sensor-based localization scheme can be successfully executed by utilizing only a few reliable range measurements. Therefore, the computation of reliability plays a significant role. The computation of reliability is divided into two steps. The first step considers characteristics of optical sensors. The second step mainly deals with the effects of obstacles. The observation likelihood model exploits computed reliability for pose estimation. The proposed scheme was successfully verified through various experiments under challenging situations.}

Using a pair of coupled Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we show that it is possible to generate the appearance of one domain (such as summer) from another (such as winter) without requiring image-to-image correspondences across the domains. Mapping between domains is learned from sets of images in each domain without knowing the instanceto-instance correspondence by enforcing a cyclic consistency constraint. In the process, meaningful feature spaces are learned for each domain, the distances in which can be used for the task of place recognition. Experiments show that learned features correspond to visual similarity and can be effectively used for place recognition across seasons.}

The dataset embeds the challenges faced by a robot in a real-life application and provides a useful tool for validating object recognition algorithms. Besides describing the characteristics of the dataset, the paper evaluates the performance of a collection of wellestablished deep convolutional networks on the new dataset and analyzes the transferability of deep representations from Web images to robotic data.

For binary, lidar-based grid maps, this is essentially the case when the laser beam traverses a voxel which has been observed as occupied, or when the beam is reflected by a voxel which has been observed as empty. However, in real-world environments, some voxels are neither completely occupied nor completely free. These voxels have to be modeled by real-valued variables, whose estimation is an inherently statistical process. Thus, it is nontrivial to decide whether two sets of observations emerge from the same underlying true map values, and hence from an unchanged environment. Our main idea is to account for the statistical nature of the estimation by leveraging the full map posteriors instead of only the most likely maps. Closed form solutions of posteriors over realvalued grid maps have been introduced recently. We leverage a similarity measure on these posteriors to score each point in time according to the probability that it constitutes a change in the hidden map value. While the proposed approach works for any type of real-valued grid map that allows the computation of the full posterior, we provide all formulas for the wellknown reflection maps and the recently introduced decay-rate maps.

One of reasons is only single level features is used for localization of proposal candidates. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a multiple classifier fusion strategy into a Faster R-CNN network for small fruit detection. We utilize features from three different levels to learn three classifiers for objectness classification in the stage of proposal localization. Probabilities from classifiers are combined by a simple convolutional layer to generate final objectness classification for proposal candidates. In order to keep diversity of multiple classifiers, a novel loss term of classifier correlation is introduced into original loss function. Experimental results show that our model is feasible for detecting small fruits.}

Existing robust SLAM methods assume a good initialization or an odometry backbone to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Maximization (PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in realtime. This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.}

Hence a key requirement for employing these methods in practice is to have a large set of labeled data for your specific robotic manipulation task, a requirement that is not generally satisfied by existing datasets. In this paper we develop a pipeline to rapidly generate high quality RGBD data with pixelwise labels and object poses. We use an RGBD camera to collect video of a scene from multiple viewpoints and leverage existing reconstruction techniques to produce a 3D dense reconstruction. We label the 3D reconstruction using a human assisted ICPfitting of object meshes. By reprojecting the results of labeling the 3D scene we can produce labels for each RGBD image of the scene. This pipeline enabled us to collect over 1,000,000 labeled object instances in just a few days. We use this dataset to answer questions related to how much training data is required, and of what quality the data must be, to achieve high performance from a DNN architecture.

              detection of plant diseases using sensors that can be
              mounted on aerial vehicles is in the interest of
              farmers to support decision-making in integrated pest
              management and to breeders for selecting tolerant or
              resistant genotypes. This paper investigated the
              detection of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), caused by
              Cercospora beticola in sugar beet using RGB imagery.
              We proposed an approach to tackle the CLS detection
              problem using fully convolutional neural networks,
              which operate directly on RGB images captured by a
              UAV. This efficient approach does not require complex
              multi- or hyper-spectral sensors, but provides
              reliable results and high sensitivity. We provided a
              detection pipeline for pixel-wise semantic
              segmentation of CLS symptoms, healthy vegetation, and
              background so that our approach can automatically
              quantify the grade of infestation. We thoroughly
              evaluated our system using multiple UAV datasets

              dataset consisted of a training and a test dataset

              evaluate our approach under realistic conditions and
              analyzed its generalization capabilities to unseen

              high-resolution RGB imaging and convolutional neural
              networks for plant disease detection under field
              conditions. The demonstrated procedure is
              particularly interesting for applications under

Robots, such as AgBot II, which can detect and classify weeds as they traverse a field are a key enabling factor for individualised treatment of weed species. Integral to the invidualised treatment of weed species are the the non-herbicide methods through which the weeds are managed. This paper explores mechanical methods as an alternative to weed management. Three implements are considered: belowsurface tilling (arrow hoe), above-surface tilling (tines) and a cutting mechanism. These mechanisms were evaluated in a controlled field with varying rates of application to herbicide resistant weeds of interest for Queensland, Australia. Statistical analysis demonstrated the efficacy of these implements and highlighted the importance of early intervention. It was found that a tine, deployed automatically on AgBot II, was effective for all of the weeds considered in this study, leading to an overall survival probability of 0.28 0.15. Further analysis demonstrated the significance of treatment time with late intervention commencing at week 6 resulting in a survival probability of 0.54 0.08 vs 0.24 0.18 for earlier intervention at week 4.}

In risk-aware formulations of MPDM, only the worst outcomes affect the decision making process, and efficiently finding these influential outcomes becomes the core challenge. Recently, stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, using a heuristic function, were shown to be significantly superior to random sampling. In this paper, we show that accurate gradients can be computed even through a complex forward simulation using approaches similar to those in deep networks. We show that our proposed approach finds influential outcomes more reliably, and is faster than earlier methods, allowing us to evaluate more policies while simultaneously eliminating the need to design an easily-differentiable heuristic function. We demonstrate significant performance improvements in simulation as well as on a real robot platform navigating a highly dynamic environment.}

While most works focus on segmenting robot built maps, those are not the only types of map a robot, or its user, can use. We present a method for segmenting maps from different modalities, focusing on robot built maps and hand-drawn sketch maps, and show better results than state of the art for both types. Our method segments the map by doing a convolution between the distance image of the map and a circular kernel, and grouping pixels of the same value. Segmentation is done by detecting ripple-like patterns where pixel values vary quickly, and merging neighboring regions with similar values. We identify a flaw in the segmentation evaluation metric used in recent works and propose a metric based on Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We compare our results to groundtruth segmentations of maps from a publicly available dataset, on which we obtain a better MCC than the state of the art with 0.98 compared to 0.65 for a recent Voronoi-based segmentation method and 0.70 for the DuDe segmentation method. We also provide a dataset of sketches of an indoor environment, with two possible sets of ground truth segmentations, on which our method obtains an MCC of 0.56 against 0.28 for the Voronoibased segmentation method and 0.30 for DuDe.}

To that end, we present two strategies that we explored. One is a deep metric learning approach that works in three separate steps: semantic-agnostic boundary detection, patch classification and pixel-wise voting. The other is a fully-supervised semantic segmentation approach with efficient dataset collection. We conduct an extensive analysis of the two methods on our ARC 2017 dataset.

We show that this uncertainty can be utilized to increase object detection performance under the open-set conditions that are typically encountered in robotic vision.

Each node of pose graph corresponds to an orientation and a location. The PGO problem finds orientations and locations of the nodes from relative noisy observation between nodes. Recent investigations show that well-known iterative PGO solvers need good initialization to converge to good solutions. However, we observed that state-of-the-art initialization methods obtain good initialization only in low noise problems, and they fail in challenging problems having more measurement noise. Consequently, iterative methods may converge to bad solutions in high noise problems. In this paper, a new method for obtaining orientations in the PGO optimization problem is presented. Like other well-known methods the initial locations are obtained from the result of a least-squares problem. The proposed method iteratively approximates the problem around current estimation and converts it to a least-squares problem. Therefore, the method can be seen as an iterative least-squares method which is computationally efficient. Simulation results show that the proposed initialization method helps the most well-known iterative solver to obtain better optima and significantly outperform other solvers in some cases.

We present a conservative trajectory optimization-based local planner, coupled with a local exploration strategy that selects intermediate goals. We perform extensive simulations to show that this system performs better than the standard approach of using an optimistic global planner, and also outperforms doing a single exploration step when the local planner is stuck. The method is validated through experiments in a variety of highly cluttered environments including a dense forest. These experiments show the complete system running in real time fully onboard an MAV, mapping and replanning at 4 Hz.}

  keywords  = {Learning and Adaptive Systems},
  abstract  = {In the automation of many kinds of processes, the observable outcome can often be described as the combined effect of an entire sequence of actions, or controls, applied throughout the process execution. In these cases, strategies to optimise control policies for individual stages of the process are not applicable, and instead the whole policy needs to be optimised at once. On the other hand, the cost to evaluate the policys performance might also be high, being desirable that a solution can be found with as few interactions as possible with the real system. We consider the problem of optimising control policies to allow a robot to complete a given race track within a minimum amount of time. We assume that the robot has no prior information about the track or its own dynamical model, just an initial valid driving example. Localisation is only applied to monitor the robot and to provide an indication of its position along the tracks centre axis. With that in mind, we propose a method for finding a policy that minimises the time per lap while keeping the vehicle on the track using a Bayesian optimisation (BO) approach over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We apply an algorithm to search more efficiently over high-dimensional policy-parameter spaces with BO, by iterating over each dimension individually, in a sequential coordinate descent-like scheme. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the algorithm against other methods in a simulated car racing environment.}

  abstract  = {State-of-the-art autonomous driving systems rely heavily on detailed and highly accurate prior maps. However, outside of small urban areas, it is very challenging to build, store, and transmit detailed maps since the spatial scales are so large. Furthermore, maintaining detailed maps of large rural areas can be impracticable due to the rapid rate at which these environments can change. This is a significant limitation for the widespread applicability of autonomous driving technology, which has the potential for an incredibly positive societal impact. In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous navigation in rural environments through a novel mapless driving framework that combines sparse topological maps for global navigation with a sensor-based perception system for local navigation. First, a local navigation goal within the sensor view of the vehicle is chosen as a waypoint leading towards the global goal. Next, the local perception system generates a feasible trajectory in the vehicle frame to reach the waypoint while abiding by the rules of the road for the segment being traversed. These trajectories are updated to remain in the local frame using the vehicles odometry and the associated uncertainty based on the least-squares residual and a recursive filtering approach, which allows the vehicle to navigate road networks reliably, and at high speed, without detailed prior maps. We demonstrate the performance of the system on a full-scale autonomous vehicle navigating in a challenging rural environment and benchmark the system on a large amount of collected data.}

In this paper, we address the problem of class-agnostic multi-object tracking using generic object proposals. We present an efficient segmentation mask-based tracker which associates pixel-precise masks reported by the segmentation. Our approach can utilize semantic information whenever it is available for classifying objects at the track level, while retaining the capability to track generic unknown objects in the absence of such information. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art trackingby-detection methods for popular object categories such as cars and pedestrians. Additionally, we show that the proposed method can discover and robustly track a large variety of other objects.}

However, regardless of these advantages, its offline property caused by the requirement of global batch optimization is critically hindering its relevance for real-time and life-long applications. In this paper, we present a dense map-centric SLAM method based on a continuous-time trajectory to cope with this problem. The proposed system locally functions in a similar fashion to conventional Continuous-Time SLAM (CT-SLAM). However, it removes the need for global trajectory optimization by introducing map deformation. The computational complexity of the proposed approach for loop closure does not depend on the operation time, but only on the size of the space it explored before the loop closure. It is therefore more suitable for long term operation compared to the conventional CTSLAM. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces uncertainty in the reconstructed dense map by using probabilistic surface element (surfel) fusion.

In this network, the complementary characteristics of sparse 3D LiDAR and dense stereo depth are simultaneously encoded in a boosting manner. Tailored to the LiDAR and stereo fusion problem, the proposed network differs from previous CNNs in the incorporation of a compact convolution module, which can be deployed with the constraints of mobile devices. As training data for the LiDAR and stereo fusion is rather limited, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for reproducing the raw KITTI dataset. The raw LiDAR scans are augmented by adapting an off-the-shelf stereo algorithm and a confidence measure. We evaluate the proposed network on the KITTI benchmark and data collected by our multi-sensor acquisition system. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed network generalizes across datasets and is significantly more accurate than various baseline approaches.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents SceneCut, a novel approach to jointly discover previously unseen objects and non-object surfaces using a single RGB-D image. SceneCuts joint reasoning over scene semantics and geometry allows a robot to detect and segment object instances in complex scenes where modern deep learning-based methods either fail to separate object instances, or fail to detect objects that were not seen during training. SceneCut automatically decomposes a scene into meaningful regions which either represent objects or scene surfaces. The decomposition is qualified by an unified energy function over objectness and geometric fitting. We show how this energy function can be optimized efficiently by utilizing hierarchical segmentation trees. Moreover, we leverage a pretrained convolutional oriented boundary network to predict accurate boundaries from images, which are used to construct high-quality region hierarchies. We evaluate SceneCut on several different indoor environments, and the results show that SceneCut significantly outperforms all the existing methods.}

  abstract = {In Robotics, especially in this era of autonomous driving, mapping is one key ability of a robot to be able to navigate through an environment, localize on it and analyze its traversability. To allow for real-time execution on constrained hardware, the map usually estimated by feature-based or semidense SLAM algorithms is a sparse point cloud; a richer and more complete representation of the environment is desirable. Existing dense mapping algorithms require extensive use of GPU computing and they hardly scale to large environments; incremental algorithms from sparse points still represent an effective solution when light computational effort is needed and big sequences have to be processed in real-time. In this paper we improved and extended the state of the art incremental manifold mesh algorithm proposed in [1] and extended in [2]. While these algorithms do not achieve real-time and they embed points from SLAM or Structure from Motion only when their position is fixed, in this paper we propose the first incremental algorithm able to reconstruct a manifold mesh in real-time through single core CPU processing which is also able to modify the mesh according to 3D points updates from the underlying SLAM algorithm. We tested our algorithm against two state of the art incremental mesh mapping systems on the KITTI dataset, and we showed that, while accuracy is comparable, our approach is able to reach real-time performances thanks to an order of magnitude speed-up.}

A network is trained to output synthetic images optimised for feature matching given only an input RGB image, and these generated images are used to localize the robot against a previously built map using traditional sparse matching approaches. We benchmark our results using multiple traversals of the Oxford RobotCar Dataset over a year-long period, using one traversal as a map and the other to localise. We show that this method significantly improves place recognition and localisation under changing and adverse conditions, while reducing the number of mapping runs needed to successfully achieve reliable localisation.}

The method, named MapAware Particle Filter, uses a nonlinear approach to mapmatching that can be integrated into a particle filter framework for localization. Each particle is re-weighted based on the validity of its current position in the map. In addition, we buffer the trajectory followed by the vehicle and then append it to each particles pose. We then quantify the overlap between the trajectory and the maps free space. This serves as a measure of each particles validity given the trajectory and the shape of the map. We evaluated the method by performing experiments with different types of localization sensors: First, (i) we significantly reduced the drift inherent to dead reckoning. By only using wheel odometry and map information we achieved loop closure over a distance of approximately 3 km. We also (ii) increased the accuracy of GPS localization. Finally, (iii) we fused a fragile 2D LiDAR localization with the map information. The resulting system had a higher robustness and managed to close the loop in an outdated map where it had failed before.}

We present experimental results obtained by training our neural network using the KITTI dataset and evaluating it in a mapping process using our own dataset. In extensive experiments, we show that maps generated using the proposed probability about dynamic objects increases the accuracy of the resulting maps.}

We use the recently developed encoder-decoder cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), SegNet, that infers dense semantic classes while allowing any number of input image channels and class balancing with our sugar beet and weed datasets. To obtain training datasets, we established an experimental field with varying herbicide levels resulting in field plots containing only either crop or weed, enabling us to use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a distinguishable feature for automatic ground truth generation. We train 6 models with different numbers of input channels and condition (fine-tune) it to achieve 0.8 F1-score and 0.78 Area Under the Curve (AUC) classification metrics. For model deployment, an embedded GPU system (Jetson TX2) is tested for MAV integration. Dataset used in this paper is released to support the community and future work.}

Although intuitive, this representation entails disadvantages: The resulting grid maps exhibit aliasing effects and are not differentiable. In the present paper, we address these drawbacks by introducing a novel mapping technique that does neither rely on tessellation nor on the assumption of piecewise uniformity of the space, without increasing memory requirements. Instead of representing the map in the position domain, we store the map parameters in the discrete frequency domain and leverage the continuous extension of the inverse discrete cosine transform to convert them to a continuously differentiable scalar field in the position domain, which we call DCT map. A DCT map assigns to each point in space a lidar decay rate, which models the local permeability of the space for laser rays. In this way, the map can describe objects of different laser permeabilities, from completely opaque to completely transparent. DCT maps represent lidar measurements significantly more accurate than grid maps, Gaussian process occupancy maps, and Hilbert maps, all with the same memory requirements, as demonstrated in our real-world experiments.},

Being able to localize against a prior map and obtain accurate and driftfree pose estimates can push the applicability of such systems even further. Most of the currently available solutions, however, either focus on a single session use case, lack localization capabilities, or dont provide an end-to-end pipeline. We believe that only a complete system, combining state-of-the-art algorithms, scalable multi-session mapping tools, and a flexible user interface, can become an efficient research platform. We, therefore, present maplab, an open, research-oriented visual-inertial mapping framework for processing and manipulating multi-session maps, written in C++.

On the other hand, maplab provides the research community with a collection of multisession mapping tools that include map merging, visual-inertial batch optimization, and loop closure. Furthermore, it includes an online frontend that can create visual-inertial maps and also track a global drift-free pose within a localization map. In this paper, we present the system architecture, five use cases, and evaluations of the system on public datasets.

In this paper, we propose a method for robust dense RGB-D SLAM in dynamic environments which detects moving objects and simultaneously reconstructs the background structure. While most methods employ implicit robust penalisers or outlier filtering techniques in order to handle moving objects, our approach is to simultaneously estimate the camera motion as well as a probabilistic static/dynamic segmentation of the current RGBD image pair. This segmentation is then used for weighted dense RGB-D fusion to estimate a 3D model of only the static parts of the environment. By leveraging the 3D model for frameto-model alignment, as well as static/dynamic segmentation, camera motion estimation has reduced overall drift as well as being more robust to the presence of dynamics in the scene. Demonstrations are presented which compare the proposed method to related state-of-the-art approaches using both static and dynamic sequences. The proposed method achieves similar performance in static environments and improved accuracy and robustness in dynamic scenes.}

Using images from a monocular camera alone, we devise pairwise costs for object tracks, based on several 3D cues such as object pose, shape, and motion. The proposed costs are agnostic to the data association method and can be incorporated into any optimization framework to output the pairwise data associations. These costs are easy to implement, can be computed in real-time, and complement each other to account for possible errors in a tracking-by-detection framework. We perform an extensive analysis of the designed costs and empirically demonstrate consistent improvement over the state-of-the-art under varying conditions that employ a range of object detectors, exhibit a variety in camera and object motions, and, more importantly, are not reliant on the choice of the association framework. We also show that, by using the simplest of associations frameworks (two-frame Hungarian assignment), we surpass the state-of-the-art in multi-objecttracking on road scenes.

Almost all existing methods are designed to work with traditional cameras with a limited field of view. Recent advances in omnidirectional sensors offer a robot an opportunity to perceive the entire surrounding environment. However, no work has existed thus far to research how omnidirectional sensors can help long-term place recognition, especially when multiple types of omnidirectional sensory data are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to integrate observations obtained from multiple sensors from different viewing angles in the omnidirectional observation in order to perform multi-directional place recognition in longterm autonomy. Our approach also answers two new questions when omnidirectional multisensory data is available for place recognition, including whether it is possible to recognize a place with long-term appearance variations when robots approach it from various directions, and whether observations from various viewing angles are the same informative. To evaluate our approach and hypothesis, we have collected the first largescale dataset that consists of omnidirectional multisensory (intensity and depth) data collected in urban and suburban environments across a year. Experimental results have shown that our approach is able to achieve multi-directional long-term place recognition, and identifies the most discriminative viewing angles from the omnidirectional observation.}

We show that semantically labeled 3D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.). Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time.}

  abstract  = {We present VI-DSO, a novel approach for visualinertial odometry, which jointly estimates camera poses and sparse scene geometry by minimizing photometric and IMU measurement errors in a combined energy functional. The visual part of the system performs a bundle-adjustment like optimization on a sparse set of points, but unlike key-point based systems it directly minimizes a photometric error. This makes it possible for the system to track not only corners, but any pixels with large enough intensity gradients. IMU information is accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes. We explicitly include scale and gravity direction into our model and jointly optimize them together with other variables such as poses. As the scale is often not immediately observable using IMU data this allows us to initialize our visual-inertial system with an arbitrary scale instead of having to delay the initialization until everything is observable. We perform partial marginalization of old variables so that updates can be computed in a reasonable time. In order to keep the system consistent we propose a novel strategy which we call dynamic marginalization. This technique allows us to use partial marginalization even in cases where the initial scale estimate is far from the optimum. We evaluate our method on the challenging EuRoC dataset, showing that VI-DSO outperforms the state of the art.}

Specifically, we employ the GP upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) as the optimization criteria to adaptively plan sampling paths that balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off. Path planning at the initial stage focuses on exploring and learning a model of the environment, and later, on exploiting the learned model to focus sampling around regions that exhibit extreme sensory measurements and much higher spatial variability, denoted as the Region of Interest (ROI). The integration of the CE trajectory optimization allows the sampling density to be dynamically adjusted based on the latest sensory measurements, thus providing an efficient sampling strategy for sensing and localizing the ROI. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in exploring simulated scalar fields with single or multiple ROIs.

Historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is of significant value to this problem. The method joins AIS locations of a same vessel at different time and locations in a region into a route. Next, it automatically computes navigation plans using nearest neighbour based path retrieval relying on two representations, Ship Feature and Navigation Feature. Before starting service, existing AIS records in the form of ship properties and corresponding route are preprocessed and stored in the form of Ship and Navigation Feature. During online retrieval, given input constraints in vector form, nearest neighbour of this query vector in the same space is found and corresponding path of the neighbour is returned as recommended path. Analysis was done in four and two dimensional spaces for Ship and Navigation Feature respectively. Application of the method is demonstrated in two regions of Australian, covering Bass Strait and Great Australian Bight.}

A convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a recurrent neural network (RNN) are trained together to detect the location of keypoints as well as to generate corresponding descriptors in one unified structure. The network is optimized by warping points from source frame to reference frame, with a rigid body transform. Essentially, learning from warping. The overall training is focused on movements of the camera rather than movements within the image, which leads to better consistency in the matching and ultimately better motion estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results than both related deep learning and hand crafted methods. Furthermore, as a demonstration of the promise of our method we use a naive SLAM implementation based on these keypoints and get a performance on par with ORB-SLAM.}

This paper proposes a machine learning technique to identify errors in three dimensional (3D) meshes. Beyond simply identifying errors, our method quantifies both the magnitude and the direction of depth estimate errors when viewing the scene. This enables us to improve the reconstruction accuracy. We train a suitably deep network architecture with two 3D meshes: a high-quality laser reconstruction, and a lower quality stereo image reconstruction. The network predicts the amount of error in the lower quality reconstruction with respect to the high-quality one, having only view the former through its input. We evaluate our approach by correcting two dimensional (2D) inverse-depth images extracted from the 3D model, and show that our method improves the quality of these depth reconstructions by up to a relative 10\% RMSE.}

In this paper we first demonstrate that this type of orienteering problem remains NP-hard even for the restricted class of graphs associated with precision irrigation. Then, we devise and analyze two greedy heuristics informed by the problem we consider. Finally, these algorithms are evaluated on settings associated with a commercial vineyard and we show that our methods favorably compare to solutions proposed in the past.}

In this work, we propose VLocNet, a new convolutional neural network architecture for 6-DoF global pose regression and odometry estimation from consecutive monocular images. Our multitask model incorporates hard parameter sharing, thus being compact and enabling real-time inference, in addition to being end-to-end trainable. We propose a novel loss function that utilizes auxiliary learning to leverage relative pose information during training, thereby constraining the search space to obtain consistent pose estimates. We evaluate our proposed VLocNet on indoor as well as outdoor datasets and show that even our single task model exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art deep architectures for global localization, while achieving competitive performance for visual odometry estimation. Furthermore, we present extensive experimental evaluations utilizing our proposed Geometric Consistency Loss that show the effectiveness of multitask learning and demonstrate that our model is the first deep learning technique to be on par with, and in some cases outperforms state-of-theart SIFT-based approaches.}

Yet, most of these systems rely on the semantically rich information of RGB images. Deep Learning solutions applied to the data of other sensors typically mounted on autonomous cars (e.g. lidars or radars) are not explored much. In this paper we propose a novel solution to understand the dynamics of moving vehicles of the scene from only lidar information. The main challenge of this problem stems from the fact that we need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the observer vehicle from that of the external observed vehicles. For this purpose, we devise a CNN architecture which at testing time is fed with pairs of consecutive lidar scans. However, in order to properly learn the parameters of this network, during training we introduce a series of so-called pretext tasks which also leverage on image data. These tasks include semantic information about vehicleness and a novel lidar-flow feature which combines standard image-based optical flow with lidar scans. We obtain very promising results and show that including distilled image information only during training, allows improving the inference results of the network at test time, even when image data is no longer used.}

In a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate dense SLAM accuracy and runtime performance on-par with flat hashing approaches when using TSDF-based maps, and considerable speed-ups when using occupancy mapping compared to standard occupancy maps frameworks. Our SLAM system can run at 10-40 Hz on a modern quadcore CPU, without the need for massive parallelisation on a GPU. We furthermore demonstrate a probabilistic occupancy mapping as an alternative to TSDF mapping in dense SLAM and show its direct applicability to online motion planning, using the example of Informed RRT*.}

These cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have a very high dynamic range, which enables them to provide reliable visual information during high speed motions or in scenes characterized by high dynamic range. However, event cameras output only little information when the amount of motion is limited, such as in the case of almost still motion. Conversely, standard cameras provide instant and rich information about the environment most of the time (in low-speed and good lighting scenarios), but they fail severely in case of fast motions, or difficult lighting such as high dynamic range or low light scenes. In this paper, we present the first state estimation pipeline that leverages the complementary advantages of these two sensors by fusing in a tightly-coupled manner events, standard frames, and inertial measurements. We show on the publicly available Event Camera Dataset that our hybrid pipeline leads to an accuracy improvement of 130\% over event-only pipelines, and 85\% over standard-framesonly visual-inertial systems, while still being computationally tractable. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to demonstrate to the best of our knowledgethe first autonomous quadrotor flight using an event camera for state estimation, unlocking flight scenarios that were not reachable with traditional visualinertial odometry, such as low-light environments and highdynamic range scenes.}

In this paper, we propose a new incremental algorithm that computes solutions with lower absolute error and generally provides lower error solutions for a fixed computational budget than either iSAM or iSAM2.

We use mutual information (MI) to evaluate the information the robot would get at a certain location. In order to get the most informative sensing location, we first propose a sampling method that can get random sensing patches in free space. Each sensing patch is extended to informative locations to collect information with true values. Then we use Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) to model the distribution of MI in environment. Compared with the traditional methods that employ Gaussian Process (GP) model, GMRF is more efficient. MI of every sensing location can be estimated using the training sample patches and the established GMRF model. We utilize an efficient computation algorithm to estimate the GMRF model hyperparameters so as to speed up the computation. Besides the information gain of the candidates regions, the path cost is also considered in this work. We propose a utility function that can balance the path cost and the information gain the robot would collect. We tested our algorithm in both simulated and real experiment. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can explore the environment efficiently with relatively shorter path length.}

  abstract  = {Scale recovery is one of the essential problems for monocular visual odometry. The camera height is usually used as an absolute reference to recover the scale. In this case, the precision of scale recovery depends on the accuracy of the road region detection and road geometrical model calculation. In previous works, road detection and road geometrical model calculation are solved sequentially: the road geometrical model calculation is based on the road detection and the road region detection is based on the color information. However, the color information of a road is not stable enough. In the proposed method, the estimated road geometrical model is taken into consideration to detect the road region as a feedback. Therefore, the road region detection and road geometrical model estimation can benefit each other. Delaunay Triangulation method is used to segment an input image to many triangles with the matched feature points as vertices. Every triangle region is classified as a road region or not by comparing their geometrical model with that of the road and the road geometrical model is updated online. We evaluate our visual odometry scale recovery method on the KITTI dataset and the results show that our method is achieving the best performance among all existing monocular visual odometry scale recovery methods without additional sensors.}

In particular, our goal is to inpaint a sparse map obtained from either a monocular visual SLAM system or a sparse sensor using a single-view depth prediction network as a virtual depth sensor. We adopt a fairly standard approach to data fusion, to produce a fused depth map by performing inference over a novel fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) which is parameterized by the input depth maps and their pixel-wise confidence weights. Crucially, we obtain the confidence weights that parameterize the CRF model in a data-dependent manner via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are trained to model the conditional depth error distributions given each source of input depth map and the associated RGB image. Our CRF model penalises absolute depth error in its nodes and pairwise scale-invariant depth error in its edges, and the confidence-based fusion minimizes the impact of outlier input depth values on the fused result. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by real-time inpainting of ORB-SLAM, Kinect, and LIDAR depth maps acquired both indoors and outdoors at arbitrary scale and varied amount of irregular sparsity.}

We focus on a geometric version where the environment is represented as a polygonal grid with a single charging station. Energy consumption throughout the environment is assumed to be uniform and proportional to the distance traveled. We first present a constant-factor approximation algorithm for contour-connected environments. We then extend the algorithm for general environments.

To solve these challenges, we introduce iMag, an accurate and rapidly deployable inertial magnetoinductive (MI) localisation system. It localises monitored workers using a single MI transmitter and inertial measurement units with minimal setup effort. However, MI location estimates can be distorted and ambiguous. To solve this problem, we suggest a novel method to use MI devices for sensing environmental distortions, and use these to correctly close inertial loops. By applying robust simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM), our proposed localisation method achieves excellent tracking accuracy, and can improve performance significantly compared with only using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and MI device for localisation.

In particular, many robotics applications exhibit these conditions and thus facilitate the potential to incrementally adapt a learnt model over minor shifts which integrate to massive differences over time. Our work presents an adversarial approach for lifelong, incremental domain adaptation which benefits from unsupervised alignment to a series of intermediate domains which successively diverge from the labelled source domain. We empirically demonstrate that our incremental approach improves handling of large appearance changes, e.g. day to night, on a traversable-path segmentation task compared with a direct, single alignment step approach. Furthermore, by approximating the feature distribution for the source domain with a generative adversarial network, the deployment module can be rendered fully independent of retaining potentially large amounts of the related source training data for only a minor reduction in performance.}

To combat short-term illumination changes as well as long-term seasonal variations, we propose using a place-and-time-dependent binary descriptor that adapts to different scenarios in an online fashion. This is achieved by extending the GRIEF [6] evolution algorithm in two ways: correspondence generation using a known pose change and the inclusion of LATCH triplets in addition to BRIEF comparisons for descriptor generation. We show the adaptive descriptor outperforms a single descriptor scheme for localization within a single-experience Visual Teach and Repeat (VT\&R) system while maintaining the efficiency of binary descriptors. By adapting the description function to different environmental conditions, it allows the system to operate for a longer period before a new experience is required. In the presence of extreme illumination changes from day to night, we obtain 40\% more inlier matches compared to SURF. In the case of seasonal variations, a 70\% increase is demonstrated. The increased correspondences result in more localizable sections along the paths, amounting to a 25\% and 150\% increase in the lighting and seasonal cases, respectively.}

Using the information from the monocular state estimation and mapping system, we generate a library of candidate trajectories and evaluate them in terms of perception quality, collision probability, and distance to the goal. The best trajectory to execute is then selected as the one that maximizes a reward function based on these three metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates active vision within a receding horizon navigation framework for a goal reaching task. We demonstrate by simulation and real-world experiments on an actual quadrotor that our active approach leads to improved state estimation accuracy in a goal-reaching task when compared to a purely-reactive navigation system, especially in difficult scenes (e.g., weak texture).}

This paper presents an automatic algorithm to obtain the drivable path of a vehicle operating in urban roads with or without clear lane markings. The developed system projects trajectories obtained during human operation of the vehicle and utilizes these to generate automatic labels for training a semantic based path prediction model. The system segments an urban scenario into 13 categories including vehicles, pedestrian, undrivable road, other categories relevant to urban roads, and a new class for a path proposal. The drivable path information is essential particularly in unstructured scenarios, and is critical for an intelligent vehicle system to make sound driving decisions. The path proposal category is a car-width drivable lane estimated to be safe to drive for the vehicle under consideration. The data collection, model training and inference process requires only images from a monocular camera and odometry from a low-cost IMU combined with a wheel encoder. The algorithm has been successfully demonstrated on the Sydney University campus, which is a challenging environment without clear road markings. The algorithm was demonstrated to run in real-time, proving its applicability for intelligent vehicles.}

To that end, this paper proposes the Cognitive Turn-taking Model (CTTM), which leverages cognitive models (i.e., Spiking Neural Network) to achieve early turn-taking prediction. The CTTM framework can process multimodal human communication cues (both implicit and explicit) and predict human turntaking intentions in an early stage. The proposed framework is tested on a simulated surgical procedure, where a robotic scrub nurse predicts the surgeons turn-taking intention. It was found that the proposed CTTM framework outperforms the state-of-the-art turn-taking prediction algorithms by a large margin. It also outperforms humans when presented with partial observations of communication cues (i.e., less than 40\% of full actions). This early prediction capability enables robots to initiate turn-taking actions at an early stage, which facilitates collaboration and increases overall efficiency.}

Due to the lack of subretinal visual feedback, it is hard to sense the insertion depth during the procedure, thus affecting the results of surgical outcome and hindering the widespread use of this treatment. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the 3D position of the needle under the retina using the information from microscope-integrated Intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT). We evaluated our approach on both tissue phantom and ex-vivo porcine eyes. Evaluation results show that the average error in distance measurement is 4.7 m (maximum of 16.5 m). We furthermore, verified the feasibility of the proposed method to track the insertion depth of needle in robotassisted subretinal injection.}

  abstract  = {Complete coverage, which is the foundation of many robotic applications, aims to cover an area as quickly as possible. This study investigates the time-limited version of multi-robot complete coverage problem, that is, to find the least number of robots and allocate tasks properly to them such that they can finish a known mission within the time limit. This version of problem can be tackled straightforwardly based on optimizing the task-allocation to a fixed number of robots and enumerating the number. However, the number-fixed problem is NP-hard and the existing algorithm for the numberfixed problem allows intersecting tasks (possibly causing robots interference) and endures high approximation factor. In this study, the time-limited complete coverage problem is tackled with a multi-objective approach, instead of enumerating robots number and optimizing each number-fixed problem one by one. The multi-objective GA, Mofint, at first estimates the lower and upper bounds of the number of robots. It abstracts each task as a weighted node of a graph. Then, Mofint evolves individuals, each individual being a forest containing a certain number (within the bounds) of non-intersecting trees. Mofint can finally obtain higher precision than existing work with less time: the approximation factor for Mofint is 1.1 to 1.5 times the ideal allocation when robots number is fixed, while for existing work is 1.5 to 2. Due to its higher precision, the least number of robots obtained in the experiments by Mofint is 0.6 times of existing work.}

The estimation of crop biomass in agriculture is expected to be closely correlated to canopy heights. The work presented in this paper contributes to the mapping and textual analysis of agricultural fields. Crop and environmental state information can be used to tailor treatments to the specific site. This paper presents the current results with our ground vehicle LiDAR mapping systems for broad acre crop fields. The proposed vehicle system and method facilitates LiDAR recordings in an experimental winter wheat field. LiDAR data are combined with data from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to conduct environment mapping for point clouds. The sensory data from the vehicle are recorded, mapped, and analyzed using the functionalities of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Point Cloud Library (PCL). In this experiment winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in field plots, was mapped using 3D point clouds with a point density on the centimeter level. The purpose of the experiment was to create 3D LiDAR point-clouds of the field plots enabling canopy volume and textural analysis to discriminate different crop treatments. Estimated crop volumes ranging from 3500-6200 (m3) per hectare are correlated to the manually collected samples of cut biomass extracted from the experimental field.}

  abstract = {Currently, self-driving cars rely greatly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) infrastructure, albeit there is an increasing demand for alternative methods for GPS-denied environments. One of them is known as place recognition, which associates images of places with their corresponding positions. We previously proposed systems based on Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) to address this problem as a classification task. This encompasses solely one part of the global localization, which is not precise enough for driverless cars. Instead of just recognizing past places and outputting their poses, it is desired that a global localization system estimates the pose of current place images. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem as follows. Firstly, given a live image, the place recognition system returns the most similar image and its pose. Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization system outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To estimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as input and a relative pose vector as output. Together, these systems solve the global localization problem using the topological and metric information to approximate the current vehicle pose. The full approach is compared to a Real- Time Kinematic GPS system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach correctly localizes a vehicle 90\% of the time with a mean error of 1.20m compared to 1.12m of the SLAM system and 0.37m of the GPS, 89\% of the time.}

The number of refueling stations and their placement plays a vital role in determining coverage efficiency. In this paper, we propose the use of a ground-based refueling vehicle (RV) to increase the operational range of a UAV in both spatial and temporal domains. Determining optimal routes for the UAV and RV, and selecting optimized locations for refueling to aid in minimizing coverage time is a challenging problem due to different vehicle speeds, coupling between refueling location placement, and the coverage area at each location. We develop a two-stage strategy for coupled route planning for UAV and RV to perform a coverage mission. The first stage computes a minimal set of refueling sites that permit a feasible UAV route. In the second stage, multiple Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations are developed to plan optimal routes for the UAV and the refueling vehicle taking into account the feasible set of refueling sites generated in stage one. The performance of different formulations is compared empirically. In addition, computationally efficient heuristics are developed to solve the routing problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.}

Pre-collected information of the road landmarks is stored in a self-defined map with a minimal amount of data. We recognize landmarks using a deep neural network, followed with a geometric feature extraction process which promotes the measurement accuracy. The vehicle location and posture are estimated by minimizing a self-defined re-projection residual error to evaluate the map-to-image registration, together with a robust association method. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by applying this method to localize a vehicle in an open dataset, achieving the RMS accuracy of 0.345 meter with reduced sensor setup and map storage compared to the state of art approaches. We also evaluate some key steps and discuss the contribution of the subsystems.}

Finding the best poses to capture part of the scene is one of the most challenging topic that goes under the name of Next Best View. Recently, many volumetric methods have been proposed; they choose the Next Best View by reasoning over a 3D voxelized space and by finding which pose minimizes the uncertainty decoded into the voxels. Such methods are effective, but they do not scale well since the underlaying representation requires a huge amount of memory. In this paper we propose a novel mesh-based approach which focuses on the worst reconstructed region of the environment mesh. We define a photo-consistent index to evaluate the 3D mesh accuracy, and an energy function over the worst regions of the mesh which takes into account the mutual parallax with respect to the previous cameras, the angle of incidence of the viewing ray to the surface and the visibility of the region. We test our approach over a well known dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results.}

As an RGB-D camera scans a cluttered scene, image-based instance-level semantic segmentation creates semantic object masks that enable real-time object recognition and the creation of an object-level representation for the world map. Unlike previous recognition-based SLAM systems, MaskFusion does not require prior knowledge or known models of the objects it can recognize and can deal with multiple independent motions. Unlike recent semantics enabled SLAM systems that perform voxel-level semantic segmentation MaskFusion takes full advantage of using instance-level semantic segmentation to enable semantic labels to be fused into an object-aware map. We show augmented-reality applications, that demonstrate the unique features of the map output by MaskFusion: instance-aware, semantic and dynamic.}

  abstract = {Visual Odometry (VO) can be categorized as being either direct or feature based. When the system is calibrated photometrically, and images are captured at high rates, direct methods have shown to outperform feature-based ones in terms of accuracy and processing time; they are also more robust to failure in feature-deprived environments. On the downside, Direct methods rely on heuristic motion models to seed the estimation of camera motion between frames; in the event that these models are violated (e.g., erratic motion), Direct methods easily fail. This paper proposes a novel system entitled FDMO (Feature assisted Direct Monocular Odometry), which complements the advantages of both direct and featured based techniques. FDMO bootstraps indirect feature tracking upon the sub-pixel accurate localized direct keyframes only when failure modes (e.g., large baselines) of direct tracking occur. Control returns back to direct odometry when these conditions are no longer violated. Efficiencies are introduced to help FDMO perform in real time. FDMO shows significant drift (alignment, rotation & scale) reduction when compared to DSO & ORB SLAM when evaluated using the TumMono and EuroC datasets.}

The visual part of the system performs a bundle-adjustment like optimization on a sparse set of points, but unlike key-point based systems it directly minimizes a photometric error. This makes it possible for the system to track not only corners, but any pixels with large enough intensity gradients. IMU information is accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes. We explicitly include scale and gravity direction into our model and jointly optimize them together with other variables such as poses. As the scale is often not immediately observable using IMU data this allows us to initialize our visual-inertial system with an arbitrary scale instead of having to delay the initialization until everything is observable. We perform partial marginalization of old variables so that updates can be computed in a reasonable time. In order to keep the system consistent we propose a novel strategy which we call "dynamic marginalization". This technique allows us to use partial marginalization even in cases where the initial scale estimate is far from the optimum. We evaluate our method on the challenging EuRoC dataset, showing that VI-DSO outperforms the state of the art.}

In this paper, we derive a SLAM formulation that uses dual quadrics as 3D landmark representations, exploiting their ability to compactly represent the size, position and orientation of an object, and show how 2D bounding boxes (such as those typically obtained from visual object detection systems) can directly constrain the quadric parameters via a novel geometric error formulation. We develop a sensor model for deep-learned object detectors that addresses the challenge of partial object detections often encountered in robotics applications, and demonstrate how to jointly estimate the camera pose and constrained dual quadric parameters in factor graph based SLAM with a general perspective camera.}

Our model jointly estimates (i) the segmentation of the scene into an unknown but finite number of objects, (ii) the motion trajectories of these objects and (iii) the object scene flow. We employ an hourglass, deep neural network architecture. In the encoding stage, the RGB and depth images undergo spatial compression and correlation. In the decoding stage, the model outputs three images containing a per-pixel estimate of the corresponding object center as well as object translation and rotation. This forms the basis for inferring the object segmentation and final object scene flow. To evaluate our model, we generated a new and challenging, large-scale, synthetic dataset that is specifically targeted at robotic manipulation: It contains a large number of scenes with a very diverse set of simultaneously moving 3D objects and is recorded with a commonly-used RGB-D camera. In quantitative experiments, we show that we significantly outperform state-of-the-art scene flow and motion-segmentation methods. In qualitative experiments, we show how our learned model transfers to challenging real-world scenes, visually generating significantly better results than existing methods.}

Experiments on two commonly used benchmarks for 6D pose estimation demonstrate that DeepIM achieves large improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

In addition to facilitating the computationally intensive task of processing 3D point clouds, working at the level of segments addresses the data compression requirements of real-time single- and multi-robot systems. While current methods extract descriptors for the single task of localization, SegMap leverages a data-driven descriptor in order to extract meaningful features that can also be used for reconstructing a dense 3D map of the environment and for extracting semantic information. This is particularly interesting for navigation tasks and for providing visual feedback to end-users such as robot operators, for example in search and rescue scenarios. These capabilities are demonstrated in multiple urban driving and search and rescue experiments. Our method leads to an increase of area under the ROC curve of 28.3\% over current state of the art using eigenvalue based features. We also obtain very similar reconstruction capabilities to a model specifically trained for this task.

While deep learning has enabled recent breakthroughs across a wide spectrum of scene understanding tasks, its applicability to state estimation tasks has been limited due to the direct formulation that renders it incapable of encoding scene-specific constrains. In this work, we propose the VLocNet++ architecture that employs a multitask learning approach to exploit the inter-task relationship between learning semantics, regressing 6-DoF global pose and odometry, for the mutual benefit of each of these tasks. Our network overcomes the aforementioned limitation by simultaneously embedding geometric and semantic knowledge of the world into the pose regression network. We propose a novel adaptive weighted fusion layer to aggregate motion-specific temporal information and to fuse semantic features into the localization stream based on region activations. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised warping technique that uses the relative motion to warp intermediate network representations in the segmentation stream for learning consistent semantics. Finally, we introduce a first-of-a-kind urban outdoor localization dataset with pixel-level semantic labels and multiple loops for training deep networks. Extensive experiments on the challenging Microsoft 7-Scenes benchmark and our DeepLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art outperforming local feature-based methods while simultaneously performing multiple tasks and exhibiting substantial robustness in challenging scenarios.}

The differential techniques (e.g., real-time kinematic (RTK)) have several attractive properties, such as correlated error mitigation and fast convergence; however, to support a differential processing scheme, an infrastructure of reference stations within a proximity of the platform must be in place to construct observation corrections. This infrastructure requirement makes differential processing techniques infeasible in many locations. To mitigate the need for additional receivers within proximity of the platform, the precise point positioning (PPP) method utilizes accurate orbit and clock models to localize the platform. The autonomy of PPP from local reference stations make it an attractive processing scheme for several applications; however, a current disadvantage of PPP is the slow positioning convergence when compared to differential techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the convergence properties of PPP with an incremental graph optimization scheme (Incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM2)), which allows for real-time filtering and smoothing. The characterization is first conducted through a Monte Carlo analysis within a simulation environment, which allows for the variations of parameters, such as atmospheric conditions, satellite geometry, and intensity of multipath. Then, an example collected data set is utilized to validate the trends presented in the simulation study.}

  abstract = {With the success of deep learning based approaches in tackling challenging problems in computer vision, a wide range of deep architectures have recently been proposed for the task of visual odometry (VO) estimation. Most of these proposed solutions rely on supervision, which requires the acquisition of precise ground-truth camera pose information, collected using expensive motion capture systems or high-precision IMU/GPS sensor rigs. In this work, we propose an unsupervised paradigm for deep visual odometry learning. We show that using a noisy teacher, which could be a standard VO pipeline, and by designing a loss term that enforces geometric consistency of the trajectory, we can train accurate deep models for VO that do not require ground-truth labels. We leverage geometry as a self-supervisory signal and propose "Composite Transformation Constraints (CTCs)", that automatically generate supervisory signals for training and enforce geometric consistency in the VO estimate. We also present a method of characterizing the uncertainty in VO estimates thus obtained. To evaluate our VO pipeline, we present exhaustive ablation studies that demonstrate the efficacy of end-to-end, self-supervised methodologies to train deep models for monocular VO. We show that leveraging concepts from geometry and incorporating them into the training of a recurrent neural network results in performance competitive to supervised deep VO methods.}

  abstract = {Human visual scene understanding is so remarkable that we are able to recognize a revisited place when entering it from the opposite direction it was first visited, even in the presence of extreme variations in appearance. This capability is especially apparent during driving: a human driver can recognize where they are when travelling in the reverse direction along a route for the first time, without having to turn back and look. The difficulty of this problem exceeds any addressed in past appearance- and viewpoint-invariant visual place recognition (VPR) research, in part because large parts of the scene are not commonly observable from opposite directions. Consequently, as shown in this paper, the precision-recall performance of current state-of-the-art viewpoint- and appearance-invariant VPR techniques is orders of magnitude below what would be usable in a closed-loop system. Current engineered solutions predominantly rely on panoramic camera or LIDAR sensing setups; an eminently suitable engineering solution but one that is clearly very different to how humans navigate, which also has implications for how naturally humans could interact and communicate with the navigation system. In this paper we develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable for the first time high performance place recognition in this challenging scenario. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of images using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense semantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement of the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining semantically-salient keypoint correspondences.}

The following paper describes OpenSeqSLAM2.0, a fully open source toolbox for visual place recognition under changing conditions. Beyond the benefits of open access to the source code, OpenSeqSLAM2.0 provides a number of tools to facilitate exploration of the visual place recognition problem and interactive parameter tuning.

AUVs create an acoustic image of the survey area, such that objects on the seabed can be identified and, in the case of MCM, mines can be found and disposed of. The common method for creating such seabed maps is to run a lawnmower survey, which is a standard method in coverage path planning. We are interested in exploring alternate techniques for surveying areas of interest, in order to reduce mission time or assess feasible actions, such as finding a safe path through a hazardous region. In this paper, we use Gaussian Process regression to build models of seabed complexity data, obtained through lawnmower surveys. We evaluate several commonly used kernels to assess their modeling performance, which includes modeling discontinuities in the data. Our results show that an additive Mat\'ern kernel is most suitable for modeling seabed complexity data. On top of the GP model, we use adaptations of two standard path planning methods, A* and RRT*, to find safe paths through the modeled areas. We evaluate the planned paths and also run a vehicle dynamics simulator to assess potential performance by a marine vessel.}

Approaches based solely on visual information or on low-cost GPS are easily prone to fail in such scenarios. In this paper, we present a robust and accurate 3D global pose estimation framework, designed to take full advantage of heterogeneous sensory data. By modeling the pose estimation problem as a pose graph optimization, our approach simultaneously mitigates the cumulative drift introduced by motion estimation systems (wheel odometry, visual odometry, ...), and the noise introduced by the raw GPS readings. Along with a suitable motion model, our system also integrates two additional types of constraints: (i) a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and (ii) a Markov Random Field (MRF) assumption. We demonstrate how using these additional cues substantially reduces the error along the altitude axis, and this benefit spreads to the other components of the state. We report exhaustive experiments combining several sensor setups, showing improvements from 37\% to 76\% of the localization accuracy with respect to using only the GPS. We also show that our approach provides accurate results even if the GPS temporarily change positioning mode. We released our C++ open-source implementation and two challenging datasets with their relative ground truth.}

Maintaining a spatial-hashed field of cubes, we distribute vertices with continuous value on discrete edges that support O(1) vertex accessing and forbid memory redundancy. By introducing Hamming distance in mesh refinement, we further improve the mesh quality regarding the triangle type consistency with a low cost. Lock-based and lock-free operations were applied to avoid thread conflicts in GPU parallel computation. Experiments demonstrate that the mesh memory consumption is significantly reduced while the running speed is kept in the online reconstruction process.}

We use a Euclidean Signed Distance Field, extract a 3D Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), and obtain a thin skeleton diagram representing the topological structure of the environment. We then convert this skeleton diagram into a sparse graph, which we show is resistant to noise and changes in resolution. We demonstrate global planning over this graph, and the orders of magnitude speed-up it offers over other common planning methods. We validate our planning algorithm in real maps built onboard an MAV, using RGB-D sensing.}

Effective soil mapping on farms can enhance yields, reduce inputs and help protect the environment. Traditionally, data are collected manually at an arbitrary set of locations, then soil maps are constructed offline using Kriging, a form of Gaussian process regression. This process is laborious and costly, limiting the quality and resolution of the resulting information. Instead, we propose to use an outdoor mobile robot for automatic collection of soil condition data, building soil maps online and also adapting the robot's exploration strategy on-the-fly based on the current quality of the map. We show how using Kriging variance as a reward function for robotic exploration allows for both more efficient data collection and better soil models. This work presents the theoretical foundations for our proposal and an experimental comparison of exploration strategies using soil compaction data from a field generated with a mobile robot.}

Examining these points of interest is time consuming, potentially hazardous or require special equipment to reach. MAVs are ideal platforms to automate this expensive and tedious task. In this work we present a novel system that enables a human operator to teach a visual inspection task to an autonomous aerial vehicle by simply demonstrating the task using a handheld device. To enable robust operation in confined, GPS-denied environments, the system employs the Google Tango visual-inertial mapping framework as the only source of pose estimates. In a first step the operator records the desired inspection path and defines the inspection points. The mapping framework then computes a feature-based localization map, which is shared with the robot. After take-off, the robot estimates its pose based on this map and plans a smooth trajectory through the way points defined by the operator. Furthermore, the system is able to track the poses of other robots or the operator, localized in the same map, and follow them in real-time while keeping a safe distance.}

This is especially relevant for inspection tasks and search and rescue missions. To solve this high-dimensional path planning problem, sampling-based exploration algorithms have proven successful. However, these do not necessarily scale well to larger environments or spaces with narrow openings. This paper presents a 3D exploration planner based on the principles of Next-Best Views (NBVs). In this approach, a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a limited field-of-view depth sensor randomly samples its configuration space to find promising future viewpoints. In order to obtain high sampling efficiency, our planner maintains and uses a history of visited places, and locally optimizes the robot's orientation with respect to unobserved space. We evaluate our method in several simulated scenarios, and compare it against a state-of-the-art exploration algorithm. The experiments show substantial improvements in exploration time ($2\times$ faster), computation time, and path length, and advantages in handling difficult situations such as escaping dead-ends (up to $20\times$ faster). Finally, we validate the on-line capability of our algorithm on a computational constrained real world MAV.}

In this paper, we present an approach for predicting occupancy map representations of sensor data for future robot motions using deep neural networks. We evaluate several deep network architectures, including purely generative and adversarial models. Testing on both simulated and real environments we demonstrated performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with SSIM similarity measure up to 0.899. We showed that it is possible to make predictions about occupied space beyond the physical robot's FOV from simulated training data. In the future, this method will allow robots to navigate through unknown environments in a faster, safer manner.}

This process of planning observations to improve the model of a scene is called Next Best View (NBV) planning. NBV planning approaches often use either volumetric (e.g., voxel grids) or surface (e.g., triangulated meshes) representations. Volumetric approaches generalise well between scenes as they do not depend on surface geometry but do not scale to high-resolution models of large scenes. Surface representations can obtain high-resolution models at any scale but often require tuning of unintuitive parameters or multiple survey stages. This paper presents a scene-model-free NBV planning approach with a density representation. The Surface Edge Explorer (SEE) uses the density of current measurements to detect and explore observed surface boundaries. This approach is shown experimentally to provide better surface coverage in lower computation time than the evaluated state-of-the-art volumetric approaches while moving equivalent distances.}

Leveraging on our prior work, in this paper we present a Hamming Distance embedding Binary Search Tree (HBST) approach for binary Descriptor Matching and Image Retrieval. HBST allows for descriptor Search and Insertion in logarithmic time by exploiting particular properties of binary Feature descriptors. We support the idea behind our search structure with a thorough analysis on the exploited descriptor properties and their effects on completeness and complexity of search and insertion. To validate our claims we conducted comparative experiments for HBST and several state-of-the-art methods on a broad range of publicly available datasets. HBST is available as a compact open-source C++ header-only library.}

  abstract = {We would like robots to be able to safely navigate at high speed, efficiently use local 3D information, and robustly plan motions that consider pose uncertainty of measurements in a local map structure. This is hard to do with previously existing mapping approaches, like occupancy grids, that are focused on incrementally fusing 3D data into a common world frame. In particular, both their fragile sensitivity to state estimation errors and computational cost can be limiting. We develop an alternative framework, NanoMap, which alleviates the need for global map fusion and enables a motion planner to efficiently query pose-uncertainty-aware local 3D geometric information. The key idea of NanoMap is to store a history of noisy relative pose transforms and search over a corresponding set of depth sensor measurements for the minimum-uncertainty view of a queried point in space. This approach affords a variety of capabilities not offered by traditional mapping techniques: (a) the pose uncertainty associated with 3D data can be incorporated in motion planning, (b) poses can be updated (i.e., from loop closures) with minimal computational effort, and (c) 3D data can be fused lazily for the purpose of planning. We provide an open-source implementation of NanoMap, and analyze its capabilities and computational efficiency in simulation experiments. Finally, we demonstrate in hardware its effectiveness for fast 3D obstacle avoidance onboard a quadrotor flying up to 10 m/s.}

The resulting system enables highfrequency, low-latency ego-motion estimation, along with dense, accurate 3D map registration. Further, the system is capable of handling sensor degradation by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure modules. Therefore, it can operate in the presence of highly dynamic motion as well as in dark, textureless, and structure-less environments.

  abstract  = {This paper presents an efficient framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using input from a moving monocular camera. Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) approaches based solely on geometric methods have proven to be quite capable of accurately tracking the pose of a moving camera and simultaneously building a map of the environment in real-time. However, most of them suffer from the 3D map being too sparse for practical use. The missing points in the generated map correspond mainly to areas lacking texture in the input images, and dense mapping systems often rely on hand-crafted priors like piecewise-planarity or piecewise-smooth depth. These priors do not always provide the required level of scene understanding to accurately fill the map. On the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have had great success in extracting high-level information from images and regressing pixel-wise surface normals, semantics, and even depth. In this work we leverage this high-level scene context learned by a deep CNN in the form of a surface normal prior. We show, in particular, that using the surface normal prior leads to better reconstructions than the weaker smoothness prior.}

This way we find very informative support points which preserve the depth discontinuity. The prior of our Bayesian stereo matching method is based on a set of line segments and a set of support points. Both sets are given to a constrained Delaunay triangulation to generate a triangulation mesh which is aware of possible depth discontinuities. We further increased the accuracy by using an adaptive method to sample candidate points along edge segments. We evaluated our algorithm on the Middlebury benchmark.},

However, the reconstructions are noisy and generally incomplete. Moreover, during online reconstruction, the surface changes with every newly integrated depth image which poses a significant challenge for physics engines and path planning algorithms. This paper presents a novel, fast and robust method for obtaining and using information about planar surfaces, such as walls, floors, and ceilings as a stage in 3D reconstruction based on Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Our algorithm recovers clean and accurate surfaces, reduces the movement of individual mesh vertices caused by noise during online reconstruction and fills in the occluded and unobserved regions. We implemented and evaluated two different strategies to generate plane candidates and two strategies for merging them. Our implementation is optimized to run in real-time on mobile devices such as the Tango tablet. In an extensive set of experiments, we validated that our approach works well in a large number of natural environments despite the presence of significant amount of occlusion, clutter and noise, which occur frequently. We further show that plane fitting enables in many cases a meaningful semantic segmentation of real-world scenes.},

Drawing inspiration from visual state estimation, we employ a direct formulation of the camera measurement model. To this end, we render a view of the target given all calibration parameters, enabling a maximum likelihood estimator formulated on image intensities as measurements. We demonstrate the advantages of avoiding abstraction from image measurements for determining the line delay of a rolling shutter camera and by estimating camera exposure time from motion blur.}

Utilizing the sparse nature of the environment, we propose a ray tracing method with early termination for efficient probabilistic map update. We also propose a divide-and-conquer volume occupancy inquiry method which serves as the core operation for generation of free-space configurations for optimization-based trajectory generation. We experimentally demonstrate that our method maintains the same storage advantage of the original OctoMap, but being computationally more efficient for map update and occupancy inquiry.

Then we refine the disparity map iteratively by bilateral filtering-based completion and edge feature refinement.

In order to handle such matters, we propose an adaptive CT method that combines the predicted target position with CT based on Locality Sensitive Histograms (LSH) features. Our method significantly improves CT in four aspects. First, the efficient illumination invariant features extracted based on LSH are used to represent an effective appearance model that is robust to illumination changes. Second, the color attributes tracker is adopted to predict the target position for re-building the new weighted discriminant function which brings in the color information to make up for the inadequacy of Haarlike characteristics. Third, a new model update mechanism is proposed to preserve the stable features while avoid the noisy appearance variations during tracking. Fourth, a trajectory rectification method is employed to refine the tracking location when possible inaccurate tracking occurs. Finally, we show that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in a comprehensive evaluation over 47 challenging color sequences.}

Automated weed scouting and weed destruction has typically been performed using classification systems able to classify a set group of species known a priori. This greatly limits deployability as classification systems must be retrained for any field with a different set of weed species present within them. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper works towards developing a clustering approach to weed scouting which can be utilized in any field without the need for prior species knowledge. We demonstrate our system using challenging data collected in the field from an agricultural robotics platform. We show that considerable improvements can be made by (i) learning low-dimensional (bottleneck) features using a deep convolutional neural network to represent plants in general and (ii) tying views of the same area (plant) together. Deploying this algorithm on in-field data collected by AgBotII, we are able to successfully cluster cotton plants from grasses without prior knowledge or training for the specific plants in the field.},

However, the localization performance degrades when the observed lighting conditions differ from the conditions when the sparse map was built. We investigate and quantify the effect of lighting variations on visual feature-based localization systems, and discover that maps built in darker conditions can also be effective in bright conditions, but the reverse is not true. We extend Astrobees localization algorithm to make it more robust to changinglight environments on the ISS by automatically recognizing the current illumination level, and selecting an appropriate map and camera exposure time.

Segmenting the 3D point cloud that is provided by modern LiDAR sensors, is the first important step towards the situational assessment pipeline that aims for the safety of the passengers. This step needs to provide accurate segmentation of the ground surface and the obstacles in the vehicles path, and to process each point cloud in real time. The proposed pipeline aims to solve the problem of 3D point cloud segmentation for data received from a LiDAR in a fast and low complexity manner that targets real world applications. The two-step algorithm first extracts the ground surface in an iterative fashion using deterministically assigned seed points, and then clusters the remaining non-ground points taking advantage of the structure of the LiDAR point cloud. Our proposed algorithms outperform similar approaches in running time, while producing similar results and support the validity of this pipeline as a segmentation tool for real world applications.}

In the mapping part, edge is used to speed up and increase stereo matching accuracy.

Previous work typically performs change detection on point clouds, surfels or maps, which are not able to distinguish between unexplored and empty space. In contrast, our TSDF-based representation naturally contains this information and thus allows us to more robustly solve the scene differencing problem.

Additionally, we provide a robust data association algorithm to address the problem of large appearance changes due to scenes being viewed from different angles at different points in time, which is critical to achieving 4D reconstruction. Finally, we collected a high-quality dataset with ground-truth statistics to evaluate the performance of our method.

  abstract  = {This paper studies monocular visual odometry (VO) problem. Most of existing VO algorithms are developed under a standard pipeline including feature extraction, feature matching, motion estimation, local optimisation, etc. Although some of them have demonstrated superior performance, they usually need to be carefully designed and specifically fine-tuned to work well in different environments. Some prior knowledge is also required to recover an absolute scale for monocular VO. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for monocular VO by using deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs). Since it is trained and deployed in an end-to-end manner, it infers poses directly from a sequence of raw RGB images (videos) without adopting any module in the conventional VO pipeline. Based on the RCNNs, it not only automatically learns effective feature representation for the VO problem through Convolutional Neural Networks, but also implicitly models sequential dynamics and relations using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Extensive experiments on the KITTI VO dataset show competitive performance to state-ofthe-art methods, verifying that the end-to-end Deep Learning technique can be a viable complement to the traditional VO systems.}

  abstract  = {Many robotics and Augmented Reality (AR) systems that use sparse keypoint-based visual maps operate in large and highly repetitive environments, where pose tracking and localization are challenging tasks. Additionally, these systems usually face further challenges, such as limited computational power, or insufficient memory for storing large maps of the entire environment. Thus, developing compact map representations and improving retrieval is of considerable interest for enabling large-scale visual place recognition and loop-closure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compress descriptors while increasing their discriminability and matchability, based on recent advances in neural networks. At the same time, we target resource-constrained robotics applications in our design choices. The main contributions of this work are twofold. First, we propose a linear projection from descriptor space to a lower-dimensional Euclidean space, based on a novel supervised learning strategy employing a triplet loss. Second, we show the importance of including contextual appearance information to the visual feature in order to improve matching under strong viewpoint, illumination and scene changes. Through detailed experiments on three challenging datasets, we demonstrate significant gains in performance over state-ofthe-art methods.}

Our method uses stable, descriptorless features associated with vertical structure in the environment around a ground robot in previously unmapped areas, referencing only overhead imagery, without GPS. Multiple-hypothesis data association with a particle filter enables efficient recovery from data association error and odometry uncertainty. We implement a stereo system to demonstrate our vertical feature based global positioning approach in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, and show comparable performance to laser-scanmatching results in both environments.}

From an input set of trajectories, a set of hot regions (topics) that trajectory points most frequently present are first discovered using a sticky HDP-HMM; then, the major paths of the trajectories transitions across different hot regions are extracted by recursively mining frequent subsequences of topics; and finally, paths are modeled using a hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), where the intra-path dynamics is represented using an HMM, in which each state corresponds to a hot region, while the inter-path transition is assumed to be Markovian. The model could be used for behavior prediction, i.e. whenever a vehicle is detected in a scene, predicting which route it will probably follow and how its trajectory will probably develop over time, which is essential to interpreting the potential risks for longer time horizons. Experiments are conducted using a large set of vehicle trajectories collected from motorways in Beijing, and promising results are presented.}

  abstract  = {In this work, we develop a novel keyframe-based dense planar SLAM (KDP-SLAM) system, based on CPU only, to reconstruct large indoor environments in real-time using a hand-held RGB-D sensor. Our keyframe-based approach applies a fast dense method to estimate odometry, fuses depth measurements from small baseline images, extracts planes from the fused depth map, and optimizes the poses of the keyframes and landmark planes in a global factor graph using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM). Using the fast odometry estimation, correct plane correspondences may be found projectively, and the pose of each frame can be estimated accurately even without sufficient planes to fully constrain the 6 degree-of-freedom transformation. The depth map generated from the local fusion process generates higher quality reconstructions and plane segmentations by eliminating noise. Moreover, explicitly modeling plane landmarks in the fully probabilistic global optimization significantly reduces the drift that plagues other dense SLAM algorithms. We test our system on standard RGB-D benchmarks as well as additional indoor environments, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance as a real-time dense 3D SLAM algorithm, without the use of GPU.}

  abstract  = {This paper deals with the problem of active sensing control for nonlinear differentially flat systems. The objective is to improve the estimation accuracy of an observer by determining the inputs of the system that maximise the amount of information gathered by the outputs over a time horizon. In particular, we use the Observability Gramian (OG) to quantify the richness of the acquired information. First, we define a trajectory for the flat outputs of the system by using B-Spline curves. Then, we exploit an online gradient descent strategy to move the control points of the B-Spline in order to actively maximise the smallest eigenvalue of the OG over the whole planning horizon. While the system travels along its planned (optimized) trajectory, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate the system state. In order to keep memory of the past acquired sensory data for online re-planning, the OG is also computed on the past estimated state trajectories. This is then used for an online replanning of the optimal trajectory during the robot motion which is continuously refined by exploiting the state estimation obtained by the EKF. In order to show the effectiveness of our method we consider a simple but significant case of a planar robot with a single range measurement. The simulation results show that, along the optimal path, the EKF converges faster and provides a more accurate estimate than along other possible (non-optimal) paths.}

Ablation studies are presented to better understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of > 0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.}

Thanks to colorization techniques, these methods exploit the filters learned from 2D images to extract meaningful representations in 2.5D. Still, the perceptual signature of these two kind of images is very different, with the first usually strongly characterized by textures, and the second mostly by silhouettes of objects. Ideally, one would like to have two CNNs, one for RGB and one for depth, each trained on a suitable data collection, able to capture the perceptual properties of each channel for the task at hand. This has not been possible so far, due to the lack of a suitable depth database. This paper addresses this issue, proposing to opt for synthetically generated images rather than collecting by hand a 2.5D large scale database. While being clearly a proxy for real data, synthetic images allow to trade quality for quantity, making it possible to generate a virtually infinite amount of data. We show that the filters learned from such data collection, using the very same architecture typically used on visual data, learns very different filters, resulting in depth features (a) able to better characterize the different facets of depth images, and (b) complementary with respect to those derived from CNNs pretrained on 2D datasets. Experiments on two publicly available databases show the power of our approach.}

  abstract  = {Visual place recognition under difficult perceptual conditions remains a challenging problem due to changing weather conditions, illumination and seasons. Long-term visual navigation approaches for robot localization should be robust to these dynamics of the environment. Existing methods typically leverage feature descriptions of whole images or image regions from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Some approaches also exploit sequential information to alleviate the problem of spatially inconsistent and non-perfect image matches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning a discriminative holistic image representation which exploits the image content to create a dense and salient scene description. These salient descriptions are learnt over a variety of datasets under large perceptual changes. Such an approach enables us to precisely segment the regions of an image which are geometrically stable over large time lags. We combine features from these salient regions and an off-the-shelf holistic representation to form a more robust scene descriptor. We also introduce a semantically labeled dataset which captures extreme perceptual and structural scene dynamics over the course of 3 years. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments on data collected over several kilometers in Freiburg and show that our learnt image representation outperforms off-the-shelf features from the deep networks and hand-crafted features.}

Though the problem appears to be ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles project to an image can be used to reason about the reverse process, i.e., how shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in shape priors, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then formulate a shapeaware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle keypoints in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as stereo approaches.}

Thus longterm operation of these systems cannot fully rely on factory calibration. Since the observability of certain parameters is highly dependent on the motion of the device, using short data segments at device initialization may yield poor results. When such systems are additionally subject to energy constraints, it is also infeasible to use full-batch approaches on a big dataset and careful selection of the data is of high importance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for resource efficient self-calibration of visual-inertial sensor systems. This is achieved by casting the calibration as a segment-based optimization problem that can be run on a small subset of informative segments. Consequently, the computational burden is limited as only a predefined number of segments is used. We also propose an efficient information-theoretic selection to identify such informative motion segments. In evaluations on a challenging dataset, we show our approach to significantly outperform state-of-the-art in terms of computational burden while maintaining a comparable accuracy.}

The range in which depth values can be accurately estimated is usually limited for two-camera stereo setups due to the fixed baseline between the cameras. In addition, two-camera setups suffer from wrong depth estimates caused by local minima in the matching cost functions. Both problems can be alleviated by adding more cameras as this creates multiple baselines of different lengths and since multi-image matching leads to unique minima. However, using more cameras usually comes at an increase in run-time. In this paper, we present a novel embedded system for multibaseline stereo. By exploiting the parallelization capabilities within FPGAs, we are able to estimate a depth map from multiple cameras in real-time. We show that our approach requires only little more power and weight compared to a twocamera stereo system. At the same time, we show that our system produces significantly better depth maps and is able to handle occlusion of some cameras, resulting in the redundancy typically desired for autonomous vehicles. Our system is small in size and leight-weight and can be employed even on a MAV platform with very strict power, weight, and size requirements.}

A key contribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing that the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true attitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively compensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude estimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is initialized with a very large attitude error.}

Segments provide a good compromise between local and global descriptions, incorporating their strengths while reducing their individual drawbacks. SegMatch does not rely on assumptions of perfect segmentation, or on the existence of objects in the environment, which allows for reliable execution on large scale, unstructured environments.

This paper proposes a robust probabilistic model for projection errors, based on real world data. For that, we argue that projection distances follow Gamma distributions, and hence, the introduction of these models in a probabilistic formulation of the motion estimation process increases both precision and accuracy.

Thus, the generated map data requires automated evaluation procedures that do not require experienced personnel or ground truth knowledge of the underlying environment. A particularly important question enabling commercial applications is whether a given map is of sufficient quality for localization. This paper proposes a framework for predicting localization performance in the context of visual landmark-based mapping. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for predicting performance of vision-based localization systems from different poses within the map. To achieve this, a metric is defined that assigns a score to a given query pose based on the underlying map structure. The algorithm is evaluated on two challenging datasets involving indoor data generated using a handheld device and outdoor data from an autonomous fixedwing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using these, we are able to show that the score provided by our method is highly correlated to the true localization performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the predicted map quality can be used within a belief based path planning framework in order to provide reliable trajectories through high-quality areas of the map.}

Interestingly, explicit reasoning about the data association within the belief enables our framework to have parsimonious data association, thereby resulting in a scalable solution compared with nave permutational approaches. Unlike in some of the recent approaches where the number of components in a GMM belief can only be reduced, in our approach this can also go up such as due to perceptual aliasing present in the environment. Furthermore, our approach naturally integrates with inference, providing a unified framework for robust passive and active perception. We demonstrate key aspects of our approach and its comparison with the state of the art on a general abstract domain as well as in a real robot setup.}

The first method, curvature filtering, is based on the assumption that low curvature regions provide false matches, and removing points in these regions improves robustness. The second method, region pruning, is more general by making no assumptions about local surface properties. Our region pruning segments a model point cloud into cluster regions and searches good region combinations using a validation set. The robustifying methods are general and can be used with any correspondence based method. For the experiments, we evaluated three correspondence selection methods, Geometric Consistency (GC) [1], Hough Grouping (HG) [2] and Search of Inliers (SI) [3] and report systematic improvements for their robustified versions with two distinct datasets.}

We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an occupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to informationtheoretic objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our approach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the effects of different planning strategies. Our results show that the proposed algorithm builds maps with over 50\% lower entropy compared to traditional lawnmower coverage in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the planning scheme on a multirotor platform with different artificial farmland set-ups.}

The use of Echo State Networks allows to deal with temporal dependencies implicitly, while the spatial mapping with a Gaussian Process estimator exploits the fact that Echo State Networks learn linear combinations of complex temporal dynamics. The resulting Echo State Map elegantly combines spatial and temporal cues into a single representation. We showcase the method in the exposure modeling task of building dust distribution maps for foundries, a challenge which is of great interest to occupational health researchers. Results from simulated data and real world experiments highlight the potential of Echo State Maps. While we focus on particulate matter measurements, the method can be applied for any other environmental variables like temperature or gas concentration.}

  abstract  = {This paper addresses a difficulty in large-scale long term laser localisation - how to deal with scene change. We pose this as a distraction suppression problem. Urban driving environments are frequently subject to large dynamic outliers, such as buses, trucks etc. These objects can mask the static elements of the prior map that we rely on for localisation. At the same time some objects change shape in a way that is less dramatic but equally pernicious during localisation for example trees over seasons and in wind, shop fronts and doorways. In this paper, we show how we can learn in high resolution, the areas of our map that are subject to such distractions (low value data) in a place-dependent approach. We demonstrate how to utilise this model to select individual laser measurements for localisation. Specifically, by leveraging repeated operation over weeks and months, for each point in our map pointcloud we build distributions of the errors associated with that point for multiple localisation passes. These distributions are then used to determine the legitimacy of laser measurements prior to their use in localisation. We demonstrate distraction suppression as a front-end process to large scale localiser by incrementally adding 50km of error data to our base map and show that robustness is improved over the base system with a further 10km of urban driving.}

Added routes can be followed autonomously using visual localization. To enable long-term operation that is robust to appearance change, its Multi-Experience Localization (MEL) leverages many previously driven experiences when localizing to the manually taught network. While this multi-experience method is effective across appearance change, the computation becomes intractable as the number of experiences grows into the tens and hundreds. This paper introduces an algorithm that prioritizes experiences most relevant to live operation, limiting the number of experiences required for localization. The proposed algorithm uses a visual Bag-of-Words description of the live view to select relevant experiences based on what the vehicle is seeing right now, without having to factor in all possible environmental influences on scene appearance. This system runs in the loop, in real time, does not require bootstrapping, can be applied to any pointfeature MEL paradigm, and eliminates the need for visual training using an online, local visual vocabulary. By picking a subset of visually similar experiences to the live view, we demonstrate safe, vision-in-the-loop route following over a 31 hour period, despite appearance as different as night and day.}

  abstract  = {RGBD SLAM systems have shown impressive results, but the limited field of view (FOV) and depth range of typical RGBD cameras still cause problems for registering distant frames. Monocular SLAM systems, in contrast, can exploit wide-angle cameras and do not have the depth range limitation, but are unstable for textureless scenes. We present a SLAM system that uses both an RGBD camera and a wide-angle monocular camera for combining the advantages of the two sensors. Our system extracts 3D point features from RGBD frames and 2D point features from monocular frames, which are used to perform both RGBD-to-RGBD and RGBDto-monocular registration. To compensate for different FOV and resolution of the cameras, we generate multiple virtual images for each wide-angle monocular image and use the feature descriptors computed on the virtual images to perform the RGBD-to-monocular matches. To compute the poses of the frames, we construct a graph where nodes represent RGBD and monocular frames and edges denote the pairwise registration results between the nodes. We compute the global poses of the nodes by first finding the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of the graph and then pruning edges that have inconsistent poses due to possible mismatches using the MST result. We finally run bundle adjustment on the graph using all the consistent edges. Experimental results show that our system registers a larger number of frames than using only an RGBD camera, leading to larger-scale 3D reconstruction.}

Inspired by some of the most recent breakthroughs in online dense scene estimation and borrowing fundamental concepts from Computer Vision, in this work we propose a new pipeline for real-time, local scene reconstruction using a single camera for aerial navigation. Aiming for denser scene estimation than traditional feature-based maps with the ability to run onboard a small UAV in real-time, the proposed approach is demonstrated to achieve unprecedented performance producing rich maps of the cameras workspace, timely enough to serve in obstacle avoidance and real-time interaction of a robot with its direct surroundings. Evaluation on benchmarking datasets and on challenging aerial footage captured with a UAV featuring a conventional camera, reveals dramatic speed-ups, as well as denser and more accurate local reconstructions with respect to the state of the art.}

Yet, there are many environments in which, despite being low textured, one can still reliably estimate line-based geometric primitives, for instance in city and indoor scenes, or in the so-called Manhattan worlds, where structured edges are predominant. In this paper we propose a solution to handle these situations. Specifically, we build upon ORBSLAM, presumably the current state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy as efficiency, and extend its formulation to simultaneously handle both point and line correspondences. We propose a solution that can even work when most of the points are vanished out from the input images, and, interestingly it can be initialized from solely the detection of line correspondences in three consecutive frames. We thoroughly evaluate our approach and the new initialization strategy on the TUM RGB-D benchmark and demonstrate that the use of lines does not only improve the performance of the original ORB-SLAM solution in poorly textured frames, but also systematically improves it in sequence frames combining points and lines, without compromising the efficiency.}

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the task of designing a modular neural network architecture that jointly solves different tasks. As an example we use the tasks of depth estimation and semantic segmentation given a single RGB image. The main focus of this work is to analyze the cross-modality influence between depth and semantic prediction maps on their joint refinement. While most of the previous works solely focus on measuring improvements in accuracy, we propose a way to quantify the cross-modality influence. We show that there is a relationship between final accuracy and cross-modality influence, although not a simple linear one. Hence a larger cross-modality influence does not necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial balance between the cross-modality influences can be achieved by network architecture and conjecture that this relationship can be utilized to understand different network design choices. Towards this end we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that fuses the state-of-the-art results for depth estimation and semantic labeling. By balancing the crossmodality influences between depth and semantic prediction, we achieve improved results for both tasks using the NYU-Depth v2 benchmark.}

In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative featureto-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver. Keywords: SLAM, graph-based SLAM, non-linear optimization, relative measurements}

With Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) systems recently demonstrated to be employable onboard UAVs, the focus fall on path-planning on the quest of achieving autonomous navigation. With the vast body of path-planning literature often assuming perfect maps or maps known a priori, the biggest challenge lies in dealing with the robustness and accuracy limitations of onboard SLAM in real missions. In this spirit, this paper proposes a path-planning algorithm designed to work in the loop of the SLAM estimation of a monocular-inertial system. This point-to-point planner is demonstrated to navigate in an unknown environment using the incrementally generated SLAM map, while dictating the navigation strategy for preferable acquisition of sensor data for better estimations within SLAM. A thorough evaluation testbed of both simulated and real data is presented, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed pipeline against the state-of-the-art and its dramatically lower computational complexity, revealing its suitability to UAV navigation.

The NMPC operates over both steering and acceleration simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed receding horizon planner also applies to fully autonomous vehicles.

State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used. On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks, but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1) a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging technique for regression ensembles which can be trained endto-end with a NN. Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression, traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better. To summarize, our best method, a ForestNet with a robust average, which has an equivalent fast and lightweight RF, improves over the stateof-the-art for camera localization on the 7-Scenes dataset [1]. While this work focuses on scene coordinate regression for camera localization, our innovations may also be applied to other continuous regression tasks.}

We have tested our method extensively in real homes, offices and on synthetic data.

SeqSLAM is considered to be one of the most successful algorithms for loop closure detection as it has been demonstrated to be able to handle significant environmental condition changes including those due to illumination, weather, and time of the day. However, SeqSLAM relies heavily on exhaustive sequence matching, a computationally expensive process that prevents the algorithm from being used in dealing with large maps. In this paper, we propose Fast-SeqSLAM, an efficient version of SeqSLAM. Fast-SeqSLAM has a much reduced time complexity without degrading the accuracy, and this is achieved by using an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm to match the current image with those in the robot map and extending the idea of SeqSLAM to greedily search a sequence of images that best match with the current sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fast-SeqSLAM algorithm in appearance based loop closure detection.}

Moreover, the classic measure for the certainty of the depth estimate fails as well: The matching score between the template and any pixel on the epipolar line is perfect. This results for common scenes in incorrect matches with very high confidence, some even resistant to leftright image checks. It is straightforward to try to address this by adding a second stereo head in a perpendicular direction. However, it is nontrivial to identify the failure and fuse the two depth maps in a real-time system. A simple weighted average will alleviate the problem but still result in a very large error in the depth map. Our contributions are: 1) We derive a model to predict the failure of stereo by leveraging the matching scores and 2) we propose a combined cost function to fuse two depth maps from orthogonal stereo heads using the failure prediction, matching score and consistency. We show the resulting system in real-time operation on a low-latency system in indoor, urban and natural environments.}

  abstract  = {Motion planning for multi-target autonomous search requires efciently gathering as much information over an area as possible with an imperfect sensor. In disaster scenarios and contested environments the spatial connectivity may unexpectedly change (due to aftershock, avalanche, ood, building collapse, adversary movements, etc.) and the ight envelope may evolve as a known function of time to ensure rescue worker safety or to facilitate other mission goals. Algorithms designed to handle both expected and unexpected changes must: (1) reason over a sufciently long time horizon to respect expected changes, and (2) replan quickly in response to unexpected changes. These ambitions are hindered by the submodularity property of mutual information, which makes optimal solutions NP-hard to compute. We present an algorithm for autonomous search in changing environments that uses a variety of techniques to improve both the speed and time horizon, including using admissible heuristics to speed up the search.}

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a probabilistic approach for detecting and classifying urban road intersections from a moving vehicle. The approach is based on images from an onboard stereo rig; it relies on the detection of the road ground plane on one side, and on a pixel-level classification of the road on the other. The two processing pipelines are then integrated and the parameters of the road components, i.e., the intersection geometry, are inferred. As opposed to other state-of-the-art offline methods, which require processing of the whole video sequence, our approach integrates the image data by means of an online procedure. The experiments have been performed on well-known KITTI datasets, allowing for future comparisons.}

Abandoning the grid structure allows a more accurate representation of space directly tangent to surfaces, which facilitates a number of applications such as high fidelity surface reconstruction and surface-guided path planning. Maps composed of atoms can distinguish between free, occupied, and unknown space, support computationally efficient insertions and collision queries, provide free space planning guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art memory efficiency over large volumes. This is achieved while simultaneously reducing quantization effects in the vicinity of surfaces and defining a useful implicit surface representation.}

To enable spatio-temporal mapping we also present a procedure for in-situ illumination estimation, resulting in radiometric calibration of the collected images. In contrast to current approaches, we present a purely data driven, parameter free approach, based on maximum likelihood estimation which can be performed entirely on the field, without requiring specialised laboratory equipment. Our routine requires three simple datasets which are easily acquired using most modern multispectral cameras. We evaluate the framework with a cost-effective snapshot multispectral camera. The results show that our method enables the creation of quatitatively accurate relative reflectance images with challenging on field calibration datasets under a variety of ambient conditions.}

Recent developments in computer vision have made autonomous vision based navigation possible. However, vision systems are known to be imperfect and prone to failure due to variable lighting, terrain changes, and other environmental variables. We describe a system for learning simple failure recovery maneuvers based on experience. This involves both recognizing when the vision system is prone to failure, and associating failures with appropriate responses that will most likely help the robot recover. We implement this system on an autonomous quadrotor and demonstrate that behaviors learned with our system are effective in recovering from situational perception failure, thereby improving reliability in cluttered and uncertain environments.}

  abstract  = {Bayesian Optimisation has gained much popularity lately, as a global optimisation technique for functions that are expensive to evaluate or unknown a priori. While classical BO focuses on where to gather an observation next, it does not take into account practical constraints for a robotic system such as where it is physically possible to gather samples from, nor the sequential nature of the problem while executing a trajectory. In field robotics and other real-life situations, physical and trajectory constraints are inherent problems. This paper addresses these issues by formulating Bayesian Optimisation for continuous trajectories within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. The resulting POMDP is solved using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we adapt to using a reward function balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on monitoring a spatial phenomenon with a UAV illustrate how our BO-POMDP algorithm outperforms competing techniques.}

Despite the rise of dense and semi-dense methods which use large proportions of the pixels in a video stream to estimate motion and structure via alternating estimation, they have not eradicated feature-based methods which use a significantly smaller amount of image information from keypoints and retain a more rigorous joint estimation framework. Dense methods provide more complete scene information, but in this paper we focus on how the amount of information and different optimisation methods affect the accuracy of local motion estimation (monocular visual odometry). This topic becomes particularly relevant after the recent results from a direct sparse system. We propose a new method for fairly comparing the accuracy of SLAM frontends in a common setting. We suggest computational cost models for an overall comparison which indicates that there is relative parity between the approaches at the settings allowed by current serial processors when evaluated under equal conditions.}

While some vision-based tracking methods invoke 3D information in parts of their pipeline, and some 3D-based methods utilize image-based information in components of their approach, we propose to use image- and world-space information jointly throughout our method. We present our tracking pipeline as a 3D extension of image-based tracking. From enhancing the detections with 3D measurements to the reported positions of every tracked object, we use worldspace 3D information at every stage of processing. We accomplish this by our novel coupled 2D-3D Kalman filter, combined with a conceptually clean and extendable hypothesize-andselect framework. Our approach matches the current stateof-the-art on the official KITTI benchmark, which performs evaluation in the 2D image domain only. Further experiments show significant improvements in 3D localization precision by enabling our coupled 2D-3D tracking.}

The resulting inference model has several desirable properties in comparison to existing methods, including speed of computation, the ability to be recursively updated without approximation, and consistency between batch and online inference. The method also reverts to the use of a specified prior state when insufficient relevant training data exist to predict the occupancy probability of a query point, a property which is attractive for motion planning and exploration applications with mobile robots.}

At the core of the procedure lies the propagation of model parameter uncertainty and initial state uncertainty as high-confidence ellipsoids in pose space. The quadrotor trajectories are then computed to avoid obstacles by a required safety margin, expressed as ellipsoid penetration while minimizing control effort and achieving a user-specified goal location. Combining this technique with online model identification results in robust obstacle avoidance behavior. Experiments in outdoor scenarios with virtual obstacles show that the quadrotor can avoid obstacles robustly, even under the influence of external disturbances.}

  abstract  = {Traditional approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) rely on low-level geometric features such as points, lines, and planes. They are unable to assign semantic labels to landmarks observed in the environment. Furthermore, loop closure recognition based on low-level features is often viewpoint-dependent and subject to failure in ambiguous or repetitive environments. On the other hand, object recognition methods can infer landmark classes and scales, resulting in a small set of easily recognizable landmarks, ideal for view-independent unambiguous loop closure. In a map with several objects of the same class, however, a crucial data association problem exists. While data association and recognition are discrete problems usually solved using discrete inference, classical SLAM is a continuous optimization over metric information. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem over sensor states and semantic landmark positions that integrates metric information, semantic information, and data associations, and decompose it into two interconnected problems: an estimation of discrete data association and landmark class probabilities, and a continuous optimization over the metric states. The estimated landmark and robot poses affect the association and class distributions, which in turn affect the robot-landmark pose optimization. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on indoor and outdoor datasets.}

These correspondences allow the CNNs semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of 25Hz.}

This paper presents several candidate network architectures for doing so. Empirical tests on robot collision prediction and control problems compare the the proposed architectures in terms of learning speed, memory usage, learning capacity, and susceptibility to overfitting.}

In recent years, Lagrangian duality has proved suitable to provide good, frequently tight relaxations of the hard PGO problem through convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP). In this work, we build from the state-ofthe-art Lagrangian relaxation [1] and contribute a complete recovery procedure that, given the (tractable) optimal solution of the relaxation, provides either the optimal MLE solution if the relaxation is tight, or a remarkably good feasible guess if the relaxation is non-tight, which occurs in specially challenging PGO problems (very noisy observations, low graph connectivity, etc.). In the latter case, when used for initialization of local iterative methods, our approach outperforms other state-ofthe-art approaches converging to better solutions.

In this paper, we introduce a novel automated driving strategy that allows automated vehicles to tackle these dilemmas. The key insight behind our automated driving strategy is that expert drivers understand human interactions on the road and comply with mutually-accepted rules, which are learned from countless experiences. In order to teach the driving strategy of expert drivers to automated vehicles, we propose a general learning framework based on maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and Gaussian process. Experiments are conducted on a 5.2 km-long campus road at Seoul National University and demonstrate that our framework performs comparably to expert drivers in planning trajectories to handle various dilemmas.}

It can be formalized as that of finding budgeted routes in a graph such that the reward collected by the route is maximized, where the reward at nodes can be dependent. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-Hard and the state of the art methods are too slow to even present an approximate solution online. Here we present Randomized Anytime Orienteering (RAOr) algorithm that provides near optimal solutions while demonstrably converging to an efficient solution in runtimes that allows the solver to be run online. The key idea of our approach is to pose orienteering as a combination of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and a Traveling Salesman Problem. This formulation allows us to restrict the search space to routes that incur minimum distance to visit a set of selected nodes, and rapidly search this space using random sampling. The paper provides the analysis of asymptotic nearoptimality, convergence rates for RAOr algorithms, and present strategies to improve anytime performance of the algorithm. Our experimental results suggest an improvement by an order of magnitude over the state of the art methods in relevant simulation and in real world scenarios.}

EPC leverages an affine dynamics model that is updated online via Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) to capture nonlinearities, uncertainty, and changes in the system dynamics. This model enables the NMPC problem to be re-cast as a quadratic program (QP). The QP can then be solved via multi-parametric techniques to generate a mapping from state, reference, and dynamics model to a locally optimal, affine feedback control law. These mappings, in conjunction with the basis functions learned via LWPR, define a notion of experience for the controller as they capture the full inputoutput relationship for previous actions the controller has taken. The resulting experience database allows EPC to avoid solving redundant optimization problems, and as it is constructed online, enables the system to operate more efficiently over time. We demonstrate the performance of EPC through a set of hardware-in-the-loop simulation studies of a quadrotor micro air vehicle that is subjected to unmodeled exogenous perturbations.}

The formulation of the photometric residual explicitly accounts for the camera response function and lens vignetting (which can be calibrated in advance), as well as unknown illumination gains and biases, which are estimated on a per-feature or per-image basis. We present a detailed evaluation of our algorithm on 50 datasets with high-precision ground truth, which amount to approximately 1.5 hours of localization data. Through a direct comparison with a pointfeature based method, we demonstrate that the use of photometric residuals results in increased pose estimation accuracy, with approximately 23\% lower estimation errors, on average.}

To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we propose a framework that iterates between a planning component aimed at collecting the most information-rich data, and a sparse Gaussian Process learning component where the environmental model and hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. Our simulations with ground-truth ocean data shows that the proposed method is both accurate and efficient.}

  abstract  = {Robotic systems typically require memory recall mechanisms for a variety of tasks including localization, mapping, planning, visualization etc. We argue for a novel memory recall framework that enables more complex inference schemas by separating the computation from its associated data. In this work we propose a shared, centralized data persistence layer that maintains an ensemble of online, situationally-aware robot states. This is realized through a queryable graph-database with an accompanying key-value store for larger data. In turn, this approach is scalable and enables a multitude of capabilities such as experience-based learning and long-term autonomy. Using multi-modal simultaneous localization and mapping and a few example use-cases, we demonstrate the versatility and extensible nature that centralized persistence and SLAMinDB can provide. In order to support the notion of life-long autonomy, we envision robots to be endowed with such a persistence model, enabling them to revisit previous experiences and improve upon their existing task-specific capabilities.}

RISAS consists of a keypoint detector and a feature descriptor both of which utilise texture and geometric information present in the appearance and shape channels. A novel response function based on the surface normals is used in combination with the Harris corner detector for selecting keypoints in the scene. A strategy that uses the depth information for scale estimation and background elimination is proposed to select the neighbourhood around the keypoints in order to build precise invariant descriptors. Proposed descriptor relies on the ordering of both grayscale intensity and shape information in the neighbourhood. Comprehensive experiments which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed RGB-D feature when compared with CSHOT [1] and LOIND[2] are presented. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of incorporating texture and shape information in the design of both the detector and the descriptor by demonstrating the enhanced performance of CSHOT and LOIND when combined with RISAS detector.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a monocular direct semi-dense SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) method that can handle both radial distortion and rollingshutter distortion. Such distortions are common in, but not restricted to, situations when an inexpensive wide-angle lens and a CMOS sensor are used, and leads to significant inaccuracy in the map and trajectory estimates if not modeled correctly. The apparent naive solution of simply undistorting the images using pre-calibrated parameters does not apply to this case since rows in the undistorted image are no longer captured at the same time. To address this we develop an algorithm that incorporates radial distortion into an existing state-of-theart direct semi-dense SLAM system that takes rolling-shutters into account. We propose a method for finding the generalized epipolar curve for each rolling-shutter radially distorted image. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and compare it favorably with the state-of-the-art in direct semidense rolling-shutter SLAM.}

To this end, we introduce the Cholesky-Schmidt-Kalman filter (C-SKF), which explicitly considers the uncertainty of the prior map, by employing the sparse Cholesky factor of the maps Hessian, instead of its dense covarianceas is the case for the Schmidt-Kalman filter. By doing so, the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as opposed to quadratic for storing the maps covariance. Moreover, and in order to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the size of the map), we introduce two relaxations of the CSKF algorithm: (i) The sC-SKF, which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from dividing the map into overlapping segments. (ii) We formulate an efficient method for sparsifying the Cholesky factor by selecting and processing a subset of loop-closure measurements based on their temporal distribution. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements of the proposed algorithms, and compare their positioning accuracy against other inconsistent mapbased localization approaches that employ measurement-noisecovariance inflation to compensate for the maps uncertainty.}

The problem is heavily characterized by changing environmental conditions throughout the day and across seasons. Robots should be equipped with models that are impervious to these factors in order to be operable and more importantly to ensure safety in the real-world. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture and the convoluted mixture of deep experts (CMoDE) fusion technique that enables a multi-stream deep neural network to learn features from complementary modalities and spectra, each of which are specialized in a subset of the input space. Our model adaptively weighs class-specific features of expert networks based on the scene condition and further learns fused representations to yield robust segmentation. We present results from experimentation on three publicly available datasets that contain diverse conditions including rain, summer, winter, dusk, fall, night and sunset, and show that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art. In addition, we evaluate the performance of autonomously traversing several kilometres of a forested environment using only the segmentation for perception.}

Unlike prior work, we are agnostic to whether the object is textured or textureless, as the convnet learns the optimal representation from the available training image data. Furthermore, the approach can be applied to instance- and class-based pose recovery. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach can accurately recover the 6-DoF object pose for both instanceand class-based scenarios with a cluttered background. For class-based object pose estimation, state-of-the-art accuracy is shown on the large-scale PASCAL3D+ dataset.}

Discovering these configurations through random sampling may require drawing many samples, which becomes a performance bottleneck.

Finding a globally optimal solution is often intractable in practice: despite the existence of fast motion planning algorithms, most are prone to local minima, which may require re-solving the problem multiple times with different initializations. In this work we provide a novel motion planning algorithm, GPMP-GRAPH, that considers a graph-based initialization that simultaneously explores multiple homotopy classes, helping to contend with the local minima problem. Drawing on previous work to represent continuoustime trajectories as samples from a Gaussian process (GP) and formulating the motion planning problem as inference on a factor graph, we construct a graph of interconnected states such that each path through the graph is a valid trajectory and efficient inference can be performed on the collective factor graph. We perform a variety of benchmarks and show that our approach allows the evaluation of an exponential number of trajectories within a fraction of the computational time required to evaluate them one at a time, yielding a more thorough exploration of the solution space and a higher success rate.}

To be specific, with the help of stereo images, we first tackle a relevant but easier task, i.e. free-space detection with well developed unsupervised methods. Then, we transfer these useful but noisy knowledge in depth modality to single RGB modality with self-paced CNN learning. Finally, we only need to finetune the CNN with a few annotated images to get good performance. In addition, we propose an efficient projection CNN, which can improve the fine-grained segmentation results with little additional cost. At last, we test our method on KITTI road benchmark. Our proposed method surpasses all published methods at a speed of 15fps.}

Key to FroDO is to embed object shapes in a novel learnt shape space that allows seamless switching between sparse point cloud and dense DeepSDF decoding. Given an input sequence of localized RGB frames, FroDO first aggregates 2D detections to instantiate a 3D bounding box per object. A shape code is regressed using an encoder network before optimizing shape and pose further under the learnt shape priors using sparse or dense shape representations. The optimization uses multi-view geometric, photometric and silhouette losses. We evaluate on real-world datasets, including Pix3D, Redwood-OS, and ScanNet, for single-view, multi-view, and multi-object reconstruction.},

We use a multiple model fitting approach where each object can move independently from the background and still be effectively tracked and its shape fused over time using only the information from pixels associated with that object label. Previous attempts to deal with dynamic scenes have typically considered moving regions as outliers, and consequently do not model their shape or track their motion over time. In contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in the case of dynamic scenes.}

Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-N ETS predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-N ETS enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks.

Along the path, the MAV explores the greatest unknown area although it sometimes misses minor unreconstructed region, such as a hole or a sparse surface. To cover such a region, we propose an online inspection algorithm that consistently provides an optimal coverage path toward the NBV in real time. The algorithm iteratively refines an inspection path according to the acquired information until the modeling of a specific local area is complete. We evaluated the proposed algorithm by comparing it with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches in both exploration and 3D modeling scenarios.}

In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.}

We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robots perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs can improve the map quality.}

The processing is speeded up by efficiently implemented approximate nearest neighbour fields under the Euclidean distance criterion, which permits the use of compact Gauss-Newton updates in the optimization. The registration is formulated as a maximum a posterior problem to deal with outliers and sensor noise, and the equivalent weighted least squares problem is consequently solved by iteratively reweighted least squares method. A variety of robust weight functions are tested and the optimum is determined based on the probabilistic characteristics of the sensor model. Extensive evaluation on publicly available RGB-D datasets shows that the proposed method predominantly outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods.}

In this work we present a novel tightly-coupled Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system that is able to close loops and reuse its map to achieve zero-drift localization in already mapped areas. While our approach can be applied to any camera configuration, we address here the most general problem of a monocular camera, with its well-known scale ambiguity. We also propose a novel IMU initialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the velocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high accuracy. We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial vehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of 1\% and centimeter precision. We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our method due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.

Cutting the peduncle cleanly is one of the most difficult stages of the harvesting process, where the peduncle is the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant. Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers. We release a set of manually annotated 3D sweet pepper and peduncle images to assist the research community in performing further research on this topic.}

A probabilistic, volumetric method for determining the optimal next best view is developed based on a partial model of a 3D object of unknown shape and size.

In this paper we consider the path planning problem for mobile robots with adjustable relative wheel positions, which further increase the navigation capabilities.

Whereas these additional degrees of freedom increase flexibility, they introduce a more challenging planning problem. The approach proposed in this paper is built upon a search-based planner. We describe how to flexibly integrate joint angle changes in the path planning process and furthermore propose a representation of the robot configuration that substantially reduces the computational burden. In addition, we introduce search guidance heuristics that are particularly useful in environments in which a robot is required to pass over obstacles, such as on agricultural fields. An extensive evaluation on simulated and real-world data with our BoniRob agricultural robot demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.}

  abstract  = {This paper describes a fruit counting pipeline based on deep learning that accurately counts fruit in unstructured environments. Obtaining reliable fruit counts is challenging because of variations in appearance due to illumination changes and occlusions from foliage and neighboring fruits. We propose a novel approach that uses deep learning to map from input images to total fruit counts. The pipeline utilizes a custom crowd-sourcing platform to quickly label large data sets. A blob detector based on a fully convolutional network extracts candidate regions in the images. A counting algorithm based on a second convolutional network then estimates the number of fruit in each region. Finally, a linear regression model maps that fruit count estimate to a final fruit count. We analyze the performance of the pipeline on two distinct data sets of oranges in daylight, and green apples at night, utilizing human generated labels as ground truth. We also show that the pipeline has a short training time and performs well with a limited data set size. Our method generalizes across both data sets and is able to perform well even on highly occluded fruits that are challenging for human labelers to annotate.}

  keywords  = {Localization, Recognition, SLAM},
  abstract  = {We address in this paper the problem of loop closure detection for laser-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of very large areas. Consistent with the state of the art, the map is encoded as a graph of poses, and to cope with very large mapping capabilities, loop closures are asserted by comparing the features extracted from a query laser scan against a previously acquired corpus of scan features using a bag-of-words (BoW) scheme. Two contributions are here presented. First, to benefit from the graph topology, feature frequency scores in the BoW are computed not only for each individual scan but also from neighboring scans in the SLAM graph. This has the effect of enforcing neighbor relational information during document matching. Secondly, a weak geometric check that takes into account feature ordering and occlusions is introduced that substantially improves loop closure detection performance. The two contributions are evaluated both separately and jointly on four common SLAM datasets, and are shown to improve the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of precision and recall in most of the cases. Moreover, our current implementation is designed to work at nearly frame rate, allowing loop closure query resolution at nearly 22 Hz for the best case scenario and 2 Hz for the worst case scenario.}

In this paper, we train, at large scale, two CNN architectures for the specific place recognition task and employ a multi-scale feature encoding method to generate condition- and viewpoint-invariant features. To enable this training to occur, we have developed a massive Specific PlacEs Dataset (SPED) with hundreds of examples of place appearance change at thousands of different places, as opposed to the semantic place type datasets currently available. This new dataset enables us to set up a training regime that interprets place recognition as a classification problem. We comprehensively evaluate our trained networks on several challenging benchmark place recognition datasets and demonstrate that they achieve an average 10\% increase in performance over other place recognition algorithms and pre-trained CNNs. By analyzing the network responses and their differences from pre-trained networks, we provide insights into what a network learns when training for place recognition, and what these results signify for future research in this area.}

This provides state-of-the-art performance but at the cost of high computational complexity resulting in a low frame rate of just 0.12 frames per second (fps). Second, we use the adapted model and employ model compression techniques to learn a lightweight DCNN that is less accurate but has two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Third, K lightweight models are combined as a mixture model to further enhance the performance of the lightweight models. Applied to the challenging task of weed segmentation, we improve accuracy from 85.9\%, using a traditional approach, to 93.9\% by adapting a complicated pre-trained DCNN with 25M parameters (Inception-v3). The downside to this adapted model, Adapted-IV3, is that it can only process 0.12fps. To make this approach fast while still retaining accuracy, we learn lightweight DCNNs which when combined can achieve accuracy greater than 90\% while using considerably fewer parameters capable of processing between 1.07 and 1.83 frames per second, up to an order of magnitude faster and up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.}

We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robots perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs can improve the map quality.}

In this work we present a novel tightly-coupled Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system that is able to close loops and reuse its map to achieve zero-drift localization in already mapped areas. While our approach can be applied to any camera configuration, we address here the most general problem of a monocular camera, with its well-known scale ambiguity. We also propose a novel IMU initialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the velocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high accuracy. We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial vehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of 1\% and centimeter precision. We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our method due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.

Cutting the peduncle cleanly is one of the most difficult stages of the harvesting process, where the peduncle is the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant. Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers. We release a set of manually annotated 3D sweet pepper and peduncle images to assist the research community in performing further research on this topic.}

Correspondence estimation has long been the domain of hand-engineered features, but more recently deep learning techniques have provided powerful tools for learning features from raw data. The drawback of the latter approach is that a vast amount of (labelled, typically) training data is required for learning. This paper advocates a new approach to learning visual descriptors for dense correspondence estimation in which we harness the power of a strong 3D generative model to automatically label correspondences in RGB-D video data. A fully-convolutional network is trained using a contrastive loss to produce viewpoint- and lighting-invariant descriptors. As a proof of concept, we collected two datasets: the first depicts the upper torso and head of the same person in widely varied settings, and the second depicts an office as seen on multiple days with objects re-arranged within. Our datasets focus on re-visitation of the same objects and environments, and we show that by training the CNN only from local tracking data, our learned visual descriptor generalizes towards identifying non-labelled correspondences across videos. We furthermore show that our approach to descriptor learning can be used to achieve state-of-the-art single-frame localization results on the MSR 7-scenes dataset without using any labels identifying correspondences between separate videos of the same scenes at training time.}

In this paper, we present a system for robot navigation that is able to exploit the previous experiences of the robot for providing predictable behaviors that meet user preferences. User preferences are implicitly extracted from robot experiences without requiring experts to hard-code rules and automatically considered to plan paths for the successive tasks. We introduce a probabilistic approach to model the highly uncertain trajectories of the moving individuals that populate factory floors that allows to avoid them behaving according to user preferences. We thoroughly tested our system both in simulation and on an real KUKA mobile robot.

Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical application such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state-of-the-art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, our characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels. In this paper, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show that inconsistencies in object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used to identify false negatives(e.g. missed detections). In particular, we study two distinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data that is readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we evaluate the technique on several sets of real world data. The proposed method achieves over 97\% precision in automatically identifying missed detections produced by one of the leading state-of-the-art object detectors in the literature. We also release a new tracking dataset with over 100 sequences totaling more than 80,000 labeled images from a game engine to facilitate further research. }

  abstract = {The ability to extract individual objects in the scene is key for a large number of autonomous navigation systems such as mobile robots or autonomous cars. Such systems navigating in dynamic environments need to be aware of objects that may change or move. In most perception cues, a pre-segmentation of the current image or laser scan into individual objects is the first processing step before a further analysis is performed. In this paper, we present an effective method that first removes the ground from the scan and then segments the 3D data in a range image representation into different objects. A key focus of our work is a fast execution with several hundred Hertz. Our implementation has small computational demands so that it can run online on most mobile systems. We explicitly avoid the computation of the 3D point cloud and operate directly on a 2.5D range image, which enables a fast segmentation for each 3D scan. This approach can furthermore handle sparse 3D data well, which is important for scanners such as the new Velodyne VLP-16 scanner. We implemented our approach in C++ and ROS, thoroughly tested it using different 3D scanners, and will release the source code of our implementation. Our method can operate at frame rates that are substantially higher than those of the sensors while using only a single core of a mobile CPU and producing high-quality segmentation results.},

Second, we analyze the quality loss compared to the optimal bundle adjustment solution when applying different types of approximations to the constrained optimization problem to increase efficiency. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our approach using a UAV performing mapping tasks in outdoor environments.

  abstract  = {Robotic lawn-mowers are required to stay within a predefined working area, otherwise they may drive into a pond or on the street. This turns navigation and path planning into safety critical components. If we consider using SLAM techniques in that context, we must be able to provide safety guarantees in the presence of sensor/actuator noise and featureless areas in the environment. In this paper, we tackle the problem of planning a path that maximizes robot safety while navigating inside the working area and under the constraints of limited computing resources and cheap sensors. Our approach uses a map of the environment to estimate localizability at all locations, and it uses these estimates to search for a path from start to goal in belief space using an extended heuristic search algorithm. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on simulation data recorded on eight different gardens, as well as on a real robot. The experiments presented in this paper show that our approach leads to short computation times and short paths while maximizing robot safety under certain assumptions.},

Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.}

  abstract  = {Many computer vision problems are formulated as the optimization of a cost function. This approach faces two main challenges: (1) designing a cost function with a local optimum at an acceptable solution, and (2) developing an efficient numerical method to search for one (or multiple) of these local optima. While designing such functions is feasible in the noiseless case, the stability and location of local optima are mostly unknown under noise, occlusion, or missing data. In practice, this can result in undesirable local optima or not having a local optimum in the expected place. On the other hand, numerical optimization algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are typically local and often rely on expensive first or second order information to guide the search. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Discriminative Optimization (DO), a method that learns search directions from data without the need of a cost function. Specifically, DO explicitly learns a sequence of updates in the search space that leads to stationary points that correspond to desired solutions. We provide a formal analysis of DO and illustrate its benefits in the problem of 2D and 3D point cloud registration both in synthetic and range-scan data. We show that DO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin in terms of accuracy, robustness to perturbations, and computational efficiency.},

Our method computes optimized six-dimensional trajectories compliant with curvature and continuity constraints directly on unordered point cloud maps, omitting any kind of explicit surface reconstruction, discretization, or topology extraction. We assess terrain geometry and traversability on demand during motion planning, by fitting robot-sized planar patches to the map and analyzing the local distribution of map points. Our motion planning approach consists of sampling-based initial trajectory generation, followed by precise local optimization according to a custom cost measure, using a novel, constraint-aware trajectory optimization paradigm. We embed these methods in a complete autonomous navigation system based on localization and mapping by means of a 3D laser scanner and iterative closest point matching, suitable for both static and dynamic environments. The performance of the planning and terrain assessment algorithms is evaluated in offline experiments using recorded and simulated sensor data. Finally, we present the results of navigation experiments in three different environments—rough outdoor terrain, a two-level parking garage, and a dynamic environment, demonstrating how the proposed methods enable autonomous navigation in complex 3D terrain.}

It remains a major challenge when using automotive sensors such as single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, a lane detection camera, and proprioceptive sensors. This paper describes a method that enables the estimation of stand-alone single-frequency GNSS errors by integrating the measurements from a forward-looking camera matched with lane markings stored in a digital map. It includes a parameter identification method for a shaping model, which is evaluated using experimental data. An algebraic observability study is then conducted to prove that the proposed state vector is fully observable in a road-oriented frame. This observability property is the basis to develop a road-centered Extended Kalman filter (EKF) that can maintain the observability of every component of the state vector on any road, whatever its orientation. To accomplish this, the filter needs to handle road changes, which it does using bijective transformations. The filter was implemented and tested intensely on an experimental vehicle for driverless valet parking services. Field results have shown that the performance of the estimation process is better than solutions based on EKF implemented in a fixed working frame. The proposed filter guarantees that the drift along the road direction remains bounded. This is very important when the vehicle navigates autonomously. Furthermore, the road-centered modeling improves the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of the localization solver.}

Making a large fleet of autonomous robots economical requires the use of inexpensive sensors, such as cameras for localization and obstacle avoidance. To this end, we describe a vision-based obstacle detection system that continually adapts to environmental and illumination variations and a visionassisted localization system that can guide a robot along crop rows with a complex appearance. Large fleets of robots will become time-consuming to monitor, control, and resupply. To reduce this burden, we describe a vision-based docking system for autonomously refilling liquid supplies and an interface for controlling multiple robots.},

We propose a branch-and-bound technique that deterministically and globally optimizes the objective. Unlike what is available in the literature, the proposed method is not heuristic and does not require assumptions such as constraints on the background or relying on discontinuity of the range measurements to partition the data into line segments. The proposed approach is generic and can be applied to both 3D or 2D laser scanners as well as the cases where multiple checkerboards are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by providing numerical simulations as well as experimental results.}

This introduces challenges for learning-based approaches, as 3D object annotations are scarce in real images. Previous work chose to train on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information, but suffered from domain adaptation when tested on real data. In this work, we propose MarrNet, an end-to-end trainable model that sequentially estimates 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape. Our disentangled, two-step formula- tion has three advantages. First, compared to full 3D shape, 2.5D sketches are much easier to be recovered from a 2D image; models that recover 2.5D sketches are also more likely to transfer from synthetic to real data. Second, for 3D reconstruction from 2.5D sketches, systems can learn purely from synthetic data. This is because we can easily render realistic 2.5D sketches without modeling object appearance variations in real images, including lighting, texture, etc. This further relieves the domain adaptation problem. Third, we derive differentiable projective functions from 3D shape to 2.5D sketches; the framework is therefore end-to-end trainable on real images, requiring no human annotations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape reconstruction.}

In this paper we propose a 3D graph neural network (3DGNN) that builds a k-nearest neighbor graph on top of 3D point cloud. Each node in the graph corresponds to a set of points and is associated with a hidden representation vector initialized with an appearance feature extracted by a unary CNN from 2D images. Relying on recurrent functions, every node dynamically updates its hidden representation based on the current status and incoming messages from its neighbors. This propagation model is unrolled for a certain number of time steps and the final per-node representation is used for predicting the semantic class of each pixel. We use back-propagation through time to train the model. Extensive experiments on NYUD2 and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.},

  abstract = {While object recognition on 2D images is getting more and more mature, 3D understanding is eagerly in demand yet largely underexplored. In this paper, we study the 3D object detection problem from RGB-D data captured by depth sensors in both indoor and outdoor environments. Different from previous deep learning methods that work on 2D RGB-D images or 3D voxels, which often obscure natural 3D patterns and invariances of 3D data, we directly operate on raw point clouds by popping up RGB-D scans. Although recent works such as PointNet performs well for segmentation in small-scale point clouds, one key challenge is how to efficiently detect objects in large-scale scenes. Leveraging the wisdom of dimension reduction and mature 2D object detectors, we develop a Frustum PointNet framework that addresses the challenge. Evaluated on KITTI and SUN RGB-D 3D detection benchmarks, our method outperforms state of the arts by remarkable margins with high efficiency (running at 5 fps).},

However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.},

  abstract  = {In multi-class indoor semantic segmentation using RGB-D data, it has been shown that incorporating depth feature into RGB feature is helpful to improve segmentation accuracy. However, previous studies have not fully exploited the potentials of multi-modal feature fusion, e.g., simply concatenating RGB and depth features or averaging RGB and depth score maps. To learn the optimal fusion of multi-modal features, this paper presents a novel network that extends the core idea of residual learning to RGB-D semantic segmentation. Our network effectively captures multi-level RGB-D CNN features by including multi-modal feature fusion blocks and multi-level feature refinement blocks. Feature fusion blocks learn residual RGB and depth features and their combinations to fully exploit the complementary characteristics of RGB and depth data. Feature refinement blocks learn the combination of fused features from multiple levels to enable high-resolution prediction. Our network can efficiently train discriminative multi-level features from each modality end-to-end by taking full advantage of skip-connections. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging RGB-D indoor datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN RGB-D.},

To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.}

Using only limited hardware that can be carried on a MAV, we achieve accurate pose estimation at rates above 50 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art meshbased localization algorithms. In our simultaneous tracking and rendering (STAR) approach, we render virtual images of the environment and track camera images with respect to them using a robust semi-direct image alignment technique. Our main contribution is the decoupling of camera tracking from virtual image rendering, which drastically reduces the number of rendered images and enables accurate full camerarate tracking without needing a high-end GPU. We demonstrate our approach in GPS-denied indoor environments.}

To tackle this problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, we check if the current map is consistent using a statistical test. If the map is consistent, we navigate the robot back to its starting location using a standard navigation system. In case of an inconsistent map, however, we propose to rewind the trajectory from the current location to the start without relying on a map. We implemented the proposed system in ROS and showcase its effectiveness on an autonomous exploration robot in real underground and office environments.},

  abstract  = {Positioning and mapping can be conducted accurately by state-of-the-art state estimation methods. However, reliability of these methods is largely based on avoiding degeneracy that can arise from cases such as scarcity of texture features for vision sensors and lack of geometrical structures for range sensors. Since the problems are inevitably solved in uncontrived environments where sensors cannot function with their highest quality, it is important for the estimation methods to be robust to degeneracy. This paper proposes an online method to mitigate for degeneracy in optimizationbased problems, through analysis of geometric structure of the problem constraints. The method determines and separates degenerate directions in the state space, and only partially solves the problem in well-conditioned directions. We demonstrate utility of this method with data from a camera and lidar sensor pack to estimate 6-DOF ego-motion. Experimental results show that the system is able to improve estimation in environmentally degenerate cases, resulting in enhanced robustness for online positioning and mapping.}

  abstract  = {The feature-based graphical approach to robotic mapping provides a representationally rich and computationally efficient framework for an autonomous agent to learn a model of its environment. However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, everything changes and nothing stands still, and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a flexible, computationally efficient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for lifelong environmental modeling in an ever-changing world.}

This allows us to exploit the complementary nature of vision and inertial data. At the same time, and in contrast to all existing visual-inertial methods, our approach is fully direct: geometry is estimated in the form of semi-dense depth maps instead of manually designed sparse keypoints. Depth information is obtained both from static stereo relating the fixed-baseline images of the stereo camera and temporal stereo relating images from the same camera, taken at different points in time. We show that our method outperforms not only vision-only or loosely coupled approaches, but also can achieve more accurate results than state-of-the-art keypoint-based methods on different datasets, including rapid motion and significant illumination changes. In addition, our method provides high-fidelity semi-dense, metric reconstructions of the environment, and runs in real-time on a CPU.}

We then derive information-theoretic measures under this model that predict the amount of visual information gain at an unobserved location based on the bathymetric features. Unlike previous approaches, these measures consider the value of additional visual features, rather than just the habitat labels obtained. Experimental results with a toy dataset and real marine data demonstrate that the approach can be used to predict the true utility of unexplored areas.}

  abstract  = {Some robots must repeatedly interact with a fixed set of objects in their environment. To operate correctly, it is helpful for the robot to be able to recognize the object instances that it repeatedly encounters. However, current methods for recognizing object instances require that, during training, many pictures are taken of each object from a large number of viewing angles. This procedure is slow and requires much manual effort before the robot can begin to operate in a new environment. We have developed a novel procedure for training a neural network to recognize a set of objects from just a single training image per object. To obtain robustness to changes in viewpoint, we take advantage of a supplementary dataset in which we observe a separate (non-overlapping) set of objects from multiple viewpoints. After pre-training the network in a novel multi-stage fashion, the network can robustly recognize new object instances given just a single training image of each object. If more images of each object are available, the performance improves. We perform a thorough analysis comparing our novel training procedure to traditional neural network pre-training techniques as well as previous stateof-the-art approaches including keypoint-matching, templatematching, and sparse coding, and we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms these previous approaches. Our method can thus be used to easily teach a robot to recognize a novel set of object instances from unknown viewpoints.}

The closest line segment pairs are identified in two sets of line segments obtained from two consequent Velodyne scans. From each pair of correspondences, a transformation aligning the matched line segments into a 3D plane is estimated. By this, significant planes (ground, walls, . . . ) are preserved among aligned point clouds. Evaluation using the KITTI dataset shows that our method outperforms publicly available and commonly used state-of-the-art method GICP for point cloud registration in both accuracy and speed, especially in cases where the scene lacks significant landmarks or in typical urban elements. For such environments, the registration error of our method is reduced by 75\% compared to the original GICP error.}

High-texture image regions are represented at higher resolutions to capture fine detail, while low-texture regions are represented at coarser resolutions for smooth surfaces. The computational savings enabled by this approach allow for significantly increased reconstruction density and quality when compared to the state-ofthe-art. The increased depthmap density also improves tracking performance as more constraints can contribute to the pose estimation.

Starting from 3D line segments and poses obtained via Line-SLAM, we project segments from multiple frames into keyframes for image-space analysis. For each keyframe, a grid of image faces is created by optimized intersection of the segment projection lines. These faces define a segment adjacency graph, wherein we perform our Breadth-First Plane Search (BFPS). The found plane hypotheses are merged maximally with respect to a structure-preserving criterion by growing coplanar regions across the graph. Hypotheses violating the visibility constraint are discarded based on fast per-face and mostly nongeometrical evaluation of the scene and image graph. Finally, each image face gets back-projected onto an optimal plane to obtain a 3D surface model. The presented system is a complete and automatic solution suitable for mapping an environment in real-time scenarios like robotic exploration. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several indoor scenes of varying complexity. Compared to a pure 3D analysis of segments, we see a speed-up by one to almost two orders of magnitude, while still improving on reconstruction accuracy.}

In particular, this work presents the augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC) algorithm for solving a constrained dictionary learning problem, and shows that the proposed method would converge to a local optimum given a convexity condition. We consider a trajectory modeling application, in which the learned dictionary atoms correspond to local motion patterns. Classical semi-nonnegative sparse coding approaches would add dictionary atoms with opposite signs to reduce the representational error, which can lead to learning noisy dictionary atoms that correspond poorly to local motion patterns. ASNSC addresses this problem and learns a concise set of intuitive motion patterns. ASNSC shows significant improvement over existing trajectory modeling methods in both prediction accuracy and computational time, as revealed by extensive numerical analysis on real datasets.}

LQG-MP provides the capability of considering the role of compensator in the motion planning phase and bounds the degree of uncertainty to appropriate size.

  abstract  = {Robots for precision farming have the potential to reduce the reliance on herbicides and pesticides through selectively spraying individual plants or through manual weed removal. To achieve this, the value crops and the weeds must be identified by the robots perception system to trigger the actuators for spraying or removal. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the sugar beet plants as well as weeds using a camera installed on a mobile robot operating on a field. We propose a system that performs vegetation detection, feature extraction, random forest classification, and smoothing through a Markov random field to obtain an accurate estimate of the crops and weeds. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our system on a real farm robot on different sugar beet fields and illustrate that our approach allows for accurately identifying the weed on the field.},

  keywords  = {Intelligent Transportation Systems, Motion and Path Planning},
  abstract  = {We present a method for compressing trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Given a set of trajectories sampled from a space we construct a basis for compression whose elements correspond to paths in the space which are topologically distinct. This is achieved by computing a canonical representative for each element in a generating set for the first homology group and decomposing these representatives into a set of distinct paths. Trajectory compression is subsequently accomplished through representation in terms of this basis. Robustness with respect to outliers is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist in the super-level sets of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) above a threshold. Robustness with respect to small scale topological artifacts is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist for a sufficient range in the super-level sets. We demonstrate this approach to trajectory compression in the context of a large set of crowd-sourced GPS trajectories captured in the city of Chicago. On this set, the compression method achieves a mean geometrical accuracy of 108 meters with a compression ratio of over 12.}

  abstract  = {We present an integrated approach for perception of unknown articulated objects. To robustly perceive objects and understand interactions, our method tightly integrates pose tracking, shape reconstruction, and the estimation of their kinematic structure. The key insight of our method is that these sub-problems complement each other: for example, tracking is greatly facilitated by knowing the shape of the object, whereas the shape and the kinematic structure can be more easily reconstructed if the motion of the object is known. Our combined method leverages these synergies to improve the performance of perception. We analyze the proposed method in average cases and difficult scenarios using a variety of rigid and articulated objects. The results show that our integrated solution achieves better results than solutions for the individual problems. This demonstrates the benefits of approaching robot perception problems in an integrated manner.}

The major problems here are the non-uniform occurence of class instances and the unbalanced numbers of samples per class. We show that standard online learning methods based on decision trees perform comparably bad for such data streams, which are however particularly relevant for mobile robots that need to learn semantics persistently. To address this, we use Mondrian forests (MF), a recent online learning algorithm that is independent on the data order. We present an extension of that algorithm and show that MF are less overconfident than standard Random Forests. In experiments on the KITTI benchmark, we show that this leads to a substantially improved classification performance for data streams, rendering our approach very attractive for lifelong robot learning applications. Fig. 1. Example situation from the KITTI benchmark data set with a car, a cyclist and some pedestrians. The 3D point cloud data of this frame was classified after actively learning semantics from a stream of 10 000 previous samples. The bottom left image shows the result from actively learning an online Random Forest classifier, the right one shows the result using a modified Mondrian forest instead. A green bounding box refers to a correct classification, while red boxes are wrong predictions. As we show in this paper, the better performance of Mondrian forests comes from their higher capability to learn from streams of data.}

We present an approach to image matching using semantic information that is invariant to seasonal change. This semantics-based matching is incorporated into a particle filter framework and successful localization of the ground vehicle is demonstrated for satellite maps captured in summer, spring, and winter.}

  abstract  = {An accurate estimate of the 3D-structure in the environment is key to robotic applications such as autonomous inspection, obstacle avoidance and manipulation. Recent years have seen substantial algorithmic advances towards creating highly accurate models of small objects as well as large scale architectural structures. Most commonly a rich set of images covering a static scene are used to jointly estimate the pose of the cameras and the observed 3D-structure. For many practical application however the assumption of static scenes and sufficient coverage by images does not hold. In fact for industrial inspection the change in the scene is of most interest and the limited resources on mobile platforms dont allow for extensive data captures. In this paper we investigate the potential of combining multiple independent captures of a place to selectively reconstruct a scene over time. We propose an incremental reconstruction algorithm which identifies and fuses novel data into a joint model of the scene. Being able to identify changing parts of the scene is particularly interesting for mobile applications where bandwidth, storage and processing power are limited. Through detailed experiments, we show the potential of our approach to use multiple mobile devices to reconstruct and update a model of the static part of the environment over time.}

  abstract  = {Place recognition is a core component in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), limiting positional drift over space and time to unlock precise robot navigation. Determining which previously visited places belong together continues to be a highly active area of research as robotic applications demand increasingly higher accuracies. A large number of place recognition algorithms have been proposed, capable of consuming a variety of sensor data including laser, sonar and depth readings. The best performing solutions, however, have utilized visual information by either matching entire images or parts thereof. Most commonly, vision based approaches are inspired by information retrieval and utilize 3D-geometry information about the observed scene as a postverification step. In this paper we propose to use the 3D-scene information from sparse-visual feature maps directly at the core of the place recognition pipeline. We propose a novel structural descriptor which aggregates sparse triangulated landmarks from SLAM into a compact signature. The resulting 3Dfeatures provide a discriminative fingerprint to recognize places over seasonal and viewpoint changes which are particularly challenging for approaches based on sparse visual descriptors. We evaluate our system on publicly available datasets and show how its complementary nature can provide an improvement over visual place recognition.}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to motion planning using Gaussian processes. In contrast to most existing trajectory optimization algorithms, which rely on a discrete state parameterization in practice, we represent the continuous-time trajectory as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP) generated by a linear time-varying stochastic differential equation. We then provide a gradientbased optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states. We benchmark our algorithm against recent trajectory optimization algorithms by solving 7-DOF robotic arm planning problems in simulation and validate our approach on a real 7-DOF WAM arm.}

  keywords  = {Computational Geometry, Motion and Path Planning, Learning and Adaptive Systems},
  abstract  = {Cloud Robotics techniques based on Learning from Demonstrations suggest promising alternatives to manual programming of robots and autonomous vehicles. One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Frechet distance.}

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual features online for improving loopclosure detection and place recognition, based on bag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in the bagof-words model from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporallyderived perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original features. A codeword is generated by packaging the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime.}

  abstract  = {Most approaches to stereo visual odometry reconstruct the motion based on the tracking of point features along a sequence of images. However, in low-textured scenes it is often difficult to encounter a large set of point features, or it may happen that they are not well distributed over the image, so that the behavior of these algorithms deteriorates. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to stereo visual odometry based on the combination of both point and line segment that works robustly in a wide variety of scenarios. The camera motion is recovered through non-linear minimization of the projection errors of both point and line segment features. In order to effectively combine both types of features, their associated errors are weighted according to their covariance matrices, computed from the propagation of Gaussian distribution errors in the sensor measurements. The method, of course, is computationally more expensive that using only one type of feature, but still can run in real-time on a standard computer and provides interesting advantages, including a straightforward integration into any probabilistic framework commonly employed in mobile robotics.}

The proposed depth edge-detection approach uses prior information obtained from the previous RGB-D video frame to determine which areas of the current depth image are likely to contain edges due to image similarity. By limiting the search for edges to these areas a significant amount of computation time is saved compared to searching the entire image. Pixels belonging to both the depth and colour edges of an RGB-D image can be back projected using the depth component to form 3D point clouds of edge points. Registration between such edge point clouds is achieved using ICP and we present a realtime RGB-D SLAM system utilizing such back projected edge features. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the performance of both the proposed depth edge-detection and SLAM system using publicly available datasets.}

For every scanned point we formulate the range flow constraint equation in terms of the sensor velocity, and minimize a robust function of the resulting geometric constraints to obtain the motion estimate. Conversely to traditional approaches, this method does not search for correspondences but performs dense scan alignment based on the scan gradients, in the fashion of dense 3D visual odometry. The minimization problem is solved in a coarse-to-fine scheme to cope with large displacements, and a smooth filter based on the covariance of the estimate is employed to handle uncertainty in unconstraint scenarios (e.g. corridors). Simulated and real experiments have been performed to compare our approach with two prominent scan matchers and with wheel odometry. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach which, along with its very low computational cost (0.9 milliseconds on a single CPU core), makes it suitable for those robotic applications that require planar odometry. For this purpose, we also provide the code so that the robotics community can benefit from it.}

While early versions employed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the major manufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placed beacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visual sensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or only providing a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beacon placement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present a passive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at night that combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolution contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in two-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventional low light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn and in a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2D localization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varying odometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length. Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it can enable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonless sky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply all conventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights.}

We address this task by proposing a convolutional neural network architecture. We are especially interested in a model that takes advantage of a large contextual window while maintaining a fast inference. We achieve this by using a Network-in-Network (NiN) architecture and by converting the model into a fully convolutional network after training. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effects of different contextual window sizes (the amount of contextual information) and also to evaluate the NiN aspect of the proposed architecture. Finally, we evaluated our approach using the KITTI road detection benchmark achieving results in line with other state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time inference. The benchmark results also reveal that the inference time of our approach is unique at this level of accuracy, being two orders of magnitude faster than other methods with similar performance.}

Identifying obstacles such as walls is essential for robot navigation, but also challenging due to the diversity in structure, appearance and illumination of real-world corridor scenes. Many current single-image methods make Manhattanworld assumptions, and break down in environments that do not meet this mold. They also may require complicated handdesigned features for image segmentation or clear boundaries to form certain building models. In addition, most cannot run in real time. In this paper, we propose to combine machine learning with geometric modelling to build a simplified 3D model from a single image. We first employ a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to provide a dense, but coarse, geometric class labelling of the scene. We then refine this labelling with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Finally, we fit line segments along wall-ground boundaries and pop up a 3D model using geometric constraints. We assemble a dataset of 967 labelled corridor images. Our experiments on this dataset and another publicly available dataset show our method outperforms other single image scene understanding methods in pixelwise accuracy while labelling images at over 15 Hz.}

  abstract  = {Spatio-temporal cues offer a rich source of information for inferring structural and semantic scene properties. A particularly useful representation in computer vision is a spatiotemporal video segmentation. Together with motion, knowledge of depth can substantially improve superpixel segmentation. In this work we present a novel framework for spatio-temporal segmentation from RGBD video. The method employs both low-level (intensity, color) and high-level (deformable parts model) appearance features. Motion is incorporated through the use of optical flow to construct the temporal connections in the graph Laplacian. Depth cues are incorporated in the similarity metric to provide an informative cue for object boundaries at depth disparities. Nave application of spectral clustering to dense spatio-temporal graphs leads to a high computational cost that is typically addressed through the use of GPUs or computer clusters. By contrast, we build upon a recently proposed Nystrom approximation strategy for spatiotemporal clustering that enables computation on a single core. We further explore structured local connectivity patterns to give high performance at low computational cost. Also we propose a novel context-aware aggregation method that uses a deformable parts model to group the detected parts of the object as a single segment with an accurate boundary. Detailed experiments on the NYU Depth Dataset and TUM RGBD Dataset is performed to compare against previous large-scale graph-based spatiotemporal segmentation techniques which shows the substantial performance advantages of our framework.}

  abstract  = {Structured light range sensors (SLRS) like the Microsoft Kinect have electronic rolling shutters (ERS). The output of such a sensor while in motion is subject to significant motion blur (MB) and rolling shutter (RS) distortion. Most robotic literature still does not explicitly model this distortion, resulting in inaccurate camera motion estimation. In RGBD cameras, we show via experimentation that the distortion undergone by depth images is different from that of color images and provide a mathematical model for it. We propose an algorithm that rectifies for these RS and MB distortions. To assess the performance of the algorithm we conduct an extensive set of experiments for each step of the pipeline. We assess the performance of our algorithm by comparing the performance of the rectified images on scene-flow and camera pose estimation, and show that with our proposed rectification, the performance improvement is significant.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, we explore various aspects of fusing LIDAR and color imagery for pedestrian detection in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have recently become state-of-art for many vision problems. We incorporate LIDAR by up-sampling the point cloud to a dense depth map and then extracting three features representing different aspects of the 3D scene. We then use those features as extra image channels. Specifically, we leverage recent work on HHA [9] (horizontal disparity, height above ground, and angle) representations, adapting the code to work on up-sampled LIDAR rather than Microsoft Kinect depth maps. We show, for the first time, that such a representation is applicable to up-sampled LIDAR data, despite its sparsity. Since CNNs learn a deep hierarchy of feature representations, we then explore the question: At what level of representation should we fuse this additional information with the original RGB image channels? We use the KITTI pedestrian detection dataset for our exploration. We first replicate the finding that region-CNNs (R-CNNs) [8] can outperform the original proposal mechanism using only RGB images, but only if fine-tuning is employed. Then, we show that: 1) using HHA features and RGB images performs better than RGB-only, even without any fine-tuning using large RGB web data, 2) fusing RGB and HHA achieves the strongest results if done late, but, under a parameter or computational budget, is best done at the early to middle layers of the hierarchical representation, which tend to represent midlevel features rather than low (e.g. edges) or high (e.g. object class decision) level features, 3) some of the less successful methods have the most parameters, indicating that increased classification accuracy is not simply a function of increased capacity in the neural network.}

  keywords  = {Motion and Path Planning, Optimization and Optimal Control, Aerial Robotics},
  abstract  = {Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum. Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.}

The processing is split in three threads. The first thread runs at frame rate and estimates the camera motion by a joint non-linear optimization from visual and inertial data given a semidense map. The second one creates a semidense map of high-gradient areas only for camera tracking purposes. Finally, the third thread estimates a fully dense reconstruction of the scene at a lower frame rate. We have evaluated our algorithm in several real sequences with ground truth trajectory data, showing a state-of-the-art performance.}

We leverage the uncertainty measure to estimate metric relocalization error and to detect the presence or absence of the scene in the input image. We show that the models uncertainty is caused by images being dissimilar to the training dataset in either pose or appearance.}

In this paper, we propose an alternative to traditional point-features: we train place-specific linear SVM classifiers to recognise distinctive elements in the environment. The core contribution of this paper is an unsupervised mining algorithm which operates on a single mapping dataset to extract distinct elements from the environment for localisation. We evaluate our system on 205 km of data collected from central Oxford over a period of six months in bright sun, night, rain, snow and at all times of the day. Our experiment consists of a comprehensive N-vs-N analysis on 22 laps of the approximately 10 km route in central Oxford. With our proposed system, the portion of the route where localisation fails is reduced by a factor of 6, from 33.3\% to 5.5\%.}

Specifically, in the context of scene understanding for roads, 3D vehicle detection and tracking from monocular videos still needs a lot of attention to enable practical applications. Current approaches leverage two kinds of information to deal with the vehicle detection and tracking problem: (1) 3D representations (eg. wireframe models or voxel based or CAD models) for diverse vehicle skeletal structures learnt from data, and (2) classifiers trained to detect vehicles or vehicle parts in single images built on top of a basic feature extraction step. In this paper, we propose to extend current approaches in two ways. First, we extend detection to a multiple view setting. We show that leveraging information given by feature or part detectors in multiple images can lead to more accurate detection results than single image detection. Secondly, we show that given multiple images of a vehicle, we can also leverage 3D information from the scene generated using a unique structure from motion algorithm. This helps us localize the vehicle in 3D, and constrain the parameters of optimization for fitting the 3D model to image data. We show results on the KITTI dataset, and demonstrate superior results compared with recent state-of-theart methods, with upto 14.64 \% improvement in localization error.}

Based on this understanding we compare local binary descriptors in terms of the number of bits that are required to achieve a certain performance in feature-based matching problems. Furthermore, we introduce a calibration method to automatically determine a suitable number of bits required in an image matching scenario. We provide a performance analysis in image matching and structure from motion benchmarks, showing calibration results in visual odometry and object recognition problems. Our results show that excellent performance can be achieved using a small fraction of the total number of bits from the whole descriptor, speeding-up matching and reducing storage requirements.}

Since the motion-estimation performance depends highly on the geometry of the scene and the motion of the camera, we analyze two common operational environments in mobile robotics: an urban environment and an indoor scene. To confirm the theoretical observations, we implement a stateof-the-art VO pipeline that works with large FoV fisheye and catadioptric cameras. We evaluate the proposed VO pipeline in both synthetic and real experiments. The experiments point out that it is advantageous to use a large FoV camera (e.g., fisheye or catadioptric) for indoor scenes and a smaller FoV for urban canyon environments.}

  abstract  = {The readily available image and depth data from commodity RGB-D sensors has had tremendous impact in the robotics and computer vision community recently. To jointly leverage both modalities, the depth and image measurements need to be registered. Typical calibration approaches make use of artificial landmarks and special calibration targets. However, this is not feasible if on-line (re-)calibration is necessary or the sensor setup is inaccessible, e.g., for already captured datasets. Instead of using specific calibration patterns, we propose to leverage a sparse environment model as geometric prior for the calibration. Structure-from-motion or SLAM can provide such a sparse 3D scene model, and hence our approach allows for self-calibration without the need for any manual interaction. We validate our hypothesis by introducing an optimization that jointly minimizes the alignment error between the sparse map and all recorded depth maps. Since the accuracy of depth measurements is known to degrade considerably with scene depth, we account for this distortion via a spatially varying correction term. The evaluation of our approach demonstrates that we are able to compute an accurate extrinsic and intrinsic calibration, which for example allows dense 3D modeling at improved precision.}

In recent times, high spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging data from ground based platforms have shown particular promise in this application. Using spectral vegetation signatures to discriminate between crop and weed species has been demonstrated on several occasions in the literature over the past 15 years. A number of authors demonstrated successful per-pixel classification with accuracies of over 80\%. However, the vast majority of the related literature uses supervised methods, where training datasets have been manually compiled. In practice, static training data can be particularly susceptible to temporal variability due to physiological or environmental change. A self-supervised training method that leverages prior knowledge about seeding patterns in vegetable fields has recently been introduced in the context of RGB imaging, allowing the classifier to continually update weed appearance models as conditions change. This paper combines and extends these methods to provide a selfsupervised framework for hyperspectral crop/weed discrimination with prior knowledge of seeding patterns using an autonomous mobile ground vehicle. Experimental results in corn crop rows demonstrate the systems performance and limitations.}

As such, we do not restrict ourselves to only tracking the most common categories, but are able to handle a large variety of static and moving objects.

Our key contribution is a disparity estimation algorithm that iteratively approximates the scene depth via a piece-wise planar mesh from stereo imagery, with a fast depth validation step for semidense reconstruction. The mesh is initially seeded with sparsely matched keypoints, and is recursively tessellated and refined as needed (via a resampling stage), to provide the desired stereo disparity accuracy. The inherent simplicity and speed of our approach, with the ability to tune it to a desired reconstruction quality and runtime performance makes it a compelling solution for applications in high-speed vehicles.}

Furthermore, our formulation allows for modularity since new/old maps (or parts of them) can be easily added/removed with no impact on the remaining ones. Additionally, the proposed CM algorithm lends itself, for the most part, to parallel implementations, hence gaining in speed.

In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution.}

In contrast to prior art, our system is able to predict this localisation envelope for trajectories in similar, yet geographically distant locations where no repeat runs have yet been performed. Thus, by characterising the localisation performance in one region, we are able to predict performance in another. To achieve this, we leverage a Gaussian Process regressor to estimate the likely number of feature matches for any keyframe in the teach run, based on a combination of trajectory properties such as curvature and an appearance model of the keyframe. Using data from real traversals, we demonstrate that our approach performs as well as prior art when it comes to interpolating localisation performance based on a number of repeat runs, while also performing well at generalising performance estimation to freshly taught trajectories.}

  abstract  = {An efficient surface normal estimation method is presented. The new algorithm estimates surface normal direction for each cell in a grid based on the occupancy information (both occupied and empty) of the neighboring cells. This grid representation allows user-defined sizes and scaling with the environment, not the number of measurements. Recursive and batch formulations to obtain the posterior estimate are presented, and compared. A computationally efficient implementation is derived which provides consistent and accurate estimates as measurements become available. Both simulation and experimental results are shown, demonstrating comparable estimation performance to that of using Point Cloud Library, but with significantly reduced computation time.}

  abstract  = {This paper is about discovering and leveraging architectural constraints in large scale 3D reconstructions using laser. Our contribution is to offer a formulation of the problem which naturally and in a unified way, captures the variety of architectural constraints that can be discovered and applied in urban reconstructions. We focus in particular on the case of survey construction with a push broom laser + VO system. Here visual odometry is combined with vertical 2D scans to create a 3D picture of the environment. A key characteristic here is that the sensors pass/sweep swiftly through the environment such that elements of the scene are seen only briefly by cameras and scanned just once by the laser. These qualities make for a an ill-constrained optimisation problem which is greatly aided if architectural constraints can be discovered and appropriately applied. We demonstrate our approach in an end-to-end implementation which discovers salient architectural constraints and rejects false loop closures before invoking an optimisation to return a 3D model of the workspace. We evaluate the precision of this model by comparison to a ground truth provided by a 3rd party professional survey using highend (static) 3D laser scanners.}

While increasing the sliding window size generally yields improved accuracy, it also comes at an increase in computational cost. In order to reduce this cost, we propose smarter non-uniform sampling of the trajectory representation over the sliding window. This nonuniform temporal resolution is possible with continuous-time representations that allow freely adjustable knots location. Four strategies for selecting the knots location are presented and evaluated based on a real data laser-odometry SLAM problem. The results clearly show that non-uniform distributions of knots can be superior to uniform distribution in terms of accuracy per computation time.}

We describe a monocular approach that in addition to point measurements also considers object detections to resolve this scale ambiguity and drift. By placing a prior on the size of the objects, the scale estimation can be seamlessly integrated into a bundle adjustment. When object observations are available, the local scale of the map is then determined jointly with the camera pose in local adjustments. Unlike many previous visual odometry methods, our approach does not impose restrictions such as approximately constant camera height or planar roadways, and is therefore applicable to a much wider range of applications. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset and show that it reduces scale drift over long-range outdoor sequences with a total length of 40 km. Qualitative evaluation is also performed on video footage from a hand-held camera.}

The field-grown sweet pepper crop presents several challenges for robotic systems such as the high degree of occlusion and the fact that the crop can have a similar colour to the background (green on green). To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage system that performs per-pixel segmentation followed by region detection. The output of the segmentation is used to search for highly probable regions and declares these to be sweet pepper. We propose the novel use of the local binary pattern (LBP) to perform crop segmentation. This feature improves the accuracy of crop segmentation from an AUC of 0.10, for previously proposed features, to 0.56. Using the LBP feature as the basis for our two-stage algorithm, we are able to detect 69.2\% of field grown sweet peppers in three sites. This is an impressive result given that the average detection accuracy of people viewing the same colour imagery is 66.8\%.}

The significant challenge associated with round fruits such as grapes and apples is that the surface is smooth and lacks definition and contrasting features, the contours of the fruit may be partially occluded, and the color of the fruit often blends with background foliage. We propose a fruit detection algorithm that utilizes the gradual variation of intensity and gradient orientation on the surface of the fruit. Candidate fruit locations, or seed points are tested for both monotonically decreasing intensity and gradient orientation profiles. Candidate fruit locations that pass the initial filter are classified using modified histogram of oriented gradients combined with a pairwise intensity comparison texture descriptor and random forest classifier. We analyse the performance of the fruit detection algorithm on image datasets of grapes and apples using human labeled images as ground truth. Our method to detect candidate fruit locations is scale invariant, robust to partial occlusions and more accurate than existing methods. We achieve overall F1 accuracy score of 0.82 for grapes and 0.80 for apples. We demonstrate our method is more accurate than existing methods.}

  abstract  = {Conventional SLAM systems with an RGB-D sensor use depth measurements only in a limited depth range due to hardware limitation and noise of the sensor, ignoring regions that are too far or too close from the sensor. Such systems introduce registration errors especially in scenes with large depth variations. In this paper, we present a novel RGB-D SLAM system that makes use of both 2D and 3D measurements. Our system first extracts keypoints from RGB images and generates 2D and 3D point features from the keypoints with invalid and valid depth values, respectively. It then establishes 3D-to-3D, 2D-to-3D, and 2D-to-2D point correspondences among frames. For the 2D-to-3D point correspondences, we use the rays defined by the 2D point features to pinpoint the corresponding 3D point features, generating longer-range constraints than using only 3D-to-3D correspondences. For the 2D-to-2D point correspondences, we triangulate the rays to generate 3D points that are used as 3D point features in the subsequent process. We use the hybrid correspondences in both online SLAM and offline postprocessing: the online SLAM focuses more on the speed by computing correspondences among consecutive frames for real-time operations, while the offline postprocessing generates more correspondences among all the frames for higher accuracy. The results on RGB-D SLAM benchmarks show that the online SLAM provides higher accuracy than conventional SLAM systems, while the postprocessing further improves the accuracy.}

We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time.

  abstract  = {We propose robust methods for estimating camera egomotion in noisy, real-world monocular image sequences in the general case of unknown observer rotation and translation with two views and a small baseline. This is a difficult problem because of the nonconvex cost function of the perspective camera motion equation and because of non-Gaussian noise arising from noisy optical flow estimates and scene non-rigidity. To address this problem, we introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI dataset, while adding almost no runtime cost over baseline egomotion methods.}

Accurate image parsing is required for this purpose, however, operating in natural outdoor conditions makes this a complex task due to the undesirable intra-class variations caused by changes in illumination, pose and tree types, etc. Typically these variations are difficult to explicitly model and discriminative classifiers strive to be invariant to them. However, given the presence of structure, in both the orchard and how the data was obtained, a subset of these factors of variations can correlate with readily available metadata, including extrinsic experimental information such as the sun incidence angle, position within farm, etc. This paper presents a method to incorporate such metadata to aid scene parsing based on a multi-scale Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) architecture. Experimental results are shown for pixel segmentation over data collected at an apple orchard, leading to fruit detection and yield estimation. The results show a consistent improvement in segmentation accuracy with the inclusion of metadata under different network complexities, training configurations and evaluation metrics.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents an approach to formulating the cost function for a motion planner intended for human-robot collaboration on manipulation tasks in a shared workspace. To be effective for human-robot collaboration a robot should plan its motion so that it is both safe and efficient. To achieve this, we propose two factors to consider in the cost function for the robots motion planner: (1) Avoidance of the workspace previously-occupied by the human, so that the motion is as safe as possible, and (2) Consistency of the robots motion, so that the motion is as predictable as possible for the human and they can perform their task without focusing undue attention on the robot. Our experiments in simulation and a human-robot workspace sharing study compare a cost function that uses only the first factor and a combined cost that uses both factors vs. a baseline method that is perfectly consistent but does not account for the humans previous motion. We find that using either cost function we outperform the baseline method in terms of task success rate without degrading the task completion time. The best task success rate is achieved with the cost function that includes both the avoidance and consistency terms.}

Our approach begins by extracting an over-complete set of features to describe the relative geometry of two objects. Each relationship type is modeled using a relevance-weighted distance over this feature space. This effectively ignores irrelevant feature dimensions. Our algorithm RANSEM for determining subsets of data that share a relationship as well as the model to describe each relationship is based on robust sample-based clustering. This approach combines the search for consistent groups of data with the extraction of models that precisely capture the geometry of those groups. An iterative refinement scheme has shown to be an effective approach for finding concepts of differing degrees of geometric specificity. Our results show that the models learned by our approach correlate strongly with the English labels that have been given by a human annotator to a set of validation data drawn from the NYUv2 real-world Kinect dataset, demonstrating that these concepts can be automatically acquired given sufficient experience. Additionally, the results of our method significantly out-perform K-means, a standard baseline for unsupervised cluster extraction.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a monocular Direct and Semi-dense SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) system for rolling shutter cameras. In a rolling shutter camera, the pose is different for each row of each image, and this yields poor pose estimates and poor structure estimates when using a state-of-the-art semi-dense direct method designed for global shutter cameras. To address this issue in tracking, we model the smooth and continuous camera trajectory using a B-spline curve of degree k1 for poses in the Lie algebra, se(3). We solve for the camera poses at each row-time by a direct optimisation of photometric error as a function of the control points of the spline. Likewise for mapping, we develop generalised epipolar geometry for the rolling shutter case and solve for point depths using photometric error. Although each of these issues has been previously tackled, to the best of our knowledge ours is the first full solution to monocular, direct (feature-less) SLAM. We benchmark our method for pose accuracy and map accuracy against the state-of-the-art semi-dense SLAM system, LSDSLAM, demonstrating the improved efficacy of our approach when using rolling shutter cameras via synthetic sequences with known ground-truth and real sequences.}

  abstract  = {Graphical methods have proven an extremely useful tool employed by the mobile robotics community to frame estimation problems. Incremental solvers are able to process incoming sensor data and produce maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in realtime by exploiting the natural sparsity within the graph for reasonable-sized problems. However, to enable truly longterm operation in prior unknown environments requires algorithms whose computation, memory, and bandwidth (in the case of distributed systems) requirements scale constantly with time and environment size. Some recent approaches have addressed this problem through a two-step process - first the variables selected for removal are marginalized which induces density, and then the result is sparsified to maintain computational efficiency. Previous literature generally addresses only one of these two components. In this work, we attempt to explicitly connect all of the aforementioned resource constraint requirements by considering the node removal and sparsification pipeline in its entirety. We formulate the node selection problem as a minimization problem over the penalty to be paid in the resulting sparsification. As a result, we produce node subset selection strategies that are optimal in terms of minimizing the impact, in terms of Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD), of approximating the dense distribution by a sparse one. We then show that one instantiation of this problem yields a computationally tractable formulation. Finally, we evaluate the method on standard datasets and show that the KLD is minimized as compared to other commonly-used heuristic node selection techniques.}

In this paper, we study the problem of how to predict the class and pose of an occluded object by carefully taking a sequence of observations. To find the best sequence of viewpoints by the robot, we construct hypotheses of the states of the target and occluding objects, and update our belief state as new observations come in. Every time selecting the next robot pose, we greedily choose the one that is expected to reduce the uncertainty the most. Based on the theoretical analysis of adaptive submodular maximization problems, this process is guaranteed to find a near-optimal sequence of robot poses in terms of observation and traverse costs. To validate the proposed method, we present simulation and robot experiments using a PR2.}

The 6DOF pose of the sweet peppers is then estimated via a nonlinear least squares optimisation by fitting a superellipsoid to the segmented sweet pepper. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a real 6DOF manipulator with a custom gripper. The method is shown to estimate the 6DOF pose successfully enabling the manipulator to grasp sweet peppers for a range of different orientations. The results obtained improve largely on the performance of grasping when compared to a naive approach, which does not estimate the orientation of the crop.}

Existing image stitching/mosaicking methods rely on inter-image homography computation based on a planar scene assumption. This assumption holds when images are taken from high-altitudes (hence the depth variation is negligible). It is often violated when flying at low altitudes. Further, to avoid scale and resolution changes, existing methods rely on primarily translational motion at fixed altitudes. Our method removes these limitations and performs well even when aerial images are taken from low altitudes by an aerial vehicle performing complex motions. It starts by extracting the ground geometry from a sparse reconstruction of the scene obtained from a small fraction of the input images. Next, it selects the best image (from the entire sequence) for each location on the ground using a novel camera selection criterion. This image is then independently rectified to obtain the corresponding portion of the mosaic. Therefore, the technique avoids performing costly joint-optimization over the entire sequence. It is validated using challenging input sequences motivated by agricultural applications.}

However, with the introduction of lengthier sorties and the growing size of the environments, data transfers between the backend server where the global map is stored and the agents are becoming prohibitively large. While some existing methods partially address this issue by building compact summary maps, the data transfer from the agents to the backend can still easily become unmanageable. In this paper, we propose a method that is designed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the agent to the backend, functioning in large-scale, multisession mapping scenarios. Our approach is based upon a landmark selection method that exploits information coming from multiple, possibly weak and correlated, landmark utility predictors; fused using learned feature coefficients. Such a selection yields a drastic reduction in data transfer while maintaining localization performance and the ability to efficiently summarize environments over time. We evaluate our approach on a data set that was autonomously collected in a dynamic indoor environment over a period of several months.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present an online landmark selection method for distributed long-term visual localization systems in bandwidth-constrained environments. Sharing a common map for online localization provides a fleet of autonomous vehicles with the possibility to maintain and access a consistent map source, and therefore reduce redundancy while increasing efficiency. However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.}

  abstract  = {Illumination changes are a typical problem for many outdoor long-term applications such as visual place recognition. Keypoints may fail to match between images taken at the same location but different times of the day. Although recently some methods are presented for creating shadowfree image representations, all of them have the limitation in terms of dealing with night images and non-Planckian source of lighting. In this paper we present a new method for creating illumination invariant image representation using a combination of two existing methods based on natural image statistics that address the issue of illumination invariance. Unlike previous attempts at solving the problem of illumination invariant representation, the proposed method does not assume the ideal narrow-band color camera nor a calibration step for each environment. We evaluate our method on real datasets to establish its accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method outperforms competing methods for illumination invariant image representation.}

  abstract  = {Localizing a camera in a given map is essential for vision-based navigation. In contrast to common methods for visual localization that use maps acquired with cameras, we propose a novel approach, which tracks the pose of monocular camera with respect to a given 3D LiDAR map. We employ a visual odometry system based on local bundle adjustment to reconstruct a sparse set of 3D points from image features. These points are continuously matched against the map to track the camera pose in an online fashion. Our approach to visual localization has several advantages. Since it only relies on matching geometry, it is robust to changes in the photometric appearance of the environment. Utilizing panoramic LiDAR maps additionally provides viewpoint invariance. Yet lowcost and lightweight camera sensors are used for tracking. We present real-world experiments demonstrating that our method accurately estimates the 6-DoF camera pose over long trajectories and under varying conditions.}

  abstract  = {Vision-based, route-following algorithms enable autonomous robots to repeat manually taught paths over long distances using inexpensive vision sensors. However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for routefollowing applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-offreedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day. Both exhibit significant appearance change due to lighting variation. Through these experiments we show that safe localization can be achieved by bridging the appearance gap.}

In this paper, we address the scenario of self-localization from images with small overlap. We explicitly introduce a localization difficulty index as a decreasing function of view overlap between query and relevant database images and investigate performance versus difficulty for challenging cross-view self-localization tasks. We then reformulate the self-localization as a scalable bag-ofvisual-features (BoVF) scene retrieval and present an efficient solution called PCA-NBNN, aiming to facilitate fast and yet discriminative correspondence between partially overlapping images. The proposed approach adopts recent findings in discriminativity preserving encoding of DCNN features using principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-domain scene matching using naive Bayes nearest neighbor distance metric (NBNN). We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed PCA-NBNN framework frequently achieves comparable results to previous DCNN features and that the BoVF model is significantly more efficient. We further address an important alternative scenario of self-localization from images with NO overlap and report the result.}

  abstract  = {Although Point Clouds Registration is a very well studied problem, with many different solutions, most of the approaches in the literature aims at aligning two dense point clouds. Instead, we tackle the problem of aligning a dense point cloud with a sparse one: a problem that has to be solved, for example, to merge maps produced by different sensors, such as a vision-based sensor and laser scanner or two different laser-based sensors. The most used approach to point clouds registration, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), is also applicable to this sub-problem. We propose an improvement over the standard ICP data association policy and we called it Probabilistic Data Association. It was derived applying statistical inference techniques on a fully probabilistic model. In our proposal, each point in the source point cloud is associated with a set of points in the target point cloud; each association is then weighted so that the weights form a probability distribution. The result is an algorithm similar to ICP but more robust w.r.t. noise and outliers. While we designed our approach to deal with the problem of dense-sparse registration, it can be successfully applied also to standard point clouds registration.}

In this paper, we present a new proposal focused on automatically learned descriptors, which are processed by means of a technique recently popularized in the computer vision community: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The novelty of our approach relies on fusing the image information from multiple convolutional layers at several levels and granularities. In addition, we compress the redundant data of CNN features into a tractable number of bits for efficient and robust place recognition. The final descriptor is reduced by applying simple compression and binarization techniques for fast matching using the Hamming distance. An exhaustive experimental evaluation confirms the improved performance of our proposal (CNN-VTL) with respect to state-of-the-art methods over varied long-term datasets recorded across seasons.}

The resulting detector runs in real-time and can be easily tuned to have a low false positive rate, simplifying data association.

The pose graph formulation is adopted, where each pose is associated to a local map of keypoints extracted from the corresponding laser scan. Loops in the graph are detected by matching local maps in two steps. First, the candidate matching scans are selected by comparing the scan signatures obtained from the keypoints of each scan. Second, the transformation between two scans is obtained by pairing and aligning the respective keypoint sets.

The localization is performed in real-time by a stereo camera system as a main sensor, using vehicle odometry and an off-the-shelf GPS as secondary information sources. Localization is performed by a particle filter approach, coupled with an Kalman filter for robustness and sensor fusion. This leads to a lateral accuracy below 20 cm in various urban test areas.

  abstract  = {Robotic vision, unlike computer vision, typically involves processing a stream of images from a camera with time varying pose operating in an environment with time varying lighting conditions and moving objects. Repeating robotic vision experiments under identical conditions is often impossible, making it difficult to compare different algorithms. For machine learning applications a critical bottleneck is the limited amount of real world image data that can be captured and labelled for both training and testing purposes. In this paper we investigate the use of a photo-realistic simulation tool to address these challenges, in three specific domains: robust place recognition, visual SLAM and object recognition. For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.}

A particularly important representation is the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) that is at the core of recent advances in dense 3D mapping. However, there is relatively little literature exploring the characteristics of 3D feature detection in volumetric representations. In this paper we evaluate the performance of features extracted directly from a 3D TSDF representation. We compare the repeatability of Integral invariant features, specifically designed for volumetric images, to the 3D extensions of Harris and Shi & Tomasi corners. We also study the impact of different methods for obtaining gradients for their computation. We motivate our study with an example application for building sparse stable scene graphs, and present an efficient GPU-parallel algorithm to obtain the graphs, made possible by the combination of TSDF and 3D feature points. Our findings show that while the 3D extensions of 2D corner-detection perform as expected, integral invariants have shortcomings when applied to discrete TSDFs. We conclude with a discussion of the cause for these points of failure that sheds light on possible mitigation strategies.}

Existing methods typically exploit image sequences, holistic descriptors and/or training data. Each of these approaches limits the practical applicability, e.g. to constant viewpoints for usage of holistic image descriptors. Recently, the combination of local region detectors and descriptors based on Convolutional Neural Networks showed to be a promising approach to overcome these limitations. However, established region detectors, for example keypoint detectors, showed severe problems to provide repetitive landmarks despite dramatically changed appearance of the environment. Thus, they are typically replaced by holistic image descriptors or fixedly arranged patches - both known to be sensitive towards viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present a novel local region detector, SP-Grid, that is particularly suited for the combination of severe appearance and viewpoint changes. It is based on multi-scale image oversegmentations and is designed to combine the advantages of keypoints and fixed image patches by starting from an initial grid-like arrangement and subsequently adapting to the image content. The gridlike arrangement showed to be beneficial in the presence of severe appearance changes and the adaptation to the image content increases the robustness towards viewpoint changes. The experimental evaluation will show the benefit compared to existing local region detectors and holistic image descriptors.}

Our motion segmentation method uses the raw trajectory data, allowing the objects to move in direct 3D space, without any projection model assumption or whatsoever. We also propose a complete pipeline for static-map building which estimates the inter-frame motion parameters by exploiting the minimal 3-point Random Sample Consensus algorithm on the feature correspondences only from the static scene parts. The proposed method has been especially designed and tested for large scene in real outdoor environments. On one hand, our 3D Motion Segmentation approach outperforms its 2D based counterparts, for extensive experiments on KITTI dataset. On the other hand, separately reconstructed static-maps and moving objects for various dynamic scenes are very satisfactory.}

Several detection algorithms are developed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Tests ascertain the system can successfully detect the plant and reach the detection pose required for PM (along the side of the plant), yet it has difficulties in reaching the TSWV detection pose (above the plant). Increasing manipulator workvolume is expected to solve this issue. For TSWV, PCA-based classification with leaf vein removal, achieved the highest classification accuracy (90\%) while the accuracy of the CV methods was also high (85\%, 87\%). For PM, PCA-based pixellevel classification was high (95.2\%) while leaf condition classification accuracy was low (64.3\%) since it was determined based on the upper side of the leaf while disease symptoms start on its lower side. Exposure of the lower side of the leaf during detection is expected to improve PM condition detection.}

One of the proposed features, termed FALKO-BSC, achieves higher repeatability score and similar descriptor performance compared with the FLIRT state-of-the-art feature. FALKO-BSC is also shown to enable effective localization.}

  abstract = {We present a novel technique for stitching images including those obtained from aerial vehicles flying at low altitudes. Existing image stitching/mosaicking methods rely on inter-image homography computation based on a planar scene assumption. This assumption holds when images are taken from high-altitudes (hence the depth variation is negligible). It is often violated when flying at low altitudes. Further, to avoid scale and resolution changes, existing methods rely on primarily translational motion at fixed altitudes. Our method removes these limitations and performs well even when aerial images are taken from low altitudes by an aerial vehicle performing complex motions. It starts by extracting the ground geometry from a sparse reconstruction of the scene obtained from a small fraction of the input images. Next, it selects the best image (from the entire sequence) for each location on the ground using a novel camera selection criterion. This image is then independently rectified to obtain the corresponding portion of the mosaic. Therefore, the technique avoids performing costly joint-optimization over the entire sequence. It is validated using challenging input sequences motivated by agricultural applications.}

The new model applies to catadioptric systems and wide-angle fish-eye cameras, it does not require additional mapping to model distortions, and it takes just two projection parameters more than a simple pinhole model to represent radial distortion (one parameter more than the unified model). Here we provide a study of different mathematical aspects of the model, its application limits, and explicit closed-form inversion. The latter allows to apply all the notions of epipolar geometry with no difficulties. Also we introduce a concept of projection surface, which is a useful notion to study and compare different projection models with radial distortion. Using developed software, several different lenses were calibrated using the proposed model, and in all cases sub-pixel precision was achieved.}

We present a principled method for quantifying the coverage sensing uncertainty of the robot. We use this sensing uncertainty along with the uncertainty in robot localization to develop C-OPT, a coverage-optimization algorithm which optimizes trajectories over belief-space to find locally optimal coverage paths. We highlight the applicability of our approach in multiple simulated scenarios inspired by surveillance, UAV crop analysis, and search-and-rescue tasks. We also present a case study on a physical, differential-drive robot. We also provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the paths generated by our approach.}

These metrics are inspired by contraction analysis and we demonstrate their use to guide randomized planners towards more convergent trajectories through three extensions to the kinodynamic RRT. The first strictly thresholds action selection based on these metrics, forcing the planner to find a solution that lies within a contraction region over which all initial conditions converge exponentially to a single trajectory. However, finding such a monotonically contracting plan is not always possible. Thus, we propose a second method that relaxes these strict requirements to find convergent (i.e. low-divergence) plans. The third algorithm uses these metrics for post-planning path selection. Two examples test the ability of these metrics to lead the planners to more robust trajectories: a mobile robot climbing a hill and a manipulator rearranging objects on a table.}

We present an approach that exploits such background information and enables a robot to cover the environment with its sensors faster compared to a greedy exploration system without this information. We implemented our exploration system in ROS and evaluated it in different environments. As the experimental results demonstrate, our proposed method significantly reduces the overall trajectory length needed to cover the environment with the robots sensors and thus yields a more efficient exploration strategy compared to state-of-the-art greedy exploration, if the additional information is available.}

  abstract = {Dense optical flow is a crucial visual cue for obstacle avoidance and motion control for robotic systems functioning in complex unstructured environments. In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term Rapid Embedded Vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This paper proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 544 pixel resolution.}

  abstract = {Visual Ego-Motion Estimation, or briefly Visual Odometry (VO), is one of the key building blocks of modern SLAM systems. In the last decade, impressive results have been demonstrated in the context of visual navigation, reaching very high localization performance. However, all ego-motion estimation systems require careful parameter tuning procedures for the specific environment they have to work in. Furthermore, even in ideal scenarios, most state-of-the-art approaches fail to handle image anomalies and imperfections, which results in less robust estimates. VO systems that rely on geometrical approaches extract sparse or dense features and match them to perform Frame to Frame (F2F) motion estimation. However, images contain much more information that can be used to further improve the F2F estimation. To learn new feature representation a very successful approach is to use deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Inspired by recent advances in Deep Networks and by previous work on learning methods applied to VO, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to learn both the best visual features and the best estimator for the task of visual Ego-Motion Estimation. With experiments on publicly available datasets we show that our approach is robust with respect to blur, luminance and contrast anomalies and outperforms most state-of-the-art approaches even in nominal conditions.}

We examine an epipolar rectification model designed for fisheye cameras, which allows the use of efficient out-of-the-box dense matching algorithms designed for classical pinhole-type cameras to search for correspondence information at every pixel. The resulting dense point cloud allows to recover a detailed and more complete cloud morphology compared to previous approaches that employed sparse feature-based stereo or assumed geometric constraints on the cloud field. Our approach is very efficient and can be fully automated. From the obtained 3-D shapes, cloud dynamics, size, motion, type and spacing can be derived, and used for radiation closure under cloudy conditions, for example. Fisheye lenses follow a different projection function than classical pinhole-type cameras and provide a large field of view with a single image. However, the computation of dense 3-D information is more complicated and standard implementations for dense 3-D stereo reconstruction cannot be easily applied. Together with an appropriate camera calibration, which includes internal camera geometry, global position and orientation of the stereo camera pair, we use the correspondence information from the stereo matching for dense 3-D stereo reconstruction of clouds located around the cameras. We implement and evaluate the proposed approach using real world data and present two case studies. In the first case, we validate the quality and accuracy of the method by comparing the stereo reconstruction of a stratocumulus layer with reflectivity observations measured by a cloud radar and the cloud-base height estimated from a Lidar-ceilometer. The second case analyzes a rapid cumulus evolution in the presence of strong wind shear.},

Man-made environments play a central role in navigation, city planning, building management systems, disaster management or augmented reality.

The problems appear to be caused by (1) the incoherence of the models for signal analysis, (2) the type of interplay between discrete and continuous geometric representations, (3) the inefficiency of the interaction between crisp models, such as partonomies and taxonomies, and soft models, mostly having a probabilistic nature, and (4) the vagueness of the used notions in the envisaged application domains. The paper wants to encourage the development and learning of generative models, specifically for man-made objects, to be able to understand, reason about, and explain interpretations.},

One-Class Support Vector Machines are applied to hyperspectral data without geometry information as well as to hyperspectral images with additional pixelwise inclination information. Our results show a gain in accuracy when using geometry information beside spectral information regardless of the used approach. However, both methods have different demands on the data when applied to new test data sets. One-Class Support Vector Machines require full inclination information on test and training data whereas the topographic dictionary approach only need spectral information for reconstruction of test data once the dictionary is build by spectra with inclination.}

In contrast to classical cameras, however, fisheye cameras cannot be approximated well using the pinhole camera model and this renders the computation of depth information from fisheye stereo image pairs more complicated. In this work, we analyze the combination of an epipolar rectification model for fisheye stereo cameras with existing dense methods. This has the advantage that existing dense stereo systems can be applied as a black-box even with cameras that have field of view of more than 180 deg to obtain dense disparity information. We thoroughly investigate the accuracy potential of such fisheye stereo systems using image data from our UAV. The empirical analysis is based on image pairs of a calibrated fisheye stereo camera system and two state-of-the-art algorithms for dense stereo applied to adequately rectified image pairs from fisheye stereo cameras. The canonical stochastic model for sensor points assumes homogeneous uncertainty and we generalize this model based on an empirical analysis using a test scene consisting of mutually orthogonal planes. We show (1) that the combination of adequately rectified fisheye image pairs and dense methods provides dense 3D point clouds at 6-7 Hz on our autonomous multi-copter UAV, (2) that the uncertainty of points depends on their angular distance from the optical axis, (3) how to estimate the variance component as a function of that distance, and (4) how the improved stochastic model improves the accuracy of the scene points.},

Diese Aufgabe ist in vielen realen Systemen von entscheidender Bedeutung: einerseits stellen hochgenaue Karten mitunter einen Wert an sich für den Benutzer oder eine spezielle Anwendung dar, andererseits benötigen beispielsweise autonome Roboter ein solches Modell, um zielgerichtet selbstständig navigieren zu können.

Dies beinhaltet neben dem klassischen Verfahren mittels Ausgleichung, welches offline auf allen Daten operiert, auch Filtertechniken wie den Kalman-Filter und den Partikel-Filter, die zu den Onlineverfahren zählen. Bei der Verwendung der Kleinsten-Quadrate Methode sowie beim Kalman-Filter wird meist eine Normalverteilung beziehungsweise eine unimodale Verteilung über die Positionen der 3D-Punkte in der Umgebung und die Orientierung des Sensors geschätzt. Im Gegensatz dazu arbeitet der Partikel-Filter nichtparametrisch und kann multiple Hypothesen über mögliche Datenassoziationen parallel schätzen. Neben den einzusetzenden Schätzverfahren wird auch skizziert, wie SLAM Systeme mit unterschiedlichen Sensoren realisiert werden können.}

  abstract  = {This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction into one of the key enabling technologies of mobile robot navigation: simultaneous localization and mapping, or in short SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of acquiring a spatial map of an environment while simultaneously localizing the robot relative to this model. The SLAM problem is generally regarded as one of the most important problems in the pursuit of building truly autonomous mobile robots. It is of great practical importance; if a robust, general-purpose solution to SLAM can be found, then many new applications of mobile robotics will become possible.}

  abstract  = {This textbook on Photogrammetric Computer Vision – Statistics, Geometry, Orientation and Reconstruction provides a statistical treatment of the geometry of multiple view anal- ysis useful for camera calibration, orientation, and geometric scene reconstruction. The book is the first to offer a joint view of photogrammetry and computer vision, two fields that have converged in recent decades. It is motivated by the need for a conceptually consistent theory aiming at generic solutions for orientation and reconstruction problems. Large parts of the book result from teaching bachelor’s and master’s courses for students of geodesy within their education in photogrammetry. Most of these courses were simultaneously offered as subjects in the computer science faculty.The book provides algorithms for various problems in geometric computation and in vision metrology, together with mathematical justification and statistical analysis allowing thorough evaluation. The book aims at enabling researchers, software developers, and practitioners in the photogrammetric and GIS industry to design, write, and test their own algorithms and application software using statistically founded concepts to obtain optimal solutions and to realize self-diagnostics within algorithms. This is essential when applying vision tech- niques in practice. The material of the book can serve as a source for different levels of undergraduate and graduate courses in photogrammetry, computer vision, and computer graphics, and for research and development in statistically based geometric computer vision methods. The sixteen chapters of the book are self-contained, are illustrated with numerous fig- ures, have exercises, and are supported by an appendix and an index. Many of the examples and exercises can be verified or solved using the Matlab routines available on the home page of the book, which also contains solutions to some of the exercises.}

  abstract  = {For many fundamental scene understanding tasks, it is difficult or impossible to obtain per-pixel ground truth labels from real images. We address this challenge by introducing Hypersim, a photorealistic synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding. To create our dataset, we leverage a large repository of synthetic scenes created by professional artists, and we generate 77,400 images of 461 indoor scenes with detailed per-pixel labels and corresponding ground truth geometry. Our dataset: (1) relies exclusively on publicly available 3D assets; (2) includes complete scene geometry, material information, and lighting information for every scene; (3) includes dense per-pixel semantic instance segmentations and complete camera information for every image; and (4) factors every image into diffuse reflectance, diffuse illumination, and a non-diffuse residual term that captures view-dependent lighting effects. We analyze our dataset at the level of scenes, objects, and pixels, and we analyze costs in terms of money, computation time, and annotation effort. Remarkably, we find that it is possible to generate our entire dataset from scratch, for roughly half the cost of training a popular open-source natural language processing model. We also evaluate sim-to-real transfer performance on two real-world scene understanding tasks - semantic segmentation and 3D shape prediction - where we find that pre-training on our dataset significantly improves performance on both tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the most challenging Pix3D test set. All of our rendered image data, as well as all the code we used to generate our dataset and perform our experiments, is available online.},

First, it uses an information-theoretic measure to automatically identify and store novel measurement sequences. This keeps the computation tractable by discarding redundant information and allows the system to build a sparse but complete calibration dataset from data collected at different times. Second, as the full observability of the calibration parameters may not be guaranteed for an arbitrary measurement sequence, the algorithm detects and locks unobservable directions in parameter space using a combination of rank-revealing QR and singular value decompositions of the Fisher information matrix. The result is an algorithm that listens to an incoming sensor stream, builds a minimal set of data for estimating the calibration parameters, and updates parameters as they become observable, leaving the others locked at their initial guess. We validate our approach through an extensive set of simulated and real-world experiments. }

  abstract = {Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.}

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8 deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet local- ization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.}

GPS/INS (inertial navigation system) solutions, which are insufficient alone to maintain a vehicle within a lane, can fail because of significant radio frequency noise or jamming, tall buildings, trees, and other blockage or multipath scenarios. LIDAR and camera map-based vehicle localization can fail when optical features become obscured, such as with snow or dust, or with changes to gravel or dirt road surfaces. Localizing ground penetrating radar (LGPR) is a new mode of a priori map-based vehicle localization designed to complement existing approaches with a low sensitivity to failure modes of LIDAR, camera, and GPS/INS sensors due to its low-frequency RF energy, which couples deep into the ground. Most subsurface features detected are inherently stable over time. Significant research, discussed herein, remains to prove general utility. We have developed a novel low-profile ultra-low power LGPR system and demonstrated real-time operation underneath a passenger vehicle. A correlation maximizing optimization technique was developed to allow real-time localization at 126 Hz. Here we present the detailed design and results from highway testing, which uses a simple heuristic for fusing LGPR estimates with a GPS/INS system. Cross-track localization accuracies of 4.3 cm RMS relative to a “truth” RTK GPS/INS unit at speeds up to 100 km/h (60 mph) are demonstrated. These results, if generalizable, introduce a widely scalable real-time localization method with cross-track accuracy as good as or better than current localization methods},

Precision farming, which provides a holistic system approach, helps farmers to manage the spatial and temporal crop and soil variability within a field in order to increase profitability, optimize yield and quality, and reduce costs. There has been considerable research in farmers’ adoption of precision agriculture technologies. However, most recent studies have considered only a few aspects, whereas in this study a wide range of farm characteristics and farmer demographics are tested to gain insight into the relevant aspects of adoption of precision farming in German crop farming. The results of a logistic regression analysis show that predictors with positive influence on the adoption of precision farming are agricultural contractor services such as an additional farming business, having under 5 years’ experience in crop farming, having between 16 and 20 years’ experience in crop farming, and having more than 500 ha of arable land. However, having a farm of less than 100 ha and producing barley are factors that exert a negative influence on the adoption of precision farming. The results of this study provide manifold starting points for the further proliferation of precision agriculture technologies and future research directions.}

Robots are highly complex, consisting of different sub-systems that need to be integrated and correctly synchronised to perform tasks perfectly as a whole and successfully transfer the required information. Extensive research has been conducted on the application of robots and automation to a variety of field operations, and technical feasibility has been widely demonstrated. Agricultural robots for field operations must be able to operate in unstructured agricultural environments with the same quality of work achieved by current methods and means. To assimilate robotic systems, technologies must be developed to overcome continuously changing conditions and variability in produce and environments. Intelligent systems are needed for successful task performance in such environments. The robotic system must be cost-effective, while being inherently safe and reliable human safety, and preservation of the environment, the crop and the machinery are mandatory. Despite much progress in recent years, in most cases the technology is not yet commercially available. Information-acquisition systems, including sensors, fusion algorithms and data analysis, need to be adjusted to the dynamic conditions of unstructured agricultural environments. Intensive research is needed on integrating human operators into the system control loop for increased system performance and reliability. System sizes should be reduced while improving the integration of all parts and components. For robots to perform in agricultural environments and execute agricultural tasks, research must focus on: fusing complementary sensors for adequate localisation and sensing abilities, developing simple manipulators for each agricultural task, developing path planning, navigation and guidance algorithms suited to environments besides open fields and known a-priori, and integrating human operators in this complex and highly dynamic situation.}

Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

However, when revisiting places over and over, many state-of-the-art approaches exhibit reduced performance in terms of computation and memory complexity and in terms of accuracy. For successful deployment of robots over long time scales, we must develop algorithms that get better with repeated visits to the same environment, while still working within a fixed computational budget. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition. We evaluate a number of scoring functions and sampling policies and show that it is possible to build and maintain maps of a constant size and that place-recognition performance improves over multiple visits.}

This paper presents an appearance based loop closure detection mechanism titled IBuILD (Incremental bag of BInary words for Appearance based Loop closure Detection). The presented approach focuses on an online, incremental formulation of binary vocabulary generation for loop closure detection. The proposed approach does not require a prior vocabulary learning phase and relies purely on the appearance of the scene for loop closure detection without the need of odometry or GPS estimates. The vocabulary generation process is based on feature tracking between consecutive images to incorporate pose invariance. In addition, this process is coupled with a simple likelihood function to generate the most suitable loop closure candidate and a temporal consistency constraint to filter out inconsistent loop closures. Evaluation on different publicly available outdoor urban and indoor datasets shows that the presented approach is capable of generating higher recall at 100\% precision in comparison to the state of the art.}

  abstract  = {Here, we present a general framework for combining visual odometry and lidar odometry in a fundamental and first principle method. The method shows improvements in performance over the state of the art, particularly in robustness to aggressive motion and temporary lack of visual features. The proposed on-line method starts with visual odometry to estimate the ego-motion and to register point clouds from a scanning lidar at a high frequency but low fidelity. Then, scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously. We show results with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the KITTI odometry benchmark. Our proposed method is ranked #1 on the benchmark in terms of average translation and rotation errors, with a 0.75\% of relative position drift. In addition to comparison of the motion estimation accuracy, we evaluate robustness of the method when the sensor suite moves at a high speed and is subject to significant ambient lighting changes.}

  abstract  = {Recent successful approaches to autonomous vehicle localisation and navigation typically involve 3D LIDAR scanners and a static, curated 3D map, both of which are expensive to acquire and maintain. In this paper we propose an experience-based approach to matching a local 3D swathe built using a push-broom 2D LIDAR to a number of prior 3D maps, each of which has been collected during normal driving in different conditions. Local swathes are converted to a combined 2D height and reflectance representation, and we exploit the GPU rendering pipeline to densely sample the localisation cost function to provide robustness and a wide basin of convergence. Prior maps are incrementally built into an experience-based framework from multiple traversals of the same environment, capturing changes in environment structure and appearance over time. The LIDAR localisation solutions from each prior map are fused with vehicle odometry in a probabilistic framework to provide a single pose solution suitable for automated driving. Using this framework we demonstrate realtime centimetre-level localisation using LIDAR data collected in a dynamic city environment over a period of a year.}

Our primary motivation lies with the development of autonomous road vehicles an application domain in which low-cost sensing is particularly important. Here we present a method for localising against a textured 3-dimensional prior mesh using a monocular camera. We first present a system for generating and texturing the prior using a LIDAR scanner and camera. We then describe how we can localise against that prior with a single camera, using an information-theoretic measure of image similarity. This process requires dealing with the distortions induced by a wide-angle camera. We present and justify an interesting approach to this issue in which we distort the prior map into the image rather than vice-versa. Finally we explain how the general purpose computation functionality of a modern GPU is particularly apt for our task, allowing us to run the system in real time. We present results showing centimetre-level localisation accuracy through a city over six kilometres.}

This paper presents a lightingresistant VT&R system that uses experimentally trained colorconstant images to autonomously navigate difficult outdoor terrain despite changes in lighting. We show through an extensive field trial that our algorithm is capable of autonomously following a 1km outdoor route spanning sandy/rocky terrain, grassland, and wooded areas. Using a single visual map created at midday, the route was autonomously repeated 26 times over a period of four days, from sunrise to sunset with an autonomy rate (by distance) of over 99.9\%. These experiments show that a simple image transformation can extend the operation of VT&R from a few hours to multiple days.}

  abstract  = {While iterative optimization techniques for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) are now very efficient and widely used, none of them can guarantee global convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate. Local convergence usually implies artifacts in map reconstruction and large localization errors, hence it is very undesirable for applications in which accuracy and safety are of paramount importance. We provide a technique to verify if a given 2D SLAM solution is globally optimal. The insight is that, while computing the optimal solution is hard in general, duality theory provides tools to compute tight bounds on the optimal cost, via convex programming. These bounds can be used to evaluate the quality of a SLAM solution, hence providing a sanity check for stateof-the-art incremental and batch solvers. Experimental results show that our technique successfully identifies wrong estimates (i.e., local minima) in large-scale SLAM scenarios. This work, together with [1], represents a step towards the objective of having SLAM techniques with guaranteed performance, that can be used in safety-critical applications.}

Rotation estimation has a rich history in three scientific communities: robotics, computer vision, and control theory. We review relevant contributions across these communities, assess their practical use in the SLAM domain, and benchmark their performance on representative SLAM problems (Fig. 1).

Results show the ability of our framework to estimate time offsets to sub-millisecond accuracy.

  abstract  = {M-estimators are the de-facto standard method of robust estimation in robotics. They are easily incorporated into iterative non-linear least-squares estimation and provide seamless and effective handling of outliers in data. However, every M-estimators robust loss function has one or more tuning parameters that control the influence of different data. The choice of M-estimator and the manual tuning of these parameters is always a source of uncertainty when applying the technique to new data or a new problem. In this paper we develop the concept of self-tuning Mestimators. We first make the connection between many common M-estimators and elliptical probability distributions. This connection shows that the choice of M-estimator is an assumption that the residuals belong to a well-defined elliptical distribution. We exploit this implication in two ways. First, we develop an algorithm for tuning the M-estimator parameters during iterative optimization. Second, we show how to choose the correct M-estimator for your data by examining the likelihood of the data given the model. We fully derive these algorithms and show their behavior on a representative example of visual simultaneous localization and mapping.}

Existing place recognition approaches traditionally follow the feature-based bag-of-words paradigm in order to cut down on the richness of information in images. As structural information is typically ignored, such methods suffer from perceptual aliasing and reduced recall, due to the ambiguity of observations. In a bid to boost the robustness of appearance-based place recognition, we consider the world as a continuous constellation of visual words, while keeping track of their covisibility in a graph structure. Locations are queried based on their appearance, and modelled by their corresponding cluster of landmarks from the global covisibility graph, which retains important relational information about landmarks. Complexity is reduced by comparing locations by their graphs of visual words in a simplified manner. Test results show increased recall performance and robustness to noisy observations, compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

We present a semi supervised learning approach, where the robot learns its traversability capabilities from a human operating it. From this partially and only positive labeled training data, our approach infers a model for the traversability analysis, thereby requiring very little manual effort for the human. In practical experiments we show that our method can be used for robots that need to reliably navigate on dirt roads as well as for robots that have very restricted traversability capabilities.

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources. We demonstrate and evaluate our system over three challenging datasets, totalling 206km of outdoor travel. We demonstrate the system in a diverse range of lighting and weather conditions, scene clutter, camera occlusions, and permanent structural change in the environment.}

  abstract  = {Maps used for navigation often include a database of location descriptions for place recognition (loop closing), which permits bounded-error performance. A standard posegraph SLAM system adds a new entry for every new pose into the location database, which grows linearly and unbounded in time and thus becomes unsustainable. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new map-reduction approach that pre-constructs a fixed-size place-recognition database amenable to the limited storage and processing resources of the vehicle by exploiting the high-level structure of the environment as well as the vehicle motion. In particular, we introduce the concept of location utility which encapsulates the visitation probability of a location and its spatial distribution relative to nearby locations in the database as a measure of the value of potential loop-closure events to occur at that location. While finding the optimal reduced location database is NPhard, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm to sort all the locations in a map based on their relative utility without access to sensor measurements or the vehicle trajectory. This enables pre-determination of a generic, limited-size place-recognition database containing the N best locations in the environment. To validate the proposed approach, we develop an open-source street-map simulator using real city-map data and show that an accurate map (pose-graph) can be attained even when using a place-recognition database with only 1\% of the entries of the corresponding full database.}

In this setting, the robot must trade-off between exploring new area to complete the task and exploiting the existing information to maintain good localization. Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robots localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannons and Renyis definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannons entropy. We show that by using the proposed utility function, the robot and map uncertainties are smaller than using other existing methods.}

A defining aspect of night-time urban scenes is the presence and effect of artificial lighting be that in the form of street or interior lighting through windows. By building a model of the environment which includes a representation of the spatial location of every light source, localisation becomes possible using monocular cameras. One of the challenges we face is the gross change in light appearance as a function of distance due to flare, saturation and bleeding city lights certainly do not appear as point features. To overcome this, we model the appearance of each light as a function of vehicle location, using this to inform our data-association decisions and to regularise the cost function which is used to infer vehicle pose. In this way we develop a place-dependent but stable sensor model which is customised for the particular environment in which we are operating. We demonstrate that our system is able to localise successfully at night over 12 km in situations where a traditional point feature based system fails.}

For that reason, we accumulate shape information over time and register it in a common reference frame. Matching the resulting shapes requires a strategy for dealing with partial observations. We therefore investigate several distance functions and kernels that implement different such strategies and compare their matching performance in quantitative experiments. We show that the resulting representation achieves good results for a large variety of vision tasks, such as multi-class classification, person orientation estimation, and articulated body pose estimation, where robust 3D shape matching is essential.}

The approach is especially suited for large configuration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those found with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space, making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning from scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8\% less memory to store its experiences after 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.}

Our motivation here is to improve the performance of the popular Teach and Repeat paradigm [1] which has been shown to enable truly large-scale field operation. When using the taught route for localisation, it is often assumed the robot is following exactly, or is sufficiently close to, the original path, enabling successful localisation. However, what happens if it is not possible, or not desirable to exactly follow the mapped path? How far off the beaten track can the robot travel before it gets lost? We present an approach for assessing this localisation area around a taught route, which we refer to as the localisation envelope.

  abstract  = {In this paper we present an online approach to segmenting roads on large scale trajectories using only a monocular camera mounted on a car. We differ from popular 2D segmentation solutions which use single colour images and machine learning algorithms that require supervised training on huge image databases. Instead, we propose a novel approach that fuses 3D geometric data with appearance-based segmentation of 2D information in an automatic system. Our contribution is twofold: first, we propagate labels from frame to frame using depth priors of the segmented road avoiding user interaction most of the time; second, we transfer the segmented road labels to 3D laser point clouds. This reduces the complexity of stateof-the-art segmentation algorithms running on 3D Lidar data. Segmentation fails is in only 3\% of the cases over a sequence of 13,600 monocular images spanning an urban trajectory of more than 10km.}

  keywords  = {Computer Vision for Robotics and Automation},
  abstract  = {We consider detecting objects in an image by iteratively selecting from a set of arbitrarily shaped candidate regions. Our generic approach, which we term visual chunking, reasons about the locations of multiple object instances in an image while expressively describing object boundaries. We design an optimization criterion for measuring the performance of a list of such detections as a natural extension to a common per-instance metric. We present an efficient algorithm with provable performance for building a highquality list of detections from any candidate set of region-based proposals. We also develop a simple class-specific algorithm to generate a candidate region instance in near-linear time in the number of low-level superpixels that outperforms other region generating methods. In order to make predictions on novel images at testing time without access to ground truth, we develop learning approaches to emulate these algorithms behaviors. We demonstrate that our new approach outperforms sophisticated baselines on benchmark datasets.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents an approach to learning robot terrain assessment from human demonstration. An operator drives a robot for a short period of time, supervising the gathering of traversable and untraversable terrain data. After this initial training period, the robot can then predict the traversability of new terrain based on its experiences. We improve on current methods in two ways: first, we maintain a richer (higher-dimensional) representation of the terrain that is better able to distinguish between different training examples. Second, we use a Gaussian-process classifier for terrain assessment due to its superior introspective abilities (leading to better uncertainty estimates) when compared to other classifier methods in the literature. Our method is tested on real data and shown to outperform current methods both in classification accuracy and uncertainty estimation.}

  keywords  = {Computer Vision for Robotics and Automation, Mapping},
  abstract  = {This paper is about dense depthmap estimation using a monocular camera in workspaces with extensive textureless surfaces. Current state of the art techniques have been shown to work in real time with an admirable performance in desktop-size environments. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, when applied to larger indoor environments, performance often degrades. A common cause is the presence of large affine texture-less areas like by walls, floors, ceilings and drab objects such as chairs and tables. These produce noisy and worse still, grossly erroneous initial seeds for the depthmap that greatly impede successful optimisation. We solve this problem via the introduction of a new nonlocal higher-order regularisation term that enforces piecewise affine constraints between image pixels that are far apart in the image. This property leverages the observation that the depth at the edges of bland regions are often well estimated whereas their inner pixels are deeply problematic. A welcome by-product of our proposed technique is an estimate of the surface normals at each pixel. We will show that in terms of implementation, our algorithm is a natural extension of the often used variational approaches. We evaluate the proposed technique using real datasets for which we have ground truth models.}

  abstract  = {Practical mapping and navigation solutions for large indoor environments continue to rely on relatively expensive range scanners, because of their accuracy, range and field of view. Microsoft Kinect on the other hand is inexpensive, is easy to use and has high resolution, but suffers from high noise, shorter range and a limiting field of view. We present a mapping and navigation system that uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor as the sole source of range data and achieves performance comparable to state-of-theart LIDAR-based systems. We show how we circumvent the main limitations of Kinect to generate usable 2D maps of relatively large spaces and to enable robust navigation in changing and dynamic environments. We use the Benchmark for Robotic Indoor Navigation (BRIN) to quantify and validate the performance of our system.}

  keywords  = {Mapping, Computer Vision for Robotics and Automation},
  abstract  = {In this paper we address the problem of dense depth map estimation from sparse noisy range data to reconstruct large heterogeneous outdoor scenes. We propose a surface inpainting solution through energy minimisation with an adaptive selection of surface regularisers among a set of well known convex and non-convex regularisers. In fact, the selection of norm is pivotal with respect to the intrinsic surface characteristics. Our goal is to show how dense interpolation of sparse range data can be leveraged of more exotic and non-convex regularisers such as the log and logTGV [1] which can better capture the scene geometry. In contrast to state of the art solutions, we do not restrict ourselves to this set of norms, instead we search for the most apt norm for each semantically segmented part of the scene. Our energy model selection use Bayesian optimisation to learn the best choice of free parameters. This results in an adaptive model selection and the generalisation of well studied regularisation norms. We conclude with a detailed experimental analysis of our approach using a basis of four norms over a set of challenging outdoor scenes.}

  abstract  = {Real-world autonomous driving in city traffic must cope with dynamic environments including other agents with uncertain intentions. This poses a challenging decisionmaking problem, e.g., deciding when to perform a passing maneuver or how to safely merge into traffic. Previous work in the literature has typically approached the problem using adhoc solutions that do not consider the possible future states of other agents, and thus have difficulty scaling to complex traffic scenarios where the actions of participating agents are tightly conditioned on one another. In this paper we present multipolicy decision-making (MPDM), a decision-making algorithm that exploits knowledge from the autonomous driving domain to make decisions online for an autonomous vehicle navigating in traffic. By assuming the controlled vehicle and other traffic participants execute a policy from a set of plausible closedloop policies at every timestep, the algorithm selects the best available policy for the controlled vehicle to execute. We perform policy election using forward simulation of both the controlled vehicle and other agents, efficiently sampling from the high-likelihood outcomes of their interactions. We then score the resulting outcomes using a user-defined cost function to accommodate different driving preferences, and select the policy with the highest score. We demonstrate the algorithm on a realworld autonomous vehicle performing passing maneuvers and in a simulated merging scenario.}

The determinant-based measure of uncertainty is borrowed from the active SLAM literature. We also present in this chapter an overview of the active SLAM problem. Our path planning proposal does not require a priori knowledge of the environment due to the construction of the roadmap via a graph-based SLAM algorithm. We report experimental results of our proposal in four datasets that show its feasibility to obtain the minimum uncertainty path towards an autonomous navigation framework. We also show an improvement in the computation time with respect to the state of the art.}

  abstract  = {We propose a novel Large-Scale Direct SLAM algorithm for stereo cameras (Stereo LSD-SLAM) that runs in real-time at high frame rate on standard CPUs. In contrast to sparse interest-point based methods, our approach aligns images directly based on the photoconsistency of all highcontrast pixels, including corners, edges and high texture areas. It concurrently estimates the depth at these pixels from two types of stereo cues: Static stereo through the fixed-baseline stereo camera setup as well as temporal multi-view stereo exploiting the camera motion. By incorporating both disparity sources, our algorithm can even estimate depth of pixels that are under-constrained when only using fixed-baseline stereo. Using a fixed baseline, on the other hand, avoids scale-drift that typically occurs in pure monocular SLAM. We furthermore propose a robust approach to enforce illumination invariance, capable of handling aggressive brightness changes between frames greatly improving the performance in realistic settings. In experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on stereo SLAM benchmarks such as Kitti or challenging datasets from the EuRoC Challenge 3 for micro aerial vehicles.},

Semantic segmentation can enhance various subsequent tasks, such as (semantically assisted) person perception, (semantic) free space detection, (semantic) mapping, and (semantic) navigation.

We show that RGB-D segmentation is superior to processing RGB images solely and that it can still be performed in real time if the network architecture is carefully designed. We evaluate our proposed Efficient Scene Analysis Network (ESANet) on the common indoor datasets NYUv2 and SUNRGB-D and show that we reach state-of-the-art performance while enabling faster inference. Furthermore, our evaluation on the outdoor dataset Cityscapes shows that our approach is suitable for other areas of application as well. Finally, instead of presenting benchmark results only, we also show qualitative results in one of our indoor application scenarios.},

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate mean-field approximate inference for the Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offlinempost-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.}

  abstract = {Semantic annotations are vital for training models for object recognition, semantic segmentation or scene understanding. Unfortunately, pixelwise annotation of images at very large scale is labor-intensive and only little labeled data is available, particularly at instance level and for street scenes. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem by lifting the semantic instance labeling task from 2D into 3D. Given reconstructions from stereo or laser data, we annotate static 3D scene elements with rough bounding primitives and develop a model which transfers this information into the image domain. We leverage our method to obtain 2D labels for a novel suburban video dataset which we have collected, resulting in 400k semantic and instance image annotations. A comparison of our method to state-of-the-art label transfer baselines reveals that 3D information enables more efficient annotation while at the same time resulting in improved accuracy and time-coherent labels.}

In this paper, we present an algorithm that learns how to provide good route descriptions from a corpus of human-written directions. Using inverse reinforcement learning, our algorithm learns how to select the information for the description depending on the context of the route segment. The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.}

By using a fused volumetric surface reconstruction we achieve a much higher quality map over what would be achieved using raw RGB-D point clouds. In this paper we highlight three key techniques associated with applying a volumetric fusion-based mapping system to the SLAM problem in real time. First, the use of a GPU-based 3D cyclical buffer trick to efficiently extend dense every-frame volumetric fusion of depth maps to function over an unbounded spatial region. Second, overcoming camera pose estimation limitations in a wide variety of environments by combining both dense geometric and photometric camera pose constraints. Third, efficiently updating the dense map according to place recognition and subsequent loop closure constraints by the use of an 'as-rigid-as-possible' space deformation. We present results on a wide variety of aspects of the system and show through evaluation on de facto standard RGB-D benchmarks that our system performs strongly in terms of trajectory estimation, map quality and computational performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art systems.},

  abstract  = {We propose a real-time method for odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 2-axis lidar moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation can cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps can be built by off-line batch methods, often using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift and low-computational complexity without the need for high accuracy ranging or inertial measurements. The key idea in obtaining this level of performance is the division of the complex problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, by two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high frequency but low fidelity to estimate velocity of the lidar. Another algorithm runs at a frequency of an order of magnitude lower for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows the method to map in real-time. The method has been evaluated by a large set of experiments as well as on the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the method can achieve accuracy at the level of state of the art offline batch methods.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.}

  abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets. }

This work proposes a new algorithm that treats both problems jointly. The sole input is a sequence of dense 3D measurements as returned by multi-layer laser scanners or time-of-flight cameras. A major characteristic of the proposed approach is its applicability to any type of environment since specific object models are not used at any algorithm stage. More specifically, precise localization in non-flat environments is possible as well as the detection and tracking of e.g. trams or recumbent bicycles. Moreover, 3D shape estimation of moving objects is inherent to the proposed method. Thorough evaluation is conducted on a vehicular platform with a mounted Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles operating in real-world industrial environments have to overcome numerous challenges, chief among which is the creation and maintenance of consistent 3D world models. This paper focuses on a particularly important challenge: mapping in dynamic environments. We introduce several improvements to the recently proposed Normal Distributions Transform Occupancy Map (NDT-OM) aimed for efficient mapping in dynamic environments. A careful consistency analysis is given based on convergence and similarity metrics specifically designed for evaluation of NDT maps in dynamic environments. We show that in the context of mapping with known poses the proposed method results in improved consistency and in superior runtime performance, when compared against 3D occupancy grids at the same size and resolution. Additionally, we demonstrate that NDT-OM features real-time performance in a highly dynamic 3D mapping and tracking scenario with centimeter accuracy over a 1.5km trajectory.},

  abstract  = {The Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) scan registration algorithm models the environment as a set of Gaussian distributions and generates the Gaussians by discretizing the environment into voxels. With the standard approach, the NDT algorithm has a tendency to have poor convergence performance for even modest initial transformation error. In this work, a segmented greedy cluster NDT (SGC-NDT) variant is proposed, which uses natural features in the environment to generate Gaussian clusters for the NDT algorithm. By segmenting the ground plane and clustering the remaining features, the SGC-NDT approach results in a smooth and continuous cost function which guarantees that the optimization will converge. Experiments show that the SGC-NDT algorithm results in scan registrations with higher accuracy and better convergence properties when compared against other state-ofthe-art methods for both urban and forested environments.},

  abstract  = {We show how to recover the 6-DOF transform between two sensors mounted rigidly on a moving body, a form of extrinsic calibration useful for data fusion. Our algorithm takes noisy, per-sensor incremental egomotion observations (i.e., incremental poses) as input and produces as output an estimate of the maximum-likelihood 6-DOF calibration relating the sensors and accompanying uncertainty. The 6-DOF transformation sought can be represented effectively as a unit dual quaternion with 8 parameters subject to two constraints. Noise is explicitly modeled (via the Lie algebra), yielding a constrained Fisher Information Matrix and Cramer-Rao Lower Bound. The result is an analysis of motion degeneracy and a singularity-free optimization procedure. The method requires only that the sensors travel together along a motion path that is non-degenerate. It does not require that the sensors be synchronized, have overlapping fields of view, or observe common features. It does not require construction of a global reference frame or solving SLAM. In practice, from hand-held motion of RGB-D cameras, the method recovered inter-camera calibrations accurate to within 0.014 m and 0.022 radians (about 1 cm and 1 degree).}

  abstract  = {Modern service robots are designed to be deployed by end-users and not to be monitored by experts during operation. Most service robotics applications require reliable navigation capabilities of the robot. The calibration parameters of a mobile robot play a substantial role in navigation tasks. Often these parameters are subject to variations that depend either on environmental changes or on the wear of the devices. In this paper, we propose an approach to simultaneously estimate a map of the environment, the position of the on-board sensors of the robot, and its kinematic parameters. Our method requires no prior knowledge about the environment and relies only on a rough initial guess of the platform parameters. The proposed approach performs on-line estimation of the parameters and it is able to adapt to non-stationary changes of the configuration. Our approach has been implemented and is used on the EUROPA robot, a service robot operating in urban environments. In addition to that, we tested our approach in simulated environments and on a wide range of real world data using different types of robotic platforms.}

We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

The wide range of applications of place recognition includes localization (determine the initial pose), SLAM (detect loop closures), and change detection in dynamic environments. In the past, only relatively little work has been carried out to attack this problem using 3D range data and the majority of approaches focuses on detecting similar structures without estimating relative poses. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on 3D range data that is able to reliably detect previously seen parts of the environment and at the same time calculates an accurate transformation between the corresponding scan-pairs. Our system uses the estimated transformation to evaluate a candidate and in this way to more robustly reject false positives for place recognition. We present an extensive set of experiments using publicly available datasets in which we compare our system to other state-of-theart approaches.},

They are rigidly linked and can be moved. The most representative application is the mobile robotics domain. The calibration procedure consists in maneuvering the system while each camera observes a static scene. A linear solution derived from hand eye calibration scheme is proposed to compute an initial estimate of the extrinsic parameters. The main contribution is a specific bundle adjustment which refines both the scene geometry and the extrinsic parameters. Finally, an efficient implementation of the specific bundle adjustment step is defined for online calibration purpose. The proposed approach is validated with both synthetic and real data.}

We describe a new visual fiducial system that uses a 2D bar code style tag, allowing full 6 DOF localization of features from a single image. Our system improves upon previous systems, incorporating a fast and robust line detection system, a stronger digital coding system, and greater robustness to occlusion, warping, and lens distortion. While similar in concept to the ARTag system, our method is fully open and the algorithms are documented in detail.}

In pursuing my work, I have mostly focused on problems and solution techniques (algorithms) that have practical real-world applications and that work well in practice. Thus, this book has more emphasis on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and less on more esoteric mathematics that has intrinsic elegance but less practical applicability. This book is suitable for teaching a senior-level undergraduate course in computer vision to students in both computer science and electrical engineering. I prefer students to have either an image processing or a computer graphics course as a prerequisite so that they can spend less time learning general background mathematics and more time studying computer vision techniques. The book is also suitable for teaching graduate-level courses in computer vision (by delving into the more demanding application and algorithmic areas) and as a general reference to fundamental techniques and the recent research literature. To this end, I have attempted wherever possible to at least cite the newest research in each sub-field, even if technical details are too complex to cover in the book itself.}

  abstract  = {Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience. We need learning in cases where we cannot directly write a computer program to solve a given problem, but need example data or experience. One case where learning is necessary is when human expertise does not exist, or when humans are unable to explain their expertise. Consider the recognition of spoken speech—that is, converting the acoustic speech signal to an ASCII text; we can do this task seemingly without any difficulty, but we are unable to explain how we do it. Different people utter the same word differently due to differences in age, gender, or accent. In machine learning, the approach is to collect a large collection of sample utterances from different people and learn to map these to words. The book discusses many learning methods that have their bases in different fields: statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. In the past, research in these different communities followed different paths with different emphases. In this book, the aim is to incorporate them together to give a unified treatment of the problems and the proposed solutions to them. This is an introductory textbook, intended for senior undergraduate and graduate-level courses on machine learning, as well as engineers working in the industry who are interested in the application of these methods. The prerequisites are courses on computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. The aim is to have all learning algorithms sufficiently explained so it will be a small step from the equations given in the book to a computer program. For some cases, pseudocode of algorithms are also included to make this task easier.}

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicle navigation in dynamic urban environments requires localization accuracy exceeding that available from GPS-based inertial guidance systems. We have shown previously that GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data can be used to generate a high-resolution infrared remittance ground map that can be subsequently used for localization [4]. We now propose an extension to this approach that yields substantial improvements over previous work in vehicle localization, including higher precision, the ability to learn and improve maps over time, and increased robustness to environment changes and dynamic obstacles. Specifically, we model the environment, instead of as a spatial grid of fixed infrared remittance values, as a probabilistic grid whereby every cell is represented as its own gaussian distribution over remittance values. Subsequently, Bayesian inference is able to preferentially weight parts of the map most likely to be stationary and of consistent angular reflectivity, thereby reducing uncertainty and catastrophic errors. Furthermore, by using offline SLAM to align multiple passes of the same environment, possibly separated in time by days or even months, it is possible to build an increasingly robust understanding of the world that can be then exploited for localization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using these algorithms to localize our vehicle against probabilistic maps in various dynamic environments, achieving RMS accuracy in the 10cm-range and thus outperforming previous work. Importantly, this approach has enabled us to autonomously drive our vehicle for hundreds of miles in dense traffic on narrow urban roads which were formerly unnavigable with previous localization methods.},

  abstract  = {The problem of place recognition appears in different mobile robot navigation problems including localization, SLAM, or change detection in dynamic environments. Whereas this problem has been studied intensively in the context of robot vision, relatively few approaches are available for threedimensional range data. In this paper, we present a novel and robust method for place recognition based on range images. Our algorithm matches a given 3D scan against a database using point features and scores potential transformations by comparing significant points in the scans. A further advantage of our approach is that the features allow for a computation of the relative transformations between scans which is relevant for registration processes. Our approach has been implemented and tested on different 3D data sets obtained outdoors. In several experiments we demonstrate the advantages of our approach also in comparison to existing techniques.},

Most of the sensor models for range sensors proposed in the past either consider the individual beam measurements independently or apply uni-modal models to represent the likelihood function. In this paper we present an approach that learns place-dependent sensor models for entire range scans using Gaussian mixture models. To deal with the high dimensionality of the measurement space, we utilize principle component analysis for dimensionality reduction. In practical experiments carried out with data obtained from a real robot we demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms existing and popular sensor models.}

To do so, proximity sensor such as laser range finders or sonars are typically employed. Cameras are a cheap and lightweight alternative to such sensors, but do not offer proximity information directly. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning the relationship between range measurements and visual features extracted from a single monocular camera image. As the learning engine, we apply Gaussian processes, a non- parametric learning technique that not only yields the most likely range prediction corresponding to a certain visual input but also the predictive uncertainty. This information, in turn, can be utilized in an extended grid-based mapping scheme to update a model of the environment more gently where the predictions are unreliable. In practical experiments carried out with a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera system in different environments, we show that our system is able to predict range scans accurate enough to construct maps of the environment.}

  abstract  = {Many urban navigation applications (e.g., autonomous navigation, driver assistance systems) can benefit greatly from localization with centimeter accuracy. Yet such accuracy cannot be achieved reliably with GPS-based inertial guidance systems, specifically in urban settings. We propose a technique for high-accuracy localization of moving vehicles that utilizes maps of urban environments. Our approach integrates GPS, IMU, wheel odometry, and LIDAR data acquired by an instrumented vehicle, to generate high-resolution environment maps. Offline relaxation techniques similar to recent SLAM methods [2, 10, 13, 14, 21, 30] are employed to bring the map into alignment at intersections and other regions of self-overlap. By reducing the final map to the flat road surface, imprints of other vehicles are removed. The result is a 2-D surface image of ground reflectivity in the infrared spectrum with 5cm pixel resolution. To localize a moving vehicle relative to these maps, we present a particle filter method for correlating LIDAR measurements with this map. As we show by experimentation, the resulting relative accuracies exceed that of conventional GPS-IMU-odometry-based methods by more than an order of magnitude. Specifically, we show that our algorithm is effective in urban environments, achieving reliable real-time localization with accuracy in the 10-centimeter range. Experimental results are provided for localization in GPS-denied environments, during bad weather, and in dense traffic.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the problem of detecting changes in a 3-d scene from a sequence of images, taken by cameras with arbitrary but known pose. No prior knowledge of the state of normal appearance and geometry of object surfaces is assumed, and abnormal changes can occur in any image of the sequence. To the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to address the change detection problem in such a general framework. Existing change detection algorithms that exploit multiple image viewpoints typically can detect only motion changes or assume a planar world geometry which cannot cope effectively with appearance changes due to occlusion and un-modeled 3-d scene geometry (egomotion parallax). The approach presented here can manage the complications of unknown and sometimes changing world surfaces by maintaining a 3-d voxel-based model, where probability distributions for surface occupancy and image appearance are stored in each voxel. The probability distributions at each voxel are continuously updated as new images are received. The key question of convergence of this joint estimation problem is answered by a formal proof based on realistic assumptions about the nature of real world scenes. A series of experiments are presented that evaluate change detection accuracy under laboratory controlled conditions as well as aerial reconnaissance scenarios.}

  keywords  = {Book, Motion Planning},
  abstract  = {Due to many exciting developments in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory, three topics that were once quite distinct are presently on a collision course. In robotics, motion planning was originally concerned with problems such as how to move a piano from one room to another in a house without hitting anything. The field has grown, however, to include complications such as uncertainties, multiple bodies, and dynamics. In artificial intelligence, planning originally meant a search for a sequence of logical operators or actions that transform an initial world state into a desired goal state. Presently, planning extends beyond this to include many decision-theoretic ideas such as Markov decision processes, imperfect state information, and game-theoretic equilibria. Although control theory has traditionally been concerned with issues such as stability, feedback, and optimality, there has been a growing interest in designing algorithms that find feasible open-loop trajectories for nonlinear systems. In some of this work, the term motion planning has been applied, with a different interpretation of its use in robotics. Thus, even though each originally considered different problems, the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory have expanded their scope to share an interesting common ground. In this text, I use the term planning in a broad sense that encompasses this common ground. This does not, however, imply that the term is meant to cover everything important in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory. The presentation focuses on algorithm issues relating to planning. Within robotics, the focus is on designing algorithms that generate useful motions by processing complicated geometric models. Within artificial intelligence, the focus is on designing systems that use decision-theoretic models compute appropriate actions. Within control theory, the focus is on algorithms that compute feasible trajectories for systems, with some additional coverage of feedback and optimality. Analytical techniques, which account for the majority of control theory literature, are not the main focus here. The phrase planning and control is often used to identify complementary issues in developing a system. Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. In this text, I make no such distinctions. Ignoring historical connotations that come with the terms, planning or control can be used in terchangeably. Either refers to some kind of decision making in this text, with no associated notion of high or low level. A hierarchical approach can be developed, and either level could be called planning or control without any difference in meaning.}

The goal of this book is to provide a systematic and unified treatment of this area. Gaussian processes provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. This gives advantages with respect to the interpretation of model predictions and provides a wellfounded framework for learning and model selection. Theoretical and practical developments of over the last decade have made Gaussian processes a serious competitor for real supervised learning applications.}

  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th Turkish-German Joint Geodetic Days},
  year      = {2006},
  abstract  = {This paper presents a new full automatic approach for the relative orientation of several digital images taken with a calibrated camera. This approach uses new algorithms for feature extraction and relative orientation developed in the last few years. There is no need for special markers in the scene nor for approximate values of the orientation data. We use the point operator developed by D. G. Lowe (2004), which extracts points with scale- and rotation-invariant descriptors (SIFT-features). These descriptors allow a successful matching of image points even when dealing with highly convergent or rotated images. The approach consists of the following steps: After extracting image points on all images a matching between every image pair is calculated using the SIFT parameters only. No prior information about the pose of the images or the overlapping parts of the images is used. For every image pair a relative orientation is computed with the help of a RANSAC procedure. Here we use the new 5-point algorithm from D. Nister (2004). Out of this set of orientations approximate values for the orientation parameters and the object coordinates are calculated by computing the relative scales and transforming the models into a common coordinate system. Several tests are made in order to get a reliable input for the currently final step: a bundle block adjustment. The paper discusses the practical impacts of the used algorithms. Examples of different indoor- and outdoor-scenes including a data set of oblique images taken from a helicopter are presented and the results of the approach applied to these data sets are evaluated. These results show that the approach can be used for a wide range of scenes with different types of the image geometry and taken with different types of cameras including inexpensive consumer cameras. In particular we investigate in the robustness of the algorithms, e. g. in geometric tests on image triplets. Further developments like the use of image pyramids with a modified matching are discussed in the outlook. Literature: David G.

This novel metric works well with both common formulations AX=XB and AX=ZB, and makes use of them in accordance with the nature of the problem. The metric also adapts itself to the system precision characteristics. The method is compared in performance to earlier approaches}

These techniques include effective map-building capabilities, a method for obstacle avoidance based on a combination of range and visual information, and advanced Web and onboard robot interfaces. In addition to video streams, the system provides high-resolution virtual reality visualizations that also include the people in the vicinity of the robot. This increases the flexibility of the interface and simultaneously allows a user to understand the navigation actions of the robot. The techniques described in this article have been successfully deployed within the EU-funded projects TOURBOT and WebFAIR, which aimed to develop interactive tour-guided robots able to serve Web as well as on-site visitors. Technical developments in the framework of these projects have resulted in robust and reliable systems that have been demonstrated and validated in real-world conditions. Equally important, the system setup time has been drastically reduced, facilitating its porting to new environments.}

  abstract  = {This book provides a comprehensive introduction into the emerging field of probabilistic robotics. Probabilistic robotics is a subfield of robotics concerned with perception and control. It relies on statistical techniques for representing information and making decisions. By doing so, it accommodates the uncertainty that arises in most contemporary robotics applications. In recent years, probabilistic techniques have become one of the dominant paradigms for algorithm design in robotics. This monograph provides a first comprehensive introduction into some of the major techniques in this field. This book has a strong focus on algorithms. All algorithms in this book are based on a single overarching mathematical foundation: Bayes rule, and its temporal extension known as Bayes filters. This unifying mathematical framework is the core commonality of probabilistic algorithms.}

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a first- or second- year undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single field, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.}

This book covers the C++ standard, the international standard published as ISO/IEC 14882:1998(E), Programming Languages—C++, plus Technical Corrigendum 1. Many implementations of C++ extend the language and standard library. Except for brief mentions of language and library extensions in the appendixes, this book covers only the standard. The standard library is large—it includes strings, containers, common algorithms, and much more—but it omits much that is commonplace in computing today: concurrency, network protocols, database access, graphics, windows, and so on. See Appendix B for information about nonstandard libraries that provide additional functionality. This book is a reference. It is not a tutorial. Newcomers to C++ might find portions of this book difficult to understand. Although each section contains some advice on idioms and the proper use of certain language constructs, the main focus is on the reference material.}

The problem of the IDC algorithm is that there is no good way to estimate a covariance matrix of the position estimate, which prohibits an effective fusion with other position estimates of other sensors. This paper presents two new ways to estimate the covariance matrix. The first estimates the covariance matrix from the Hessian matrix of the error function minimized by the scan-matching algorithm. The second one, which is an off-line method, estimates the covariance matrix of a specific scan, from a specific position by simulating and matching scans around the position. Simulation results show that the covariance matrix provided by the off-line method fully corresponds with the real one. Some preliminary tests on real data indicate that the off-line method gives a good quality value of a specific scan position, which is of great value in map building.}

The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scaling issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polarto Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.}

This tutorial is designed to provide developers of graphical systems with a basic understanding of this important mathematical tool.While the Kalman filter has been around for about 30 years, it (and related optimal estimators) have recently started popping up in a wide variety of computer graphics applications. These applications span from simulating musical instruments in VR, to head tracking, to extracting lip motion from video sequences of speakers, to fitting spline surfaces over collections of points. The Kalman filter is the best possible (optimal) estimator for a large class of problems and a very effective and useful estimator for an even larger class. With a few conceptual tools, the Kalman filter is actually very easy to use. We will present an intuitive approach to this topic that will enable developers to approach the extensive literature with confidence.},

Traditional motion planning algorithms often assume that a mobile robot can track its position reliably, however, in real world situations, reliable localization may not always be feasible. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide one way to maximize the certainty of reaching the goal state, but at the cost of computational intractability for large state spaces. The method we propose explicitly models the uncertainty of the robot’s position as a state variable, and generates trajectories through the augmented pose-uncertainty space. By minimizing the positional uncertainty at the goal, the robot reduces the likelihood it becomes lost. We demonstrate experimentally that coastal navigation reduces the uncertainty at the goal, especially with degraded localization}

Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of l-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.}

From the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {The authors describe a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.}

  abstract = {Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) is a visual odometry method based on a novel, highly accurate sparse and direct structure and motion formulation. It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry-represented as inverse depth in a reference frame-and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on essentially featureless walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.},

Our approach registers two consecutive RGB-D frames directly upon each other by minimizing the photometric error. We estimate the camera motion using non-linear minimization in combination with a coarse-to-fine scheme. To allow for noise and outliers in the image data, we propose to use a robust error function that reduces the influence of large residuals. Furthermore, our formulation allows for the inclusion of a motion model which can be based on prior knowledge, temporal filtering, or additional sensors like an IMU. Our method is attractive for robots with limited computational resources as it runs in real-time on a single CPU core and has a small, constant memory footprint. In an extensive set of experiments carried out both on a benchmark dataset and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our approach is more accurate and robust than previous methods.

While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks,  processed  in parallel threads  on a dual-core  computer:  one  thread deals with the task  of  robustly tracking  erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.}

Here, taking advantage of the complementary error characteristics of LIDAR range sensing and dense stereo, we present a probabilistic method for fusing sparse 3D LIDAR data with stereo images to provide accurate dense depth maps and uncertainty estimates in real-time. We evaluate the method on data collected from a small urban autonomous vehicle and the KITTI dataset, providing accuracy results competitive with state-of-the-art stereo approaches and credible uncertainty estimates that do not misrepresent the true errors, and demonstrate real-time operation on a range of low-power GPU systems.}

  abstract  = {Most existing approaches to indoor localization focus on using either cameras or laser scanners as the primary sensor for pose estimation. In scan matching based localization, finding scan point correspondences across scans is challenging as individual scan points lack unique attributes. In camera based localization, one has to deal with images with few or no visual features as well as scale factor ambiguities to recover absolute distances. In this paper, we develop multimodal approaches for two indoor localization problems by fusing a camera and laser scanners in order to alleviate the drawbacks of each individual modality. For our first problem we recover 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of a camera-laser rig on a rolling cart in a 2D plane, by using visual odometry to facilitate scan correspondence estimation. We demonstrate this approach to result in a 0.3\% loop closure error for a 60m loop around the interior corridor of a building. In our second problem, we recover 6 DoF of a human operator carrying a backpack system mounted with sensors in 3D, by merging rotation estimates from scan matching and translation estimates from visual odometry, resulting in a 1\% loop closure error.}

We first establish putative point correspondence in the high dimensional feature space and then use these correspondences in a random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework to obtain an initial rigid body transformation that aligns the two scans. This initial transformation is then refined in a generalized iterative closest point (ICP) framework. The proposed method is completely data driven and does not require any initial guess on the transformation. We present results from a real world dataset collected by a vehicle equipped with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera.},

We then use this framework to model locally planar surface structure from both scans instead of just the "model" scan as is typically done with the point-to-plane method. This can be thought of as 'plane-to-plane'. The new approach is tested with both simulated and real-world data and is shown to outperform both standard ICP and point-to-plane. Furthermore, the new approach is shown to be more robust to incorrect correspondences, and thus makes it easier to tune the maximum match distance parameter present in most variants of ICP. In addition to the demonstrated performance improvement, the proposed model allows for more expressive probabilistic models to be incorporated into the ICP framework. While maintaining the speed and simplicity of ICP, the Generalized-ICP could also allow for the addition of outlier terms, measurement noise, and other probabilistic techniques to increase robustness.}

The proposed on-line method starts with visual odometry to estimate the ego-motion and to register point clouds from a scanning lidar at a high frequency but low fidelity. Then, scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously.We show results with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the KITTI odometry benchmark. Our proposed method is ranked #1 on the benchmark in terms of average translation and rotation errors, with a 0.75\% of relative position drift. In addition to comparison of the motion estimation accuracy, we evaluate robustness of the method when the sensor suite moves at a high speed and is subject to significant ambient lighting changes.}

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.   The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters}

  abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.}

  abstract = { Most approaches to robot localization rely on low-level geometric features such as points, lines, and planes. In this paper, we use object recognition to obtain semantic information from the robot’s sensors and consider the task of localizing the robot within a prior map of landmarks, which are annotated with semantic labels. As object recognition algorithms miss detections and produce false alarms, correct data association between the detections and the landmarks on the map is central to the semantic localization problem. Instead of the traditional vector-based representation, we propose a sensor model, which encodes the semantic observations via random finite sets and enables a unified treatment of missed detections, false alarms, and data association. Our second contribution is to reduce the problem of computing the likelihood of a set-valued observation to the problem of computing a matrix permanent. It is this crucial transformation that allows us to solve the semantic localization problem with a polynomial-time approximation to the set-based Bayes filter. Finally, we address the active semantic localization problem, in which the observer’s trajectory is planned in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the localization process. The performance of our approach is demonstrated in simulation and in real environments using deformable-part-model-based object detectors. Robust global localization from semantic observations is demonstrated for a mobile robot, for the Project Tango phone, and on the KITTI visual odometry dataset. Comparisons are made with the traditional lidar-based geometric Monte Carlo localization. }

  abstract = { Autonomous robotic manipulation in clutter is challenging. A large variety of objects must be perceived in complex scenes, where they are partially occluded and embedded among many distractors, often in restricted spaces. To tackle these challenges, we developed a deep-learning approach that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. The manipulation scenes are captured with RGB-D cameras, for which we developed a depth fusion method. Employing pretrained features makes learning from small annotated robotic datasets possible. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets: one captured for the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016, where our team NimbRo came in second in the Stowing and third in the Picking task; and one captured in disaster-response scenarios. The experiments show that object detection and semantic segmentation complement each other and can be combined to yield reliable object perception. }

  abstract = {Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However, larger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede research and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a potential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload must be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In this paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained networks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this result, we adopt a linear scaling rule for adjusting learning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple techniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using commodity hardware, our implementation achieves ~90\% scaling efficiency when moving from 8 to 256 GPUs. This system enables us to train visual recognition models on internet-scale data with high efficiency.}

We demonstrate that the existing datasets and evaluation protocols do not specify unambiguously all aspects of evaluation, leading to ambiguities and inconsistencies in results reported in the literature. Furthermore, these datasets are nearly saturated due to the recent improvements in local descriptors obtained by learning them from large annotated datasets. Therefore, we introduce a new large dataset suitable for training and testing modern descriptors, together with strictly defined evaluation protocols in several tasks such as matching, retrieval and classification. This allows for more realistic, and thus more reliable comparisons in different application scenarios. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art descriptors and analyse their properties. We show that a simple normalisation of traditional hand-crafted descriptors can boost their performance to the level of deep learning based descriptors within a realistic benchmarks evaluation.},

We present the following three principal contributions. First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the "Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors" image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we develop a training procedure, based on a new weakly supervised ranking loss, to learn parameters of the architecture in an end-to-end manner from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine. Finally, we show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms non-learnt image representations and off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on two challenging place recognition benchmarks, and improves over current state-of-the-art compact image representations on standard image retrieval benchmarks.},

We describe several extensions to existing dense SLAM techniques that allow us to operate in real-time onboard memory constrained robotic platforms. Our primary contribution is a memory management algorithm that scales to large scenes without being limited by GPU memory resources. Moreover, by integrating a visualinertial odometry system, we robustly track the camera pose even on an agile platform such as a quadrotor UAV. Our robust camera tracking framework can deal with fast camera motions and varying environments by relying on depth, color and inertial motion cues. Global consistency is achieved via regular checking for loop closures in conjunction with a pose graph, as a basis for corrective deformation of the 3D map. Our efficient SLAM system is capable of producing highly dense meshes up to 5mm resolution at rates close to 60Hz fully onboard a UAV. Experimental validations both in simulation and on a real-world platform, show that our approach is fast, more robust and more memory efficient than state-of-the-art techniques, while obtaining better or comparable accuracy.}

  abstract  = {Many modern 3D reconstruction methods accumulate information volumetrically using truncated signed distance functions. While this usually imposes a regular grid with fixed voxel size, not all parts of a scene necessarily need to be represented at the same level of detail. For example, a flat table needs less detail than a highly structured keyboard on it. We introduce a novel representation for the volumetric 3D data that uses hash functions rather than trees for accessing individual blocks of the scene, but which still provides different resolution levels. We show that our data structure provides efficient access and manipulation functions that can be very well parallelised, and also describe an automatic way of choosing appropriate resolutions for different parts of the scene. We embed the novel representation in a system for simultaneous localisation and mapping from RGB-D imagery and also investigate the implications of the irregular grid on interpolation routines. Finally we evaluate our system in experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art representation accuracy at typical framerates around 100 Hz, along with 40\% memory savings.}

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5\% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6\% error on the test set) and 17.3\% top-1 error on the validation set.}

  abstract = {Understanding the growth and development of
              individual plants is of central importance in modern
              agriculture, crop breeding, and crop science. To this
              end, using 3D data for plant analysis has gained
              attention over the last years. High-resolution point
              clouds offer the potential to derive a variety of
              plant traits, such as plant height, biomass, as well
              as the number and size of relevant plant organs.
              Periodically scanning the plants even allows for
              performing spatio-temporal growth analysis. However,
              highly accurate 3D point clouds from plants recorded
              at different growth stages are rare, and acquiring
              this kind of data is costly. Besides, advanced plant
              analysis methods from machine learning require
              annotated training data and thus generate intense
              manual labor before being able to perform an
              analysis. To address these issues, we present with
              this dataset paper a multi-temporal dataset featuring
              high-resolution registered point clouds of maize and
              tomato plants, which we manually labeled for computer
              vision tasks, such as for instance segmentation and
              3D reconstruction, providing approximately 260
              million labeled 3D points. To highlight the usability
              of the data and to provide baselines for other
              researchers, we show a variety of applications
              ranging from point cloud segmentation to non-rigid
              registration and surface reconstruction. We believe
              that our dataset will help to develop new algorithms
              to advance the research for plant phenotyping, 3D
              reconstruction, non-rigid registration, and deep
              learning on raw point clouds. The dataset is freely

Other aspects like runtime and memory footprint are arguably as important for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Motivated by this observation and inspired by recent works that tackle multiple tasks with a single integrated architecture, in this paper we present a real-time efficient implementation based on ENet that solves three autonomous driving related tasks at once: semantic scene segmentation, instance segmentation and monocular depth estimation. Our approach builds upon a branched ENet architecture with a shared encoder but different decoder branches for each of the three tasks. The presented method can run at 21 fps at a resolution of 1024x512 on the Cityscapes dataset without sacrificing accuracy compared to running each task separately.}

  abstract = {Different to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation assigns unique labels to each individual instance of the same class. In this work, we propose a novel recurrent fully convolutional network architecture for tracking such instance segmentations over time. The network architecture incorporates convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRU) into a stacked hourglass network to utilize temporal video information. Furthermore, we train the network with a novel embedding loss based on cosine similarities, such that the network predicts unique embeddings for every instance throughout videos. Afterwards, these embeddings are clustered among subsequent video frames to create the final tracked instance segmentations. We evaluate the recurrent hourglass network by segmenting left ventricles in MR videos of the heart, where it outperforms a network that does not incorporate video information. Furthermore, we show applicability of the cosine embedding loss for segmenting leaf instances on still images of plants. Finally, we evaluate the framework for instance segmentation and tracking on six datasets of the ISBI celltracking challenge, where it shows state-of-the-art performance.}

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.}

  abstract = {We propose an online object-level SLAM system which builds a persistent and accurate 3D graph map of arbitrary reconstructed objects. As an RGB-D camera browses a cluttered indoor scene, Mask-RCNN instance segmentations are used to initialise compact per-object Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) reconstructions with object size-dependent resolutions and a novel 3D foreground mask. Reconstructed objects are stored in an optimisable 6DoF pose graph which is our only persistent map representation. Objects are incrementally refined via depth fusion, and are used for tracking, relocalisation and loop closure detection. Loop closures cause adjustments in the relative pose estimates of object instances, but no intra-object warping. Each object also carries semantic information which is refined over time and an existence probability to account for spurious instance predictions. We demonstrate our approach on a hand-held RGB-D sequence from a cluttered office scene with a large number and variety of object instances, highlighting how the system closes loops and makes good use of existing objects on repeated loops. We quantitatively evaluate the trajectory error of our system against a baseline approach on the RGB-D SLAM benchmark, and qualitatively compare reconstruction quality of discovered objects on the YCB video dataset. Performance evaluation shows our approach is highly memory efficient and runs online at 4-8Hz (excluding relocalisation) despite not being optimised at the software level.}

  abstract  = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections--one between each layer and its subsequent layer--our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR- 10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet.}

  abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions.   Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train.   In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.

  abstract = {The ability to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation in real-time is of paramount importance in mobile applications. Recent deep neural networks aimed at this task have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of floating point operations and have long run-times that hinder their usability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet (efficient neural network), created specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. ENet is up to 18$\times$ faster, requires 75$\times$ less FLOPs, has 79$\times$ less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models. We have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster.}

  abstract  = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set and demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art via to carefully factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.}

  abstract = {Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), including 2D and 3D FCNs, serve as the back-bone in many volumetric image segmentation. However, 2D convolutions can not fully leverage the spatial information along the third dimension while 3D convolutions suffer from high computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of a 2D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3D counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We formulate the learning process of H-DenseUNet in an end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion (HFF) layer. We extensively evaluated our method on the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge and 3DIRCADb Dataset. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance for liver segmentation even with a single model.}

  abstract  = {Selective weeding is one of the key challenges in the field of agriculture robotics. To accomplish this task, a farm robot should be able to accurately detect plants and to distinguish them between crop and weeds. Most of the promising state-of-the-art approaches make use of appearance-based models trained on large annotated datasets. Unfortunately, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is an extremely time consuming task, actually penalizing the usage of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we face this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e., crop and weed species, type of soil, light conditions). More specifically, by tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used to train the model or to supplement real-world images. We validate the proposed methodology by using as testbed a modern deep learning based image segmentation architecture. We compare the classification results obtained using both real and synthetic images as training data. The reported results confirm the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.},

This work demonstrates a novel labeling approach designed to maximize labeling accuracy whilst needing to label as few images as possible.

  abstract  = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation.  Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning.  We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models.  We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task.  We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.  Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

  abstract  = {In this system paper we present a novel approach for autonomous, mobile manipulation for agricultural robots. Our target application is mechanical weed control which for example is needed in organic farming. Today, this task is often performed by field workers, whose availability is declining and the quality of their work differs greatly. In addition, manual weeding is a very tedious task with adverse health effects. Hence, mechanical weed control is considered as a prime example for automation. One of the challenges in order to perform the task efficiently is the need for fast plant detection and precise treatment of single plants with a mobile manipulator. The unstructured environment and rough field conditions raise additional challenges. We introduce a first system concept and control design known to handle these issues. In particular, high speed image processing and visual servoing are applied to precisely position a specially designed weeding tool. To evaluate the performance of the mobile manipulator we run experiments with a mobile test vehicle in field-like conditions and demonstrate that our system can treat single plants in less than 1s as it is required to be competitive.},

Here, we are concerned with providing a small unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) the ability to localize itself within a 2.5D aerial map generated from imagery captured by a low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We consider the scenario where GPS is unavailable and appearance-based scene changes may have occurred between the UAV's flight and the start of the UGV's mission. We present a GPS-free solution to this localization problem that is robust to appearance shifts by exploiting high-level, semantic representations of image and depth data. Using data gathered at an urban test site, we empirically demonstrate that our technique yields results within five meters of a GPS-based approach.}

  abstract = {Abstract Monte Carlo localization (MCL) uses a reference map to estimate a pose of a ground robot in outdoor environments. However, MCL shows low performance when it uses an elevation map built by an aerial mapping system because three-dimensional (3D) environments are observed differently from the air and the ground and such an elevation map cannot represent outdoor environments in detail. Although other types of maps have been proposed to improve localization performance, an elevation map is still used as the main reference map in some applications. Therefore, we propose a new feature to improve localization performance with an elevation map. This feature is extracted from 3D range data and represents the part of an object that can be commonly observed from both the air and the ground. Therefore, this feature is likely to be accurately matched with an elevation map, and the average error of this feature is much smaller than that of unclassified sensing data. Experimental results in real environments show that the success rate of global localization increased and the error of local tracking decreased. Thus, the proposed feature can be very useful for localization of an outdoor ground robot when an elevation map is used as a reference map. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of globally localizing and tracking the pose of a camera-equipped micro aerial vehicle (MAV) flying in urban streets at low altitudes without GPS. An image-based global positioning system is introduced to localize the MAV with respect to the surrounding buildings. We propose a novel air-ground image-matching algorithm to search the airborne image of the MAV within a ground-level, geotagged image database. Based on the detected matching image features, we infer the global position of the MAV by back-projecting the corresponding image points onto a cadastral three-dimensional city model. Furthermore, we describe an algorithm to track the position of the flying vehicle over several frames and to correct the accumulated drift of the visual odometry whenever a good match is detected between the airborne and the ground-level images. The proposed approach is tested on a 2 km trajectory with a small quadrocopter flying in the streets of Zurich. Our vision-based global localization can robustly handle extreme changes in viewpoint, illumination, perceptual aliasing, and over-season variations, thus outperforming conventional visual place-recognition approaches. The dataset is made publicly available to the research community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and demonstrates global localization and position tracking of a drone in urban streets with a single onboard camera.}

  abstract  = {To determine the pose of a vehicle is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics. Most approaches relate the current sensor observations to a map generated with previously acquired data of the same system or by another system with a similar sensor setup. Unfortunately, previously acquired data is not always available. In outdoor settings, GPS is a very useful tool to determine a global estimate of the vehicles pose. Unfortunately, GPS tends to be unreliable in situations in which a clear view to the sky is restricted. Yet, one can make use of publicly available map material as prior information. In this paper, we describe an approach to localize a robot equipped with a 3D range scanner with respect to a road network created from OpenStreetMap data. To successfully localize a mobile robot we propose a road classification scheme for 3D range data together with a novel sensor model, which relates the classification results to a road network. Compared to other approaches, our system does not require the robot to actually travel on the road network. We evaluate our approach in extensive experiments on simulated and real data and compare favorably to two state-of-the-art methods on those data.}

However, most existing solutions to the SLAM problem learn the maps from scratch and have no means for incorporating prior information. In this paper, we present a novel SLAM approach that achieves global consistency by utilizing publicly accessible aerial photographs as prior information. It inserts correspondences found between stereo and three-dimensional range data and the aerial images as constraints into a graph-based formulation of the SLAM problem. We evaluate our algorithm based on large real-world datasets acquired even in mixed in- and outdoor environments by comparing the global accuracy with state-of-the-art SLAM approaches and GPS. The experimental results demonstrate that the maps acquired with our method show increased global consistency.}

  abstract  = {The harvest yield in vineyards can vary significantly from year to year and also spatially within plots due to variations in climate, soil conditions and pests. Fine grained knowledge of crop yields can allow viticulturists to better manage their vineyards. The current industry practice for yield prediction is destructive, expensive and spatially sparse during the growing season sparse samples are taken and extrapolated to determine overall yield. We present an automated method that uses computer vision to detect and count grape berries. The method could potentially be deployed across large vineyards taking measurements at every vine in a non-destructive manner. Our berry detection uses both shape and visual texture and we can demonstrate detection of green berries against a green leaf background. Berry detections are counted and the eventual harvest yield is predicted. Results are presented for 224 vines (over 450 meters) of two different grape varieties and compared against the actual harvest yield as groundtruth. We calibrate our berry count to yield and find that we can predict yield of individual vineyard rows to within 9.8\% of actual crop weight.},

  abstract  = {The booming interest in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is fed by their potentially great impact, however progress is hindered by their limited perception capabilities. While vision-based odometry was shown to run successfully onboard UAVs, loop-closure detection to correct for drift or to recover from tracking failures, has so far, proven particularly challenging for UAVs. At the heart of this is the problem of viewpoint-tolerant place recognition; in stark difference to ground robots, UAVs can revisit a scene from very different viewpoints. As a result, existing approaches struggle greatly as the task at hand violates underlying assumptions in assessing scene similarity. In this paper, we propose a place recognition framework, which exploits both efficient binary features and noisy estimates of the local 3D geometry, which are anyway computed for visual-inertial odometry onboard the UAV. Attaching both an appearance and a geometry signature to each location, the proposed approach demonstrates unprecedented recall for perfect precision as well as high quality loopclosing transformations on both flying and hand-held datasets exhibiting large viewpoint and appearance changes as well as perceptual aliasing.}

               We leverage our method to obtain 2D labels for a novel suburban video dataset which

               organization of 3D point clouds can be efficiently captured by a structure called superpoint
               graph (SPG), derived from a partition of the scanned scene into geometrically homogeneous
               elements. SPGs offer a compact yet rich representation of contextual relationships between
               object parts, which is then exploited by a graph convolutional network. Our framework sets
               a new state of the art for segmenting outdoor LiDAR scans (+11.9 and +8.8 mIoU points for
               both Semantic3D test sets), as well as indoor scans (+12.4 mIoU points for the S3DIS dataset).},

               operates on a collection of points represented as a sparse set of samples in a high-dimensional
               lattice. Naively applying convolutions on this lattice scales poorly, both in terms of memory
               and computational cost, as the size of the lattice increases. Instead, our network uses sparse
               bilateral convolutional layers as building blocks. These layers maintain efficiency by using
               indexing structures to apply convolutions only on occupied parts of the lattice, and allow flexible
               specifications of the lattice structure enabling hierarchical and spatially-aware feature learning,
               as well as joint 2D-3D reasoning. Both point-based and image-based representations can be easily
               incorporated in a network with such layers and the resulting model can be trained in an end-to-end

  abstract  = {We present an approach to semantic scene analysis using deep convolutional networks.
               Our approach is based on tangent convolutions – a new construction for convolutional networks on
               3D data. In contrast to volumetric approaches, our method operates directly on surface geometry.
               Crucially, the construction is applicable to unstructured point clouds and other noisy real-world
               data. We show that tangent convolutions can be evaluated efficiently on large-scale point clouds
               with millions of points. Using tangent convolutions, we design a deep fully-convolutional network
               for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds, and apply it to challenging real-world datasets of
               indoor and outdoor 3D environments. Experimental results show that the presented approach outperforms

  abstract  = {We address semantic segmentation of road-objects from 3D LiDAR point clouds. In
               particular, we wish to detect and categorize instances of interest, such as cars, pedestrians and
               cyclists. We formulate this problem as a point-wise classification problem, and propose an
               end-to-end pipeline called SqueezeSeg based on convolutional neural networks (CNN): the CNN takes
               a transformed LiDAR point cloud as input and directly outputs a point-wise label map, which is then
               refined by a conditional random field (CRF) implemented as a recurrent layer. Instance-level labels
               are then obtained by conventional clustering algorithms. Our CNN model is trained on LiDAR point
               clouds from the KITTI [1] dataset, and our point-wise segmentation labels are derived from 3D
               bounding boxes from KITTI. To obtain extra training data, we built a LiDAR simulator into Grand Theft
               Auto V (GTA-V), a popular video game, to synthesize large amounts of realistic training data. Our
               experiments show that SqueezeSeg achieves high accuracy with astonishingly fast and stable runtime
               (8.7  0.5 ms per frame), highly desirable for autonomous driving. Furthermore, additionally training on
               synthesized data boosts validation accuracy on real-world data. Our source code is open-source released1 .

  abstract  = {The Jaccard index, also referred to as the intersection-over-union score, is commonly employed in the evaluation of image segmentation results given its perceptual qualities, scale invariance - which lends appropriate relevance to small objects, and appropriate counting of false negatives, in comparison to per-pixel losses. We present a method for direct optimization of the mean intersection-over-union loss in neural networks, in the context of semantic image segmentation, based on the convex Lovász extension of submodular losses. The loss is shown to perform better with respect to the Jaccard index measure than the traditionally used cross-entropy loss. We show quantitative and qualitative differences between optimizing the Jaccard index per image versus optimizing the Jaccard index taken over an entire dataset. We evaluate the impact of our method in a semantic segmentation pipeline and show substantially improved intersection-over-union segmentation scores on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets using state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation architectures.},

              publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised
              evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges:
              classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper
              we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences:
              algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by
              performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation
              of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the
              process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance
              of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a
              bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are
              significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes
              with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance
              across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint
              classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined
              performance. We also analyse the community’s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem
              et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of
              occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that
              worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.}

               worlds. We propose an efficient real-to-virtual world cloning method, and validate our
               approach by building and publicly releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (see
               this http URL), automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection,
               tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow. We provide quantitative
               experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learning algorithms pre-trained on
               real data behave similarly in real and virtual worlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual
               data improves performance. As the gap between real and virtual worlds is small, virtual
               worlds enable measuring the impact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition
               performance, all other things being equal. We show these factors may affect drastically

  abstract  = {We present 3D-MPA, a method for instance segmentation on 3D point clouds. Given an input point cloud, we propose an object-centric approach where each point votes for its object center. We sample object proposals from the predicted object centers. Then, we learn proposal features from grouped point features that voted for the same object center. A graph convolutional network introduces inter-proposal relations, providing higher-level feature learning in addition to the lower-level point features. Each proposal comprises a semantic label, a set of associated points over which we define a foreground-background mask, an objectness score and aggregation features. Previous works usually perform non-maximum-suppression (NMS) over proposals to obtain the final object detections or semantic instances. However, NMS can discard potentially correct predictions. Instead, our approach keeps all proposals and groups them together based on the learned aggregation features. We show that grouping proposals improves over NMS and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of 3D object detection and semantic instance segmentation on the ScanNetV2 benchmark and the S3DIS dataset.},

  abstract = {Place recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision, and has become a key part in mobile robotics and autonomous driving applications for performing loop closure in visual SLAM systems. Moreover, the difficulty of recognizing a revisited location increases with appearance changes caused, for instance, by weather or illumination variations, which hinders the long-term application of such algorithms in real environments. In this paper we present a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained for the first time with the purpose of recognizing revisited locations under severe appearance changes, which maps images to a low dimensional space where Euclidean distances represent place dissimilarity. In order for the network to learn the desired invariances, we train it with triplets of images selected from datasets which present a challenging variability in visual appearance. The triplets are selected in such way that two samples are from the same location and the third one is taken from a different place. We validate our system through extensive experimentation, where we demonstrate better performance than state-of-art algorithms in a number of popular datasets.}

  abstract = {Localization is an essential capability for mobile robots and the ability to localize in changing environments is key to robust outdoor navigation. Robots operating over extended periods of time should be able to handle substantial appearance changes such as those occurring over seasons or under different weather conditions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of efficiently coping with seasonal appearance changes in online localization. We propose a lazy data association approach for matching streams of incoming images to a reference image sequence in an online fashion. We present a search heuristic to quickly find matches between the current image sequence and a database using a data association graph. Our experiments conducted under substantial seasonal changes suggest that our approach can efficiently match image sequences while requiring a comparably small number of image to image comparisons.}

  abstract  = {We present 3DMV, a novel method for 3D semantic scene segmentation of RGB-D scans using a joint 3D-multi-view prediction network. In contrast to existing methods that either use geometry or RGB data as input for this task, we combine both data modalities in a joint, end-to-end network architecture. Rather than simply projecting color data into a volumetric grid and operating solely in 3D -- which would result in insufficient detail -- we first extract feature maps from associated RGB images. These features are then directly projected into the volumetric feature grid of a 3D network using a differentiable backprojection layer. Since our target is 3D scanning scenarios with possibly many frames, we use a multi-view pooling approach in order to handle a varying number of RGB input views. This learned combination of RGB and geometric features with our joint 2D-3D architecture achieves significantly better results than existing baselines. For instance, our final result on the ScanNet 3D segmentation benchmark increases from 52.8\% to 75\% accuracy compared to existing volumetric architectures.},

The BBCH key is it decimal system, with 10 principal growth stages and up to 10 secondary ones, starting with seed germination, sprouting of perennials, progressing through leaf production and extension growth to flowering and senescence. Therefore, it can also be a suitable tool to define the growth stages of different weed species. To encourage further use of the BBCH scale in weed research, definitions of the codes have been more closely adapted to weeds. Possible problems are discussed and guidelines for correct use are given.}

By introducing robustness as a continuous parameter, our loss function allows algorithms built around robust loss minimization to be generalized, which improves performance on basic vision tasks such as registration and clustering. Interpreting our loss as the negative log of a univariate density yields a general probability distribution that includes normal and Cauchy distributions as special cases. This probabilistic interpretation enables the training of neural networks in which the robustness of the loss automatically adapts itself during training, which improves performance on learning-based tasks such as generative image synthesis and unsupervised monocular depth estimation, without requiring any manual parameter tuning.},

  abstract = {Semantic 3D maps are required for various applications including robot navigation and surveying, and their importance has significantly increased. Generally, existing studies on semantic mapping were camera-based approaches that could not be operated in large-scale environments owing to their computational burden. Recently, a method of combining a 3D Lidar with a camera was introduced to address this problem, and a 3D Lidar and a camera were also utilized for semantic 3D mapping. In this study, our algorithm consists of semantic mapping and map refinement. In the semantic mapping, a GPS and an IMU are integrated to estimate the odometry of the system, and subsequently, the point clouds measured from a 3D Lidar are registered by using this information. Furthermore, we use the latest CNN-based semantic segmentation to obtain semantic information on the surrounding environment. To integrate the point cloud with semantic information, we developed incremental semantic labeling including coordinate alignment, error minimization, and semantic information fusion. Additionally, to improve the quality of the generated semantic map, the map refinement is processed in a batch. It enhances the spatial distribution of labels and removes traces produced by moving vehicles effectively. We conduct experiments on challenging sequences to demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and intersection over union.}

  abstract = {In order to facilitate long-term localization using a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, careful feature selection can help ensure that reference points persist over long durations and the runtime and storage complexity of the algorithm remain consistent. We present SIVO (Semantically Informed Visual Odometry and Mapping), a novel information-theoretic feature selection method for visual SLAM which incorporates semantic segmentation and neural network uncertainty into the feature selection pipeline. Our algorithm selects points which provide the highest reduction in Shannon entropy between the entropy of the current state and the joint entropy of the state, given the addition of the new feature with the classification entropy of the feature from a Bayesian neural network. Each selected feature significantly reduces the uncertainty of the vehicle state and has been detected to be a static object (building, traffic sign, etc.) repeatedly with a high confidence. This selection strategy generates a sparse map which can facilitate long-term localization. The KITTI odometry dataset is used to evaluate our method, and we also compare our results against ORB_SLAM2. Overall, SIVO performs comparably to the baseline method while reducing the map size by almost 70\%.}

We describe an integrated mathematical framework for simultaneously registering scans and recovering the surface configuration. To tackle the resulting high-dimensional optimization problems, we introduce a hierarchical method that first matches a coarse skeleton of scan points, then adapts local scan patches. The approach is implemented for a mobile robot capable of acquiring 3D models of objects.}

  abstract  = {Accurate detection of objects in 3D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms  the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative  representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.},

However, a key challenge of this approach is how to efficiently localize objects in point clouds of large-scale scenes (region proposal). Instead of solely relying on 3D proposals, our method leverages both mature 2D object detectors and advanced 3D deep learning for object localization, achieving efficiency as well as high recall for even small objects. Benefited from learning directly in raw point clouds, our method is also able to precisely estimate 3D bounding boxes even under strong occlusion or with very sparse points.

In this paper, we present a real-time 3D vehicle detection method (RT3D) that utilizes pure LiDAR point cloud to predict the location, orientation, and size of vehicles. In contrast to previous 3D object detection methods, we used a pre-RoIpooling convolution technique that moves a majority of the convolution operations to ahead of the RoI pooling, leaving just a small part behind, so that significantly boosts the computation efficiency. We also propose a pose-sensitive feature map design which can be strongly activated by the relative poses of vehicles, leading to a high regression accuracy on the location, orientation, and size of vehicles. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark dataset show that the RT3D is not only able to deliver competitive detection accuracy against state-of-the-art methods, but also the first LiDAR-based 3D vehicle detection work that completes detection within 0.09 seconds which is even shorter than the scan period of mainstream LiDAR sensors.}

In this paper, we extend our preliminary work PointRCNN to a novel and strong point-cloud-based 3D object detection framework, the part-aware and aggregation neural network (Part-$A^2$ net). The whole framework consists of the part-aware stage and the part-aggregation stage. Firstly, the part-aware stage for the first time fully utilizes free-of-charge part supervisions derived from 3D ground-truth boxes to simultaneously predict high quality 3D proposals and accurate intra-object part locations. The predicted intra-object part locations within the same proposal are grouped by our new-designed RoI-aware point cloud pooling module, which results in an effective representation to encode the geometry-specific features of each 3D proposal. Then the part-aggregation stage learns to re-score the box and refine the box location by exploring the spatial relationship of the pooled intra-object part locations. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance improvements from each component of our proposed framework. Our Part-$A^2$ net outperforms all existing 3D detection methods and achieves new state-of-the-art on KITTI 3D object detection dataset by utilizing only the LiDAR point cloud data.}

  abstract  = {Object detection in point clouds is an important aspect of many robotics applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of encoding a point cloud into a format appropriate for a downstream detection pipeline. Recent literature suggests two types of encoders; fixed encoders tend to be fast but sacrifice accuracy, while encoders that are learned from data are more accurate, but slower. In this work, we propose PointPillars, a novel encoder which utilizes PointNets to learn a representation of point clouds organized in vertical columns (pillars). While the encoded features can be used with any standard 2D convolutional detection architecture, we further propose a lean downstream network. Extensive experimentation shows that PointPillars outperforms previous encoders with respect to both speed and accuracy by a large margin. Despite only using lidar, our full detection pipeline significantly outperforms the state of the art, even among fusion methods, with respect to both the 3D and bird's eye view KITTI benchmarks. This detection performance is achieved while running at 62 Hz: a 2 - 4 fold runtime improvement. A faster version of our method matches the state of the art at 105 Hz. These benchmarks suggest that PointPillars is an appropriate encoding for object detection in point clouds.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning techniques have become the to-go models for most vision-related tasks on 2D images. However, their power has not been fully realised on several tasks in 3D space, e.g., 3D scene understanding. In this work, we jointly address the problems of semantic and instance segmentation of 3D point clouds. Specifically, we develop a multi-task pointwise network that simultaneously performs two tasks: predicting the semantic classes of 3D points and embedding the points into high-dimensional vectors so that points of the same object instance are represented by similar embeddings. We then propose a multi-value conditional random field model to incorporate the semantic and instance labels and formulate the problem of semantic and instance segmentation as jointly optimising labels in the field model.

  abstract  = {The recently introduced panoptic segmentation task has renewed our community's interest in unifying the tasks of instance segmentation (for thing classes) and semantic segmentation (for stuff classes). However, current state-of-the-art methods for this joint task use separate and dissimilar networks for instance and semantic segmentation, without performing any shared computation. In this work, we aim to unify these methods at the architectural level, designing a single network for both tasks. Our approach is to endow Mask R-CNN, a popular instance segmentation method, with a semantic segmentation branch using a shared Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone. Surprisingly, this simple baseline not only remains effective for instance segmentation, but also yields a lightweight, top-performing method for semantic segmentation. In this work, we perform a detailed study of this minimally extended version of Mask R-CNN with FPN, which we refer to as Panoptic FPN, and show it is a robust and accurate baseline for both tasks. Given its effectiveness and conceptual simplicity, we hope our method can serve as a strong baseline and aid future research in panoptic segmentation.},

  abstract  = {We propose and study a task we name panoptic segmentation (PS). Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation.

The core idea of our method to jointly learn from both geometric and color signal, thus enabling accurate instance predictions. Rather than operate solely on 2D frames, we observe that most computer vision applications have multi-view RGB-D input available, which we leverage to construct an approach for 3D instance segmentation that effectively fuses together these multi-modal inputs. Our network leverages high-resolution RGB input by associating 2D images with the volumetric grid based on the pose alignment of the 3D reconstruction. For each image, we first extract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then backproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D grid. This combination of 2D and 3D feature learning allows significantly higher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than state-of-the-art alternatives. We show results on both synthetic and real-world public benchmarks, achieving an improvement in mAP of over 13 on real-world data.},

Its capacity to use any number of kernel points gives KPConv more flexibility than fixed grid convolutions. Furthermore, these locations are continuous in space and can be learned by the network. Therefore, KPConv can be extended to deformable convolutions that learn to adapt kernel points to local geometry. Thanks to a regular subsampling strategy, KPConv is also efficient and robust to varying densities. Whether they use deformable KPConv for complex tasks, or rigid KPconv for simpler tasks, our networks outperform state-of-the-art classification and segmentation approaches on several datasets.

  abstract  = {The ability to segment unknown objects in depth images has potential to enhance robot skills in grasping and object tracking. Recent computer vision research has demonstrated that Mask R-CNN can be trained to segment specific categories of objects in RGB images when massive handlabeled datasets are available. As generating these datasets is time-consuming, we instead train with synthetic depth images. Many robots now use depth sensors, and recent results suggest training on synthetic depth data can transfer successfully to the real world. We present a method for automated dataset generation and rapidly generate a synthetic training dataset of 50,000 depth images and 320,000 object masks using simulated heaps of 3D CAD models. We train a variant of Mask R-CNN with domain randomization on the generated dataset to perform category-agnostic instance segmentation without any handlabeled data and we evaluate the trained network, which we refer to as Synthetic Depth (SD) Mask R-CNN, on a set of real, high-resolution depth images of challenging, densely-cluttered bins containing objects with highly-varied geometry. SD Mask R-CNN outperforms point cloud clustering baselines by an absolute 15\% in Average Precision and 20\% in Average Recall on COCO benchmarks, and achieves performance levels similar to a Mask R-CNN trained on a massive, hand-labeled RGB dataset and fine-tuned on real images from the experimental setup. We deploy the model in an instance-specific grasping pipeline to demonstrate its usefulness in a robotics application.

More importantly, we introduce a parameter-free panoptic head which solves the panoptic segmentation via pixel-wise classification. It first leverages the logits from the previous two heads and then innovatively expands the representation for enabling prediction of an extra unknown class which helps better resolving the conflicts between semantic and instance segmentation. Besides, it handles the challenge caused by the varying number of instances and permits back propagation to the bottom modules in an end-to-end manner.

Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.  Our unified architecture is extremely fast.

A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background.

  abstract  = {The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.},

Generally, proposal-free methods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and instance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances. However, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two sub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating these two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple separate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The mutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To this end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation method that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based on a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two pixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity pyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and achieve mutual benefits. Moreover, incorporating with the learned affinity pyramid, a novel cascaded graph partition module is presented to sequentially generate instances from coarse to fine. Unlike previous time-consuming graph partition methods, this module achieves 5x speedup and 9\% relative improvement on Average-Precision (AP).

Proposal-free methods, by contrast, can generate masks at high resolution and are often faster, but fail to reach the same accuracy as the proposal-based methods. In this work we propose a new clustering loss function for proposal-free instance segmentation.

When combined with a fast architecture, the network can perform instance segmentation in real-time while maintaining a high accuracy.

In addition, for 2D detection, our approach obtains 14.9\% higher AP than the state-of-the-art on the hard data among the LIDAR-based methods.},

  booktitle = iccv,
  year      = 2019,
  abstract  = {Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data -- samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space -- we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images.},

In addition to our novel formulation, we introduce corner pooling, a new type of pooling layer that helps the network better localize the corners.

Important to the effectiveness of SGPN is its novel representation of 3D instance segmentation results in the form of a similarity matrix that indicates the similarity between each pair of points in embedded feature space, thus producing an accurate grouping proposal for each point.  To the best of our knowledge, SGPN is the first framework to learn 3D instance-aware semantic segmentation on point clouds. Experimental results on various 3D scenes show the effectiveness of our method on 3D instance segmentation, and we also evaluate the capability of SGPN to improve 3D object detection and semantic segmentation results. We also demonstrate its flexibility by seamlessly incorporating 2D CNN features into the framework to boost performance.},

  abstract  = {Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.}

L3-Net learns local descriptors specifically optimized for matching in different real-world driving scenarios. 3D convolutions over a cost volume built in the solution space significantly boosts the localization accuracy. RNNs are demonstrated to be effective in modeling the vehicle's dynamics, yielding better temporal smoothness and accuracy. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our approach using freshly collected datasets. Multiple trials of repetitive data collection over the same road and areas make our dataset ideal for testing localization systems. The  SunnyvaleBigLoop sequences, with a year's time interval between the collected mapping and testing data, made it quite challenging, but the low localization error of our method in these datasets demonstrates its maturity for real industrial implementation.},

               Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the online construction of a map during exploration of an environment. One of
               the components of SLAM is loop closure detection, identifying that the same location has been visited and is present on the
               existing map, and localizing against it. We have shown in previous work that using semantics from a deep segmentation network
               in conjunction with the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) point cloud registration improves the robustness, speed and accuracy
               of lidar odometry. In this work we extend the method for loop closure detection, using the labels already available from local
               registration into NDT Histograms, and we present a SLAM pipeline based on Semantic assisted NDT and PointNet++. We experimentally
               demonstrate on sequences from the KITTI benchmark that the map descriptor we propose outperforms NDT Histograms without
               semantics, and we validate its use on a SLAM task.},

The signature verification algorithm is based on an artificial neural network. The novel network presented here, called a “Siamese” time delay neural network, consists of two identical networks joined at their output. During training the network learns to measure the similarity between pairs of signatures. When used for verification, only one half of the Siamese network is evaluated. The output of this half network is the feature vector for the input signature. Verification consists of comparing this feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer than a chosen threshold to this stored representation are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries. System performance is illustrated with experiments performed in the laboratory. }

Most current systemsprovide information on the whole-plant level and not on the level of specific plant partssuch as leaves, nodes and stems. Computer vision provides possibilities to extract infor-mation from plant parts from images. However, the segmentation of plant parts is achallenging problem, due to the inherent variation in appearance and shape of naturalobjects. In this paper, deep-learning methods are proposed to deal with this variation.Moreover, a multi-view approach is taken that allows the integration of information fromthe two-dimensional (2D) images into a three-dimensional (3D) point-cloud model of theplant. Specifically, a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a masked R-CNN (region-basedconvolutional neural network) were used for semantic and instance segmentation on the2D images. The different viewpoints were then combined to segment the 3D point cloud.The performance of the 2D and multi-view approaches was evaluated on tomato seedlingplants. Our results show that the integration of information in 3D outperforms the 2Dapproach, because errors in 2D are not persistent for the different viewpoints and cantherefore be overcome in 3D}

This  methodleverages   multiple   horizontal   and   vertical   viewpoints   whilecapturing 2D images from a robotic platform so as to generatein-field  3D  reconstructions  of  the  sorghum  plant.  We  developand  quantitatively  evaluate  segmentation  methods  on  these3D  reconstructions  and  also  compare  against  reconstructionsobtained from a controlled greenhouse environment. We presentanalysis that contrasts the role of purely local geometric featuresand  the  effect  of  addition  of  global  context  in  both  datasets.This  work  furthers  capabilities  of  in-field  phenotyping  whichpaves the way forward for plant biologists to study the coupledeffect  of  genetics  and  environment  on  improving  crop  yields}

  abstract  = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns therepresentation  of  3D  shapes  for  recognition:  should  3Dshapes be represented with descriptors operating on theirnative 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, orcan they be effectively represented with view-based descrip-tors?  We address this question in the context of learningto recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their renderedviews on 2D images.  We first present a standard CNN ar-chitecture trained to recognize the shapes’ rendered viewsindependently  of  each  other,  and  show  that  a  3D  shapecan be recognized even from a single view at an accuracyfar higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors.Recognition rates further increase when multiple views ofthe shapes are provided.  In addition, we present a novelCNN architecture that combines information from multipleviews of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape de-scriptor offering even better recognition performance. Thesame architecture can be applied to accurately recognizehuman hand-drawn sketches of shapes.  We conclude thata collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3Dshape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN archi-tectures and their derivatives.}

One novel result is that the self-organization process can also discover semantic relationships in sentence. In this respect the resulting maps very closely resemble the topographically organized maps found in the cortices of the more developed animal brains. After supervised fine tuning of its weight vectors, the Self-Organizing Map has been particularly succesfull in various pattern recognition tasks involving very noisy signals. In particular, these maps have been used in practical speech recognition, and work is in progress on their application to robotics, process control, teleccommunications, etc. This paper contains a survey of several basic facts and results.}

  abstract = {ccurate and high-throughput determination of plant morphological traits is essentialfor  phenotyping  studies.  Nowadays,  there  are  many  approaches  to  acquire  high-quality three-dimensional (3D) point clouds of plants. However, it is difficult to estimatephenotyping parameters accurately of the whole growth stages of maize plants usingthese  3D  point  clouds.  In  this  paper,  an  accurate  skeleton  extraction  approach  wasproposed to bridge the gap between 3D point cloud and phenotyping traits estimationof  maize  plants.  The  algorithm  first  uses  point  cloud  clustering  and  color  differencedenoising to reduce the noise of the input point clouds. Next, the Laplacian contractionalgorithm is applied to shrink the points. Then the key points representing the skeleton ofthe plant are selected through adaptive sampling, and neighboring points are connectedto form a plant skeleton composed of semantic organs. Finally, deviation skeleton pointsto  the  input  point  cloud  are  calibrated  by  building  a  step  forward  local  coordinatealong the tangent direction of the original points. The proposed approach successfullygenerates  accurately  extracted  skeleton  from  3D  point  cloud  and  helps  to  estimatephenotyping parameters with high precision of maize plants. Experimental verification ofthe skeleton extraction process, tested using three cultivars and different growth stagesmaize, demonstrates that the extracted matches the input point cloud well. Comparedwith 3D digitizing data-derived morphological parameters, the NRMSE of leaf length,leaf inclination angle, leaf top length, leaf azimuthal angle, leaf growth height, and plantheight, estimated using the extracted plant skeleton, are 5.27, 8.37, 5.12, 4.42, 1.53,and 0.83\%, respectively, which could meet the needs of phenotyping analysis. The timerequired to process a single maize plant is below 100 s. The proposed approach mayplay an important role in further maize research and applications, such as genotype-to-phenotype study, geometric reconstruction, functional structural maize modeling, anddynamic growth animation.}

The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solu-tion to the combination of these requirements. In this paper,we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying ona density-based notion of clusters which is designed to dis-cover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only oneinput parameter and supports the user in determining an ap-propriate value for it. We performed an experimental evalua-tion of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN usingsynthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 bench-mark.

Typically,  arobot has to navigate through a whole crop field several timesduring  a  season  for  monitoring  the  plants,  for  applying  agro-chemicals,  or  for  performing  targeted  intervention  actions.  Inthis  paper,  we  propose  a  framework  tailored  for  navigation  inrow-crop  fields  by  exploiting  the  regular  crop-row  structurepresent in the fields.

Today, imaging sensors exploit a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and they can be deployed to measure a growing number of traits, also in heterogenic environments. Recent advances include the possibility to acquire high-resolution spectra by imaging spectroscopy and classify signatures that might be informative of plant development, nutrition, health, and disease. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of surfaces and volume is of particular interest, enabling functional and mechanistic analyses. While taking pictures is relatively easy, quantitative interpretation often remains challenging and requires integrating knowledge of sensor physics, image analysis, and complex traits characterizing plant phenotypes.}

The goal is to provide quantitative analyses of plant structure and function relevant for traits that help plants better adapt to low-input agriculture and resource-limited environments. We provide an overview of the inherently multidisciplinary research in plant phenotyping, focusing on traits that will assist in selecting genotypes with increased resource use efficiency. We highlight opportunities and challenges for integrating noninvasive or minimally invasive technologies into screening protocols to characterize plant responses to environmental challenges for both controlled and field experimentation. Although technology evolves rapidly, parallel efforts are still required because large-scale phenotyping demands accurate reporting of at least a minimum set of information concerning experimental protocols, data management schemas, and integration with modeling. The journey toward systematic plant phenotyping has only just begun. }

In this paper, we present an extension of SemanticKITTI, which is a large-scale dataset providing dense point-wise semantic labels for all sequences of the KITTI Odometry Benchmark, for training and evaluation of laser-based panoptic segmentation. We provide the data and discuss the processing steps needed to enrich a given semantic annotation with temporally consistent instance information, i.e., instance information that supplements the semantic labels and identifies the same instance over sequences of LiDAR point clouds. Additionally, we present two strong baselines that combine state-of-the-art LiDAR-based semantic segmentation approaches with a state-of-the-art detector enriching the segmentation with instance information and that allow other researchers to compare their approaches against. We hope that our extension of SemanticKITTI with strong baselines enables the creation of novel algorithms for LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation as much as it has for the original semantic segmentation and semantic scene completion tasks. Data, code, and an online evaluation using a hidden test set will be published on http://semantic-kitti.org.}

  abstract = {Matching local geometric features on real-world depth images is a challenging task due to the noisy, low-resolution, and incomplete nature of 3D scan data. These difficulties limit the performance of current state-of-art methods, which are typically based on histograms over geometric properties. In this paper, we present 3DMatch, a data-driven model that learns a local volumetric patch descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial 3D data. To amass training data for our model, we propose a self-supervised feature learning method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing RGB-D reconstructions. Experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction, but also generalize to different tasks and spatial scales (e.g. instance-level object model alignment for the Amazon Picking Challenge, and mesh surface correspondence). Results show that 3DMatch consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin. Code, data, benchmarks, and pre-trained models are available online at http://3dmatch.cs.princeton.edu}

  abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge}

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.   The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.}

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Large detection is 25\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 30\% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.}

  abstract = {The research community has increasing interest in autonomous driving research, despite the resource intensity of obtaining representative real world data. Existing self-driving datasets are limited in the scale and variation of the environments they capture, even though generalization within and between operating regions is crucial to the overall viability of the technology. In an effort to help align the research community's contributions with real-world self-driving problems, we introduce a new large scale, high quality, diverse dataset. Our new dataset consists of 1150 scenes that each span 20 seconds, consisting of well synchronized and calibrated high quality LiDAR and camera data captured across a range of urban and suburban geographies. It is 15x more diverse than the largest camera+LiDAR dataset available based on our proposed diversity metric. We exhaustively annotated this data with 2D (camera image) and 3D (LiDAR) bounding boxes, with consistent identifiers across frames. Finally, we provide strong baselines for 2D as well as 3D detection and tracking tasks. We further study the effects of dataset size and generalization across geographies on 3D detection methods.

  abstract = {We study the problem of efficient semantic segmentation for large-scale 3D point clouds. By relying on expensive sampling techniques or computationally heavy pre/post-processing steps, most existing approaches are only able to be trained and operate over small-scale point clouds. In this paper, we introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds. The key to our approach is to use random point sampling instead of more complex point selection approaches. Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can discard key features by chance. To overcome this, we introduce a novel local feature aggregation module to progressively increase the receptive field for each 3D point, thereby effectively preserving geometric details. Extensive experiments show that our RandLA-Net can process 1 million points in a single pass with up to 200X faster than existing approaches. Moreover, our RandLA-Net clearly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for semantic segmentation on two large-scale benchmarks Semantic3D and SemanticKITTI.}

Such scene comprehension necessitates recognizing instances of traffic participants along with general scene semantics which can be effectively addressed by the panoptic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient Panoptic Segmentation (EfficientPS) architecture that consists of a shared backbone which efficiently encodes and fuses semantically rich multi-scale features. We incorporate a new semantic head that aggregates fine and contextual features coherently and a new variant of Mask R-CNN as the instance head. We also propose a novel panoptic fusion module that congruously integrates the output logits from both the heads of our EfficientPS architecture to yield the final panoptic segmentation output. Additionally, we introduce the KITTI panoptic segmentation dataset that contains panoptic annotations for the popularly challenging KITTI benchmark. Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes, KITTI, Mapillary Vistas and Indian Driving Dataset demonstrate that our proposed architecture consistently sets the new state-of-the-art on all these four benchmarks while being the most efficient and fast panoptic segmentation architecture to date.}

  abstract = {The need for fine-grained perception in autonomous driving systems has resulted in recently increased research on online semantic segmentation of single-scan LiDAR. Despite the emerging datasets and technological advancements, it remains challenging due to three reasons: (1) the need for near-real-time latency with limited hardware; (2) uneven or even long-tailed distribution of LiDAR points across space; and (3) an increasing number of extremely fine-grained semantic classes. In an attempt to jointly tackle all the aforementioned challenges, we propose a new LiDAR-specific, nearest-neighbor-free segmentation algorithm - PolarNet. Instead of using common spherical or bird's-eye-view projection, our polar bird's-eye-view representation balances the points across grid cells in a polar coordinate system, indirectly aligning a segmentation network's attention with the long-tailed distribution of the points along the radial axis. We find that our encoding scheme greatly increases the mIoU in three drastically different segmentation datasets of real urban LiDAR single scans while retaining near real-time throughput.}

  abstract = {LiDAR point-cloud segmentation is an important problem for many applications. For large-scale point cloud segmentation, the \textit{de facto} method is to project a 3D point cloud to get a 2D LiDAR image and use convolutions to process it. Despite the similarity between regular RGB and LiDAR images, we discover that the feature distribution of LiDAR images changes drastically at different image locations. Using standard convolutions to process such LiDAR images is problematic, as convolution filters pick up local features that are only active in specific regions in the image. As a result, the capacity of the network is under-utilized and the segmentation performance decreases. To fix this, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Convolution (SAC) to adopt different filters for different locations according to the input image. SAC can be computed efficiently since it can be implemented as a series of element-wise multiplications, im2col, and standard convolution. It is a general framework such that several previous methods can be seen as special cases of SAC. Using SAC, we build SqueezeSegV3 for LiDAR point-cloud segmentation and outperform all previous published methods by at least 3.7\% mIoU on the SemanticKITTI benchmark with comparable inference speed.}

Fast and efficient semantic segmentation methods are needed to match the strong computational and temporal restrictions of many of these real-world applications.   This work presents 3D-MiniNet, a novel approach for LIDAR semantic segmentation that combines 3D and 2D learning layers. It first learns a 2D representation from the raw points through a novel projection which extracts local and global information from the 3D data. This representation is fed to an efficient 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) that produces a 2D semantic segmentation. These 2D semantic labels are re-projected back to the 3D space and enhanced through a post-processing module. The main novelty in our strategy relies on the projection learning module. Our detailed ablation study shows how each component contributes to the final performance of 3D-MiniNet. We validate our approach on well known public benchmarks (SemanticKITTI and KITTI), where 3D-MiniNet gets state-of-the-art results while being faster and more parameter-efficient than previous methods.}

This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the \overfeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the \overfeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the \overfeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or $L2$ distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g., jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks.}

The numberof harvested berries per plant is strongly correlated withthe resulting quality. Therefore, early yield forecasting canenable a focused thinning of berries to ensure a high qual-ity end product. Traditionally yield estimation is done byextrapolating from a small sample size and by utilizing his-toric data. Moreover, it needs to be carried out by skilled ex-perts with much experience in this field. Berry detection inimages offers a cheap, fast and non-invasive alternative tothe otherwise time-consuming and subjective on-site anal-ysis by experts. We apply fully convolutional neural net-works on images acquired with the Phenoliner, a field phe-notyping platform. We count single berries in images toavoid the error-prone detection of grapevine clusters. Clus-ters are often overlapping and can vary a lot in the sizewhich makes the reliable detection of them difficult. We ad-dress especially the detection of white grapes directly in thevineyard. The detection of single berries is formulated as aclassification task with three classes, namely ’berry’, ’edge’and ’background’. A connected component algorithm is ap-plied to determine the number of berries in one image. Wecompare the automatically counted number of berries withthe manually detected berries in 60 images showing Ries-ling plants in vertical shoot positioned trellis (VSP) andsemi minimal pruned hedges (SMPH). We are able to detectberries correctly within the VSP system with an accuracy of 94.0\% and for the SMPH system with 85.6\%.}

In this article, we present our novel approach to humanoid navigation through cluttered environments, which exploits knowledge about different obstacle classes to decide how to deal with obstacles and select appropriate robot actions. To classify objects from RGB images and decide whether an obstacle can be overcome by the robot with a corresponding action, e.g., by pushing or carrying it aside or stepping over or onto it, we train and exploit a convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on associated action costs, we compute a cost grid containing newly observed objects in addition to static obstacles on which a 2D path can be efficiently planned. This path encodes the necessary actions that need to be carried out by the robot to reach the goal. We implemented our framework in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and tested it in various scenarios with a Nao robot as well as in simulation with the REEM-C robot. As the experiments demonstrate, using our CNN, the robot can robustly classify the observed obstacles into the different classes and decide on suitable actions to find efficient solution paths. Our system finds paths also through regions where traditional motion planning methods are not able to calculate a solution or require substantially more time. }

Research in this domain, which encompasses diverse perception problems, has primarily been focused on addressing specific tasks individually rather than modeling the ability to understand dynamic scenes holistically. In this paper, we introduce a novel perception task denoted as multi-object panoptic tracking (MOPT), which unifies the conventionally disjoint tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. MOPT allows for exploiting pixel-level semantic information of 'thing' and 'stuff' classes, temporal coherence, and pixel-level associations over time, for the mutual benefit of each of the individual sub-problems. To facilitate quantitative evaluations of MOPT in a unified manner, we propose the soft panoptic tracking quality (sPTQ) metric. As a first step towards addressing this task, we propose the novel PanopticTrackNet architecture that builds upon the state-of-the-art top-down panoptic segmentation network EfficientPS by adding a new tracking head to simultaneously learn all sub-tasks in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we present several strong baselines that combine predictions from state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation and multi-object tracking models for comparison. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations of both vision-based and LiDAR-based MOPT that demonstrate encouraging results.}

The presented method addresses the tasks of detecting mature broccoli heads in the field and providing their 3D locations relative to the vehicle. The paper evaluates different 3D features, machine learning, and temporal filtering methods for detection of broccoli heads. Our experiments show that a combination of Viewpoint Feature Histograms, Support Vector Machine classifier, and a temporal filter to track the detected heads results in a system that detects broccoli heads with high precision. We also show that the temporal filtering can be used to generate a 3D map of the broccoli head positions in the field. Additionally, we present methods for automatically estimating the size of the broccoli heads, to determine when a head is ready for harvest. All of the methods were evaluated using ground‐truth data from both the UK and Spain, which we also make available to the research community for subsequent algorithm development and result comparison. Cross‐validation of the system trained on the UK dataset on the Spanish dataset, and vice versa, indicated good generalization capabilities of the system, confirming the strong potential of low‐cost 3D imaging for commercial broccoli harvesting.}

  abstract = {Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.}

Modern graphics techniqueshave succeeded in synthesizing photo-realistic images from hand-crafted scene representations. However, the automatic gen-eration of shape, materials, lighting, and other aspects of scenes remains a challenging problem that, if solved, would makephoto-realistic computer graphics more widely accessible. Concurrently, progress in computer vision and machine learninghave  given  rise  to  a  new  approach  to  image  synthesis  and  editing,  namely  deep  generative  models.  Neural  rendering  is  anew and rapidly emerging field that combines generative machine learning techniques with physical knowledge from computergraphics, e.g., by the integration of differentiable rendering into network training. With a plethora of applications in computergraphics and vision, neural rendering is poised to become a new area in the graphics community, yet no survey of this emerg-ing field exists. This state-of-the-art report summarizes the recent trends and applications of neural rendering. We focus onapproaches that combine classic computer graphics techniques with deep generative models to obtain controllable and photo-realistic outputs. Starting with an overview of the underlying computer graphics and machine learning concepts, we discusscritical aspects of neural rendering approaches. Specifically, our emphasis is on the type of control, i.e., how the control isprovided, which parts of the pipeline are learned, explicit vs. implicit control, generalization, and stochastic vs. deterministicsynthesis. The second half of this state-of-the-art report is focused on the many important use cases for the described algorithmssuch as novel view synthesis, semantic photo manipulation, facial and body reenactment, relighting, free-viewpoint video, andthe creation of photo-realistic avatars for virtual and augmented reality telepresence. Finally, we conclude with a discussion ofthe social implications of such technology and investigate open research problems.}

In this paper, we present a computer-vision system for seedling phenotyping that combines best of both approaches by utilizing a fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method. We developed image processing methods for the identification and segmentation of plant organs (stem and leaf) from the 3D plant model. Various measurements of plant features such as plant volume, leaf area, and stem length are estimated based on these plant segments. We evaluate the accuracy of our system by comparing the measurements of our methods with ground truth measurements obtained destructively by hand. The results indicate that the proposed system is very promising.}

Oursystem is based on a realtime registration process that accurately reconstructs hand poses by fitting a 3D articulatedhand model to depth images. We register the hand model using depth, silhouette, and temporal information. Toeffectively map low-quality depth maps to realistic hand poses, we regularize the registration with kinematicand temporal priors, as well as a data-driven prior built from a database of realistic hand poses. We presenta principled way of integrating such priors into our registration optimization to enable robust tracking withoutseverely restricting the freedom of motion. A core technical contribution is a new method for computing trackingcorrespondences that directly models occlusions typical of single-camera setups. To ensure reproducibility of ourresults and facilitate future research, we fully disclose the source code of our implementation.}

  abstract  = {The Flourish project aims to bridge the gap between current and desired capabilities of agricultural robots by developing an adaptable robotic solution for precision farming. Combining the aerial survey capabilities of a small autonomous multi-copter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a multi-purpose agricultural Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), the system will be able to survey a field from the air, perform targeted intervention on the ground, and provide detailed information for decision support, all with minimal user intervention. The system can be adapted to a wide range of farm management activities and to different crops by choosing different sensors, status indicators and ground treatment packages. The research project thereby touches a selection of topics addressed by ICPA such as sensor application in managing in-season crop variability, precision nutrient management and crop protection as well as remote sensing applications in precision agriculture and engineering technologies and advances. This contribution will introduce the Flourish consortium and concept using the results of three years of active development, testing, and measuring in field campaigns. Two key parts of the project will be shown in more detail: First, mapping of the field by drones for detection of sugar beet nitrogen status variation and weed pressure in the field and second the perception of the UGV as related to weed classification and subsequent precision weed management. The field mapping by means of an UAV will be shown for crop nitrogen status estimation and weed pressure with examples for subsequent crop management decision support. For nitrogen status, the results indicate that drones are up to the task to deliver crop nitrogen variability maps utilized for variable rate application that are of comparable quality to current on-tractor systems. The weed pressure mapping is viable as basis for the UGV showcase of precision weed management. For this, we show the automated image acquisition by the UGV and a subsequent plant classification with a four-step pipeline, differentiating crop from weed in real time. Advantages and disadvantages as well as future prospects of such approaches will be discussed.}

  abstract  = {Localization is a prerequisite for most autonomous robots. For example, to carry out precision agriculture tasks
               effectively, a robot must be able to localize itself accurately in crop fields. The crop field environment
               presentsunique challenges such as the highly repetitive structure ofthe crops leading to visual aliasing as
               well as the continuously changing appearance of the field, which makes it difficult tolocalize over time.
               In this paper, we present a localization system, which uses an aerial map of the field and exploits the
               semantic information of the crops, weeds, and their stem positions to resolve the visual ambiguity problem and to
               enable robot localization over extended periods of time. We evaluate our approach on a real field over
               multiple sessions spanning several weeks. Experiments suggest that our approach provides the necessary accuracy
               required by precision agriculture applications and works in cases where current techniques using
               typical visual features tend to fail.}

  abstract = {Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\% and 82.1\% without any post-processing. Our paper is accompanied with a publicly available reference implementation of the proposed models in Tensorflow at \url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab}.}

  abstract = {In modern agriculture, usually weeds control consists in spraying herbicides all over the agricultural field. This practice involves significant waste and cost of herbicide for farmers and environmental pollution. One way to reduce the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide at the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for weeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low cost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic weeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity with the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in different complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a certain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for weeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main phases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify the interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to constitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to build a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results obtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling. The accuracy gaps are 1.5\% in the spinach field and 6\% in the bean field.}

Intelligent spot-spraying system predominantly relies on machine vision-based detectors for autonomous weed control. In this work, several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) were constructed for detection of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Web.), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea L.), and spotted spurge (Euphorbia maculata L.) growing in perennial ryegrass. When the networks were trained using a dataset containing a total of 15,486 negative (images contained perennial ryegrass with no target weeds) and 17,600 positive images (images contained target weeds), VGGNet achieved high F<sub>1</sub> scores (≥0.9278), with high recall values (≥0.9952) for detection of E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. The F<sub>1</sub> scores of AlexNet ranged from 0.8437 to 0.9418 and were generally lower than VGGNet at detecting E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale. GoogleNet is not an effective DCNN at detecting these weed species mainly due to the low precision values. DetectNet is an effective DCNN and achieved high F<sub>1</sub> scores (≥0.9843) in the testing datasets for detection of T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. Moreover, VGGNet had the highest Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values, while GoogleNet had the lowest MCC values. Overall, the approach of training DCNN, particularly VGGNet and DetectNet, presents a clear path toward developing a machine vision-based decision system in smart sprayers for precision weed control in perennial ryegrass.}

  abstract = {Abstract Conventional farming still relies on large quantities of agrochemicals for weed management which have several negative side-effects on the environment. Autonomous robots offer the potential to reduce the amount of chemicals applied, as robots can monitor and treat each plant in the field individually and thereby circumventing the uniform chemical treatment of the whole field. Such agricultural robots need the ability to identify individual crops and weeds in the field using sensor data and must additionally select effective treatment methods based on the type of weed. For example, certain types of weeds can only be effectively treated mechanically due to their resistance to herbicides, whereas other types can be treated trough selective spraying. In this article, we present a novel system that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It estimates the stem location for weeds, which enables the robots to perform precise mechanical treatment, and at the same time provides the pixel-accurate area covered by weeds for treatment through selective spraying. The major challenge in developing such a system is the large variability in the visual appearance that occurs in different fields. Thus, an effective classification system has to robustly handle substantial environmental changes including varying weed pressure, various weed types, different growth stages, changing visual appearance of the plants and the soil. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates plant stem positions as well as the spatial extent of crop plants and weeds. It jointly learns how to detect the stems and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences of local field strips. The jointly learned feature representation for both tasks furthermore exploits the crop arrangement information that is often present in crop fields. This information is considered even if it is only observable from the image sequences and not a single image. Such image sequences, as typically provided by robots navigating over the field along crop rows, enable our approach to robustly estimate the semantic segmentation and stem positions despite the large variations encountered in different fields. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach on images from multiple farms in different countries. The experiments show that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions—a key capability to deploy such systems in the real world. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach generalizes well to unseen fields and not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, that is, distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also improves the semantic segmentation performance.},

Deep-learning approaches have recently achieved both excellent classification performance and real-time execution. However, these techniques also rely on a large amount of training data, requiring a substantial labeling effort, both of which are scarce in precision agriculture. Additional design efforts are required to achieve commercially viable performance levels under varying environmental conditions and crop growth stages. In this paper, we explore the role of knowledge transfer between deep-learning-based classifiers for different crop types, with the goal of reducing the retraining time and labeling efforts required for a new crop. We examine the classification performance on three datasets with different crop types and containing a variety of weeds and compare the performance and retraining efforts required when using data labeled at pixel level with partially labeled data obtained through a less time-consuming procedure of annotating the segmentation output. We show that transfer learning between different crop types is possible and reduces training times for up to 80\%. Furthermore, we show that even when the data used for retraining are imperfectly annotated, the classification performance is within 2\% of that of networks trained with laboriously annotated pixel-precision data.},

It is a part of a project of the automatic weeding machine, developed by the Warsaw University of Technology and MCMS Warka Ltd. Obtained models reach satisfying accuracy (detecting 47--67\% of weed area, misclasifing as weed 0.1&ndash;0.9\% of crop area) at over 10 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ computer. It was tested for four different plant species at different growth stadiums and lighting conditions. The system performing semantic segmentation is based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Its custom architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet and ResNet concepts. Amount of needed manual ground truth labels was significantly decreased by the usage of the knowledge distillation process, learning final model which mimics an ensemble of complex models on a large database of unlabeled data. Further decrease of the inference time was obtained by two custom modifications: in the usage of separable convolutions in DenseNet block and in the number of channels in each layer.

Images of weeds growing within a variety of crops were gathered across variable environmental conditions with regards to soil types, resolution and light settings. Then, 9649 of these images were used for training the computer, which automatically divided the weeds into nine growth classes. The performance of this proposed convolutional neural network approach was evaluated on a further set of 2516 images, which also varied in term of crop, soil type, image resolution and light conditions. The overall performance of this approach achieved a maximum accuracy of 78\% for identifying Polygonum spp. and a minimum accuracy of 46\% for blackgrass. In addition, it achieved an average 70\% accuracy rate in estimating the number of leaves and 96\% accuracy when accepting a deviation of two leaves. These results show that this new method of using deep convolutional neural networks has a relatively high ability to estimate early growth stages across a wide variety of weed species.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between cultivated maize plant and grass or grass-like weed image segments using the context surrounding the image segments. While convolutional neural networks have brought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when objects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs when objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct differences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or localized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when classifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional neural network a central square image along with a border of its direct surroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are labelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network classifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We demonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task through a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed detection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone nearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1\% to 4.3\%. After only one epoch with context, the network also achieved a higher accuracy than the network without context did after 50 epochs. The benefits of using the context technique are likely to particularly evident in agricultural contexts in which parts (such as leaves) of several plants may appear similar when not taking into account the context in which those parts appear.}

Visual cover estimation is a key tool for many ecological studies, yet quadrat-based analyses are known to suffer from issues of consistency between people as well as across sites (spatially) and time (temporally). Previous efforts to estimate cover from photograps require considerable manual work. We demonstrate that an automated system can be used to estimate vegetation cover and the type of vegetation cover present using top–down photographs of 1 m by 1 m quadrats. Vegetation cover is estimated by modelling the distribution of color using a multivariate Gaussian. The type of vegetation cover is then classified, using illumination robust local binary pattern features, into two broad groups: graminoids (grasses) and forbs. This system is evaluated on two datasets from the globally distributed experiment, the Nutrient Network (NutNet). These NutNet sites were selected for analyses because repeat photographs were taken over time and these sites are representative of very different grassland ecosystems—a low stature subalpine grassland in an alpine region of Australia and a higher stature and more productive lowland grassland in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. We find that estimates of treatment effects on grass and forb cover did not differ between field and automated estimates for eight of nine experimental treatments. Conclusions about total vegetation cover did not correspond quite as strongly, particularly at the more productive site. A limitation with this automated system is that the total vegetation cover is given as a percentage of pixels considered to contain vegetation, but ecologists can distinguish species with overlapping coverage and thus can estimate total coverage to exceed 100\%. Automated approaches such as this offer techniques for estimating vegetation cover that are repeatable, cheaper to use, and likely more reliable for quantifying changes in vegetation over the long-term. These approaches would also enable ecologists to increase the spatial and temporal depth of their coverage estimates with methods that allow for vegetation sampling over large spatial scales quickly.},

  abstract  = {Planning for autonomous driving in complex, urban scenarios requires accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding traffic participants. Their future behavior depends on their route intentions, the road-geometry, traffic rules and mutual interaction, resulting in interdependencies between their trajectories. We present a probabilistic prediction framework based on a dynamic Bayesian network, which represents the state of the complete scene including all agents and respects the aforementioned dependencies. We propose Markovian, context-dependent motion models to define the interaction-aware behavior of drivers. At first, the state of the dynamic Bayesian network is estimated over time by tracking the single agents via sequential Monte Carlo inference. Secondly, we perform a probabilistic forward simulation of the network's estimated belief state to generate the different combinatorial scene developments. This provides the corresponding trajectories for the set of possible, future scenes. Our framework can handle various road layouts and number of traffic participants. We evaluate the approach in online simulations and real-world scenarios. It is shown that our interaction-aware prediction outperforms interaction-unaware physics- and map-based approaches.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous cars have to navigate in dynamic environment which can be full of uncertainties. The uncertainties can come either from sensor limitations such as occlusions and limited sensor range, or from probabilistic prediction of other road participants, or from unknown social behavior in a new area. To safely and efficiently drive in the presence of these uncertainties, the decision-making and planning modules of autonomous cars should intelligently utilize all available information and appropriately tackle the uncertainties so that proper driving strategies can be generated. In this paper, we propose a social perception scheme which treats all road participants as distributed sensors in a sensor network. By observing the individual behaviors as well as the group behaviors, uncertainties of the three types can be updated uniformly in a belief space. The updated beliefs from the social perception are then explicitly incorporated into a probabilistic planning framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The cost function of the MPC is learned via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Such an integrated probabilistic planning module with socially enhanced perception enables the autonomous vehicles to generate behaviors which are defensive but not overly conservative, and socially compatible. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified in simulation on an representative scenario with sensor occlusions.},

One of the major challenges is to detect dangerous situations and react accordingly in order to avoid or mitigate accidents. This requires predicting the likely evolution of the current traffic situation, and assessing how dangerous that future situation might be. This paper is a survey of existing methods for motion prediction and risk assessment for intelligent vehicles. The proposed classification is based on the semantics used to define motion and risk. We point out the tradeoff between model completeness and real-time constraints, and the fact that the choice of a risk assessment method is influenced by the selected motion model.},

  abstract  = {As autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other road users, it is of importance to comprehensively understand the dynamic traffic environment, especially the future possible trajectories of surrounding vehicles. This paper presents an algorithm for long-horizon trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles using a dual long short term memory (LSTM) network, which is capable of effectively improving prediction accuracy in strongly interactive driving environments. In contrast to traditional approaches which require trajectory matching and manual feature selection, this method can automatically learn high-level spatial-temporal features of driver behaviors from naturalistic driving data through sequence learning. By employing two blocks of LSTMs, the proposed method feeds the sequential trajectory to the first LSTM for driver intention recognition as an intermediate indicator, which is immediately followed by a second LSTM for future trajectory prediction. Test results from real-world highway driving data show that the proposed method can, in comparison to state-of-art methods, output more accurate and reasonable estimate of different future trajectories over 5s time horizon with root mean square error (RMSE) for longitudinal and lateral prediction less than 5.77m and 0.49m, respectively.}

@article{dai2019acce,
  abstract = {The long short-term memory (LSTM) model is one of the most commonly used vehicle trajectory predicting models. In this paper, we study two problems of the existing LSTM models for long-term trajectory prediction in dense traffic. First, the existing LSTM models cannot simultaneously describe the spatial interactions between different vehicles and the temporal relations between the trajectory time series. Thus, the existing models cannot accurately estimate the influence of the interactions in dense traffic. Second, the basic LSTM models often suffer from vanishing gradient problem and are, thus, hard to train for long time series. These two problems sometimes lead to large prediction errors in vehicle trajectory predicting. In this paper, we proposed a spatiooral LSTM-based trajectory prediction model (ST-LSTM) which includes two modifications. We embed spatial interactions into LSTM models to implicitly measure the interactions between neighboring vehicles. We also introduce shortcut connections between the inputs and the outputs of two consecutive LSTM layers to handle gradient vanishment. The proposed new model is evaluated on the I-80 and US-101 datasets. Results show that our new model has a higher trajectory predicting accuracy than one state-of-the-art model [maneuver-LSTM (M-LSTM)].},

Our method is based on recurrent neural networks combined with a mixture density network output layer. To consolidate the multi-modal nature of the output probability distribution, we introduce a clustering algorithm that extracts the set of possible paths that exist in the prediction output and ranks them according to probability. To verify the method's performance and generalizability, we present a real-world dataset that consists of over 23 000 vehicles traversing five different intersections, collected using a vehicle-mounted lidar-based tracking system. An array of metrics is used to demonstrate the performance of the model against several baselines.},

  abstract  = {Anticipating possible behaviors of traffic participants is an essential capability of autonomous vehicles. Many behavior detection and maneuver recognition methods only have a very limited prediction horizon that leaves inadequate time and space for planning. To avoid unsatisfactory reactive decisions, it is essential to count long-term future rewards in planning, which requires extending the prediction horizon. In this paper, we uncover that clues to vehicle behaviors over an extended horizon can be found in vehicle interaction, which makes it possible to anticipate the likelihood of a certain behavior, even in the absence of any clear maneuver pattern. We adopt a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observation encoding, and based on that, we propose a novel vehicle behavior interaction network (VBIN) to capture the vehicle interaction from the hidden states and connection feature of each interaction pair. The output of our method is a probabilistic likelihood of multiple behavior classes, which matches the multimodal and uncertain nature of the distant future. A systematic comparison of our method against two state-of-the-art methods and another two baseline methods on a publicly available real highway dataset is provided, showing that our method has superior accuracy and advanced capability for interaction modeling.},

Our approach models these interactions and constraints jointly within a novel Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF) network. Specifically, the model encodes multiple agents' past trajectories and the scene context into a Multi-Agent Tensor, then applies convolutional fusion to capture multiagent interactions while retaining the spatial structure of agents and the scene context.

  abstract  = {We study the problem of efficient semantic segmentation for large-scale 3D point clouds. By relying on expensive sampling techniques or computationally heavy pre/post-processing steps, most existing approaches are only able to be trained and operate over small-scale point clouds. In this paper, we introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds. The key to our approach is to use random point sampling instead of more complex point selection approaches. Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can discard key features by chance. To overcome this, we introduce a novel local feature aggregation module to progressively increase the receptive field for each 3D point, thereby effectively preserving geometric details. Extensive experiments show that our RandLA-Net can process 1 million points in a single pass with up to 200x faster than existing approaches. Moreover, our RandLA-Net clearly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for semantic segmentation on two large-scale benchmarks Semantic3D and SemanticKITTI.},

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2020,
  abstract  = {The requirement of fine-grained perception by autonomous driving systems has resulted in recently increased research in the online semantic segmentation of single-scan LiDAR. Emerging datasets and technological advancements have enabled researchers to benchmark this problem and improve the applicable semantic segmentation algorithms. Still, online semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans in autonomous driving applications remains challenging due to three reasons: (1) the need for near-real-time latency with limited hardware, (2) points are distributed unevenly across space, and (3) an increasing number of more fine-grained semantic classes. The combination of the aforementioned challenges motivates us to propose a new LiDAR-specific, KNN-free segmentation algorithm - PolarNet. Instead of using common spherical or bird's-eye-view projection, our polar bird's-eye-view representation balances the points per grid and thus indirectly redistributes the network's attention over the long-tailed points distribution over the radial axis in polar coordination. We find that our encoding scheme greatly increases the mIoU in three drastically different real urban LiDAR single-scan segmentation datasets while retaining ultra low latency and near real-time throughput.},

  abstract  = {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is crucial to tackle the lack of annotations in a new domain. There are many multi-modal datasets, but most UDA approaches are uni-modal. In this work, we explore how to learn from multi-modality and propose cross-modal UDA (xMUDA) where we assume the presence of 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation. This is challenging as the two input spaces are heterogeneous and can be impacted differently by domain shift. In xMUDA, modalities learn from each other through mutual mimicking, disentangled from the segmentation objective, to prevent the stronger modality from adopting false predictions from the weaker one. We evaluate on new UDA scenarios including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, leveraging recent autonomous driving datasets. xMUDA brings large improvements over uni-modal UDA on all tested scenarios, and is complementary to state-of-the-art UDA techniques.

  abstract = {In this chapter, we present CORrelation ALignment (CORAL), a simple yet effective method for unsupervised domain adaptation. CORAL minimizes domain shift by aligning the second-order statistics of source and target distributions, without requiring any target labels. In contrast to subspace manifold methods, it aligns the original feature distributions of the source and target domains, rather than the bases of lower-dimensional subspaces. It is also much simpler than other distribution matching methods. CORAL performs remarkably well in extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets. We first describe a solution that applies a linear transformation to source features to align them with target features before classifier training. For linear classifiers, we propose to equivalently apply CORAL to the classifier weights, leading to added efficiency when the number of classifiers is small but the number and dimensionality of target examples are very high. The resulting CORAL Linear Discriminant Analysis (CORAL-LDA) outperforms LDA by a large margin on standard domain adaptation benchmarks. Finally, we extend CORAL to learn a nonlinear transformation that aligns correlations of layer activations in deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting Deep CORAL approach works seamlessly with DNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets.

We formally demonstrate this hypothesis and, aiming at achieving an optimal alignment in practical cases, we adopt a more principled strategy which, differently from the current Euclidean approaches, deploys alignment along geodesics. Our pipeline can be implemented by adding to the standard classification loss (on the labeled source domain), a source-to-target regularizer that is weighted in an unsupervised and data-driven fashion. We provide extensive experiments to assess the superiority of our framework on standard domain and modality adaptation benchmarks.}

Existing self-driving datasets are limited in the scale and variation of the environments they capture, even though generalization within and between operating regions is crucial to the over-all viability of the technology. In an effort to help align the research community's contributions with real-world self-driving problems, we introduce a new large scale, high quality, diverse dataset. Our new dataset consists of 1150 scenes that each span 20 seconds, consisting of well synchronized and calibrated high quality LiDAR and camera data captured across a range of urban and suburban geographies. It is 15x more diverse than the largest camera+LiDAR dataset available based on our proposed diversity metric. We exhaustively annotated this data with 2D (camera image) and 3D (LiDAR) bounding boxes, with consistent identifiers across frames. Finally, we provide strong baselines for 2D as well as 3D detection and tracking tasks. We further study the effects of dataset size and generalization across geographies on 3D detection methods.

  abstract  = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We 
               simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures 
               or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, 
               we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations 
               plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation 
               between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, 
               and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. 
               By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and 
               semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by 
               SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the 
               performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, 
               outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels. }

               research. Among a big body of recently proposed approaches for unsupervised learning of visual representations, a 
               class of self-supervised techniques achieves superior performanceon many challenging benchmarks. A large number of the 
               pretext tasks for self-supervised learning have been studied, but other important aspects, such as the choice of 
               convolutional neural networks (CNN), has not received equalattention. Therefore, we revisit numerous previously 
               proposed self-supervised models, conduct a thorough largescale study and, as a result, uncover multiple crucial 
               insights. We challenge a number of common practices in self-supervised visual representation learning and observe 
               that standard recipes for CNN design do not always translateto self-supervised representation learning. As part of 
               our study, we drastically boost the performance of previouslyproposed techniques and outperform previously published

  abstract  = {Self-supervised learning aims to learn representations from the data itself without explicit manual supervision. Existing efforts ignore a crucial aspect of self-supervised learning - the ability to scale to large amount of data because self-supervision requires no manual labels. In this work, we revisit this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million images. We show that by scaling on various axes (including data size and problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface normal estimation (3D) and visual navigation using reinforcement learning. Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full advantage of large scale data and do not seem to learn effective high level semantic representations. We also introduce an extensive benchmark across 9 different datasets and tasks. We believe that such a benchmark along with comparable evaluation settings is necessary to make meaningful progress.

  abstract  = {Large-scale 3D scene reconstruction is an important task in autonomous driving and other 
               robotics applications as having an accurate representation of the environment is necessary to safely 
               interact with it. Reconstructions are used for numerous tasks ranging from localization and mapping to 
               planning. In robotics, volumetric depth fusion is the method of choice for indoor applications since the 
               emergence of commodity RGB-D cameras due to its robustness and high reconstruction quality. In this work 
               we present an approach for volumetric depth fusion using LiDAR sensors as they are common on most autonomous 
               cars. We present a framework for large-scale mapping of urban areas considering loop closures. Our method 
               creates a meshed representation of an urban area from recordings over a distance of 3.7 km with a high level 
               of detail on consumer graphics hardware in several minutes. The whole process is fully automated and does not 
               need any user interference. We quantitatively evaluate our results from a real world application. Also, we 
               investigate the effects of the sensor model that we assume on reconstruction quality by using synthetic data.},

  year      = {2013},
  abstract  = {In this paper we present a system for capturing large scale dense maps in an online setting with a low cost RGB-D sensor. Central to this work is the use of an “as-rigid-as-possible” space deformation for efficient dense map correction in a pose graph optimisation framework. By combining pose graph optimisation with non-rigid deformation of a dense map we are able to obtain highly accurate dense maps over large scale trajectories that are both locally and globally consistent. With low latency in mind we derive an incremental method for deformation graph construction, allowing multi-million point maps to be captured over hundreds of metres in real-time. We provide benchmark results on a well established RGB-D SLAM dataset demonstrating the accuracy of the system and also provide a number of our own datasets which cover a wide range of environments, both indoors, outdoors and across multiple floors.},

  abstract  = {Plant phenotyping is the measurement of observ-able plant traits. Current methods for phenotyping in the fieldare  labour  intensive  and  error  prone.  High  throughput  plantphenotyping in an automated and noninvasive manner is crucialto accelerating plant breeding methods.Occlusions and non-ideal sensing conditions is a major prob-lem for high throughput plant phenotyping with most state-of-the-art 3D phenotyping algorithms relying heavily on heuristicsor hand-tuned parameters. To address this problem, we presenta novel model-based optimization approach for estimating plantphysical traits from plant units called phytomers. The proposedapproach  involves  sampling  parameterized  3D  plant  modelsfrom an underlying probability distribution. It then optimizes,making the mass of this probability distribution approach trueparameters of the model.Reformulating   the   phenotyping   objective   as   a   search   inthe   space   of   plant   models   lets   us   reason   about   the   plantstructure   in   a   holistic   manner   without   having   to   rely   onhand-tuned  parameters.  This  makes  our  approach  robust  tonoise  and  occlusions  as  frequently  encountered  in  real  worldenvironments. We evaluate our approach for plant units takenacross simulated, greenhouse and field environments. This workfurthers field-based robotic phenotyping capabilities paving theway for plant biologists to study the coupled effect of geneticsand environment on improving crop yields.}

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = {2021},
  abstract  = {A key step towards understanding human behavior is the
               prediction of 3D human motion. Successful solutions have many applications
               in human tracking, HCI, and graphics. Most previous work focuses on
               predicting a time series of future 3D joint locations given a sequence 3D
               joints from the past. This Euclidean formulation generally works better
               than predicting pose in terms of joint rotations. Body joint locations,
               however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose, leaving degrees of freedom
               (like rotation about a limb) undefined. Note that 3D joints can be viewed
               as a sparse point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can
               be seen as a problem of point cloud prediction. With this observation, we
               instead predict a sparse set of locations on the body surface that
               correspond to motion capture markers. Given such markers, we fit a
               parametric body model to recover the 3D body of the person. These sparse
               surface markers also carry detailed information about human movement that
               is not present in the joints, increasing the naturalness of the predicted
               motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO (More than Our JOints),
               which is a novel variational autoencoder with a latent DCT space that
               generates motions from latent frequencies. MOJO preserves the full
               temporal resolution of the input motion, and sampling from the latent
               frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency components into the
               generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods accumulate errors
               over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from true human
               bodies. To address this, we fit the SMPL-X body model to the predictions
               at each time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid
               bodies, before propagating the new markers in time. Quantitative and
               qualitative experiments show that our approach produces state-of-the-art
               results and realistic 3D body animations. The code is available for

  abstract  = {The ability to reliably perceive the environmental states,
               particularly the existence of objects and their motion behavior, is crucial
               for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose an efficient deep model,
               called MotionNet, to jointly perform perception and motion prediction from
               3D point clouds. MotionNet takes a sequence of LiDAR sweeps as input and
               outputs a bird's eye view (BEV) map, which encodes the object category and
               motion information in each grid cell. The backbone of MotionNet is a novel
               spatio-temporal pyramid network, which extracts deep spatial and temporal
               features in a hierarchical fashion. To enforce the smoothness of predictions
               over both space and time, the training of MotionNet is further regularized
               with novel spatial and temporal consistency losses. Extensive experiments
               show that the proposed method overall outperforms the state-of-the-arts,
               including the latest scene-flow- and 3D-object-detection-based methods. This
               indicates the potential value of the proposed method serving as a backup to
               the bounding-box-based system, and providing complementary information to
               the motion planner in autonomous driving. Code is available at

  abstract  = {Three-dimensional objects are commonly represented as 3D boxes in a point-cloud. 
               This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional 
               challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have 
               difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this 
               paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, 
               first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 
               3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on 
               the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting 
               detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. On the nuScenes and Waymo datasets, 
               CenterPoint surpasses prior methods by a large margin. On the Waymo Open Dataset, CenterPoint improves previous 
               tate-of-the-art by 10-20\% while running at 13FPS. The code and pretrained models are available

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles need to have a semantic understanding of the three-dimensional world around them in 
               order to reason about their environment. State of the art methods use deep neural networks to predict semantic classes 
               for each point in a LiDAR scan. A powerful and efficient way to process LiDAR measurements is to use two-dimensional, 
               image-like projections. In this work, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of image-based semantic segmentation 
               architectures for LiDAR point clouds. We demonstrate various techniques to boost the performance and to improve runtime 
               as well as memory constraints. First, we examine the effect of network size and suggest that much faster inference times 
               can be achieved at a very low cost to accuracy. Next, we introduce an improved point cloud projection technique that does 
               not suffer from systematic occlusions. We use a cyclic padding mechanism that provides context at the horizontal 
               field-of-view boundaries. In a third part, we perform experiments with a soft Dice loss function that directly 
               optimizes for the intersection-over-union metric. Finally, we propose a new kind of convolution layer with a reduced 
               amount of weight-sharing along one of the two spatial dimensions, addressing the large difference in appearance 
               along the vertical axis of a LiDAR scan. We propose a final set of the above methods with which the model achieves
               an increase of 3.2\% in mIoU segmentation performance over the baseline while requiring only 42\% of the original inference time.}

  abstract  = {Unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms aim to transfer the knowledge learned from one domain to another (e.g., synthetic to real images). The adapted representations often do not capture pixel-level domain shifts that are crucial for dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). In this paper, we present a novel pixel-wise adversarial domain adaptation algorithm. By leveraging image-to-image translation methods for data augmentation, our key insight is that while the translated images between domains may differ in styles, their predictions for the task should be consistent. We exploit this property and introduce a cross-domain consistency loss that enforces our adapted model to produce consistent predictions. Through extensive experimental results, we show that our method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art on a wide variety of unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.}

  abstract  = {We present an efficient, elastic 3D LiDAR reconstruction framework which can reconstruct up to maximum LiDAR ranges (60 m) at multiple frames per second, thus enabling robot exploration in large-scale environments. Our approach only requires a CPU. We focus on three main challenges of large-scale reconstruction: integration of long-range LiDAR scans at high frequency, the capacity to deform the reconstruction after loop closures are detected, and scalability for longduration exploration. Our system extends upon a state-of-theart efficient RGB-D volumetric reconstruction technique, called supereight, to support LiDAR scans and a newly developed submapping technique to allow for dynamic correction of the 3D reconstruction. We then introduce a novel pose graph clustering and submap fusion feature to make the proposed system more scalable for large environments. We evaluate the performance using two public datasets including outdoor exploration with a handheld device and a drone, and with a mobile robot exploring an underground room network. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can reconstruct at 3 Hz with 60 m sensor range and 5 cm resolution, while state-of-the-art approaches can only reconstruct to 25 cm resolution or 20 m range at the same frequency.}

  abstract  = {We introduce a data-driven approach to complete partial 3D shapes through a combination of volumetric deep neural networks and 3D shape synthesis. From a partially-scanned input shape, our method first infers a low-resolution -- but complete -- output. To this end, we introduce a 3D-Encoder-Predictor Network (3D-EPN) which is composed of 3D convolutional layers. The network is trained to predict and fill in missing data, and operates on an implicit surface representation that encodes both known and unknown space. This allows us to predict global structure in unknown areas at high accuracy. We then correlate these intermediary results with 3D geometry from a shape database at test time. In a final pass, we propose a patch-based 3D shape synthesis method that imposes the 3D geometry from these retrieved shapes as constraints on the coarsely-completed mesh.  This synthesis process enables us to reconstruct fine-scale detail and generate high-resolution output while respecting the global mesh structure obtained by the 3D-EPN. Although our 3D-EPN outperforms state-of-the-art completion method, the main contribution in our work lies in the combination of a data-driven shape predictor and analytic 3D shape synthesis. In our results, we show extensive evaluations on a newly-introduced shape completion benchmark for both real-world and synthetic data.},

The research community deeply investigated this topic in the last few years, and this resulted in the development of several open-source solvers to approach constantly increasing classes of problems. In this work, we propose a unified methodology to design and develop efficient Least-Squares Optimization algorithms, focusing on the structures and patterns of each specific domain. Furthermore, we present a novel open-source optimization system that addresses problems transparently with a different structure and designed to be easy to extend. The system is written in modern C++ and runs efficiently on embedded systemsWe validated our approach by conducting comparative experiments on several problems using standard datasets.

In this work, we tackle these issues, proposing a novel unified SLAM architecture specifically designed to standardize the SLAM problem and to address heterogeneous sensor configurations. Thanks to its modularity and design patterns, the presented framework is easy to extend, maximizes code reuse and improves computational efficiency. We show in our experiments with a variety of typical sensor configurations that these advantages come without compromising state-of-the-art SLAM performance.

The mapping strategy is based on two environment maps, a local map for instantaneous perception, and a global map for perception memory. The 2D local map represents the surface in front of the robot and may contain RGB data, allowing environment reconstruction and human detection, similar to a sliding window that moves with a robot and stores surface data.}

  abstract = {Survey-grade Lidar brands have commercialized Lidar-based mobile mapping systems (MMSs) for several years now. With this high-end equipment, the high-level accuracy quality of point clouds can be ensured, but unfortunately, their high cost has prevented practical implementation in autonomous driving from being affordable. As an attempt to solve this problem, we present a cost-effective MMS to generate an accurate 3D color point cloud for autonomous vehicles. Among the major processes for color point cloud reconstruction, we first synchronize the timestamps of each sensor. The calibration process between camera and Lidar is developed to obtain the translation and rotation matrices, based on which color attributes can be composed into the corresponding Lidar points. We also employ control points to adjust the point cloud for fine tuning the absolute position. To overcome the limitation of Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit (GNSS/IMU) positioning system, we utilize Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) localization to refine the trajectory to solve the multi-scan dispersion issue. Experimental results show that the color point cloud reconstructed by the proposed MMS has a position error in centimeter-level accuracy, meeting the requirement of high definition (HD) maps for autonomous driving usage.}

  abstract  = {We present a novel framework named NeuralRecon for real-time 3D scene reconstruction from a monocular video. Unlike previous methods that estimate single-view depth maps separately on each key-frame and fuse them later, we propose to directly reconstruct local surfaces represented as sparse TSDF volumes for each video fragment sequentially by a neural network. A learning-based TSDF fusion module based on gated recurrent units is used to guide the network to fuse features from previous fragments. This design allows the network to capture local smoothness prior and global shape prior of 3D surfaces when sequentially reconstructing the surfaces, resulting in accurate, coherent, and real-time surface reconstruction. The experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based system that is able to reconstruct dense coherent 3D geometry in real-time.

In comparison with previous normal distribution-based ICP methods, such as normal distribution transformation and generalized ICP, our ICP method is simply stabilized with normalization of the cost function by the Frobenius norm and a regularized covariance matrix. The previous methods are stabilized with principal component analysis, whose computational cost is higher than that of our method. Moreover, our SLAM method can reduce the effect of incorrect loop closure constraints. The experimental results show that our SLAM method has advantages over open source state-of-the-art methods, including LOAM, LeGO-LOAM, and hdl graph slam.}

  abstract  = { Multi-beam LiDAR sensors are increasingly used in robotics, particularly with autonomous cars for localization and perception tasks, both relying on the ability to build a precise map of the environment. For this, we propose a new real-time LiDAR-only odometry method called CT-ICP (for Continuous-Time ICP), completed into a full SLAM with a novel loop detection procedure. The core of this method, is the introduction of the combined continuity in the scan matching, and discontinuity between scans. It allows both the elastic distortion of the scan during the registration for increased precision, and the increased robustness to high frequency motions from the discontinuity. We build a complete SLAM on top of this odometry, using a fast pure LiDAR loop detection based on elevation image 2D matching, providing a pose graph with loop constraints. To show the robustness of the method, we tested it on seven datasets: KITTI, KITTI-raw, KITTI-360, KITTICARLA, ParisLuco, Newer College, and NCLT in driving and high-frequency motion scenarios. Both the CT-ICP odometry and the loop detection are made available online. CT-ICP is currently first, among those giving access to a public code, on the KITTI odometry leaderboard, with an average Relative Translation Error (RTE) of 0.59\% and an average time per scan of 60ms on a CPU with a single thread.}

  abstract  = {The rapid development of autonomous driving and mobile mapping calls for off-the-shelf LiDAR SLAM solutions that are adaptive to LiDARs of different specifications on various complex scenarios. To this end, we propose MULLS, an efficient, low-drift, and versatile 3D LiDAR SLAM system. For the front-end, roughly classified feature points (ground, facade, pillar, beam, etc.) are extracted from each frame using dualthreshold ground filtering and principal components analysis. Then the registration between the current frame and the local submap is accomplished efficiently by the proposed multimetric linear least square iterative closest point algorithm. Point-to-point (plane, line) error metrics within each point class are jointly optimized with a linear approximation to estimate the ego-motion. Static feature points of the registered frame are appended into the local map to keep it updated. For the backend, hierarchical pose graph optimization is conducted among regularly stored history submaps to reduce the drift resulting from dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with more than 100,000 frames collected by seven types of LiDAR on various outdoor and indoor scenarios. On the KITTI benchmark, MULLS ranks among the top LiDARonly SLAM systems with real-time performance.}

  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {Point clouds can be represented in many forms (views), typically, point-based sets, voxel-based cells or range-based images(i.e., panoramic view). The point-based view is geometrically accurate, but it is disordered, which makes it difficult to find local neighbors efficiently. The voxel-based view is regular, but sparse, and computation grows cubicly when voxel resolution increases. The range-based view is regular and generally dense, however spherical projection makes physical dimensions distorted. Both voxel- and range-based views suffer from quantization loss, especially for voxels when facing large-scale scenes. In order to utilize different view's advantages and alleviate their own shortcomings in fine-grained segmentation task, we propose a novel range-point-voxel fusion network, namely RPVNet. In this network, we devise a deep fusion framework with multiple and mutual information interactions among these three views, and propose a gated fusion module (termed as GFM), which can adaptively merge the three features based on concurrent inputs. Moreover, the proposed RPV interaction mechanism is highly efficient, and we summarize it to a more general formulation. By leveraging this efficient interaction and relatively lower voxel resolution, our method is also proved to be more efficient. Finally, we evaluated the proposed model on two large-scale datasets, i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and it shows state-of-the-art performance on both of them. Note that, our method currently ranks 1st on SemanticKITTI leaderboard without any extra tricks.},

  abstract  = { Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has wide robotic applications such as autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles. Both computational efficiency and localization accuracy are of great importance towards a good SLAM system. Existing works on LiDAR based SLAM often formulate the problem as two modules: scan-to-scan match and scan-to-map refinement. Both modules are solved by iterative calculation which are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a general solution that aims to provide a computationally efficient and accurate framework for LiDAR based SLAM. Specifically, we adopt a non-iterative two-stage distortion compensation method to reduce the computational cost. For each scan input, the edge and planar features are extracted and matched to a local edge map and a local plane map separately, where the local smoothness is also considered for iterative pose optimization. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate its performance in challenging scenarios, including localization for a warehouse Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) and a public dataset on autonomous driving. The proposed method achieves a competitive localization accuracy with a processing rate of more than 10 Hz in the public dataset evaluation, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational cost for practical applications. It is one of the most accurate and fastest open-sourced SLAM systems1 in KITTI dataset ranking.}

  abstract  = {This paper extends the popular task of multi-object tracking to multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS). Towards this goal, we create dense pixel-level annotations for two existing tracking datasets using a semi-automatic annotation procedure. Our new annotations comprise 65,213 pixel masks for 977 distinct objects (cars and pedestrians) in 10,870 video frames. For evaluation, we extend existing multi-object tracking metrics to this new task. Moreover, we propose a new baseline method which jointly addresses detection, tracking, and segmentation with a single convolutional network. We demonstrate the value of our datasets by achieving improvements in performance when training on MOTS annotations. We believe that our datasets, metrics and baseline will become a valuable resource towards developing multi-object tracking approaches that go beyond 2D bounding boxes. We make our annotations, code, and models available at https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/page/mots.},

  title     = {{LiDAR-Based Panoptic Segmentation via Dynamic Shifting Network}},
  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {With the rapid advances of autonomous driving, it becomes critical to equip its sensing system with more holistic 3D perception. However, existing works focus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g. trees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, we achieve 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI, outperforming 2nd place by 2.6\% in terms of the PQ metric.},

  abstract  = {Panoptic segmentation presents a new challenge in exploiting the merits of both detection and segmentation, with the aim of unifying instance segmentation and semantic segmentation in a single framework. However, an efficient solution for panoptic segmentation in the emerging domain of LiDAR point cloud is still an open research problem and is very much under-explored. In this paper, we present a fast and robust LiDAR point cloud panoptic segmentation framework, referred to as Panoptic-PolarNet. We learn both semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance clustering in a single inference network using a polar Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling us to circumvent the issue of occlusion among instances in urban street scenes. To improve our network's learnability, we also propose an adapted instance augmentation technique and a novel adversarial point cloud pruning method. Our experiments show that Panoptic-PolarNet outperforms the baseline methods on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with an almost real-time inference speed. Panoptic-PolarNet achieved 54.1\% PQ in the public SemanticKITTI panoptic segmentation leaderboard and leading performance for the validation set of nuScenes.},

  abstract  = {The problem of tracking multiple objects in a video sequence poses several challenging tasks. For tracking-by-detection, these include object re-identification, motion prediction and dealing with occlusions. We present a tracker (without bells and whistles) that accomplishes tracking without specifically targeting any of these tasks, in particular, we perform no training or optimization on tracking data. To this end, we exploit the bounding box regression of an object detector to predict the position of an object in the next frame, thereby converting a detector into a Tracktor. We demonstrate the potential of Tracktor and provide a new state-of-the-art on three multi-object tracking benchmarks by extending it with a straightforward re-identification and camera motion compensation. We then perform an analysis on the performance and failure cases of several state-of-the-art tracking methods in comparison to our Tracktor. Surprisingly, none of the dedicated tracking methods are considerably better in dealing with complex tracking scenarios, namely, small and occluded objects or missing detections. However, our approach tackles most of the easy tracking scenarios. Therefore, we motivate our approach as a new tracking paradigm and point out promising future research directions. Overall, Tracktor yields superior tracking performance than any current tracking method and our analysis exposes remaining and unsolved tracking challenges to inspire future research directions.},

  abstract  = {Panoptic segmentation has become a new standard of visual recognition task by unifying previous semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks in concert. In this paper, we propose and explore a new video extension of this task, called video panoptic segmentation. The task requires generating consistent panoptic segmentation as well as an association of instance ids across video frames. To invigorate research on this new task, we present two types of video panoptic datasets. The first is a re-organization of the synthetic VIPER dataset into the video panoptic format to exploit its large-scale pixel annotations. The second is a temporal extension on the Cityscapes val. set, by providing new video panoptic annotations (Cityscapes-VPS). Moreover, we propose a novel video panoptic segmentation network (VPSNet) which jointly predicts object classes, bounding boxes, masks, instance id tracking, and semantic segmentation in video frames. To provide appropriate metrics for this task, we propose a video panoptic quality (VPQ) metric and evaluate our method and several other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented two datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results in image PQ on Cityscapes and also in VPQ on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.},

Our approach determines a semantic class for every point while modeling object instances as probability distributions in the 4D spatio-temporal domain. We process multiple point clouds in parallel and resolve point-to-instance associations, effectively alleviating the need for explicit temporal data association. Inspired by recent advances in benchmarking of multi-object tracking, we propose to adopt a new evaluation metric that separates the semantic and point-to-instance association aspects of the task.

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2020,
  abstract  = {3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial to autonomous systems. Recent work uses a standard tracking-by-detection pipeline, where feature extraction is first performed independently for each object in order to compute an affinity matrix. Then the affinity matrix is passed to the Hungarian algorithm for data association. A key process of this standard pipeline is to learn discriminative features for different objects in order to reduce confusion during data association. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve the discriminative feature learning for MOT: (1) instead of obtaining features for each object independently, we propose a novel feature interaction mechanism by introducing the Graph Neural Network. As a result, the feature of one object is informed of the features of other objects so that the object feature can lean towards the object with similar feature (i.e., object probably with a same ID) and deviate from objects with dissimilar features (i.e., object probably with different IDs), leading to a more discriminative feature for each object; (2) instead of obtaining the feature from either 2D or 3D space in prior work, we propose a novel joint feature extractor to learn appearance and motion features from 2D and 3D space simultaneously. As features from different modalities often have complementary information, the joint feature can be more discriminate than feature from each individual modality. To ensure that the joint feature extractor does not heavily rely on one modality, we also propose an ensemble training paradigm. Through extensive evaluation, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and nuScenes 3D MOT benchmarks.

  abstract  = {Object tracking is still a critical and challenging problem with many applications in computer vision. For this challenge, more and more researchers pay attention to applying deep learning to get powerful feature for better tracking accuracy. In this paper, a novel triplet loss is proposed to extract expressive deep feature for object tracking by adding it into Siamese network framework instead of pairwise loss for training. Without adding any inputs, our approach is able to utilize more elements for training to achieve more powerful feature via the combination of original samples. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical analysis by combining comparison of gradients and back-propagation, to prove the effectiveness of our method. In experiments, we apply the proposed triplet loss for three real-time trackers based on Siamese network. And the results on several popular tracking benchmarks show our variants operate at almost the same frame-rate with baseline trackers and achieve superior tracking performance than them, as well as the comparable accuracy with recent state-of-the-art real-time trackers.},

In this paper, we present an extension of SemanticKITTI [1], a large-scale dataset providing dense point-wise semantic labels for all sequences of the KITTI Odometry Benchmark [10]. This extension enables training and evaluation of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation. We provide the data and discuss the processing steps needed to enrich a given semantic annotation with temporally consistent instance information, i.e., instance information that supplements the semantic labels and identifies the same instance over sequences of LiDAR point clouds. Additionally, we present two strong baselines that combine state-of-the-art LiDAR-based semantic segmentation approaches with a state-of-the-art detector enriching the segmentation with instance information and that allow other researchers to compare their approaches against. We believe that our extension of SemanticKITTI with strong baselines enables the creation of novel algorithms for LiDARbased panoptic segmentation as much as it has for the original semantic segmentation and semantic scene completion tasks. Data, code, and an online evaluation service using a hidden test set are publicly available at http://semantic-kitti.org.}

These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it. Our "SimSiam" method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks. We hope this simple baseline will motivate people to rethink the roles of Siamese architectures for unsupervised representation learning. Code is made available.

In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors.  Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128 bytes per face.  On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result [DeepId2+] by 30\% on both datasets.},

  abstract  = {Scene understanding is critical for autonomous navigation in dynamic environments. Perception tasks in this domain like segmentation and tracking are usually tackled individually. In this paper, we address the problem of 4D panoptic segmentation using LiDAR scans, which requires to assign to each 3D point in a temporal sequence of scans a semantic class and for each object a temporally consistent instance ID. We propose a novel approach that builds on top of an arbitrary single-scan panoptic segmentation network and extends it to the temporal domain by associating instances across time. We propose a contrastive aggregation network that leverages the point-wise features from the panoptic network. It generates an embedding space in which encodings of the same instance at different timesteps lie close together and far from encodings belonging to other instances. The training is inspired by contrastive learning techniques for self-supervised metric learning. Our association module combines appearance and motion cues to associate instances across scans, allowing us to perform temporal perception. We evaluate our proposed method on the SemanticKITTI benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results even without relying on pose information.},

  abstract  = {State-of-the-art methods for large-scale driving-scene LiDAR segmentation often project the point clouds to 2D space and then process them via 2D convolution. Although this corporation shows the competitiveness in the point cloud, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometric relations. A natural remedy is to utilize the 3D voxelization and 3D convolution network. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the improvement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the property of the outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density. Motivated by this investigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor LiDAR segmentation, where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution networks are designed to explore the 3D geometric pattern while mainaining these inhernt properties. Moreover, a point-wise refinement module is introduced to alleviate the interference of lossy voxel-based label encoding. We evaluate the proposed model on two large-scale datasets , i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Our method achieves the 1st place in the leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and outperforms existing methods on nuScenes with a noticeable margin. Furthermore, the proposed 3D framework also generalizes well to LiDAR panoptic segmentation and LiDAR 3D detection.},

  booktitle = iccv,
  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose an anchor-free single-stage LiDAR-based 3D object detector -- RangeDet. The most notable difference with previous works is that our method is purely based on the range view representation. Compared with the commonly used voxelized or Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, the range view representation is more compact and without quantization error. Although there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its performance in object detection is largely behind voxelized or BEV counterparts. We first analyze the existing range-view-based methods and find two issues overlooked by previous works: 1) the scale variation between nearby and far away objects; 2) the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature extraction and the 3D Cartesian coordinates used in output. Then we deliberately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet. We test our RangeDet in the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). Our best model achieves 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist. These results outperform other range-view-based methods by a large margin, and are overall comparable with the state-of-the-art multi-view-based methods.

We therefore investigate an improved sparse convolution method for such networks, which significantly increases the speed of both training and inference. We also introduce a new form of angle loss regression to improve the orientation estimation performance and a new data augmentation approach that can enhance the convergence speed and performance.

  abstract  = {Panoptic segmentation of point clouds is a crucial task that enables autonomous vehicles to comprehend their vicinity using their highly accurate and reliable LiDAR sensors. Existing topdown approaches tackle this problem by either combining independent task-specific networks or translating methods from the image domain ignoring the intricacies of LiDAR data and thus often resulting in suboptimal performance. In this article, we present the novel topdown efficient LiDAR panoptic segmentation (EfficientLPS) architecture that addresses multiple challenges in segmenting LiDAR point clouds, including distance-dependent sparsity, severe occlusions, large scale-variations, and reprojection errors. EfficientLPS comprises of a novel shared backbone that encodes with strengthened geometric transformation modeling capacity and aggregates semantically rich range-aware multiscale features. It incorporates new scale-invariant semantic and instance segmentation heads along with the panoptic fusion module which is supervised by our proposed panoptic periphery loss function. Additionally, we formulate a regularized pseudolabeling framework to further improve the performance of EfficientLPS by training on unlabeled data. We benchmark our proposed model on two largescale LiDAR datasets: nuScenes, for which we also provide ground truth annotations, and SemanticKITTI. Notably, EfficientLPS sets the new state-of-the-art on both these datasets. Index TermsInstance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, scene understanding, semantic segmentation.},

  title     = {{Cascade R-CNN: Delving Into High Quality Object Detection}},
  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2018,
  abstract  = {In object detection, an intersection over union (IoU) threshold is required to define positives and negatives. An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains independently of the baseline detector strength. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoweicai/cascade-rcnn.},

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2022,
  abstract  = {Existing state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation methods perform semantic segmentation followed by grouping. The hard predictions are made when performing semantic segmentation such that each point is associated with a single class. However, the errors stemming from hard decision propagate into grouping that results in (1) low overlaps between the predicted instance with the ground truth and (2) substantial false positives. To address the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a 3D instance segmentation method referred to as SoftGroup by performing bottom-up soft grouping followed by top-down refinement. SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple classes to mitigate the problems stemming from semantic prediction errors and suppresses false positive instances by learning to categorize them as background. Experimental results on different datasets and multiple evaluation metrics demonstrate the efficacy of SoftGroup. Its performance surpasses the strongest prior method by a significant margin of +6.2\% on the ScanNet v2 hidden test set and +6.8\% on S3DIS Area 5 in terms of AP50. SoftGroup is also fast, running at 345ms per scan with a single Titan X on ScanNet v2 dataset.

  abstract  = {Three-dimensional objects are commonly represented as 3D boxes in a point-cloud. This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. On the nuScenes and Waymo datasets, CenterPoint surpasses prior methods by a large margin. On the Waymo Open Dataset, CenterPoint improves previous state-of-the-art by 10-20\% while running at 13FPS. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint.},

  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {Panoptic segmentation as an integrated task of both static environmental understanding and dynamic object identification, has recently begun to receive broad research interest. In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient LiDAR based panoptic segmentation framework, called GP-S3Net. GP-S3Net is a proposal-free approach in which no object proposals are needed to identify the objects in contrast to conventional two-stage panoptic systems, where a detection network is incorporated for capturing instance information.  Our new design consists of a novel instance-level network to process the semantic results by constructing a graph convolutional network to identify objects (foreground), which later on are fused with the background classes. Through the fine-grained clusters of the foreground objects from the semantic segmentation backbone, over-segmentation priors are generated and subsequently processed by 3D sparse convolution to embed each cluster. Each cluster is treated as a node in the graph and its corresponding embedding is used as its node feature. Then a GCNN predicts whether edges exist between each cluster pair. We utilize the instance label to generate ground truth edge labels for each constructed graph in order to supervise the learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GP-S3Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches, by a significant margin across available datasets such as, nuScenes and SemanticPOSS, ranking first on the competitive public SemanticKITTI leaderboard upon publication.},

  booktitle = iccv,
  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box, which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query, each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.

  abstract  = {We present a new method for efficient high-quality image segmentation of objects and scenes. By analogizing classical computer graphics methods for efficient rendering with over- and undersampling challenges faced in pixel labeling tasks, we develop a unique perspective of image segmentation as a rendering problem. From this vantage, we present the PointRend (Point-based Rendering) neural network module: a module that performs point-based segmentation predictions at adaptively selected locations based on an iterative subdivision algorithm. PointRend can be flexibly applied to both instance and semantic segmentation tasks by building on top of existing state-of-the-art models. While many concrete implementations of the general idea are possible, we show that a simple design already achieves excellent results. Qualitatively, PointRend outputs crisp object boundaries in regions that are over-smoothed by previous methods. Quantitatively, PointRend yields significant gains on COCO and Cityscapes, for both instance and semantic segmentation. PointRend's efficiency enables output resolutions that are otherwise impractical in terms of memory or computation compared to existing approaches.

  abstract = {LIDAR semantic segmentation is an essential task that provides 3D semantic information about the environment to robots. Fast and efficient semantic segmentation methods are needed to match the strong computational and temporal restrictions of many real-world robotic applications. This work presents 3D-MiniNet, a novel approach for LIDAR semantic segmentation that combines 3D and 2D learning layers. It first learns a 2D representation from the raw points through a novel projection which extracts local and global information from the 3D data. This representation is fed to an efficient 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) that produces a 2D semantic segmentation. These 2D semantic labels are reprojected back to the 3D space and enhanced through a postprocessing module. The main novelty in our strategy relies on the projection learning module. Our detailed ablation study shows how each component contributes to the final performance of 3D-MiniNet. We validate our approach on well known public benchmarks (SemanticKITTI and KITTI), where 3DMiniNet gets state-of-the-art results while being faster and more parameter-efficient than previous methods.},

  abstract = {We focus on the problem of class-agnostic instance segmentation of LiDAR point clouds. We propose an approach that combines graph-theoretic search with data-driven learning: it searches over a set of candidate segmentations and returns one where individual segments score well according to a datadriven point-based model of objectness. We prove that if we score a segmentation by the worst objectness among its individual segments, there is an efficient algorithm that finds the optimal worst-case segmentation among an exponentially large number of candidate segmentations. We also present an efficient algorithm for the average-case. For evaluation, we repurpose KITTI 3D detection as a segmentation benchmark and empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform past bottom-up segmentation approaches and topdown object-based algorithms on segmenting point clouds.},

  abstract  = {Panoptic scene understanding and tracking of dynamic agents are essential for robots and automated vehicles to navigate in urban environments. As LiDARs provide accurate illumination-independent geometric depictions of the scene, performing these tasks using LiDAR point clouds provides reliable predictions. However, existing datasets lack diversity in the type of urban scenes and have a limited number of dynamic object instances which hinders both learning of these tasks as well as credible benchmarking of the developed methods. In this paper, we introduce the large-scale Panoptic nuScenes benchmark dataset that extends our popular nuScenes dataset with point-wise groundtruth annotations for semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and panoptic tracking tasks. To facilitate comparison, we provide several strong baselines for each of these tasks on our proposed dataset. Moreover, we analyze the drawbacks of the existing metrics for panoptic tracking and propose the novel instance-centric PAT metric that addresses the concerns. We present exhaustive experiments that demonstrate the utility of Panoptic nuScenes compared to existing datasets and make the online evaluation server available at nuScenes.org. We believe that this extension will accelerate the research of novel methods for scene understanding of dynamic urban environments. Index TermsList of keywords (from the RA Letters keyword list)},

  abstract  = { LiDAR point cloud panoptic segmentation, including both semantic and instance segmentation, plays a critical role in meticulous scene understanding for autonomous driving. Existing 3D voxelized approaches either utilize 3D sparse convolution that only focuses on local scene understanding, or add extra and time-consuming PointNet branch to capture global feature structures. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end Prototype-Voxel Contrastive Learning (PVCL) framework for learning stable and discriminative semantic representations, which includes voxel-level and prototype-level contrastive learning (CL). The voxel-level CL decreases intraclass distance and increases inter-class distance among sample representations, while the prototype-level CL further reduces the dependence of CL on negative sampling and avoids the influence of outliers from the same class, enabling PVCL to be more effective for outdoor point cloud panoptic segmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public point cloud panoptic segmentation datasets, Semantic-KITTI and nuScenes, where evaluations and ablation studies demonstrate PVCL achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-theart. Our approach ranks the top on the public leaderboard of Semantic-KITTI at the time of submission, and surpasses the published 2nd rank, EfficientLPS, by 1.7\% in PQ.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a self-supervised framework for training interest point
               detectors and descriptors suitable for a large number of multiple-view geometry
               problems in computer vision. As opposed to patch-based neural networks, our
               fully-convolutional model operates on full-sized images and jointly computes
               pixel-level interest point locations and associated descriptors in one forward
               pass. We introduce Homographic Adaptation, a multi-scale, multi-homography
               approach for boosting interest point detection repeatability and performing
               cross-domain adaptation (e.g., synthetic-to-real). Our model, when trained on
               the MS-COCO generic image dataset using Homographic Adaptation, is able to
               repeatedly detect a much richer set of interest points than the initial
               pre-adapted deep model and any other traditional corner detector. The final
               system gives rise to state-of-the-art homography estimation results on HPatches
               when compared to LIFT, SIFT and ORB.},

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2017,
  abstract  = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

By combining the advantages of 3D scanning, reasoning, and GAN-based domain adaptation techniques, we introduce a novel pipeline named SRDA to obtain large quantities of training samples with very minor effort. Our pipeline is well-suited to scenes that can be scanned, i.e. most indoor and some outdoor scenarios. To evaluate our performance, we build three representative scenes and a new dataset, with 3D models of various common objects categories and annotated real-world scene images. Extensive experiments show that our pipeline can achieve decent instance segmentation performance given very low human labor cost.},

  abstract  = {Most existing convolution neural network (CNN) based super-resolution (SR) methods generate their paired training dataset by artificially synthesizing low-resolution (LR) images from the high-resolution (HR) ones. However, this dataset preparation strategy harms the application of these CNNs in real-world scenarios due to the inherent domain gap between the training and testing data. A popular attempts towards the challenge is unpaired generative adversarial networks, which generate "real" LR counterparts from real HR images using image-to-image translation and then perform super-resolution from "real" LR->SR. Despite great progress, it is still difficult to synthesize perfect "real" LR images for super-resolution. In this paper, we firstly consider the real-world SR problem from the traditional domain adaptation perspective. We propose a novel unpaired SR training framework based on feature distribution alignment, with which we can obtain degradation-indistinguishable feature maps and then map them to HR images. In order to generate better SR images for target LR domain, we introduce several regularization losses to force the aligned feature to locate around the target domain. Our experiments indicate that our SR network obtains the state-of-the-art performance over both blind and unpaired SR methods on diverse datasets.},

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2022,
  abstract  = {Previous super-resolution (SR) approaches often formulate SR as a regression problem and pixel wise restoration, which leads to a blurry and unreal SR output. Recent works combine adversarial loss with pixel-wise loss to train a GAN-based model or introduce normalizing flows into SR problems to generate more realistic images. As another powerful generative approach, autoregressive (AR) model has not been noticed in low level tasks due to its limitation. Based on the fact that given the structural information, the textural details in the natural images are locally related without long term dependency, in this paper we propose a novel autoregressive model-based SR approach, namely LAR-SR, which can efficiently generate realistic SR images using a novel local autoregressive (LAR) module. The proposed LAR module can sample all the patches of textural components in parallel, which greatly reduces the time consumption. In addition to high time efficiency, it is also able to leverage contextual information of pixels and can be optimized with a consistent loss. Experimental results on the widely-used datasets show that the proposed LAR-SR approach achieves superior performance on the visual quality and quantitative metrics compared with other generative models such as GAN, Flow, and is competitive with the mixture generative model.},

  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {It is widely acknowledged that single image super-resolution (SISR) methods would not perform well if the assumed degradation model deviates from those in real images. Although several degradation models take additional factors into consideration, such as blur, they are still not effective enough to cover the diverse degradations of real images. To address this issue, this paper proposes to design a more complex but practical degradation model that consists of randomly shuffled blur, downsampling and noise degradations. Specifically, the blur is approximated by two convolutions with isotropic and anisotropic Gaussian kernels; the downsampling is randomly chosen from nearest, bilinear and bicubic interpolations; the noise is synthesized by adding Gaussian noise with different noise levels, adopting JPEG compression with different quality factors, and generating processed camera sensor noise via reverse-forward camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline model and RAW image noise model. To verify the effectiveness of the new degradation model, we have trained a deep blind ESRGAN super-resolver and then applied it to super-resolve both synthetic and real images with diverse degradations. The experimental results demonstrate that the new degradation model can help to significantly improve the practicability of deep super-resolvers, thus providing a powerful alternative solution for real SISR applications.},

  abstract  = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have demonstrated the potential to recover realistic details for single image super-resolution (SISR). To further improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE, and Ma. However, existing methods cannot directly optimize these indifferentiable perceptual metrics, which are shown to be highly correlated with human ratings. To address the problem, we propose Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator in the direction of perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train a Ranker which can learn the behavior of perceptual metrics and then introduce a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of different SR methods to generate better results. Extensive experiments show that RankSRGAN achieves visually pleasing results and reaches state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics.

  booktitle = cvpr,
  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = {These days, unsupervised super-resolution (SR) is soaring due to its practical and promising potential in real scenarios. The philosophy of off-the-shelf approaches lies in the augmentation of unpaired data, i.e. first generating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images Y^g corresponding to real-world high-resolution (HR) images X^r in the real-world LR domain Y^r, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs Y^g, X^r for training in a supervised manner. Unfortunately, since image translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance of these approaches is severely limited by the domain gap between generated synthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised real-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g. Y^g) and testing data (e.g. Y^r) is addressed with our domain-gap aware training and domain-distance weighted supervision strategies. Domain-gap aware training takes additional benefit from real data in the target domain while domain-distance weighted supervision brings forward the more rational use of labeled source domain data. The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real datasets and the experimental results show that DASR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised SR approaches in generating SR outputs with more realistic and natural textures.

  abstract  = {We present a generic image-to-image translation framework, pixel2style2pixel (pSp). Our pSp framework is based on a novel encoder network that directly generates a series of style vectors which are fed into a pretrained StyleGAN generator, forming the extended W+ latent space. We first show that our encoder can directly embed real images into W+, with no additional optimization. Next, we propose utilizing our encoder to directly solve image-to-image translation tasks, defining them as encoding problems from some input domain into the latent domain. By deviating from the standard invert first, edit later methodology used with previous StyleGAN encoders, our approach can handle a variety of tasks even when the input image is not represented in the StyleGAN domain. We show that solving translation tasks through StyleGAN significantly simplifies the training process, as no adversary is required, has better support for solving tasks without pixel-to-pixel correspondence, and inherently supports multi-modal synthesis via the resampling of styles. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework on a variety of facial image-to-image translation tasks, even when compared to state-of-the-art solutions designed specifically for a single task, and further show that it can be extended beyond the human facial domain.

In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.},

This enables us to generate soft segmentation masks for the foreground object in an unsupervised fashion. On multiple object classes, we report comparable results against state-of-the-art supervised segmentation networks, while against the best unsupervised segmentation approach we demonstrate a clear improvement, both in qualitative and quantitative metrics.

  year      = 2022,
  abstract  = {Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by different cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct proficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from different devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task coded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on the paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured by arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the absence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target domain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model training even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA facilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for two LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA together improve the model transferability from the source domain to the target. We empirically conduct experiments under six Real to Real adaptation settings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the proposed DADA to address the adaptation to the video camera, which presents a promising research topic to promote the wide applications of real-world super-resolution.

  booktitle = iros,
  year      = 2022,
  abstract  = {Integrating different representations from complementary sensing modalities is crucial for robust scene interpretation in autonomous driving. While deep learning architectures that fuse vision and range data for 2D object detection have thrived in recent years, the corresponding modalities can degrade in adverse weather or lighting conditions, ultimately leading to a drop in performance. Although domain adaptation methods attempt to bridge the domain gap between source and target domains, they do not readily extend to heterogeneous data distributions. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework, which adapts a 2D object detector for RGB and LiDAR sensors to one or more target domains featuring adverse weather conditions. Our proposed approach consists of three components. First, a data augmentation scheme that simulates weather distortions is devised to add domain confusion and prevent overfitting on the source data. Second, to promote cross-domain foreground object alignment, we leverage the complementary features of multiple modalities through a multi-scale entropy-weighted domain discriminator. Finally, we use carefully designed pretext tasks to learn a more robust representation of the target domain data. Experiments performed on the DENSE dataset show that our method can substantially alleviate the domain gap under the single-target domain adaptation setting and the less explored yet more general multi-target domain adaptation setting.},

  abstract = {We present StyleFusion, a new mapping architecture for StyleGAN, which takes as input a number of latent codes and fuses them into a single style code. Inserting the resulting style code into a pre-trained StyleGAN generator results in a single harmonized image in which each semantic region is controlled by one of the input latent codes. Effectively, StyleFusion yields a disentangled representation of the image, providing fine-grained control over each region of the generated image. Moreover, to help facilitate global control over the generated image, a special input latent code is incorporated into the fused representation. StyleFusion operates in a hierarchical manner, where each level is tasked with learning to disentangle a pair of image regions (e.g., the car body and wheels). The resulting learned disentanglement allows one to modify both local, fine-grained semantics (e.g., facial features) as well as more global features (e.g., pose and background), providing improved flexibility in the synthesis process. As a natural extension, StyleFusion allows one to perform semantically-aware cross-image mixing of regions that are not necessarily aligned. Finally, we demonstrate how StyleFusion can be paired with existing editing techniques to more faithfully constrain the edit to the user’s region of interest. Code is available at: .}

  booktitle = iros,
  year      = 2021,
  abstract  = { Studies have shown that picking techniques play an important role in determining fruit quality at harvest (e.g. bruising, stem retention, etc). When picking fruit such as apples and pears, professional pickers use active perception, incorporating both visual and tactile input about fruit orientation, stem location, and the fruits immediate surroundings. This combination of tactile, visual, and force feedback is what enables human workers to execute dynamic movements that quickly and efficiently remove fruit from the tree without damage. However, much of the prior work on robotic fruit picking has formulated the harvesting problem as a positioncontrol problem, using visual feedback for closed-loop endeffector placement while disregarding feedback on physical contact. As a first step towards more intelligent fruit picking  combining proprioception, localized sensing, and observed forces  we have developed a custom end-effector with multiple in-hand sensors, including tactile sensors on the fingertips. This paper presents the mechatronic design of the device as well as results from multiple outdoor picking trials with a Honeycrisp apple tree. Preliminary results show that, with multi-modal sensing, fruit slip, fruit separation from the tree, and fruit release from the hand can be detected.},

Those landmarks are selected so as to reduce the discrepancy between the domains and then are used to non linearly project the data in the same space where an efficient subspace alignment (in closed-form) is performed. We carry out a large experimental comparison in visual domain adaptation showing that our new method outperforms the most recent unsupervised DA approaches.},

  booktitle = iros,
  year      = 2022,
  abstract  = {Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has attracted intense study due to its low cost and critical functions for robotic tasks such as localization, mapping and obstacle detection. Supervised approaches have led to great success with the advance of deep learning, but they rely on large quantities of ground-truth depth annotations that are expensive to acquire. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data, so as to relax the constraint of supervised learning. However, existing UDA approaches may not completely align the domain gap across different datasets because of the domain shift problem. We believe better domain alignment can be achieved via welldesigned feature decomposition. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method for MDE, referred to as Learning Feature Decomposition for Adaptation (LFDA), which learns to decompose the feature space into content and style components. LFDA only attempts to align the content component since it has a smaller domain gap. Meanwhile, it excludes the style component which is specific to the source domain from training the primary task. Furthermore, LFDA uses separate feature distribution estimations to further bridge the domain gap. Extensive experiments on three domain adaptative MDE scenarios show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and lower computational cost compared to the stateof-the-art approaches.},
