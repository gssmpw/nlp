\begin{abstract}
Generating and distributing remote entangled pairs (EPs) is a primary function of quantum networks, 
as entanglement is the fundamental resource for key quantum network applications. 
A critical performance metric for quantum networks is the time-to-serve (TTS) for users' EP requests, which is the time to distribute EPs between the requested nodes. 
Minimizing the TTS is essential given the limited qubit coherence time. 
In this paper, we study the Adaptive Continuous entanglement generation Protocol (ACP), which enables quantum network nodes to continuously generate EPs with their neighbors, while adaptively selecting the neighbors to optimize TTS. 
Meanwhile, entanglement purification is used to mitigate decoherence in pre-generated EPs prior to the arrival of user requests.
We extend the SeQUeNCe simulator to fully implement ACP and conduct extensive simulations across various network scales. 
Our results show that ACP reduces TTS by up to $94\%$ and increases entanglement fidelity by up to $0.05$.
%Then through extensive simulations, we evaluate ACP at different network scales, demonstrating significant improvement in TTS (up to $94\%$ decrease) and moderate improvement in entanglement fidelity (up to $6.3\%$ increase).

%The EPs generated by ACP are pre-generated before user requests arrive and may experience fidelity loss in the time between when the EPs are generated and the time when the user request (that will consume the EPs) arrive,
%during idle periods,  which we address through entanglement purification to enhance fidelity. 

%Generating entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits is the core functionality of a quantum network because the user requests will break down into requests for EPs, the fundamental resource for various quantum network applications, such as the transmission of unknown quantum states, distributed quantum computing and distributed quantum sensing. A key metric for a quantum network is the time-to-serve (TTS) of user requests, which is determined by the time to generate EPs. We aim to reduce the TTS because this is particularly critical for quantum applications where qubits have a limited coherence time.

%In this paper, we reduce the TTS by introducing the Adaptive, continuous entanglement generation protocol (\acp) that lets a node continuously generate EPs with neighbor nodes and picks the neighbor nodes wisely by adaptive control. The EPs generated by the \acp\ are pre-generated EPs, i.e., generated before the user request arrives, and may suffer a fidelity loss while sitting in idle. Thus, we leverage entanglement purification to mitigate the fidelity loss and eventually improve the fidelity. We implemented \acp\ in a simulator SeQUeNCe and have done major extensions to SeQUeNCe to fully support \acp. Then we evaluate \acp at various scales using SeQUeNCe and demonstrate the effectiveness, i.e., improvement in both TTS and fidelity.
