\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study the Adaptive, Continuous Entanglement Generation Protocol (\acp), and implement it in the SeQUeNCe quantum network simulator. To support \acp,  
we introduce key extensions of SeQUeNCe, 
%to implement the \acp, 
including an entanglement generation protocol that accounts for existing \acp-generated EPs, 
%generated by the \acp, 
and an entanglement purification strategy to improve fidelity.
%We conduct 
Through extensive simulations using SeQUeNCe, we evaluate the performance of the \acp.
Our simulation results show that the \acp\ reduces the request's time-to-serve by \red{$57\%\sim94\%$} and improves the fidelity of distributed EPs by $0.01\sim0.05$.
