abstract = {Following the prevalence of short-form video, short-form voice content has emerged on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. A challenge that creators face is hard constraints on the content length. If the initial recording is not short enough, they need to re-record or edit their content. Both are time-consuming, and the latter, if supported, can have a learning curve. Moreover, creators need to manually create multiple versions to publish content on platforms with different length constraints. To simplify this process, we present ROPE1 (Record Once, Post Everywhere). Creators can record voice content once, and our system will automatically shorten it to all length limits by removing parts of the recording for each target. We formulate this as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose a novel algorithm that automatically selects optimal sentence combinations from the original content to comply with each length constraint. Creators can customize the algorithmically shortened content by specifying sentences to include or exclude. Our system can also use the user-specified constraints to recompute and provides a new version. We conducted a user study comparing ROPE with a sentence-based manual editing baseline. The results show that ROPE can generate high-quality edits, alleviating the cognitive loads of creators for shortening content. While our system and user study address short-form voice content specifically, we believe that the same concept can also be applied to other media such as video with narration and dialog.},

abstract = {Explaining the mechanisms behind model predictions is a common strategy in AI-assisted decision-making to help users rely appropriately on AI. However, recent research shows that the effectiveness of explanations depends on numerous factors, leading to mixed results, with many studies finding no effect or even an increase in overreliance, while explanations do improve appropriate reliance in other studies. We consider the factor of decision difficulty to better understand when feature-based explanations can mitigate overreliance. To this end, we conducted an online experiment (N = 200) with carefully selected task instances that cover a wide range of difficulties. We found that explanations reduce overreliance for easy decisions, but that this effect vanishes with increasing decision difficulty. For the most difficult decisions, explanations might even increase overreliance. Our results imply that explanations of the model’s inner workings are only helpful for a limited set of decision tasks where users easily know the answer themselves.},

In this paper, we study "batch labeling", an AI-assisted UX paradigm, that aids data labelers by allowing a single labeling action to apply to multiple records. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk with 156 participants to investigate labeler-AI-batching system interaction. We investigate the efficacy of the system when compared to a single-item labeling interface (i.e., labeling one record at-a-time), and evaluate the impact of batch labeling on accuracy and time. We further investigate the impact of AI algorithm quality and its effects on the labelers' overreliance, as well as potential mechanisms for mitigating it. Our work offers implications for the design of batch labeling systems and for work practices focusing on labeler-AI-batching system interaction.},

abstract = {Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs’ expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants’ reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., “I’m not sure, but...”) decrease participants’ confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system’s answers, while increasing participants’ accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., “It’s not clear, but...”), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.},

abstract = {Prior work has identified a resilient phenomenon that threatens the performance of human-AI decision-making teams: overreliance, when people agree with an AI, even when it is incorrect. Surprisingly, overreliance does not reduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only providing predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from cognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an inevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people strategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation, demonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce overreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a cost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task are weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate the costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a simulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (N = 731), we find that costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2, 3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance. Finally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify the utility of different explanations, providing further support for our framework. Our results suggest that some of the null effects found in literature could be due in part to the explanation not sufficiently reducing the costs of verifying the AI's prediction.},

We hypothesized that the use of an LLM as a CST might make the LLM’s users feel more creative, and even broaden the range of ideas suggested by each individual user, but also homogenize the ideas suggested by different users. We conducted a 36-participant comparative user study and found, in accordance with the homogenization hypothesis, that different users tended to produce less semantically distinct ideas with ChatGPT than with an alternative CST. Additionally, ChatGPT users generated a greater number of more detailed ideas, but felt less responsible for the ideas they generated. We discuss potential implications of these findings for users, designers, and developers of LLM-based CSTs.},

abstract = {Thinking of technology as a design material is appealing. It encourages designers to explore the material’s properties to understand its capabilities and limitations—a prerequisite to generative design thinking. However, as a material, AI resists this approach because its properties only emerge as part of the user experience design. Therefore, designers and AI engineers must collaborate in new ways to create both the material and its application experience. We investigate the co-creation process through a design study with 10 pairs of designers and engineers. We find that design ‘probes’ with user data are a useful tool in defining AI materials. Through data probes, designers construct designerly representations of the envisioned AI experience (AIX) to identify desirable AI characteristics. Data probes facilitate divergent design thinking, material testing, and design validation. Based on our findings, we propose a process model for co-creating AIX and offer design considerations for incorporating data probes in AIX design tools.},

TTCW consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by professional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated stories pass 3-10X less TTCW tests than stories written by professionals. In addition, we explore the use of LLMs as assessors to automate the TTCW evaluation, revealing that none of the LLMs positively correlate with the expert assessments.},

There are many AI workflows that solve real and complex problems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although there is an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflows are after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generative AI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users’ individual needs, but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinal study with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization of generative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that there exists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novel capabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful. After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate the outputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of the system was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility of AI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes from end-users’ ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate the system to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systems can allow us to design for appropriation.},

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40\% and output quality rose by 18\%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment. Automation has historically displaced human workers in factories (e.g., automotive manufacturing) or in performing routine computational tasks. Will generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT disrupt the labor market by making educated professionals obsolete, or will these tools complement their skills and enhance productivity? Noy and Zhang examined this issue in an experiment that recruited college-educated professionals to complete incentivized writing tasks. Participants assigned to use ChatGPT were more productive, efficient, and enjoyed the tasks more. Participants with weaker skills benefited the most from ChatGPT, which carries policy implications for efforts to reduce productivity inequality through AI. —EEU The assistive chatbot ChatGPT raises productivity in professional writing tasks and reduces productivity inequality.}}

abstract = {Narrative, and in particular storytelling, is an important part of the human experience. Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors - logical and aesthetic - that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audience's suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem - to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm - the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner - that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.},

Story generation is knowledge-intensive; traditional story generators rely on a priori defined domain models about fictional worlds, including characters, places, and actions that can be performed. Manually authoring the domain models is costly and thus not scalable. We present a novel class of story generation system that can generate stories in an unknown domain. Our system (a) automatically learns a domain model by crowdsourcing a corpus of narrative examples and (b) generates stories by sampling from the space defined by the domain model. A large-scale evaluation shows that stories generated by our system for a previously unknown topic are comparable in quality to simple stories authored by untrained humans.},

However, many types of complex creative work, such as fiction writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because work is tightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the overall plot and vice versa. Taking inspiration from how expert authors write, we propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds. With this technique, the crowd loops between reflection, to select a high-level goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical Novel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work.},

In this work we investigate how language models can support science writing, a challenging writing task that is both open-ended and highly constrained. We present a system for generating “sparks”, sentences related to a scientific concept intended to inspire writers. We find that our sparks are more coherent and diverse than a competitive language model baseline, and approach a human-written gold standard. We run a user study with 13 STEM graduate students writing on topics of their own selection and find three main use cases of sparks—inspiration, translation, and perspective—each of which correlates with a unique interaction pattern. We also find that while participants were more likely to select higher quality sparks, the average quality of sparks seen by a given participant did not correlate with their satisfaction with the tool. We end with a discussion about what impacts human satisfaction with AI support tools, considering participant attitudes towards influence, their openness to technology, as well as issues of plagiarism, trustworthiness, and bias in AI.},

However, writers remain unsupported in intuitively understanding the AI’s actions or steering the iterative generation. We introduce TaleBrush, a generative story ideation tool that uses line sketching interactions with a GPT-based language model for control and sensemaking of a protagonist’s fortune in co-created stories. Our empirical evaluation found our pipeline reliably controls story generation while maintaining the novelty of generated sentences. In a user study with 14 participants with diverse writing experiences, we found participants successfully leveraged sketching to iteratively explore and write stories according to their intentions about the character’s fortune while taking inspiration from generated stories. We conclude with a reflection on how sketching interactions can facilitate the iterative human-AI co-creation process.},

We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations—including plagiarism and bias—and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools.},

abstract = {Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by “unit-testing” sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications.},

abstract = {A storyboard is a sequence of images to illustrate a story containing multiple sentences, which has been a key process to create different story products. In this paper, we tackle a new multimedia task of automatic storyboard creation to facilitate this process and inspire human artists. Inspired by the fact that our understanding of languages is based on our past experience, we propose a novel inspire-and-create framework with a story-to-image retriever that selects relevant cinematic images for inspiration and a storyboard creator that further refines and renders images to improve the relevancy and visual consistency. The proposed retriever dynamically employs contextual information in the story with hierarchical attentions and applies dense visual-semantic matching to accurately retrieve and ground images. The creator then employs three rendering steps to increase the flexibility of retrieved images, which include erasing irrelevant regions, unifying styles of images and substituting consistent characters. We carry out extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain visual story datasets. The proposed model achieves better quantitative performance than the state-of-the-art baselines for storyboard creation. Qualitative visualizations and user studies further verify that our approach can create high-quality storyboards even for stories in the wild.},

Existing data-driven support for storyboarding focuses on constructing user stories, but fail to address its benefit as a graphic narrative device. Instead, we propose to develop a data-driven design support tool that increases the expressiveness of user stories by facilitating sketching storyboards. To explore this, we focus on supporting the sketching of emotional expressions of characters in storyboards. In this paper, we present EmoG, an interactive system that generates sketches of characters with emotional expressions based on input strokes from the user. We evaluated EmoG with 21 participants in a controlled user study. The results showed that our tool has significantly better performance in usefulness, ease of use, and quality of results than the baseline system.},

The resurgence of stereoscopic media has motivated filmmakers to evolve a new stereo-cinematic vocabulary, as many principles for stereo 3D film are unique. Concepts like plane separation, parallax position, and depth budgets are missing from early planning due to the 2D nature of existing storyboards. Storeoboard is the first of its kind, allowing filmmakers to explore, experiment and conceptualize ideas in stereo early in the film pipeline, develop new stereo-cinematic constructs and foresee potential difficulties. Storeoboard is the design outcome of interviews and field work with directors, stereographers, and storyboard artists. We present our design guidelines and implementation of a tool combining stereo-sketching, depth manipulations and storyboard features into a coherent and novel workflow. We report on feedback from storyboard artists, industry professionals and the director of a live action, feature film on which Storeoboard was deployed.},

However, creating coding strips is a creative, time-consuming process. Creators have to generate stories from code (code↦story) and design comics from stories (story↦comic). We contribute CodeToon, a comic authoring tool that facilitates this code-driven storytelling process with two mechanisms: (1) story ideation from code using metaphor and (2) automatic comic generation from the story. We conducted a two-part user study that evaluates the tool and the comics generated by participants to test whether CodeToon facilitates the authoring process and helps generate quality comics. Our results show that CodeToon helps users create accurate, informative, and useful coding strips in a significantly shorter time. Overall, this work contributes methods and design guidelines for code-driven storytelling and opens up opportunities for using art to support computer science education.},

In a needfinding study with a widely used, interactive musical AI, we found that the AI can overwhelm users with the amount of musical content it generates, and frustrate them with its non-deterministic output. To better match co-creation needs, we developed AI-steering tools, consisting of Voice Lanes that restrict content generation to particular voices; Example-Based Sliders to control the similarity of generated content to an existing example; Semantic Sliders to nudge music generation in high-level directions (happy/sad, conventional/surprising); and Multiple Alternatives of generated content to audition and choose from. In a summative study (N=21), we discovered the tools not only increased users' trust, control, comprehension, and sense of collaboration with the AI, but also contributed to a greater sense of self-efficacy and ownership of the composition relative to the AI.},

In this paper, we address this challenge with Opal, a system that produces text-to-image generations for news illustration. Given an article, Opal guides users through a structured search for visual concepts and provides a pipeline allowing users to generate illustrations based on an article’s tone, keywords, and related artistic styles. Our evaluation shows that Opal efficiently generates diverse sets of news illustrations, visual assets, and concept ideas. Users with Opal generated two times more usable results than users without.

In particular, we study prompts structured to include subject and style keywords and investigate success and failure modes of these prompts. Our evaluation of 5493 generations over the course of five experiments spans 51 abstract and concrete subjects as well as 51 abstract and figurative styles.

To address this challenge, we developed a web application that allows friends to asynchronously collaborate creatively. In this application, multiple people can contribute to the writing of a story, told partially by a natural language AI system. By offloading some of the creative work to the AI, the human writers have the opportunity to also act as readers, being surprised by new events in the story. To gain preliminary insights into the experience of using this system, we conducted an informal pilot study over a span of 5 days. Through this process, we learned that storytelling with an AI system can encourage roleplay, it can be a cathartic experience, and it is curiosity-driven. Our recommendations for future research include (1) investigating new turn-taking strategies, and clearly communicating turns through the interface, (2) providing guidance for the prompt-writing process, perhaps through editable prompt templates, and (3) conducting a thorough evaluation of the system with friend groups of various sizes and timezones.},

These models have even demonstrated an ability to perform arbitrary tasks without explicit training. In this work, we sought to learn how people might use such models in the process of creative writing. We built Wordcraft, a text editor in which users collaborate with a generative language model to write a story. We evaluated Wordcraft with a user study in which participants wrote short stories with and without the tool. Our results show that large language models enable novel co-writing experiences. For example, the language model is able to engage in open-ended conversation about the story, respond to writers’ custom requests expressed in natural language (such as ”rewrite this text to be more Dickensian”), and generate suggestions that serve to unblock writers in the creative process. Based on these results, we discuss design implications for future human-AI co-writing systems.},

abstract = {While LLMs have made it possible to rapidly prototype new ML functionalities, many real-world applications involve complex tasks that cannot be easily handled via a single run of an LLM. Recent work has found that chaining multiple LLM runs together (with the output of one step being the input to the next) can help users accomplish these more complex tasks, and in a way that is perceived to be more transparent and controllable. However, it remains unknown what users need when authoring their own LLM chains – a key step to lowering the barriers for non-AI-experts to prototype AI-infused applications. In this work, we explore the LLM chain authoring process. We find from pilot studies that users need support transforming data between steps of a chain, as well as debugging the chain at multiple granularities. To address these needs, we designed PromptChainer, an interactive interface for visually programming chains. Through case studies with four designers and developers, we show that PromptChainer supports building prototypes for a range of applications, and conclude with open questions on scaling chains to even more complex tasks, as well as supporting low-fi chain prototyping.},

Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness.

An evaluation of the workflow shows that decentralized groups can generate blends in independent microtasks, co-located groups can collaboratively make visual blends for their own messages, and VisiBlends improves novices' ability to make visual blends.},

abstract = {In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confirmed the usability and effectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.},

 abstract = {How and why individuals adopt innovations has motivated a great deal of research. This article examines individuals' computing adoption processes through the lenses of three adoption theories: Rogers's innovation diffusion theory, the Concerns-Based Adoption Model, the Technology Acceptance Model, and the United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Incorporating all three models, this article suggests technology adoption is a complex, inherently social, developmental process; individuals construct unique yet malleable perceptions of technology that influence their adoption decisions. Thus, successfully facilitating technology adoption must address cognitive, emotional, and contextual concerns. This article also focuses specific attention on adoption theory outside of a formal organization and the implications of adoption theory on informal environments.},
