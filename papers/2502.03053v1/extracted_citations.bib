Crucial to stemming the tide of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is communicating to vulnerable populations the means by which they can protect themselves. To this end, the collaborators forming the Translation Initiative for COvid-19 (TICO-19) have made test and development data available to AI and MT researchers in 35 different languages in order to foster the development of tools and resources for improving access to information about COVID-19 in these languages. In addition to 9 high-resourced, {''}pivot{''} languages, the team is targeting 26 lesser resourced languages, in particular languages of Africa, South Asia and South-East Asia, whose populations may be the most vulnerable to the spread of the virus. The same data is translated into all of the languages represented, meaning that testing or development can be done for any pairing of languages in the set. Further, the team is converting the test and development data into translation memories (TMXs) that can be used by localizers from and to any of the languages.",

In this article, we present hand-crafted, discourse test sets, designed to test the models{'} ability to exploit previous source and target sentences. We investigate the performance of recently proposed multi-encoder NMT models trained on subtitles for English to French. We also explore a novel way of exploiting context from the previous sentence. Despite gains using BLEU, multi-encoder models give limited improvement in the handling of discourse phenomena: 50{\%} accuracy on our coreference test set and 53.5{\%} for coherence/cohesion (compared to a non-contextual baseline of 50{\%}). A simple strategy of decoding the concatenation of the previous and current sentence leads to good performance, and our novel strategy of multi-encoding and decoding of two sentences leads to the best performance (72.5{\%} for coreference and 57{\%} for coherence/cohesion), highlighting the importance of target-side context.",

In this work, we first propose a method for creating paragraph-level data for training and meta-evaluating metrics from existing sentence-level data. Then, we use these new datasets to benchmark existing sentence-level metrics as well as train learned metrics at the paragraph level. Interestingly, our experimental results demonstrate that using sentence-level metrics to score entire paragraphs is equally as effective as using a metric designed to work at the paragraph level. We speculate this result can be attributed to properties of the task of reference-based evaluation as well as limitations of our datasets with respect to capturing all types of phenomena that occur in paragraph-level translations.",

Recent works in context-aware MT attempt to target a small set of discourse phenomena during evaluation, however not in a fully systematic way. In this paper, we develop the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) benchmark, a series of taggers that identify and evaluate model performance on discourse phenomena in any given dataset. The choice of phenomena is inspired by a novel methodology to systematically identify translations that require context. This methodology confirms the difficulty of previously studied phenomena while uncovering others which were not previously addressed. We find that commonly studied context-aware MT models make only marginal improvements over context-agnostic models, which suggests these models do not handle these ambiguities effectively. We release code and data for 14 language pairs to encourage the MT community to focus on accurately capturing discourse phenomena. Code available at \url{https://github.com/neulab/contextual-mt}",

Assuming independence between sentences makes it difficult to take certain translation decisions when the necessary information cannot be determined locally. We argue for the necessity to include crosssentence dependencies in SMT. As a case in point, we study the problem of pronominal anaphora translation by manually evaluating German-English SMT output. We then present a word dependency model for SMT, which can represent links between word pairs in the same or in different sentences. We use this model to integrate the output of a coreference resolution system into English-German SMT with a view to improving the translation of anaphoric pronouns.",

Recent work on models that have access to information across sentence boundaries has seen only moderate improvements in terms of automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU. However, metrics that quantify the overall translation quality are ill-equipped to measure gains from additional context. We argue that a different kind of evaluation is needed to assess how well models translate inter-sentential phenomena such as pronouns. This paper therefore presents a test suite of contrastive translations focused specifically on the translation of pronouns. Furthermore, we perform experiments with several context-aware models. We show that, while gains in BLEU are moderate for those systems, they outperform baselines by a large margin in terms of accuracy on our contrastive test set. Our experiments also show the effectiveness of parameter tying for multi-encoder architectures.",

Firstly, standard metrics are not sensitive to improvements in consistency in document-level translations. Secondly, previous work on context-aware NMT assumed that the sentence-aligned parallel data consisted of complete documents while in most practical scenarios such document-level data constitutes only a fraction of the available parallel data. To address the first issue, we perform a human study on an English-Russian subtitles dataset and identify deixis, ellipsis and lexical cohesion as three main sources of inconsistency. We then create test sets targeting these phenomena. To address the second shortcoming, we consider a set-up in which a much larger amount of sentence-level data is available compared to that aligned at the document level. We introduce a model that is suitable for this scenario and demonstrate major gains over a context-agnostic baseline on our new benchmarks without sacrificing performance as measured with BLEU.",

Sentences that require context to be translated correctly are rare in test sets, reducing the utility of standard corpus-level metrics such as COMET or BLEU. On the other hand, datasets that annotate such sentences are also rare, small in scale, and available for only a few languages. To address this, we modernize, generalize, and extend previous annotation pipelines to produce MultiPro, a tool that identifies subsets of parallel documents containing sentences that require context to correctly translate five phenomena: gender, formality, and animacy for pronouns, verb phrase ellipsis, and ambiguous noun inflections. The input to the pipeline is a set of hand-crafted, per-language, linguistically-informed rules that select contextual sentence pairs using coreference, part-of-speech, and morphological features provided by state-of-the-art tools. We apply this pipeline to seven languages pairs (EN into and out-of DE, ES, FR, IT, PL, PT, and RU) and two datasets (OpenSubtitles and WMT test sets), and validate its performance using both overlap with previous work and its ability to discriminate a contextual MT system from a sentence-based one. We release the MultiPro pipeline and data as open source.",
