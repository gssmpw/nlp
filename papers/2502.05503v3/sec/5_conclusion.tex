\section{Conclusion}

The rapid development of the video generation field has raised higher demands for video benchmarks, necessitating more comprehensive and effective methods for evaluating video quality. In this paper, we introduce PhyCoBench, a benchmark specifically focused on the dimension of physical coherence in videos. We have carefully designed a prompt set that comprehensively covers various physical scenarios. We also utilize an optical flow-guided frame prediction model, PhyCoPredictor, which effectively predicts the motion trajectories of objects. Based on this model and the prompt set, we can effectively assess whether the content of a video adheres to physical coherence. We believe that PhyCoBench makes a significant contribution to the fields of video generation and evaluation, and will aid in enhancing the capabilities of future video generation models.
