\label{sec:data-availability}

This paper is accompanied by \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14592164}{an artifact}~\cite{Pelsmaeker_OOPSLA25_Artifact}, a Docker container that includes our reference synthesis tool, source code, and its dependencies.
Our tool can be executed in \emph{evaluation} mode to reproduce the data presented in~\cref{sec:evaluation}.
The evaluation utilizes a set of test programs with locked references, that are all included in the artifact.
Additionally, the original test sets from which the test cases were derived are also provided for further reference.
