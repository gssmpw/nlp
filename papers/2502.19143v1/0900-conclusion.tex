\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a novel approach reference synthesis that is \emph{automatic}, \emph{language-parametric}, and \emph{sound}---generating only well-typed references to the intended declarations.
This approach is applicable to any language whose static semantics is defined using typing rules in Statix~\cite{AntwerpenPRV18}.
It works out-of-the-box for such languages, is \emph{sound} by construction, and uses non-deterministic search to provide a high degree of \emph{completeness}.
Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm works on practical examples, but also reveals that our generic approach comes with a high performance cost, which we intend to explore in future work.
