\section{MIMIC-III Experiment Results} 
\label{sec:MIMIC_Results} 

Below is all supplementary material for the MIMIC-III experiment. This includes BoP distribution plots and plots showing how incomprehensiveness and sufficiency change over the number of features removed. 




\subsection{Experiment Plots}\label{subsec:mimic_plots}
In the following section, we show supplementary plots for the regression task on the auditing dataset. We show the distribution of the BoP across participants for all three metrics we evaluate. We overlay Laplace and Gaussian distributions to see which fit the individual BoP distribution best, illustrating that prediction and incomprehensiveness are best fit by Laplace distributions and sufficiency by a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we show how incomprehensiveness and sufficiency change for the number of important attributes $r$ that are kept are removed.
