\textbf{Multimodal Multi-label Emotion Regression.} It aims to infer human emotions from textual, audio, and visual sequences in video clips, often encompassing multiple affective states. The primary challenges in MMER is integrating multimodal data. Early studies like MISA ____ address modality heterogeneity by decoupled invariant and modality-specific features for fusion. MMS2S ____ and HHMPN ____ focused on modeling label-to-label and label-to-modality dependencies using Transformer and GNNs network. Recent approaches ____ incorporated advanced training techniques; for example, TAILOR ____ utilized adversarial learning to differentiate common and private modal features, while AMP ____ employed masking and parameter perturbation to mitigate modality bias and enhance robustness. However, these works all model from multimodal fusion instead of emotion latent space. \\
\textbf{Uncertainty-aware Learning and Calibration.} Deep models often overconfidently assign high confidence to incorrect predictions, making uncertainty-aware learning essential to ensure confidence accurately reflects prediction uncertainty ____. The primary goal is to calibrate model confidence to match the true probability of correctness. There are two main approaches: calibrated uncertainty ____ and ordinal or ranking-based uncertainty ____. Calibration methods, such as histogram binning, temperature scaling, and accuracy versus uncertainty calibration ____, align predicted confidence with actual correctness. Meanwhile, ranking-based methods like Confidence Ranking Loss (CRL) ____ enforce accurate confidence rankings among correctly classified samples based on feature distinctiveness.\\
\textbf{Uncertainty-based Multimodal Fusion.} Uncertainty learning enhances multimodal fusion across tasks. ____ employed Bayesian deep learning and AvU to guide fusion, while ____ used temporal-invariant learning to reduce redundancy and noise, improving robustness. But these methods incorporate uncertainty without calibration. In contrast, COLD ____ leveraged GURs to model feature distributions across modalities, quantifies modality contributions with variance norms, and integrated both calibrated and ranking-based uncertainty to regulate fusion variance. However, there hasn't exploration of uncertainty-aware for MMER.
