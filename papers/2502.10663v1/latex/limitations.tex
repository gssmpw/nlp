\section{Limitations}

\name requires a LLM for summarizing attribute information from the knowledge base, and a VQA model for question answering. Using commercial models can lead to financial cost, as it takes \$0.03 to evaluate an image on average with GPT-4o. However, this can be eliminated using open source models such as mPLUG-Owl3, which already show similar performance to Google's Gemini-1.5 model. Also, it takes 10 seconds on average to score an image, but processing speed can be greatly accelerated using asynchronous programming. In the future we should cover more dimensions, such as logic, commonsense knowledge, etc.
