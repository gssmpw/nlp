Multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation is vital for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR). To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process.
We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. 
First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment.
Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.
