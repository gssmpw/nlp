\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-label enhancement approach for multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation domain adaptation, guided by 2D SAM masks. The proposed method refines pseudo-labels within each SAM mask using MLA and GAPP, ensuring robustness against pseudo-label noise and the 2D-3D misalignment issue. Experiments conducted on multiple domain adaptation tasks and scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully produces denser pseudo-labels with similar/higher pseudo-label accuracy. The enhanced pseudo-labels significantly improve the adaptation performance.
