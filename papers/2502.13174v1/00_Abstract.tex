Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. 
Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. 
To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Generative Topology Optimization} (GenTO) -- a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint.
The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. 
The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements.
We validate GenTO on 2D and 3D TO problems. 
Our results demonstrate that GenTO produces more diverse solutions than any prior method while maintaining near-optimality and being an order of magnitude faster due to inherent parallelism.
These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.\isformat{icml}
