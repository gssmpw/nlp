Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. 
While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. 
This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. 
To address this, we introduce \textbf{MIKASA} (\textbf{M}emory-\textbf{I}ntensive S\textbf{k}ills \textbf{A}ssessment \textbf{S}uite for \textbf{A}gents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect \textbf{MIKASA-Base} -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop \textbf{MIKASA-Robo} -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation.
Our contributions establish a unified framework for advancing memory RL research, driving the development of more reliable systems for real-world applications. The code is available at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/memorybenchrobots/}.
