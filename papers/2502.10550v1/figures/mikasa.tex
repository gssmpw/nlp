    \caption{MIKASA bridges the gap between human-like memory complexity and RL agents requirements. While agents tasks don’t require the full spectrum of human memory capabilities, they can’t be reduced to simple spatio-temporal dependencies. MIKASA provides a balanced framework that captures essential memory aspects for agents tasks while maintaining practical simplicity.}
