    \caption{Illustration of demonstrative memory-intensive tasks execution from the proposed MIKASA-Robo benchmark. The \texttt{ShellGameTouch-v0} task requires the agent to memorize the ball's location under mugs and touch the correct one. In \texttt{RememberColor9-v0}, the agent must memorize a cube's color and later select the matching one. In \texttt{RotateLenientPos-v0}, the agent must rotate a peg while keeping track of its previous rotations.}
