\textbf{Class}

& \textbf{Example}
\\

\midrule

Object Permanence
& Understanding that object continue to exist even when it cannot be observed.
& The object is placed in one of the boxes and after some time the agent must correctly identify the box with the object.

\\%[-5pt]

Categorical Perception
& Formation of perceptions, in which specific attributes are identified with a certain class of objects that have a certain meaning.
& The agent sees an object of a specific color, then must select the same color object from a set of objects of the same shape but different colors.

\\%[-5pt]

Conjunction of Categories
& Understanding the different properties of an object and being able to separate them.
& The agent sees an object with a particular shape and color, then must select an object matching both attributes from a set of objects with variations of shapes and colors.

\\%[-5pt]

Perception Memory Span
& The number of different attributes of an object agent is able to memorize.
& The agent must remember as many different features of one object (color, shape, mass, size, etc.) of the cube as possible.

\\%[-5pt]

Essence Memory Span
& The number of different objects with the same attribute that the agent is able to memorize.
& The agent must memorize as many colors of cubes on the table as possible.

\\%[-5pt]

Serial Recall
& Memorize and reproduce ordered information in the exact order.
& The agent must memorize and reconstruct in exact order the sequence of actions / events in the environment.

\\%[-5pt]

Spatial Reasoning
& Memorize spatial relationships between objects.
& An agent in a maze must memorize its structure for more efficient navigation.

\\%[-5pt]

Causal Reasoning
& Identify cause-and-effect relationships.
& The agent must recall and relate an action/event from the past to a response in the present.

\\%[-5pt]

Transitive Inference
& Infer the relationship between items (e.g., A$>$C) after having memorized a set of premise pairs (e.g., A$>$B and B$>$C).
& The agent must memorize the object hierarchy to make comparisons between objects when the comparison between each object is not explicitly shown.
