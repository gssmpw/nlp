	abstract = {AI tools intend to transform mental healthcare by providing remote estimates of depression risk using behavioral data collected by sensors embedded in smartphones. While these tools accurately predict elevated depression symptoms in small, homogenous populations, recent studies show that these tools are less accurate in larger, more diverse populations. In this work, we show that accuracy is reduced because sensed-behaviors are unreliable predictors of depression across individuals: sensed-behaviors that predict depression risk are inconsistent across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. We first identified subgroups where a developed AI tool underperformed by measuring algorithmic bias, where subgroups with depression were incorrectly predicted to be at lower risk than healthier subgroups. We then found inconsistencies between sensed-behaviors predictive of depression across these subgroups. Our findings suggest that researchers developing AI tools predicting mental health from sensed-behaviors should think critically about the generalizability of these tools, and consider tailored solutions for targeted populations.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to increase uniformity and unambiguity of evaluation through rating scales of schizophrenia and schizophrenialike psychosis, the 5-step edition of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is used. In this edition of BPRS the 18 symptoms and the symptom grading are expressed in explicit item definitions. Symptoms in the Hamilton Depression Scale and in the Beigel Mania Scale which correlate with BPRS have been incorporated as far as possible. Despite wide international application of BPRS, only few reliability and validity studies have been made, the fact notwithstanding that the scale is used as a reference when new scales are introduced.This interim statement includes weekly co-rating of in-patients on the BPRS. The studies were commenced in August 1984. The rating procedure takes place between 8.15 and 9.00 a.m. and each patient is examined only once. The maximum number of raters is six but varies between three and six per rating procedure. The evaluated patients all comply with DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia.Reliability is expressed by intra-class correlation R = 0.78, p. {\textless} 0.001, for the total scale. When considering degree of severity the global estimate (validity) showed a correlation of R = 0.66, p. {\textless} 0.01. After 18 weeks of co-ratings all other schizophrenic in-patients - a total of 17 - were rated as a control group. There was no difference between the two populations of schizophrenic patients, t = 0.92, p = 0.36.},

Greater frequency of data collection is more important for shorter-term therapies, and use of graphs, greater specificity of feedback, and alerts are helpful. Overall effects on patient outcomes are statistically significant (g ≈ 0.15) and increase when clinical support tools (CSTs) are used for not-on-track cases (g ≈ 0.36–0.53). Effects are additive to standard effects of psychological therapies. Organizational, personnel, and resource issues remain the greatest obstacles to the successful adoption of ROM.Conclusion ROM offers a low-cost method for enhancing patient outcomes, on average resulting in an ≈ 8\% advantage (success rate difference; SRD) over standard care. CSTs are particularly effective for not-on-track patients (SRD between ≈ 20\% and 29\%), but ROM does not work for all patients and successful implementation is a major challenge, along with securing appropriate cultural adaptations.},

However, the collection of detailed clinical information about reported cases, which is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, to understand transmission, or to determine disease-related risk factors, is still heavily dependent on manual processes. The increasing prevalence and functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the United States present important opportunities to advance public health surveillance. EHR data have the potential to further increase the breadth, detail, timeliness, and completeness of public health surveillance and thereby provide better data to guide public health interventions. EHRs also provide a unique opportunity to expand the role and vision of current surveillance efforts and to help bridge the gap between public health practice and clinical medicine.},

We live in a time of change, with a shift from care being delivered by professionals towards people being expected to be actively engaged and involved in shared decision making. Technically, this shift is supported by novel health technologies and information resources ; culturally, the pace of change varies across contexts. In this paper, I present a “space” of interactive health technologies, users and uses, and interdependencies between them. Based on a review of the past and present, I highlight opportunities for and challenges to the application of HCI methods in the design and deployment of digital health technologies.

	abstract = {Although current classification systems have greatly contributed to the reliability of psychiatric diagnoses, they ignore the unique role of individual symptoms and, consequently, potentially important information is lost. The network approach, in contrast, assumes that psychopathology results from the causal interplay between psychiatric symptoms and focuses specifically on these symptoms and their complex associations. By using a sophisticated network analysis technique, this study constructed an empirically based network structure of 120 psychiatric symptoms of twelve major DSM-IV diagnoses using cross-sectional data of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, second wave; N = 34,653). The resulting network demonstrated that symptoms within the same diagnosis showed differential associations and indicated that the strategy of summing symptoms, as in current classification systems, leads to loss of information. In addition, some symptoms showed strong connections with symptoms of other diagnoses, and these specific symptom pairs, which both concerned overlapping and non-overlapping symptoms, may help to explain the comorbidity across diagnoses. Taken together, our findings indicated that psychopathology is very complex and can be more adequately captured by sophisticated network models than current classification systems. The network approach is, therefore, promising in improving our understanding of psychopathology and moving our field forward.},

The model offers a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe the progression of HCI knowledge through a sequence of translations. Additionally, the model may facilitate a precise identification of translational barriers, which allows devising more effective strategies to increase the use of scientific findings in design practice.},

From this perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

After screening for data quality, our sample included 147 college student participants and 270 weeks of data. We examined correlations between six weekly surveys and 13 metrics derived from passive data features. Finally, we trained logistic regression models to predict survey scores from passive data with and without daily surveys.ResultsSimilar to other large studies, our correlations were lower than prior reports from smaller studies. We found that the most useful features came from GPS, call, and sleep duration data. Logistic regression models performed poorly with only passive data, but when daily survey scores were included, performance greatly increased.ConclusionsAlthough passive data alone may not provide enough information to predict survey scores, augmenting this data with short daily surveys can improve performance. Therefore, it may be that passive data can be used to refine survey score predictions and clinical utility may be derived from the combination of active and passive data.},

But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” differs from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (offline sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psycho-social signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quality of mental health treatment has not progressed to the same extent as physical health treatment. Suboptimal mental health outcomes may be attributed to the lack of a systematic approach to tracking and measuring patient progress. In psychiatry, Measurement-Based Care (MBC) offers an objective, systematic approach to monitor clinical progress, evaluate treatment efficacy, and inform clinical decisions, yet remains seldom used in daily practice.
AIMS: To identify the clinical impact of using MBC in psychiatry.
METHODS: Using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model as a guideline, this integrative review focused on the research query, “What is the clinical impact of Measurement-Based Care when treating patients with mental illness?”
RESULTS: A total of nine articles met the inclusion criteria for this integrative review. The articles ranged from 2008 to 2021. The following themes were identified from the analysis of these articles: (1) the clinical impact of MBC, (2) provider attitudes about MBC, and (3) barriers to MBC implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: MBC, augmenting usual standard care, provides an objective, systematic approach using quantifiable data to monitor symptom severity and treatment effectiveness. This review highlights the clinical benefits of MBC, including increased remission rates, lower risk of relapse, improved medication adherence, and strengthening the therapeutic alliance. Although this review provides an overview of the benefits of MBC in psychiatry, there remains a substantial practice gap warranting further investigation. Strategies must be developed to address barriers at the individual and organizational levels which impede the successful adoption of MBC.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to review existing healthcare service quality-measurement models. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature was conducted utilizing keywords “healthcare’’, “service quality’’, “measurement models”, “SERVQUAL”, “SERVPERF”, “HEALTHQUAL”, “PubHosQual” and “HospitalQual”. These investigations were selected from the “Emerald’’, “ABI/Inform”, “ScienceDirect” and “EBSCOhost” databases. A range of studies used in the makeup of the healthcare quality-measurement model for a 36 years period (1979 to 2015) were examined in an exhaustive survey of the literature. Of 137 studies reviewed, 74 studies were selected for analysis. Findings As yet, no consensus has been reached among scholars on the definition and indicators and factors of the quality of the healthcare services. Moreover, most of the current models are of Western origin and incongruent with the cultural and economic contexts of developing countries. The previous studies create scales resembling the generic measures of service quality, which may not be completely appropriate for assessing the perceived quality of healthcare services. Furthermore, previous studies were too narrow, overemphasizing the quality of healthcare only as far as the functional aspect of the services were concerned and paying too little attention to the technical aspects, using the experience of healthcare providers. These results have much room for failures. This is therefore advising healthcare organizations that need to develop their own models for measuring the quality of their services. Originality/value Generic models no longer suffice in measuring the quality of healthcare services. Developing countries should try and develop their own models for measuring the quality of healthcare services.},

To address this, we present the Clinician Homework Review (CHR), a unique measure and interface that displays similarity ratings calculated using sensor-captured patient-generated data (sPGD; i.e. heart rate, phone usage, ambient noise, and physical activity) for therapeutic exercises outside of the clinical setting within the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment context. Through concept testing sessions with 10 clinicians, we examine how sPGD can be leveraged to measure and investigate what contributes to patient performance in a therapeutic exercise. We also share in-depth information regarding clinician interpretation and planned use of data displayed by CHR in clinical sessions with patients. We frame our results in the context of situated objectivity and propose the notion of "perceived reference weight," which describes the significance attributed to contextualized data. In doing so, we support clinical decision-making in PTSD therapy.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Measurement-based care involves the systematic administration of symptom rating scales and use of the results to drive clinical decision making at the level of the individual patient. This literature review examined the theoretical and empirical support for measurement-based care.

Methods:

Articles were identified through search strategies in PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional citations in the references of retrieved articles were identified, and experts assembled for a focus group conducted by the Kennedy Forum were consulted.

Results:

Fifty-one relevant articles were reviewed. There are numerous brief structured symptom rating scales that have strong psychometric properties. Virtually all randomized controlled trials with frequent and timely feedback of patient-reported symptoms to the provider during the medication management and psychotherapy encounters significantly improved outcomes. Ineffective approaches included one-time screening, assessing symptoms infrequently, and feeding back outcomes to providers outside the context of the clinical encounter. In addition to the empirical evidence about efficacy, there is mounting evidence from large-scale pragmatic trials and clinical demonstration projects that measurement-based care is feasible to implement on a large scale and is highly acceptable to patients and providers.

Conclusions:

In addition to the primary gains of measurement-based care for individual patients, there are also potential secondary and tertiary gains to be made when individual patient data are aggregated. Specifically, aggregated symptom rating scale data can be used for professional development at the provider level and for quality improvement at the clinic level and to inform payers about the value of mental health services delivered at the health care system level.},

Resumen Sviluppo e validazione di una versione abbreviata modificata del Questionario di funzionamento dell' alleanza (WAI–Working Alliance Inventory). Il Questionario di funzionamento dell' Alleanza (WAI; Horvath \& Greenberg, 1989) e il Questionario di funzionamento dell' Alleanza \_/abbreviatot (WAI\_S; Tracey \& Kokotovic, 1989) sono misure usate ampiamente sull'alleanza nella terapia.

Un' alternativa della WAI a 12 items (Wai-Sr), in accordo con il modello del'alleanza di Bordin (1979), è stato sviluppato in uno dei due campioni e incrociato e validato nell'altro. La Wai-Sr meglio differenziava l'obiettivo, il compito ed il vincolo e ben correlava con le altre misure dell'alleanza.La dimensione del compito risultava particolarmente saliente, come previsto nella teoria originale di Bordin. Sono presentate le proprietà, l'analisi psicometriche supplementari e di teoria della Wai-Sr. Resumo Desenvolvimento e validação da versão curta revista do Inventário da Aliança Terapêutica O Inventário da Aliança Terapêutica (WAI; Horvath \& Greenberg, 1989) e a sua versão reduzida (WAI-S; Tracey \& Kokotovic, 1989) são frequentemente utilizadas na avaliação da aliança em terapia.

	abstract = {Multiple barriers exist to accessing behavioral health care, and several are related to payment. The national shortage of behavioral health providers is exacerbated by their not joining health insurance networks, often shifting the cost of treatment to patients. In the face of high out-of-network expenses, deductibles, and copays, many insured patients forgo behavioral health treatment altogether. However, even when patients access care, health outcomes are not routinely measured, and there is reason to suspect that the quality of care is poor. To address these issues, value-based reimbursement for behavioral health care offers a sustainable pathway to increase payment for providers in return for improved population health outcomes and costs. This article describes a comprehensive collaborative effort between a payer and a health care technology and services organization to support behavioral health providers to enter into value-based care. This approach changes financial incentives to drive improvements in behavioral health care access and quality.},

Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of the Arkansas Medicaid administrative claims data. Continuously eligible adult schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM = 295.**) patients on antipsychotic monotherapy were identified in the recruitment period from July 2000 through April 2004. Adherence rates to antipsychotic therapy in year 1 were calculated using eight different measures identified from the literature. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to prospectively predict all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations in the follow-up year. Results: Adherence rates were computed for 3395 schizophrenic patients with a mean age of 42.9 years, of which 52.5\% (n = 1782) were females, and 52.8\% (n = 1793) were white. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and continuous measure of medication gaps measures of adherence had equal C-statistics of 0.571 in predicting both all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The medication possession ratio (MPR) continuous multiple interval measure of oversupply were the second best measures with equal C-statistics of 0.568 and 0.567 for any-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The multivariate adjusted models had higher C-statistics but provided the same rank order results. Conclusions: MPR and PDC were among the best predictors of any-cause and mental health-related hospitalization, and are recommended as the preferred adherence measures when a single measure is sought for use with administrative claims data for patients not on polypharmacy.},

	abstract = {Mental disorders are common worldwide, yet the quality of care for these disorders has not increased to the same extent as that for physical conditions. In this paper, we present a framework for promoting quality measurement as a tool for improving quality of mental health care. We identify key barriers to this effort, including lack of standardized information technology-based data sources, limited scientific evidence for mental health quality measures, lack of provider training and support, and cultural barriers to integrating mental health care within general health environments. We describe several innovations that are underway worldwide which can mitigate these barriers. Based on these experiences, we offer several recommendations for improving quality of mental health care. Health care payers and providers will need a portfolio of validated measures of patient-centered outcomes across a spectrum of conditions. Common data elements will have to be developed and embedded within existing electronic health records and other information technology tools. Mental health outcomes will need to be assessed more routinely, and measurement-based care should become part of the overall culture of the mental health care system. Health care systems will need a valid way to stratify quality measures, in order to address potential gaps among subpopulations and identify groups in most need of quality improvement. Much more attention should be devoted to workforce training in and capacity for quality improvement. The field of mental health quality improvement is a team sport, requiring coordination across different providers, involvement of consumer advocates, and leveraging of resources and incentives from health care payers and systems.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are proliferating, and financial incentives encourage their use. Applying Fair Information Practice principles to EHRs necessitates balancing patients' rights to control their personal information with providers' data needs to deliver safe, high-quality care. We describe the technical and organizational challenges faced in capturing patients' preferences for patient-controlled EHR access and applying those preferences to an existing EHR.
METHODS: We established an online system for capturing patients' preferences for who could view their EHRs (listing all participating clinic providers individually and categorically-physicians, nurses, other staff) and what data to redact (none, all, or by specific categories of sensitive data or patient age). We then modified existing data-viewing software serving a state-wide health information exchange and a large urban health system and its primary care clinics to allow patients' preferences to guide data displays to providers.
RESULTS: Patients could allow or restrict data displays to all clinicians and staff in a demonstration primary care clinic, categories of providers (physicians, nurses, others), or individual providers. They could also restrict access to all EHR data or any or all of five categories of sensitive data (mental and reproductive health, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse) and for specific patient ages. The EHR viewer displayed data via reports, data flowsheets, and coded and free text data displayed by Google-like searches. Unless patients recorded restrictions, by default all requested data were displayed to all providers. Data patients wanted restricted were not displayed, with no indication they were redacted. Technical barriers prevented redacting restricted information in free textnotes. The program allowed providers to hit a "Break the Glass" button to override patients' restrictions, recording the date, time, and next screen viewed. Establishing patient-control over EHR data displays was complex and required ethical, clinical, database, and programming expertise and difficult choices to overcome technical and health system constraints.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing patients' preferences for access to their EHRs and applying them in clinical practice requires wide-ranging technical, clinical, and bioethical expertise, to make tough choices to overcome significant technical and organization challenges.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. Despite MBC's demonstrated ability to enhance usual care by expediting improvements and rapidly detecting patients whose health would otherwise deteriorate, it is underused, with typically less than 20\% of behavioral health practitioners integrating it into their practice. This narrative review addresses definitional issues, offers a concrete and evaluable operationalization of MBC fidelity, and summarizes the evidence base and utility of MBC. It also synthesizes the extant literature's characterization of barriers to and strategies for supporting MBC implementation, sustainment, and scale-up.
OBSERVATIONS: Barriers to implementing MBC occur at multiple levels: patient (eg, concerns about confidentiality breach), practitioner (eg, beliefs that measures are no better than clinical judgment), organization (eg, no resources for training), and system (eg, competing requirements). Implementation science-the study of methods to integrate evidence-based practices such as MBC into routine care-offers strategies to address barriers. These strategies include using measurement feedback systems, leveraging local champions, forming learning collaboratives, training leadership, improving expert consultation with clinical staff, and generating incentives.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This narrative review, informed by implementation science, offers a 10-point research agenda to improve the integration of MBC into clinical practice: (1) harmonize terminology and specify MBC's core components; (2) develop criterion standard methods for monitoring fidelity and reporting quality of implementation; (3) develop algorithms for MBC to guide psychotherapy; (4) test putative mechanisms of change, particularly for psychotherapy; (5) develop brief and psychometrically strong measures for use in combination; (6) assess the critical timing of administration needed to optimize patient outcomes; (7) streamline measurement feedback systems to include only key ingredients and enhance electronic health record interoperability; (8) identify discrete strategies to support implementation; (9) make evidence-based policy decisions; and (10) align reimbursement structures.},

However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people’s lives to enrich the value of systems.},

	abstract = {Psychotherapists are taught that when a client expresses resistance repeatedly, they must understand and address its underlying sources. Yet proponents of evidence-based practice (EBP) have routinely ignored the root causes of many clinical psychologists' reservations concerning the use of scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. As a consequence, much of the resistance to EBP persists, potentially widening the already large scientist–practitioner gap. Following a review of survey data on psychologists' attitudes toward EBP, we examine six sources underpinning resistance toward EBP in clinical psychology and allied domains: (a) naïve realism, which can lead clinicians to conclude erroneously that client change is due to an intervention itself rather than to a host of competing explanations; (b) deep-seated misconceptions regarding human nature (e.g., mistaken beliefs regarding the causal primacy of early experiences) that can hinder the adoption of evidence-based treatments; (c) statistical misunderstandings regarding the application of group probabilities to individuals; (d) erroneous apportioning of the burden of proof on skeptics rather than proponents of untested therapies; (e) widespread mischaracterizations of what EBP entails; and (f) pragmatic, educational, and attitudinal obstacles, such as the discomfort of many practitioners with evaluating the increasingly technical psychotherapy outcome literature. We advance educational proposals for articulating the importance of EBP to the forthcoming generation of clinical practitioners and researchers, and constructive remedies for addressing clinical psychologists' objections to EBP.},

	abstract = {Background: The assessment of behaviors related to mental health typically relies on self-report data. Networked sensors embedded in smartphones can measure some behaviors objectively and continuously, with no ongoing effort.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether changes in phone sensor–derived behavioral features were associated with subsequent changes in mental health symptoms.
Methods: This longitudinal cohort study examined continuously collected phone sensor data and symptom severity data, collected every 3 weeks, over 16 weeks. The participants were recruited through national research registries. Primary outcomes included depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), and social anxiety (Social Phobia Inventory) severity. Participants were adults who owned Android smartphones. Participants clustered into 4 groups: multiple comorbidities, depression and generalized anxiety, depression and social anxiety, and minimal symptoms.
Results: A total of 282 participants were aged 19-69 years (mean 38.9, SD 11.9 years), and the majority were female (223/282, 79.1\%) and White participants (226/282, 80.1\%). Among the multiple comorbidities group, depression changes were preceded by changes in GPS features (Time: r=−0.23, P=.02; Locations: r=−0.36, P\&lt;.001), exercise duration (r=0.39; P=.03) and use of active apps (r=−0.31; P\&lt;.001). Among the depression and anxiety groups, changes in depression were preceded by changes in GPS features for Locations (r=−0.20; P=.03) and Transitions (r=−0.21; P=.03). Depression changes were not related to subsequent sensor-derived features. The minimal symptoms group showed no significant relationships. There were no associations between sensor-based features and anxiety and minimal associations between sensor-based features and social anxiety.
Conclusions: Changes in sensor-derived behavioral features are associated with subsequent depression changes, but not vice versa, suggesting a directional relationship in which changes in sensed behaviors are associated with subsequent changes in symptoms.

	abstract = {Background: Given the interrelated health of children and parents, strategies to promote stress regulation are critically important in the family context. However, the uptake of preventive mental health is limited among parents owing to competing family demands.
Objective: In this study, we aim to determine whether it is feasible and acceptable to randomize digital prompts designed to engage parents in real-time brief mindfulness activities guided by a commercially available app.
Methods: We conducted a 30-day pilot microrandomized trial among a sample of parents who used Android smartphones. Each day during a parent-specified time frame, participants had a 50\% probability of receiving a prompt with a message encouraging them to engage in a mindfulness activity using a commercial app, Headspace. In the 24 hours following randomization, ecological momentary assessments and passively collected smartphone data were used to assess proximal engagement (yes or no) with the app and any mindfulness activity (with or without the app). These data were combined with baseline and exit surveys to determine feasibility and acceptability.
Results: Over 4 months, 83 interested parents were screened, 48 were eligible, 16 were enrolled, and 10 were successfully onboarded. Reasons for nonparticipation included technology barriers, privacy concerns, time constraints, or change of mind. In total, 80\% (8/10) of parents who onboarded successfully completed all aspects of the intervention. While it is feasible to randomize prompt delivery, only 60\% (6/10) of parents reported that the timing of prompts was helpful despite having control over the delivery window. Across the study period, we observed higher self-reported engagement with Headspace on days with prompts (31/62, 50\% of days), as opposed to days without prompts (33/103, 32\% of days). This pattern was consistent for most participants in this study (7/8, 87\%). The time spent using the app on days with prompts (mean 566, SD 378 seconds) was descriptively higher than on days without prompts (mean 225, SD 276 seconds). App usage was highest during the first week and declined over each of the remaining 3 weeks. However, self-reported engagement in mindfulness activities without the app increased over time. Self-reported engagement with any mindfulness activity was similar on days with (40/62, 65\% of days) and without (65/103, 63\% of days) prompts. Participants found the Headspace app helpful (10/10, 100\%) and would recommend the program to others (9/10, 90\%).
Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that parents are receptive to using mindfulness apps to support stress management, and prompts are likely to increase engagement with the app. However, we identified several implementation challenges in the current trial, specifically a need to optimize prompt timing and frequency as a strategy to engage users in preventive digital mental health.},

Depression quality measures aligned with evidence-based practices require that health care organizations use standardized tools for tracking and monitoring patient-reported symptoms and functioning over time. This study describes challenges and opportunities for reporting 5 HEDIS measures which use electronic clinical data to assess adolescent and perinatal depression care quality.
Methods
Two learning collaboratives were convened with 10 health plans from 5 states to support reporting of the depression measures. We conducted content analysis of notes from collaborative meetings and individual calls with health plans to identify key challenges and strategies for reporting.
Results
Health plans used various strategies to collect the clinical data needed to report the measures, including setting up direct data exchange with providers and data aggregators and leveraging data captured in health information exchanges and case management records. Health plans noted several challenges to reporting and performance improvement: 1) lack of access to clinical data sources where the results of patient-reported tools were documented; 2) unavailability of the results of patient-reported tools in usable data fields; 3) lack of routine depression screening and ongoing assessment occurring in provider practices.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate ongoing challenges in collecting and using patient-reported clinical data for health plan quality measurement. Systems to track and improve outcomes for individuals with depression will require significant investments and policy support at the point of care and across the healthcare system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital health-tracking tools are changing mental health care by giving patients the ability to collect passively measured patient-generated health data (PGHD; ie, data collected from connected devices with little to no patient effort). Although there are existing clinical guidelines for how mental health clinicians should use more traditional, active forms of PGHD for clinical decision-making, there is less clarity on how passive PGHD can be used.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to understand mental health clinicians' perceptions and concerns regarding the use of technology-enabled, passively collected PGHD for clinical decision-making. Our interviews sought to understand participants' current experiences with and visions for using passive PGHD.
METHODS: Mental health clinicians providing outpatient services were recruited to participate in semistructured interviews. Interview recordings were deidentified, transcribed, and qualitatively coded to identify overarching themes.
RESULTS: Overall, 12 mental health clinicians (n=11, 92\% psychiatrists and n=1, 8\% clinical psychologist) were interviewed. We identified 4 overarching themes. First, passive PGHD are patient driven-we found that current passive PGHD use was patient driven, not clinician driven; participating clinicians only considered passive PGHD for clinical decision-making when patients brought passive data to clinical encounters. The second theme was active versus passive data as subjective versus objective data-participants viewed the contrast between active and passive PGHD as a contrast between interpretive data on patients' mental health and objective information on behavior. Participants believed that prioritizing passive over self-reported, active PGHD would reduce opportunities for patients to reflect upon their mental health, reducing treatment engagement and raising questions about how passive data can best complement active data for clinical decision-making. Third, passive PGHD must be delivered at appropriate times for action-participants were concerned with the real-time nature of passive PGHD; they believed that it would be infeasible to use passive PGHD for real-time patient monitoring outside clinical encounters and more feasible to use passive PGHD during clinical encounters when clinicians can make treatment decisions. The fourth theme was protecting patient privacy-participating clinicians wanted to protect patient privacy within passive PGHD-sharing programs and discussed opportunities to refine data sharing consent to improve transparency surrounding passive PGHD collection and use.
CONCLUSIONS: Although passive PGHD has the potential to enable more contextualized measurement, this study highlights the need for building and disseminating an evidence base describing how and when passive measures should be used for clinical decision-making. This evidence base should clarify how to use passive data alongside more traditional forms of active PGHD, when clinicians should view passive PGHD to make treatment decisions, and how to protect patient privacy within passive data-sharing programs. Clear evidence would more effectively support the uptake and effective use of these novel tools for both patients and their clinicians.},

We conclude that the major challenges presented by DesignX problems stem not from trying to understand or address the issues, but rather arise during implementation, when political, economic, cultural, organizational, and structural problems overwhelm all else. We suggest that designers cannot stop at the design stage: they must play an active role in implementation, and develop solutions through small, incremental steps—minimizing budgets and the resources required for each step— to reduce political, social, and cultural disruptions. This approach requires tolerance for existing constraints and trade-offs, and a modularity that allows for measures that do not compromise the whole. These designs satisfice rather than optimize and are related to the technique of making progress by “muddling through,” a form of incrementalism championed by Lindblom.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Measurement-based care using patient-reported outcome measures has been shown to improve treatment outcomes for patients with mental illness. Despite wide availability of validated measures, measurement-based care is seldom used in clinical practice.

Methods:

The authors conducted a survey of 230 mental health providers across 47 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The survey measured provider attitudes and self-reported use of various components of measurement-based care.

Results:

More than half of the providers (58\%) reported collecting at least one measure for at least half of their patients. Psychiatrists reported using and sharing results less frequently than social workers, nurses, or psychologists. Psychologists reported the most use and sharing of patient-reported measures.

Conclusions:

In this convenience sample of providers, use of measurement-based care was reported to be common and attitudes about the utility of such care were positive. However, professional differences in the use of measurement-based care must be addressed to expand its use.},

To date, few of those recommendations have been implemented, and there is little evidence that behavioral health care quality has improved significantly over the past ten years. However, the advent of health care reform, parity of insurance coverage, and growing recognition of the impact of behavioral health disorders on population health and health care costs have created new demands and opportunities for expanded and innovative strategies to assess the quality of care for this patient population. We provide an overview of the current state of quality measurement in behavioral health, identify key priorities for measure development, and describe the most important challenges. We recommend a coordinated plan that would boost investment in developing, evaluating, and implementing behavioral health quality measures; conduct research to develop the evidence necessary to support a more robust set of measures; overcome barriers to the improvement and linking of data sources; and expand efforts to build the capacity of the clinical workforce, in partnership with consumers, to improve quality.},

Researchers and policy-makers are increasingly seeking to develop more systematic ways of measuring and benchmarking quality of care of different providers. Quality of care is now systematically reported as part of overall health system performance reports in many countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands, and most Nordic countries. At the same time, international efforts in comparing and benchmarking quality of care across countries are mounting. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the EU Commission have both expanded their efforts at assessing and comparing healthcare quality internationally (Carinci et al., 2015; EC, 2016). Furthermore, a growing focus on value-based healthcare (Porter, 2010) has sparked renewed interest in the standardization of measurement of outcomes (ICHOM, 2019), and notably the measurement of patient-reported outcomes has gained momentum (OECD, 2019).},

	abstract = {Background
Smartphones offer the hope that depression can be detected using passively collected data from the phone sensors. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous work using geographic location (GPS) sensors to identify depressive symptom severity.

Methods
We used a dataset collected from 48 college students over a 10-week period, which included GPS phone sensor data and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptom severity at baseline and end-of-study. GPS features were calculated over the entire study, for weekdays and weekends, and in 2-week blocks.

Results
The results of this study replicated our previous findings that a number of GPS features, including location variance, entropy, and circadian movement, were significantly correlated with PHQ-9 scores (r’s ranging from −0.43 to −0.46, p-values {\textless}  .05). We also found that these relationships were stronger when GPS features were calculated from weekend, compared to weekday, data. Although the correlation between baseline PHQ-9 scores with 2-week GPS features diminished as we moved further from baseline, correlations with the end-of-study scores remained significant regardless of the time point used to calculate the features.

Discussion
Our findings were consistent with past research demonstrating that GPS features may be an important and reliable predictor of depressive symptom severity. The varying strength of these relationships on weekends and weekdays suggests the role of weekend/weekday as a moderating variable. The finding that GPS features predict depressive symptom severity up to 10 weeks prior to assessment suggests that GPS features may have the potential as early warning signals of depression.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep is a critical aspect of people’s well-being and as such assessing sleep is an important indicator of a person’s health. Traditional methods of sleep assessment are either time- and resource-intensive or suffer from self-reporting biases. Recently, researchers have started to use mobile phones to passively assess sleep in individuals’ daily lives. However, this work remains in its early stages, having only examined relatively small and homogeneous populations in carefully controlled contexts. Thus, it remains an open question as to how well mobile device-based sleep monitoring generalizes to larger populations in typical use cases. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of machine learning algorithms to detect the sleep start and end times for the main sleep period in a 24-h cycle using mobile devices in a diverse sample. Methods: We collected mobile phone sensor data as well as daily self-reported sleep start and end times from 208 individuals (171 females; 37 males), diverse in age (18−66 years; mean 39.3), education, and employment status, across the United States over 6 weeks. Sensor data consisted of geographic location, motion, light, sound, and in-phone activities. No specific instructions were given to the participants regarding phone placement. We used random forest classifiers to develop both personalized and global predictors of sleep state from the phone sensor data. Results: Using all available sensor features, the average accuracy of classifying whether a 10-min segment was reported as sleep was 88.8\%. This is somewhat better than using the time of day alone, which gives an average accuracy of 86.9\%. The accuracy of the model considerably varied across the participants, ranging from 65.1\% to 97.3\%. We found that low accuracy in some participants was due to two main factors: missing sensor data and misreports. After correcting for these, the average accuracy increased to 91.8\%, corresponding to an average median absolute deviation (MAD) of 38 min for sleep start time detection and 36 min for sleep end time. These numbers are close to the range reported by previous research in more controlled situations. Conclusions: We find that mobile phones provide adequate sleep monitoring in typical use cases, and that our methods generalize well to a broader population than has previously been studied. However, we also observe several types of data artifacts when collecting data in uncontrolled settings. Some of these can be resolved through corrections, but others likely impose a ceiling on the accuracy of sleep prediction for certain subjects. Future research will need to focus more on the understanding of people’s behavior in their natural settings in order to develop sleep monitoring tools that work reliably in all cases for all people.

Thus, this study examines health services research through an overview of broad problem areas. Translation of medical innovation requires methodological expertise, skill, time, and resources. Although difficult, effectively translating advances in scientific knowledge to practice and policy to improve the health of patients and the public requires research of the type discussed in this chapter. The goal of medical care is to improve patient and population health.

	abstract = {Background
Measurement-based care (MBC) is the practice of routinely administering standardized measures to support clinical decision-making and monitor treatment progress. Despite evidence of its effectiveness, MBC is rarely adopted in routine substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings and little is known about the factors that may improve its adoptability in these settings. The current study gathered qualitative data from SUD treatment clinicians about their perceptions of MBC, the clinical outcomes they would most like to monitor in MBC, and suggestions for the design and implementation of MBC systems in their settings.

Methods
Fifteen clinicians from one publicly-funded and two privately-funded outpatient SUD treatment clinics participated in one-on-one research interviews. Interviews focused on clinicians’ perceived benefits, drawbacks, and ideas related to implementing MBC technology into their clinical workflows. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded to allow for thematic analysis using a mixed deductive and inductive approach. Clinicians also completed a card sorting task to rate the perceived helpfulness of routinely measuring and monitoring different treatment outcomes.

Results
Clinicians reported several potential benefits of MBC, including improved patient-provider communication, client empowerment, and improved communication between clinicians. Clinicians also expressed potential drawbacks, including concerns about subjectivity in patient self-reports, limits to personalization, increased time burdens, and needing to learn to use new technologies. Clinicians generated several ideas and preferences aimed at minimizing burden of MBC, illustrating clinical changes over time, improving ease of use, and improving personalization. Numerous patient outcomes were identified as “very helpful” to track, including coping skills, social support, and motivation for change.

Conclusions
MBC may be a beneficial tool for improving clinical care in SUD treatment settings. MBC tools may be particularly adoptable if they are compatible with existing workflows, help illustrate gradual and nonlinear progress in SUD treatment, measure outcomes perceived as clinically useful, accommodate multiple use cases and stakeholder groups, and are framed as an additional source of information meant to augment, rather than replace, existing practices and information sources.

CrossCheck is the ﬁrst step towards the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention. In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically signiﬁcant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smartphone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6\% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-speciﬁc data to quickly adapt to new users.},

	abstract = {Article AbstractObjective: A survey of psychiatrists in the United Kingdom found that only a minority routinely used standardized measures to assess outcome when treating depression and anxiety disorders. The goals of the present study were to determine how frequently psychiatrists in the United States use scales to measure outcome when treating depressed patients and, for those clinicians who do not regularly use such scales, to ascertain the reasons for the lack of use. Method: The subjects were 314 psychiatrists who attended a continuing medical education conference in California, Massachusetts, New York, or Wisconsin in 2006 or 2007. Prior to a lecture, the subjects completed a questionnaire that included 2 questions regarding the use of rating scales to monitor outcome when treating depression. Results: More than 80\% of the psychiatrists indicated that they did not routinely use scales to monitor outcome when treating depression. The most frequent reasons psychiatrists gave for not using scales were that they did not believe scales would be clinically helpful, that scales take too much time to use, and that they were not trained in the use of such measures. Conclusions: The majority of psychiatrists indicated that they do not routinely use standardized measures to evaluate outcome when treating depressed patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services†Physician Quality Reporting Initiative is intended to improve quality of care by providing physicians financial incentives to document outcomes reflecting best practices. If standardized outcome assessment is to assume increasing importance in this country, either educational efforts or payor mandates, or both, will be necessary to change clinicians†behavior.},
