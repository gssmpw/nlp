\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rw}

Our work lies at the intersection of three lines of inquiry: research on technologies supporting health services (Section \ref{sec:rw:tech-services}), mental health data collection and storage (Section \ref{sec:rw:data}), and value-based mental healthcare (Section \ref{sec:rw:vbc}).

\subsection{Designing Technologies for Health Services}
\label{sec:rw:tech-services}

In this work, we studied technologies that support value-based care and the delivery of \textit{health services}, which encompass the people, organizations, and technology involved in healthcare delivery **Donabedian, "An Introduction to Hospital Care"**.
These people and organizations include \textit{healthcare providers}, the clinicians or hospital systems that provide treatments or preventive care (the ``services''); as well as \textit{healthcare payers}, the government agencies or private health insurance companies that pay for health services.
We review specific technologies supporting mental health services in Section \ref{sec:rw:data}.
To design technologies for health services, we need to confront more than the hardware or software capabilities of a specific technology, or the effectiveness of interventions that use technologies to improve health outcomes.
We also need to confront sociotechnical factors that affect the implementation and effectiveness of these technologies in real-world care. 
Norman and Stappers categorize sociotechnical factors that affect technology implementation as political, economic, cultural, organizational, and structural **Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things"**.
Blandford states that, for health services specifically, HCI scholars should \textit{``consider stages (of identifying technical possibilities or early adopters and planning for adoption and diffusion) that are rarely discussed in HCI, but that are necessary to deliver real impact from HCI innovations in healthcare''} **Blandford, "HCI Research Methods"**.
Thus, we were motivated to improve the design of technologies supporting health services by understanding factors that affect their implementation and adoption in care.

Recently, HCI scholars have considered adopting ideas from health services research to improve both the design and effectiveness of health technologies.
Scholars have considered how HCI research can integrate aspects of \textit{implementation science} -- the health services field examining the real-world adoption of evidence-based interventions **Rogers, "Diffusion of Innovations"**. 
Interviews with HCI and implementation science researchers uncovered that HCI tends to de-prioritize factors that influence long-term adoption of technologies in their initial design, including the financial incentives that affect adoption, and an understanding of how technologies support providers after implementation **Greenhalgh, "Barriers and Facilitators to Implementing Evidence-Based Practice"**.
Moreover, HCI scholars have stated that if technologies are to impact real-world care, HCI researchers should focus on how technology is consumed in care, including developing an understanding of the technical and market incentives to use new tools **Heeks, "Health Information Systems: Design Issues and Annotated Bibliography"**.
Inspired by this work, we considered these aspects of adoption in the initial design of technologies that support value-based mental healthcare.
Specifically, we considered how technologies can support healthcare providers -- practicing clinicians -- including how these technologies can be integrated into clinicians' workflows to support care, and the financial incentives that influence HIT adoption as a part of value-based care.

\subsection{Health Information Technologies for Collecting and Storing Mental Health Data}
\label{sec:rw:data}

HCI, health informatics, and mental health researchers have collaborated to build health information technologies (HITs) for collecting and storing mental health data.
In this work, we focus on three categories of mental health data: clinical data, active data, and passive data.
\textit{Clinical data} can be retrieved from \textit{electronic health records} (EHRs), which record information collected during clinical visits including patient demographics, diagnoses, health and family history, treatments provided, and unstructured clinical notes **Hersh, "Health Informatics"**.
\rev{That said, to protect patient privacy, not all mental health data may be contained within the EHR, and exporting EHR data for VBC may require patient consent ____.}
Clinical data can also be retrieved from \textit{administrative claims databases}, which log diagnostic, treatment, and medication information used to bill healthcare payers **Gurwitz, "Quality of Medication Use"**.
Clinics or hospitals may also collect measures of patient satisfaction to understand patients' perceptions of their care **Marshall, "Patient Satisfaction with Healthcare"**.

\textit{Active data} require active patient or clinician engagement to be collected, and can be collected with technologies that support digital surveys (eg, smartphones, iPads, computers, \rev{patient portals}) and pen-and-paper questionnaires.
This data include validated self-reported \textit{measures of mental health symptoms}, which quantify symptom presence and/or severity for depression **Beck, "Depression"** or anxiety **Cox, "Anxiety Disorders"**.
\textit{Engagement} outcomes may be a promising alternative to symptom scales, as engagement is the proximal outcome of many mental health treatments **Harris, "Using Technology to Promote Engagement in Mental Health Treatment"**, improved functioning is often more important to patients than symptom reduction, and functional outcomes measure treatment progress across patients living with different mental health symptoms or disorders **Ciechankowski, "Functional Outcomes in Mental Health Treatment"**.

In terms of \textit{data collection}, it is estimated that less than 20\% of mental health clinicians practice measurement-based care (MBC) -- the process of collecting, planning, and adjusting treatment based on outcomes data -- specifically symptom scales **Kazdin, "Mediation-Based Treatments"**.
MBC is usually implemented by having patients routinely self-report symptoms during clinical encounters using validated symptom scales, like the PHQ-9 for depression or the GAD-7 for anxiety **Spitzer, "The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)"**.
Electronic health records (EHRs) often do not have standardized fields to support symptom data collection, clinicians perceive that symptom scale administration disrupts the therapeutic relationship, and clinicians are often not paid to administer symptom scales **Burlingame, "Barriers to Implementing Measurement-Based Care"**.

\textit{Action} challenges stem from both perceptions of how outcomes data could be used in care, and challenges towards attributing accountability for care.
For example, clinicians are often not trained to use outcomes data in care, and worry that they will be held accountable and penalized if outcomes data reveal that their patients are not improving **Pawson, "The Concept of Change"**.
There are also concerns that outcomes data could be gamed: biased reporting that artificially inflates performance metrics **Doran, "Performance Metrics in Mental Health Treatment"**.
In addition, it is difficult in mental healthcare to attribute accountability to specific actors (eg, specific providers) in care systems.
Mental healthcare is often ``siloed'' from physical healthcare, though both physical and mental health outcomes are strongly intertwined (eg, individuals living with schizophrenia suffer from chronic physical health conditions) **Garcia-Portilla, "The Relationship Between Physical Health and Mental Health"**.
Thus, existing value-based mental healthcare programs may hold both physical and mental health clinicians \textit{jointly accountable} by sharing cost savings across different types of providers **Hedrick, "Joint Accountability in Value-Based Healthcare"**.

Taken together, this prior work demonstrates challenges designing HITs that support value-based mental healthcare.
Integral to the design of these HITs are mental health clinicians, who are asked to participate in outcomes data collection, which clinicians have found challenging, and will be held financially accountable to the outcomes data HITs store.
Given these challenges, this work centers mental health clinicians' perspectives on how to design HITs that support value-based mental healthcare.
By centering clinicians' perspectives, we looked to gain a deeper understanding of their workflows and incentives to adopt HITs, and integrate this knowledge into the design and development of HITs supporting value-based care. 
The following section details the methodology used in this study.
