Effective fertility treatment requires continuous monitoring of a wide range of health indicators through self-tracking. The process of collecting and interpreting data and information about fertility is complex, and much of the burden falls on women. In this study, we analyzed patient-generated content in a popular online health community dedicated to fertility issues. The objective was to understand the process in which women engage in tracking relevant information, and the challenges they face. Leveraging the Personal Informatics Model, we describe women's self-tracking experiences during their fertility cycles. We discuss how a complex and highly personalized context leads to responsibility, pressure, and emotional burden on women performing self-tracking activities, as well as the role of collaboration in creating individualized solutions. Finally, we provide implications for technologies aiming to support women with fertility care needs.},

Anecdotal clinical reports indicate that mental health professionals are beginning to use information from their patients’ electronic activities in treatment and that their data-gathering practices have gone far beyond simply searching for patients online. Both academic and private sector researchers are developing mental health applications to collect patient information for clinical purposes. Professional societies and commentators have provided minimal guidance, however, about best practices for obtaining or using information from electronic communications or other online activities. This article reviews the clinical and ethical issues regarding use of patients’ electronic activities, primarily focusing on situations in which patients share information with clinicians voluntarily. We discuss the potential uses of mental health patients’ electronic footprints for therapeutic purposes, and consider both the potential benefits and the drawbacks and risks. Whether clinicians decide to use such information in treating any particular patient—and if so, the nature and scope of its use—requires case-by-case analysis. But it is reasonable to assume that clinicians, depending on their circumstances and goals, will encounter circumstances in which patients’ electronic activities will be relevant to, and useful in, treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: The review of collateral information is an essential component of patient care. Although this is standard practice, minimal research has been done to quantify collateral information collection and to understand how collateral information translates to clinical decision making. To address this, we developed and piloted a novel measure (the McLean Collateral Information and Clinical Actionability Scale [M-CICAS]) to evaluate the types and number of collateral sources viewed and the resulting actions made in a psychiatric setting.
Objective: This study aims to test the feasibility of the M-CICAS, validate this measure against clinician notes via medical records, and evaluate whether reviewing a higher volume of collateral sources is associated with more clinical actions taken.
Methods: For the M-CICAS, we developed a three-part instrument, focusing on measuring collateral sources reviewed, clinical actions taken, and shared decision making between the clinician and patient. To determine feasibility and preliminary validity, we piloted this measure among clinicians providing psychotherapy at McLean Hospital. These clinicians (n=7) completed the M-CICAS after individual clinical sessions with 89 distinct patient encounters. Scales were completed by clinicians only once for each patient during routine follow-up visits. After clinicians completed these scales, researchers conducted chart reviews by completing the M-CICAS using only the clinician’s corresponding note from that session. For the analyses, we generated summary scores for the number of collateral sources and clinical actions for each encounter. We examined Pearson correlation coefficients to assess interrater reliability between clinicians and chart reviewers, and simple univariate regression modeling followed by multilevel mixed effects regression modeling to test the relationship between collateral information accessed and clinical actions taken.
Results: The study staff had high interrater reliability on the M-CICAS for the sources reviewed (r=0.98; P\&lt;.001) and actions taken (r=0.97; P\&lt;.001). Clinician and study staff ratings were moderately correlated and statistically significant on the M-CICAS summary scores for the sources viewed (r=0.24, P=.02 and r=0.25, P=.02, respectively). Univariate regression modeling with a two-tailed test demonstrated a significant association between collateral sources and clinical actions taken when clinicians completed the M-CICAS (β=.27; t87=2.47; P=.02). The multilevel fixed slopes random intercepts model confirmed a significant association even when accounting for clinician differences (β=.23; t57=2.13; P=.04).
Conclusions: This pilot study established the feasibility and preliminary validity of the M-CICAS in assessing collateral sources and clinical decision making in psychiatry. This study also indicated that reviewing more collateral sources may lead to an increased number of clinical actions following a session.},

For decades, feminist activists and scholars have used affirmative consent to theorize and prevent sexual assault. In this paper, we ask: Can affirmative consent help to theorize online interaction? Drawing from feminist, legal, and HCI literature, we introduce the feminist theory of affirmative consent and use it to analyze social computing systems. We present affirmative consent’s five core concepts: it is voluntary, informed, revertible, specific, and unburdensome. Using these principles, this paper argues that affirmative consent is both an explanatory and generative theoretical framework. First, affirmative consent is a theoretical abstraction for explaining various problematic phenomena in social platforms—including mass online harassment, revenge porn, and problems with content feeds. Finally, we argue that affirmative consent is a generative theoretical foundation from which to imagine new design ideas for consentful socio-technical systems.},

However, the methods for involving participants have not kept pace with changes in research capability. In an era when information is shared digitally at the global level, mechanisms of informed consent remain static, paper-based and organised around national boundaries and legal frameworks. Dynamic consent (DC) is both a specific project and a wider concept that offers a new approach to consent; one designed to meet the needs of the twenty-first century research landscape. At the heart of DC is a personalised, digital communication interface that connects researchers and participants, placing participants at the heart of decision making. The interface facilitates two-way communication to stimulate a more engaged, informed and scientifically literate participant population where individuals can tailor and manage their own consent preferences. The technical architecture of DC includes components that can securely encrypt sensitive data and allow participant consent preferences to travel with their data and samples when they are shared with third parties. In addition to improving transparency and public trust, this system benefits researchers by streamlining recruitment and enabling more efficient participant recontact. DC has mainly been developed in biobanking contexts, but it also has potential application in other domains for a variety of purposes.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of the study was to establish knowledge about how online access to epidemiological data from general practitioners (GPs) electronic health record (EHR) system should be provided. Before such systems are developed and deployed a decision about the appropriate system architecture must be made. Such a decision should ideally be based on knowledge about the properties of different system architectures. This choice is important because the system architecture may affect the willingness of GPs to participate in providing epidemiological data from their EHR system.
Method
Verifying the performance and properties of an architectural approach by implementing and deploying a system on a trans-institutional level and performing evaluations studies is a very resource demanding method to establish a foundation for the decision of appropriate system architecture. Instead, we have tried to create this foundation by constructing a prototype system, establish knowledge about the properties of the system using experiments, and finally compare the properties of the federated approach to the properties of the centralised approach. By using this methodological approach we provide the best available knowledge, on this stage, for the appropriate system architecture to use for providing access to epidemiological data from the local population.
Results
Our experimental results show that it is possible to improve the timeliness and the temporal and spatial resolution of epidemiological data, compared to traditional centralised disease surveillance systems. Up-to-date epidemiological data from the local population may be provided directly from the source EHR system within 4s. The responsiveness of the system is minimally affected (0.1s) as the number of participating data providers grows from 1 to 49 data providers. The comparison of the federated approach to the centralised approach indicates that federated approaches avoid the privacy issues involved, as intended; it offers better scalability when computing speed is compared, and it provides better specificity because more data about the patient may be used.
Conclusion
The conclusion from our study is that the federated approach to providing epidemiological data about the local population has many benefits over the traditional centralised approach. A federated approach to an epidemiology system may raise the GPs awareness of local disease outbreak because it is possible to share information about incidence rates of communicable diseases and use of laboratory requests in a geographical area that predates laboratory-based disease surveillance. The effects of the federated approach could be improved data quality in the EHR systems and improved representativeness of the epidemiological data for the areas covered by such systems.},

We then examined migraine patient experiences in a deployment study for an average of 12+ months, including a total of 50 interview sessions with 10 patients working with 3 different clinicians. Patients were able to express multiple types of goals, evolve their goals over time, align tracking to their goals, personalize their tracking, reflect in the context of their goals, and gain insights that enabled understanding, communication, and action. We discuss how these results highlight the importance of accounting for distinct and concurrent goals in personal informatics together with implications for the design of future goal-directed personal informatics tools.},

One strategy to improve treatment access is to require insurance coverage of MH/SUDs to be equal to the coverage of medical and surgical (M/S) services. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) requires this equivalence for many insurance plans. The MHPAEA applies to quantitative treatment limitations (QTLs) (eg, deductibles and visit limits) and nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) (eg, utilization review processes and prior authorization). Despite years since the MHPAEA’s enactment, evaluating parity remains a challenge. In August 2023, the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services proposed changes to MHPAEA regulations concerning evaluation and enforcement of insurer compliance with NQTLs, although it is unclear how this will affect patient care. We highlight the government’s historical approach to coverage, review the proposed reforms, and present opportunities for the field.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine variation in the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) functionalities and their use patterns, barriers to adoption, and perceived benefits by physician practice size.Design Mailed survey of a nationally representative random sample of practicing physicians identified from the Physician Masterfile of the American Medical Association.Measurements We measured, stratified by practice size: (1) availability of EHR functionalities, (2) functionality use, (3) barriers to the adoption and use of EHR, and (4) impact of the EHR on the practice and quality of patient care.Results With a response rate of 62\%, we found that \&lt;2\% of physicians in solo or two-physician (small) practices reported a fully functional EHR and 5\% reported a basic EHR compared with 13\% of physicians from 11+ group (largest group) practices with a fully functional system and 26\% with a basic system. Between groups, a 21–46\% difference in specific functionalities available was reported. Among adopters there were moderate to large differences in the use of the EHR systems. Financial barriers were more likely to be reported by smaller practices, along with concerns about future obsolescence. These differences were sizable (13–16\%) and statistically significant (p\&lt;0.001). All adopters reported similar benefits.Limitations Although we have adjusted for response bias, influences may still exist.Conclusion Our study found that physicians in small practices have lower levels of EHR adoption and that these providers were less likely to use these systems. Ensuring that unique barriers are addressed will be critical to the widespread meaningful use of EHR systems among small practices.},

	abstract = {• The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was designed to remedy the problems of existing rating scales by providing a specific measure of the severity of symptoms of obsessivecompulsive disorder that is not influenced by the type of obsessions or compulsions present. The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms) (total range, 0 to 40), with separate subtotals for severity of obsessions and compulsions. In a study involving four raters and 40 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder at various stages of treatment, interrater reliability for the total Yale-Brown Scale score and each of the 10 individual items was excellent, with a high degree of internal consistency among all item scores demonstrated with Cronbach's α coefficient. Based on pretreatment assessment of 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, each item was frequently endorsed and measured across a range of severity. These findings suggest that the Yale-Brown Scale is a reliable instrument for measuring the severity of illness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with a range of severity and types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.},

We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, integration, and reflection as components of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of tracking. We use our model to surface underexplored challenges in lived informatics, thus identifying future directions for personal informatics design and research.},

In this work, we contribute a narrative review and findings from two studies with 41 mental health clinicians to understand these generalization challenges. Our findings motivate research on actionable sensing, as an alternative to detection research, studying how passive sensing can augment traditional mental health measures to support actions in clinical care. Specifically, we identify how passive sensing can support clinical actions by revealing patients' presenting problems for treatment and identifying targets for behavior change and symptom reduction, but passive data requires additional contextual information to be appropriately interpreted and used in care. We conclude by suggesting research at the intersection of actionable sensing and mental healthcare, to align technical research in ubiquitous computing with clinical actions and needs.},

However, uptake of these devices has been slow and abandonment swift, which indicates that smart devices may not currently meet the needs of users. To advance an understanding of the ways users benefit from, are challenged by, and abandon smart devices, we asked a group of users to purchase smart sensing devices to advance themselves towards a personal, self-defined goal. We found that participants abandoned devices because they did not fit with the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected by devices were perceived to not be useful, and device maintenance became unmanageable. Participants used devices because they had developed routines and because devices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for potential benefit to them. We propose ways to reduce barriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an additional function of these devices for short-term interventions, in addition to standard long-term use.},

We conducted iterative inductive and deductive analyses of approximately 1600 advertisements of personal health-tracking technologies posted over the course of one month across the US.

Though these systems offer great potential value to users, many systems are hampered by issues that limit their ability to foster engagement, and people often abandon use of these systems without garnering meaningful outcomes. While continued use of these systems is not necessary for all people, there is an opportunity to better support people working towards achievement-based goals.In this paper, we draw from the literature and our own prior work to identify a number of problems that hinder engagement with achievement-based personal informatics systems -- problems related to inadequate support for goal-setting, misalignment of user and system goals, and the burden of system maintenance. We then propose seven strategies for the design community to explore for mitigating these problems and discuss how these strategies could be used to foster engagement with PI systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are proliferating, and financial incentives encourage their use. Applying Fair Information Practice principles to EHRs necessitates balancing patients' rights to control their personal information with providers' data needs to deliver safe, high-quality care. We describe the technical and organizational challenges faced in capturing patients' preferences for patient-controlled EHR access and applying those preferences to an existing EHR.
METHODS: We established an online system for capturing patients' preferences for who could view their EHRs (listing all participating clinic providers individually and categorically-physicians, nurses, other staff) and what data to redact (none, all, or by specific categories of sensitive data or patient age). We then modified existing data-viewing software serving a state-wide health information exchange and a large urban health system and its primary care clinics to allow patients' preferences to guide data displays to providers.
RESULTS: Patients could allow or restrict data displays to all clinicians and staff in a demonstration primary care clinic, categories of providers (physicians, nurses, others), or individual providers. They could also restrict access to all EHR data or any or all of five categories of sensitive data (mental and reproductive health, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse) and for specific patient ages. The EHR viewer displayed data via reports, data flowsheets, and coded and free text data displayed by Google-like searches. Unless patients recorded restrictions, by default all requested data were displayed to all providers. Data patients wanted restricted were not displayed, with no indication they were redacted. Technical barriers prevented redacting restricted information in free textnotes. The program allowed providers to hit a "Break the Glass" button to override patients' restrictions, recording the date, time, and next screen viewed. Establishing patient-control over EHR data displays was complex and required ethical, clinical, database, and programming expertise and difficult choices to overcome technical and health system constraints.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing patients' preferences for access to their EHRs and applying them in clinical practice requires wide-ranging technical, clinical, and bioethical expertise, to make tough choices to overcome significant technical and organization challenges.},

Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether changes in phone sensor–derived behavioral features were associated with subsequent changes in mental health symptoms.
Methods: This longitudinal cohort study examined continuously collected phone sensor data and symptom severity data, collected every 3 weeks, over 16 weeks. The participants were recruited through national research registries. Primary outcomes included depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), and social anxiety (Social Phobia Inventory) severity. Participants were adults who owned Android smartphones. Participants clustered into 4 groups: multiple comorbidities, depression and generalized anxiety, depression and social anxiety, and minimal symptoms.
Results: A total of 282 participants were aged 19-69 years (mean 38.9, SD 11.9 years), and the majority were female (223/282, 79.1\%) and White participants (226/282, 80.1\%). Among the multiple comorbidities group, depression changes were preceded by changes in GPS features (Time: r=−0.23, P=.02; Locations: r=−0.36, P\&lt;.001), exercise duration (r=0.39; P=.03) and use of active apps (r=−0.31; P\&lt;.001). Among the depression and anxiety groups, changes in depression were preceded by changes in GPS features for Locations (r=−0.20; P=.03) and Transitions (r=−0.21; P=.03). Depression changes were not related to subsequent sensor-derived features. The minimal symptoms group showed no significant relationships. There were no associations between sensor-based features and anxiety and minimal associations between sensor-based features and social anxiety.
Conclusions: Changes in sensor-derived behavioral features are associated with subsequent depression changes, but not vice versa, suggesting a directional relationship in which changes in sensed behaviors are associated with subsequent changes in symptoms.

However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people’s lives to enrich the value of systems.},

We describe the process of service design, and give examples of service design framings in several projects.

	abstract = {Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur with opioid use disorder (OUD) yet are often overlooked in standard OUD treatments. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a mobile application designed to address these symptoms in individuals receiving medications for OUD (MOUD). A randomized controlled trial recruited N = 63 adults with OUD who received MOUD and screened positive for moderate depression or generalized anxiety. Participants were randomized to an app-based digital intervention or treatment-as-usual for 4 weeks, and completed follow-ups at 4 and 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were self-reported severity measures for depression and generalized anxiety, and urine drug screens (UDS). Secondary outcomes included self-reported OUD severity, craving intensity, and digital biomarkers derived from passive smartphone sensors. The application was well-received (median app rating = 4/5 stars). The intervention group showed significant reductions in depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms post-intervention and at 8 weeks follow-up (d {\textgreater} 0.70), with large (d = 0.78) and moderate (d = 0.38) effect sizes, respectively, compared to controls. Both groups exhibited substantial decreases in self-reported severity of opioid use symptoms (d {\textgreater} 2.50). UDS suggested similar between-group adherence to MOUD, with a marginal decrease in opioid (MOP) use in the intervention group and increase in controls, yielding medium between group effect sizes (d = 0.44). Passive sensor data suggested significant increases in social connectedness in the intervention group, evidenced by a significant rise in incoming and outgoing calls and text connections. Initial evidence supports the feasibility and acceptability of a digital intervention for treating anxiety and depressive symptoms in persons receiving MOUD. While underpowered to confidently determine statistical significance beyond directionality, the intervention showed promise in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, suggesting its potential as a cost-effective and scalable adjunctive therapy alongside standard OUD treatment. Due to the preliminary nature of this pilot study, further research with sample sizes permitting greater statistical power is needed to confirm findings and explore long-term effects.},

We interviewed 13 therapists and 14 clients about their experiences with between-session goals. We identified therapists' needs for information to support their clients, challenges in collaboration, and how technology can support client-therapist collaboration. Therapists need in-the-moment information about clients' engagement with goals to inform their decision-making. Clients may feel reluctant to share information due to a lack of trust, embarrassment, or not knowing what to share. Clients could use technology to asynchronously communicate about sensitive topics with their therapists. Technologies could facilitate gathering in-the-moment data that supports client-therapist collaboration on goals.},

Doctoral-level clinicians and psychologists expressed more positive ratings in all three domains than master’s-level clinicians and non-psychologists respectively, although only the disciplinary differences remained significant when predictors were examined simultaneously. All three attitude scales were predictive of standardized assessment tool use, although practical concerns were the strongest and only independent predictor of use.},

However, studies suggest the 7-point response format and 3-factor structure of the client version may have psychometric problems. This study used Rasch item response theory (IRT) to (a) improve WAI response format, (b) compare two brief 12-item versions (WAI-sr; WAI-s), and (c) develop a new 16-item Brief Alliance Inventory (BAI). Method: Archival data from 1786 counseling center and community clients were analyzed. Results: IRT findings suggested problems with crossed category thresholds. A rescoring scheme that combines neighboring responses to create 5- and 4-point scales sharply reduced these problems. Although subscale variance was reduced by 11–26\%, rescoring yielded improved reliability and generally higher correlations with therapy process (session depth and smoothness) and outcome measures (residual gain symptom improvement). The 16-item BAI was designed to maximize “bandwidth” of item difficulty and preserve a broader range of WAI sensitivity than WAI-s or WAI-sr. Conclusions: Comparisons suggest the BAI performed better in several respects than the WAI-s or WAI-sr and equivalent to the full WAI on several performance indicators.},

	abstract = {Computing devices and applications are now used beyond the desktop, in diverse environments, and this trend toward ubiquitous computing is accelerating. One challenge that remains in this emerging research field is the ability to enhance the behavior of any application by informing it of the context of its use. By context, we refer to any information that characterizes a situation related to the interaction between humans, applications, and the surrounding environment. Context-aware applications promise richer and easier interaction, but the current state of research in this field is still far removed from that vision. This is due to 3 main problems: (a) the notion of context is still ill defined, (b) there is a lack of conceptual models and methods to help drive the design of context-aware applications, and (c) no tools are available to jump-start the development of context-aware applications. In this anchor article, we address these 3 problems in turn. We first define context, identify categories of contextual information, and characterize context-aware application behavior. Though the full impact of context-aware computing requires understanding very subtle and high-level notions of context, we are focusing our efforts on the pieces of context that can be inferred automatically from sensors in a physical environment. We then present a conceptual framework that separates the acquisition and representation of context from the delivery and reaction to context by a context-aware application. We have built a toolkit, the Context Toolkit, that instantiates this conceptual framework and supports the rapid development of a rich space of context-aware applications. We illustrate the usefulness of the conceptual framework by describing a number of context-aware applications that have been prototyped using the Context Toolkit. We also demonstrate how such a framework can support the investigation of important research challenges in the area of context-aware computing.},

To develop these design implications, we analyzed data from a month-long field study of an app designed to support dialectical behavioral therapy, a psychotherapy that aims to teach concrete coping skills to help people better manage their mental health. We investigated whether particular skills are more or less effective in reducing distress or emotional intensity. We also characterized how an individual’s disorders, characteristics, and preferences may correlate with skill effectiveness, as well as how skill-level improvements correlate with study-wide changes in depressive symptoms. We then developed a model to predict skill effectiveness. Based on our findings, we present design implications that emphasize the importance of considering different environmental, emotional, and personal contexts. Finally, we discuss promising future opportunities for mobile apps to better support evidence-based psychotherapies, including using machine learning algorithms to develop personalized and context-aware skill recommendations.},

SDOH screening efforts align with mandates and recommendations by the Joint Commission, the Centers for Medicare \&amp; Medicaid Services, and Healthy People 2020 Objectives. By screening for SDOH (eg, adverse social risk factors such as food insecurity), health care professionals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of patients’ lives, allowing improved tailoring of interventions, referrals, and services to reduce health disparities and enhance care. Surprisingly absent from current SDOH screening and referral initiatives is critical consideration for the role digital redlining plays in shaping access to health care and social services.},

We argue that a decolonial digital mental health is one that centers lived experience over rigid classifcation, is conscious of structural factors that infuence mental wellbeing, and is fundamentally designed to deter the creation of power diferentials that prevent people from having agency over their care.

The entangled history of these two fields grounds the application of applied psychological techniques to digital technologies, and an investment in applying calculability to human subjectivity. Today, a quantifiable psychological subject position has been translated, via ?big data? sets and algorithmic analysis, into a model subject amenable to classification through digital media platforms.

	abstract = {The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.},

This article discusses the design, sampling strategy, implementation, and data analytic processes of the DSM-5 Field Trials.

Method

The DSM-5 Field Trials were conducted by using a test-retest reliability design with a stratified sampling approach across six adult and four pediatric sites in the United States and one adult site in Canada. A stratified random sampling approach was used to enhance precision in the estimation of the reliability coefficients. A web-based research electronic data capture system was used for simultaneous data collection from patients and clinicians across sites and for centralized data management. Weighted descriptive analyses, intraclass kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients for stratified samples, and receiver operating curves were computed. The DSM-5 Field Trials capitalized on advances since DSM-III and DSM-IV in statistical measures of reliability (i.e., intraclass kappa for stratified samples) and other recently developed measures to determine confidence intervals around kappa estimates.

Results

Diagnostic interviews using DSM-5 criteria were conducted by 279 clinicians of varied disciplines who received training comparable to what would be available to any clinician after publication of DSM-5. Overall, 2,246 patients with various diagnoses and levels of comorbidity were enrolled, of which over 86\% were seen for two diagnostic interviews. A range of reliability coefficients were observed for the categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures.

Conclusions

Multisite field trials and training comparable to what would be available to any clinician after publication of DSM-5 provided “real-world” testing of DSM-5 proposed diagnoses.},

	abstract = {Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.},

The ESM’s ability to identify patients with sepsis has not been adequately evaluated despite widespread use.To externally validate the ESM in the prediction of sepsis and evaluate its potential clinical value compared with usual care.This retrospective cohort study was conducted among 27 697 patients aged 18 years or older admitted to Michigan Medicine, the academic health system of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with 38 455 hospitalizations between December 6, 2018, and October 20, 2019.The ESM score, calculated every 15 minutes.Sepsis, as defined by a composite of (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance criteria and (2) International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnostic codes accompanied by 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and 1 organ dysfunction criterion within 6 hours of one another. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve at the hospitalization level and with prediction horizons of 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. Model calibration was evaluated with calibration plots. The potential clinical benefit associated with the ESM was assessed by evaluating the added benefit of the ESM score compared with contemporary clinical practice (based on timely administration of antibiotics). Alert fatigue was evaluated by comparing the clinical value of different alerting strategies.We identified 27 697 patients who had 38 455 hospitalizations (21 904 women [57\%]; median age, 56 years [interquartile range, 35-69 years]) meeting inclusion criteria, of whom sepsis occurred in 2552 (7\%). The ESM had a hospitalization-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.62-0.64). The ESM identified 183 of 2552 patients with sepsis (7\%) who did not receive timely administration of antibiotics, highlighting the low sensitivity of the ESM in comparison with contemporary clinical practice. The ESM also did not identify 1709 patients with sepsis (67\%) despite generating alerts for an ESM score of 6 or higher for 6971 of all 38 455 hospitalized patients (18\%), thus creating a large burden of alert fatigue.This external validation cohort study suggests that the ESM has poor discrimination and calibration in predicting the onset of sepsis. The widespread adoption of the ESM despite its poor performance raises fundamental concerns about sepsis management on a national level.},

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on part of the data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and the validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular CV methods: record-wise and subject-wise. While the subject-wise method mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosis in newly recruited subjects, the record-wise strategy has no such interpretation. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise CV often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method was used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning-based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as inaccurate results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists.},

	abstract = {Background:  Bipolar disorder is a prevalent mental health condition that is imposing significant burden on society. Accurate forecasting of symptom scores can be used to improve disease monitoring, enable early intervention, and eventually help prevent costly hospitalizations. Although several studies have examined the use of smartphone data to detect mood, only few studies deal with forecasting mood for one or more days.
 Objective:  This study aimed to examine the feasibility of forecasting daily subjective mood scores based on daily self-assessments collected from patients with bipolar disorder via a smartphone-based system in a randomized clinical trial.
 Methods:  We applied hierarchical Bayesian regression models, a multi-task learning method, to account for individual differences and forecast mood for up to seven days based on 15,975 smartphone self-assessments from 84 patients with bipolar disorder participating in a randomized clinical trial. We reported the results of two time-series cross-validation 1-day forecast experiments corresponding to two different real-world scenarios and compared the outcomes with commonly used baseline methods. We then applied the best model to evaluate a 7-day forecast.
 Results:  The best performing model used a history of 4 days of self-assessment to predict future mood scores with historical mood being the most important predictor variable. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian regression model outperformed pooled and separate models in a 1-day forecast time-series cross-validation experiment and achieved the predicted metrics,  R 2  =0.51 and root mean squared error of 0.32, for mood scores on a scale of −3 to 3. When increasing the forecast horizon, forecast errors also increased and the forecast regressed toward the mean of data distribution.
 Conclusions:  Our proposed method can forecast mood for several days with low error compared with common baseline methods. The applicability of a mood forecast in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder has also been discussed.

	abstract = {Background
Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers.
Methods
We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features.
Results
In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors.
Limitations
Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality.
Conclusions
Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention.},

	abstract = {Background
Relatively little is known about how communication changes as a function of depression severity and interpersonal closeness. We examined the linguistic features of outgoing text messages among individuals with depression and their close- and non-close contacts.
Methods
419 participants were included in this 16-week-long observational study. Participants regularly completed the PHQ-8 and rated subjective closeness to their contacts. Text messages were processed to count frequencies of word usage in the LIWC 2015 libraries. A linear mixed modeling approach was used to estimate linguistic feature scores of outgoing text messages.
Results
Regardless of closeness, people with higher PHQ-8 scores tended to use more differentiation words. When texting with close contacts, individuals with higher PHQ-8 scores used more first-person singular, filler, sexual, anger, and negative emotion words. When texting with non-close contacts these participants used more conjunctions, tentative, and sadness-related words and fewer first-person plural words.
Conclusion
Word classes used in text messages, when combined with symptom severity and subjective social closeness data, may be indicative of underlying interpersonal processes. These data may hold promise as potential treatment targets to address interpersonal drivers of depression.},

This case study introduces an infrastructural framework to illustrate the feasibility of passively collecting social media data at scale in the context of an ongoing multimodal sensing study of workplace performance (N=757).

In a large (n = 618) cohort of stable, community-dwelling schizophrenia patients we sought to: (1) examine the concordance of patients’ reports of their real-life functioning with the reports of their key caregiver; (2) identify which patient characteristics are associated to the differences between patients and informants. Patient-caregiver concordance of the ratings in three Specific Level of Functioning Scale (SLOF) domains (interpersonal relationships, everyday life skills, work skills) was evaluated with matched-pair t tests, the Lin’s concordance correlation, Somers’ D, and Bland–Altman plots with limits of agreement (LOA). Predictors of the patient-caregiver differences in SLOF ratings were assessed with a linear regression with multivariable fractional polynomials. Patients’ self-evaluation of functioning was higher than caregivers’ in all the evaluated domains of the SLOF and 17.6\% of the patients exceeded the LOA, thus providing a self-evaluation discordant from their key caregivers. The strongest predictors of patient-caregiver discrepancies were caregivers’ ratings in each SLOF domain.

	abstract = {• The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is the most widely used scale for patient selection and follow-up in research studies of treatments of depression. Despite extensive study of the reliability and validity of the total scale score, the psychometric characteristics of the individual items have not been well studied. In the only reliability study to report agreement on individual items using a test-retest interview method, most of the items had only fair or poor agreement. Because this is due in part to variability in the way the Information is obtained to make the various rating distinctions, the Structured Interview Guide for the HDRS (SIGH-D) was developed to standardize the manner of administration of the scale. A test-retest reliability study conducted on a series of psychiatric inpatients demonstrated that the use of the SIGH-D results in a substantially improved level of agreement for most of the HDRS items.},

We analyzed a total of 405,523 search queries from 105 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD, N = 36), non-psychotic mood disorders (MD, N = 38) and healthy volunteers (HV, N = 31) utilizing one year’s worth of data prior to the first psychiatric hospitalization. Across 52 weeks, we found significant differences in the timing (p{\textless}0.05) and frequency (p{\textless}0.001) of searches between individuals with SSD and MD compared to HV up to a year in advance of the first psychiatric hospitalization. We additionally identified significant linguistic differences in search content among the three groups including use of words related to sadness and perception, use of first and second person pronouns, and use of punctuation (all p{\textless}0.05). In the weeks before hospitalization, both participants with SSD and MD displayed significant shifts in search timing (p{\textless}0.05), and participants with SSD displayed significant shifts in search content (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {Background
The most common mental disorders in both outpatient settings and the general population are depression and anxiety, which frequently coexist. Both of these disorders are associated with considerable disability.
Objective
When the disorders co-occur, the disability is even greater. Authors sought to test an ultra-brief screening tool for both.
Method
Validated two-item ultra-brief screeners for depression and anxiety were combined to constitute the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (the PHQ–4). Data were analyzed from 2,149 patients drawn from 15 primary-care clinics in the United States.
Results
Factor analysis confirmed two discrete factors (Depression and Anxiety) that explained 84\% of the total variance. Increasing PHQ–4 scores were strongly associated with functional impairment, disability days, and healthcare use. Anxiety had a substantial effect on functional status that was independent of depression.
Conclusion
The PHQ–4 is a valid ultra-brief tool for detecting both anxiety and depressive disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) is established as a valid diagnostic and severity measure for depressive disorders in large clinical studies. Our objectives were to assess the PHQ-8 as a depression measure in a large, epidemiological population-based study, and to determine the comparability of depression as defined by the PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm vs. a PHQ-8 cutpoint ≥10.
Methods
Random-digit-dialed telephone survey of 198,678 participants in the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), a population-based survey in the United States. Current depression as defined by either the DSM-IV based diagnostic algorithm (i.e., major depressive or other depressive disorder) of the PHQ-8 or a PHQ-8 score ≥10; respondent sociodemographic characteristics; number of days of impairment in the past 30 days in multiple domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Results
The prevalence of current depression was similar whether defined by the diagnostic algorithm or a PHQ-8 score ≥10 (9.1\% vs. 8.6\%). Depressed patients had substantially more days of impairment across multiple domains of HRQoL, and the impairment was nearly identical in depressed groups defined by either method. Of the 17,040 respondents with a PHQ-8 score ≥10, major depressive disorder was present in 49.7\%, other depressive disorder in 23.9\%, depressed mood or anhedonia in another 22.8\%, and no evidence of depressive disorder or depressive symptoms in only 3.5\%.
Limitations
The PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm rather than an independent structured psychiatric interview was used as the criterion standard.
Conclusions
The PHQ-8 is a useful depression measure for population-based studies, and either its diagnostic algorithm or a cutpoint ≥10 can be used for defining current depression.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research has shown the feasibility of using machine learning models trained on social media data from a single platform (eg, Facebook or Twitter) to distinguish individuals either with a diagnosis of mental illness or experiencing an adverse outcome from healthy controls. However, the performance of such models on data from novel social media platforms unseen in the training data (eg, Instagram and TikTok) has not been investigated in previous literature.
Objective: Our study examined the feasibility of building machine learning classifiers that can effectively predict an upcoming psychiatric hospitalization given social media data from platforms unseen in the classifiers’ training data despite the preliminary evidence on identity fragmentation on the investigated social media platforms.
Methods: Windowed timeline data of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder before a known hospitalization event and healthy controls were gathered from 3 platforms: Facebook (254/268, 94.8\% of participants), Twitter (51/268, 19\% of participants), and Instagram (134/268, 50\% of participants). We then used a 3 × 3 combinatorial binary classification design to train machine learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on testing data from all available platforms. We further compared results from models in intraplatform experiments (ie, training and testing data belonging to the same platform) to those from models in interplatform experiments (ie, training and testing data belonging to different platforms). Finally, we used Shapley Additive Explanation values to extract the top predictive features to explain and compare the underlying constructs that predict hospitalization on each platform.
Results: We found that models in intraplatform experiments on average achieved an F1-score of 0.72 (SD 0.07) in predicting a psychiatric hospitalization because of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, which is 68\% higher than the average of models in interplatform experiments at an F1-score of 0.428 (SD 0.11). When investigating the key drivers for divergence in construct validities between models, an analysis of top features for the intraplatform models showed both low predictive feature overlap between the platforms and low pairwise rank correlation (\&lt;0.1) between the platforms’ top feature rankings. Furthermore, low average cosine similarity of data between platforms within participants in comparison with the same measurement on data within platforms between participants points to evidence of identity fragmentation of participants between platforms.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that models built on one platform’s data to predict critical mental health treatment outcomes such as hospitalization do not generalize to another platform. In our case, this is because different social media platforms consistently reflect different segments of participants’ identities. With the changing ecosystem of social media use among different demographic groups and as web-based identities continue to become fragmented across platforms, further research on holistic approaches to harnessing these diverse data sources is required.},

We collected 52,815 Facebook posts across 51 participants with recent onset psychosis (mean age = 23.96 years; 70.58\% male) and applied anomaly detection to explore linguistic and behavioral changes associated with psychotic relapse. We built a one-class classification model that makes patient-specific personalized predictions on risk to relapse. Significant differences were identified in the words posted to Facebook in the month preceding a relapse hospitalization compared to periods of relative health, including increased usage of words belonging to the swear (p {\textless} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test), anger (p {\textless} 0.001), and death (p {\textless} 0.0001) categories, decreased usage of words belonging to work (p = 0.00579), friends (p {\textless} 0.0001), and health (p {\textless} 0.0001) categories, as well as a significantly increased use of first (p {\textless} 0.0001) and second-person (p  {\textless} 0.001) pronouns. We additionally observed a significant increase in co-tagging (p {\textless} 0.001) and friending (p {\textless} 0.0001) behaviors in the month before a relapse hospitalization.

	abstract = {Background: Research in mental health has found associations between depression and individuals’ behaviors and statuses, such as social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social isolation and loneliness. These behaviors and statuses can be approximated by the nearby Bluetooth device count (NBDC) detected by Bluetooth sensors in mobile phones.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the value of the NBDC data in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).
Methods: The data used in this paper included 2886 biweekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom as part of the EU Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) study. From the NBDC data 2 weeks prior to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear features for measuring the periodicity and regularity of individuals’ life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted Bluetooth features.
Results: A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Generally speaking, along with depressive symptom worsening, one or more of the following changes were found in the preceding 2 weeks of the NBDC data: (1) the amount decreased, (2) the variance decreased, (3) the periodicity (especially the circadian rhythm) decreased, and (4) the NBDC sequence became more irregular. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics (R2=0.526) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8\% of the variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features (R2=0.338, RMSE=4.547).
Conclusions: Our statistical results indicate that the NBDC data have the potential to reflect changes in individuals’ behaviors and statuses concurrent with the changes in the depressive state. The prediction results demonstrate that the NBDC data have a significant value in predicting depressive symptom severity. These findings may have utility for the mental health monitoring practice in real-world settings.},

	abstract = {While studies show links between smartphone data and affective symptoms, we lack clarity on the temporal scale, specificity (e.g., to depression vs. anxiety), and person-specific (vs. group-level) nature of these associations. We conducted a large-scale (n = 1013) smartphone-based passive sensing study to identify within- and between-person digital markers of depression and anxiety symptoms over time. Participants (74.6\% female; M age = 40.9) downloaded the LifeSense app, which facilitated continuous passive data collection (e.g., GPS, app and device use, communication) across 16 weeks. Hierarchical linear regression models tested the within- and between-person associations of 2-week windows of passively sensed data with depression (PHQ-8) or generalized anxiety (GAD-7). We used a shifting window to understand the time scale at which sensed features relate to mental health symptoms, predicting symptoms 2 weeks in the future (distal prediction), 1 week in the future (medial prediction), and 0 weeks in the future (proximal prediction). Spending more time at home relative to one’s average was an early signal of PHQ-8 severity (distal β = 0.219, p = 0.012) and continued to relate to PHQ-8 at medial (β = 0.198, p = 0.022) and proximal (β = 0.183, p = 0.045) windows. In contrast, circadian movement was proximally related to (β = −0.131, p = 0.035) but did not predict (distal β = 0.034, p = 0.577; medial β = −0.089, p = 0.138) PHQ-8. Distinct communication features (i.e., call/text or app-based messaging) related to PHQ-8 and GAD-7. Findings have implications for identifying novel treatment targets, personalizing digital mental health interventions, and enhancing traditional patient-provider interactions. Certain features (e.g., circadian movement) may represent correlates but not true prospective indicators of affective symptoms. Conversely, other features like home duration may be such early signals of intra-individual symptom change, indicating the potential utility of prophylactic intervention (e.g., behavioral activation) in response to person-specific increases in these signals.},

	abstract = {Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for inferences regarding health and well-being, behavior, and context. However, a significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in real-world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the distribution of data in the real world---the deployment environment. While extensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such as audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN, called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12\% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression tasks.},

Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning.

Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed.

	abstract = {Background
It is essential to differentiate bipolar disorder (BD) from unipolar disorder (UD) as the course of illness and treatment guidelines differ between the two disorders. Measurements of activity and mobility could assist in this discrimination. Aims: 1) To investigate differences in smartphone-based location data between BD and UD, and 2) to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of combined location data in classifying BD and UD.
Methods
Patients with BD and UD completed smartphone-based self-assessments of mood for six months, along with same-time passively collected smartphone data on location reflecting mobility patterns, routine and location entropy (chaos). A total of 65 patients with BD and 75 patients with UD were included.
Results
A total of 2594 (patients with BD) and 2088 (patients with UD) observations of smartphone-based location data were available. During a depressive state, compared with patients with UD, patients with BD had statistically significantly lower mobility (e.g., total duration of moves per day (eB 0.74, 95\% CI 0.57; 0.97, p = 0.027)). In classification models during a depressive state, patients with BD versus patients with UD, there was a sensitivity of 0.70 (SD 0.07), a specificity of 0.77 (SD 0.07), and an AUC of 0.79 (SD 0.03).
Limitations
The relative low symptom severity in the present study may have contributed to the magnitude of the AUC.
Conclusion
Mobility patterns derived from mobile location data is a promising digital diagnostic marker in discriminating between patients with BD and UD.},

To address the challenges of self-management of mental illnesses, we have developed the MONARCA system - a personal monitoring system for bipolar patients. We conducted a 14 week field trial in which 12 patients used the system, and we report findings focusing on their experiences. The results were positive; compared to using paper-based forms, the adherence to self-assessment improved; the system was considered very easy to use; and the perceived usefulness of the system was high. Based on this study, the paper discusses three HCI questions related to the design of personal health technologies; how to design for disease awareness and self-treatment, how to ensure adherence to personal health technologies, and the roles of different types of technology platforms.},

	abstract = {Background: Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset.
Methods: In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity.
Results: The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect.
Conclusions: These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect.},

As a proof of concept, we predicted suicide-related hospitalizations for pediatric patients in a limited statewide Hospital Inpatient Discharge Dataset (HIDD) fused with a more comprehensive medical All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) from Connecticut.We built a suicide risk prediction model for the source data (APCD) and calculated patient risk scores. Patient similarity scores between patients in the source and target (HIDD) datasets using their demographic characteristics and diagnosis codes were assessed. A fused risk score was generated for each patient in the target dataset using our proposed targeted fusion framework. With this model, the averaged sensitivities at 90\% and 95\% specificity improved by 67\% and 171\%, and the positive predictive values for the combined fusion model improved 64\% and 135\% compared to the conventional model.We proposed a general targeted fusion learning framework that can be used to build a tailored predictive model for any specific healthcare setting. Results from this study suggest we can improve the performance of predictive models in specific target settings without complete integration of the raw records from external data sources.},

Mobile phone technology combined with data science has the potential to offer medicine a wealth of additional information on disease phenotypes, but the large majority of existing smartphone apps are not intended for use as biomedical research platforms and, as such, do not generate research-quality data. Objective: Our aim is not the creation of yet another app per se but rather the establishment of a platform to collect research-quality smartphone raw sensor and usage pattern data. Our ultimate goal is to develop statistical, mathematical, and computational methodology to enable us and others to extract biomedical and clinical insights from smartphone data. Methods: We report on the development and early testing of Beiwe, a research platform featuring a study portal, smartphone app, database, and data modeling and analysis tools designed and developed specifically for transparent, customizable, and reproducible biomedical research use, in particular for the study of psychiatric and neurological disorders. We also outline a proposed study using the platform for patients with schizophrenia. Results: We demonstrate the passive data capabilities of the Beiwe platform and early results of its analytical capabilities. Conclusions: Smartphone sensors and phone usage patterns, when coupled with appropriate statistical learning tools, are able to capture various social and behavioral manifestations of illnesses, in naturalistic settings, as lived and experienced by patients. The ubiquity of smartphones makes this type of moment-by-moment quantification of disease phenotypes highly scalable and, when integrated within a transparent research platform, presents tremendous opportunities for research, discovery, and patient health.},

We propose a new approach to predicting depression using passive sensing data from students' smartphones and wearables. We propose a set of symptom features that proxy the DSM-5 defined depression symptoms specifically designed for college students. We present results from a study of 83 undergraduate students at Dartmouth College across two 9-week terms during the winter and spring terms in 2016. We identify a number of important new associations between symptom features and student self reported PHQ-8 and PHQ-4 depression scores. The study captures depression dynamics of the students at the beginning and end of term using a pre-post PHQ-8 and week by week changes using a weekly administered PHQ-4. Importantly, we show that symptom features derived from phone and wearable sensors can predict whether or not a student is depressed on a week by week basis with 81.5\% recall and 69.1\% precision.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing.
Methods: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients’ mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients’ self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks.
Results: Promising accuracy rates (60\% to 91\%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.82, P {\textless} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.81, P {\textless} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (bweek = –.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71\%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (betaweek = –.71, P {\textless} .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58).
Conclusions: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.},

	abstract = {Vital signs, including heart rate and body temperature, are useful in detecting or monitoring medical conditions, but are typically measured in the clinic and require follow-up laboratory testing for more definitive diagnoses. Here we examined whether vital signs as measured by consumer wearable devices (that is, continuously monitored heart rate, body temperature, electrodermal activity and movement) can predict clinical laboratory test results using machine learning models, including random forest and Lasso models. Our results demonstrate that vital sign data collected from wearables give a more consistent and precise depiction of resting heart rate than do measurements taken in the clinic. Vital sign data collected from wearables can also predict several clinical laboratory measurements with lower prediction error than predictions made using clinically obtained vital sign measurements. The length of time over which vital signs are monitored and the proximity of the monitoring period to the date of prediction play a critical role in the performance of the machine learning models. These results demonstrate the value of commercial wearable devices for continuous and longitudinal assessment of physiological measurements that today can be measured only with clinical laboratory tests.},

	abstract = {We often think of ourselves as individuals with steady capabilities. However, converging strands of research indicate that this is not the case. Our biochemistry varies signiﬁcantly over the course of a 24 hour period. Consequently our levels of alertness, productivity, physical activity, and even sensitivity to pain ﬂuctuate throughout the day. This offers a considerable opportunity for the UbiComp community to identify novel measurements and interventions that can leverage these daily variations. To illustrate this potential, we present results from an empirical study with 9 participants over 97 days investigating whether such variations manifest in low-level smartphone use, focusing on daily rhythms related to sleep. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that phone usage patterns can be used to detect and predict individual daily variations indicative of temporal preference, sleep duration, and deprivation. We also identify opportunities and challenges for measuring and enhancing well-being using these simple and effective markers of circadian rhythms.},

However, due to the small watch screen, μEMA is better used to select among 2 to 5 multiple-choice answers versus allowing the collection of open-ended responses. We introduce an alternative and novel form of micro-interaction self-report using speech input - audio-μEMA- where a short beep or vibration cues participants to verbally report their behavioral states, allowing for open-ended, temporally dense self-reports. We conducted a one-hour usability study followed by a within-subject, 6-day to 21-day free-living feasibility study in which participants self-reported their physical activities and postures once every 2 to 5 minutes. We qualitatively explored the usability of the system and identified factors impacting the response rates of this data collection method. Despite being interrupted 12 to 20 times per hour, participants in the free-living study were highly engaged with the system, with an average response rate of 67.7\% for audio-μEMA for up to 14 days. We discuss the factors that impacted feasibility; some implementation, methodological, and participant challenges we observed; and important considerations relevant to deploying audio-μEMA in real-time activity recognition systems.},

	abstract = {Wearable cameras provide an objective method to visually confirm and automate the detection of health-risk behaviors such as smoking and overeating, which is critical for developing and testing adaptive treatment interventions. Despite the potential of wearable camera systems, adoption is hindered by inadequate clinician input in the design, user privacy concerns, and user burden. To address these barriers, we introduced HabitSense, an open-source1, multi-modal neck-worn platform developed with input from focus groups with clinicians (N=36) and user feedback from in-wild studies involving 105 participants over 35 days. Optimized for monitoring health-risk behaviors, the platform utilizes RGB, thermal, and inertial measurement unit sensors to detect eating and smoking events in real time. In a 7-day study involving 15 participants, HabitSense recorded 768 hours of footage, capturing 420.91 minutes of hand-to-mouth gestures associated with eating and smoking data crucial for training machine learning models, achieving a 92\% F1-score in gesture recognition. To address privacy concerns, the platform records only during likely health-risk behavior events using SECURE, a smart activation algorithm. Additionally, HabitSense employs on-device obfuscation algorithms that selectively obfuscate the background during recording, maintaining individual privacy while leaving gestures related to health-risk behaviors unobfuscated. Our implementation of SECURE has resulted in a 48\% reduction in storage needs and a 30\% increase in battery life. This paper highlights the critical roles of clinician feedback, extensive field testing, and privacy-enhancing algorithms in developing an unobtrusive, lightweight, and reproducible wearable system that is both feasible and acceptable for monitoring health-risk behaviors in real-world settings.},

To work around this, ML teams will extrapolate proxy signals, or alternative signs from data to evaluate illness status and create training datasets. However, these signals' validity has not been determined, whether signals align with important contextual factors, and how proxy quality impacts downstream model integrity. We use ML and qualitative methods to evaluate whether a popular proxy signal, diagnostic self-disclosure, produces a conceptually sound ML model of mental illness. Our findings identify major conceptual errors only seen through a qualitative investigation -- training data built from diagnostic disclosures encodes a narrow vision of diagnosis experiences that propagates into paradoxes in the downstream ML model. This gap is obscured by strong performance of the ML classifier (F1 = 0.91). We discuss the implications of conceptual gaps in creating training data for human-centered models, and make suggestions for improving research methods.},

This chapter presents a broad overview of some of the central components of health services and policy research. Inherently multidisciplinary, health services research incorporates perspectives, theories, knowledge, and research methods of a broad range of clinical, social, behavioral, and management sciences, including clinical medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, economics, political science, communication, psychology, public health, operations research, informatics, finance, and management. Thus, this study examines health services research through an overview of broad problem areas. Translation of medical innovation requires methodological expertise, skill, time, and resources. Although difficult, effectively translating advances in scientific knowledge to practice and policy to improve the health of patients and the public requires research of the type discussed in this chapter. The goal of medical care is to improve patient and population health. Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease require integrating knowledge and understanding across the basic, clinical, population, social, and management sciences. Health services research is a multidisciplinary scientific endeavor that studies and generates knowledge to facilitate improved translation of medical discoveries into practice to improve the health of patients and the public.},

As part of a larger evaluation, we conducted semistructured interviews with 35 primary care using Hennepin Health members enrolled for 2 or more years. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, we assessed enrollee complexity and use of the care model and improvements in quality of life. We found improved quality of life was consistently associated with strong bonds to primary care, consistent mental health care, and support from extended care team members. Comprehensive, integrated care models within ACOs may improve quality of life for low-income Medicaid enrollees through coordinated primary and mental health care.},

	abstract = {In contemporary management theory and practice the rise and role of stakeholders as major players in organizational dynamics are widely recognized and recorded. This pluralistic view of the identity of those who have an investment and an interest in an organization extends well beyond the traditional concept of shareholders to include employees, suppliers, customers, trade unions, communities, etc. The concept of stakeholders has been applied to projects in general but has not, to date, been extended to the context of construction projects although it is accepted that the traditional view of the client as a single entity does not reflect the reality of stakeholder configurations for most projects. Different stakeholders have different levels and types of investment and interest in construction projects and can be seen as multiple clients or customers for the project in which they are involved. This paper argues that the concept of client, which has prevailed throughout the twentieth century, is now obsolete and is being replaced by the reality of project stakeholders. A novel application of the technique of stakeholder mapping to a large construction project demonstrates the importance to project managers of conducting the analysis of the power, predictability and interest of key project stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Where machine-learned predictive risk scores inform high-stakes decisions, such as bail and sentencing in criminal justice, fairness has been a serious concern. Recent work has characterized the disparate impact that such risk scores can have when used for a binary classification task. This may not account, however, for the more diverse downstream uses of risk scores and their non-binary nature. To better account for this, in this paper, we investigate the fairness of predictive risk scores from the point of view of a bipartite ranking task, where one seeks to rank positive examples higher than negative ones. We introduce the xAUC disparity as a metric to assess the disparate impact of risk scores and define it as the difference in the probabilities of ranking a random positive example from one protected group above a negative one from another group and vice versa. We provide a decomposition of bipartite ranking loss into components that involve the discrepancy and components that involve pure predictive ability within each group. We use xAUC analysis to audit predictive risk scores for recidivism prediction, income prediction, and cardiac arrest prediction, where it describes disparities that are not evident from simply comparing within-group predictive performance.},

Our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor classification from disadvantaged groups to the decision maker, who can respond by improving the classification accuracy. In line with other studies, our notion is oblivious: it depends only on the joint statistics of the predictor, the target and the protected attribute, but not on interpretation of individualfeatures. We study the inherent limits of defining and identifying biases based on such oblivious measures, outlining what can and cannot be inferred from different oblivious tests. We illustrate our notion using a case study of FICO credit scores.},

Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem.

Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental health and educational outcomes of the student body. We also identify a Dartmouth term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off. The StudentLife dataset is publicly available on the web.},

EMA facilitates understanding of temporal changes of dynamic variables subject to change difficult to capture in standard laboratory assessment. It also elucidates understanding of complex etiology of mental illness in military and veteran samples and treatment approaches. Thirty-two articles published between 1995 and 2019 met inclusion criteria. Most (68.7\%) included studies examined mental health symptoms and their temporal relationship to other outcomes among servicemembers and/or veterans, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders. EMA was frequently employed to better understand underlying mechanisms of mental illness, predict symptom changes, assess feasibility among special populations, and assess treatment outcomes. Considerable variability existed in assessment period duration, number of daily assessments, and EMA modalities utilized. Several research gaps were identified, including underutilization of EMA to study suicide risk in veterans/servicemembers. EMA has great potential for increasing understanding of an array of complex mental health problems; however, this highly promising approach has been largely underutilized to study mental health issues among veteran and military populations to date, perhaps due to institutional delays in its adoption secondary to privacy/data security concerns.},

	abstract = {Background
The movement of evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous, but requires focused efforts. The field of implementation science has developed to facilitate the spread of EBPs, including both psychosocial and medical interventions for mental and physical health concerns.

Discussion
The authors aim to introduce implementation science principles to non-specialist investigators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to become familiar with this emerging field. This introduction is based on published literature and the authors’ experience as researchers in the field, as well as extensive service as implementation science grant reviewers., Implementation science is “the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.” Implementation science is distinct from, but shares characteristics with, both quality improvement and dissemination methods. Implementation studies can be either assess naturalistic variability or measure change in response to planned intervention. Implementation studies typically employ mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors that impact uptake across multiple levels, including patient, provider, clinic, facility, organization, and often the broader community and policy environment. Accordingly, implementation science requires a solid grounding in theory and the involvement of trans-disciplinary research teams.

Summary
The business case for implementation science is clear: As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic and resource-constrained conditions, evidence-based strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts.},

The model offers a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe the progression of HCI knowledge through a sequence of translations. Additionally, the model may facilitate a precise identification of translational barriers, which allows devising more effective strategies to increase the use of scientific findings in design practice.},

Text books present generic advice, but rarely focus on specific study contexts. In this paper, we focus on lessons learnt by non-clinical researchers studying technology use in hospitals: gaining access; developing good relations with clinicians and patients; being outsiders in healthcare settings; and managing the cultural divide between technology human factors and clinical practice. Drawing on case studies across various hospital settings, we present a repertoire of ways of working with people and technologies in these settings. These include engaging clinicians and patients effectively, taking an iterative approach to data gathering and being responsive to the demands and opportunities provided by the situation. The main contribution of this paper is to make visible many of the lessons we have learnt in conducting technology studies in healthcare, using these lessons to present strategies that other researchers can take up.},

Though often described as "raw," this data is produced by techniques of measurement that are imbued with judgments and values that dictate what is counted and what is not, what is considered the best unit of measurement, and how different things are grouped together and "made" into a measureable entity. In this paper, we analyze these politics of measurement and how they relate to action through two case studies involving high stake public health measurements where experts intentionally leverage measurement to change definitions of harm and health. That is, they use measurement for activism. The case studies offer a framework for thinking about of how the politics of measurement are present in user interfaces. It is usually assumed that the human element has been scrubbed from the database and that significant political and subjective interventions come from the analysis or use of data after the fact. Instead, we argue that human-computer interactions start before the data reaches the computer because various measurement interfaces are the invisible premise of data and databases, and these measurements are political.},

We conclude that the major challenges presented by DesignX problems stem not from trying to understand or address the issues, but rather arise during implementation, when political, economic, cultural, organizational, and structural problems overwhelm all else. We suggest that designers cannot stop at the design stage: they must play an active role in implementation, and develop solutions through small, incremental steps—minimizing budgets and the resources required for each step— to reduce political, social, and cultural disruptions. This approach requires tolerance for existing constraints and trade-offs, and a modularity that allows for measures that do not compromise the whole. These designs satisfice rather than optimize and are related to the technique of making progress by “muddling through,” a form of incrementalism championed by Lindblom.},

We live in a time of change, with a shift from care being delivered by professionals towards people being expected to be actively engaged and involved in shared decision making. Technically, this shift is supported by novel health technologies and information resources ; culturally, the pace of change varies across contexts. In this paper, I present a “space” of interactive health technologies, users and uses, and interdependencies between them. Based on a review of the past and present, I highlight opportunities for and challenges to the application of HCI methods in the design and deployment of digital health technologies.

To illustrate the power of this new approach, we used it in a field study of nine older adults with type 2 diabetes, and nine mothers of children with asthma. Our mixed-methods approach provides three key advantages for health design science in HCI: (1) it provides a structured health sciences theoretical framework to guide data collection and analysis; (2) it enhances the coding of unstructured data with statistical patterns of polarizing and consensus views; and (3) it empowers participants to actively weigh competing values that are most personally significant to them.},

We prioritized exploring this topic with families in low-socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods because they face increased barriers to being active due to inequities. Through our systems development, qualitative studies, and theoretical foundation, we developed the Socio-Cognitive Framework for Personal Health Informatics systems that shows how five socio-cognitive concepts (aspirations, data exposure, stories, belongingness, and impediments) influence self-efficacy and outcome expectations that are linked to health behavior.

However, turning these demands for better evidence about interventions around the social determinants of health into action requires identifying what we already know and highlighting areas for further development.
Methods Systematic review methodology was used to identify systematic reviews (from 2000 to 2007, developed countries only) that described the health effects of any intervention based on the wider social determinants of health: water and sanitation, agriculture and food, access to health and social care services, unemployment and welfare, working conditions, housing and living environment, education, and transport.
Results Thirty systematic reviews were identiﬁed. Generally, the effects of interventions on health inequalities were unclear. However, there is suggestive systematic review evidence that certain categories of intervention may impact positively on inequalities or on the health of speciﬁc disadvantaged groups, particularly interventions in the ﬁelds of housing and the work environment.

We present MindfulDiary, a mobile journaling app incorporating an LLM to help psychiatric patients document daily experiences through conversation. Designed in collaboration with mental health professionals (MHPs), MindfulDiary takes a state-based approach to safely comply with the experts' guidelines while carrying on free-form conversations. Through a four-week field study involving 28 patients with major depressive disorder and five psychiatrists, we found that MindfulDiary supported patients in consistently enriching their daily records and helped psychiatrists better empathize with their patients through an understanding of their thoughts and daily contexts. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the implications of leveraging LLMs in the mental health domain, bridging the technical feasibility and their integration into clinical settings.},

Turnover can disrupt care continuity for patients and create challenges for insurers in managing the health of their enrollee populations. Yet the extent to which enrollees reenroll is not widely known.To characterize rates of disenrollment (hereafter, external turnover) and reenrollment in commercial health plans.In this retrospective longitudinal cohort study, trends in turnover and reenrollment in commercial health plans between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2018, were analyzed. Data analysis was conducted from January 21, 2020, through December 23, 2021. Participants included 3 018 633 primary members and their dependents with employer-sponsored coverage.Primary outcomes included external turnover from commercial coverage and subsequent reenrollment into any line of business with the insurer (commercial, Medicaid Managed Care, and Medicare Advantage). Within commercial coverage, external turnover was analyzed separately for group (ie, employer-sponsored) and individual markets.In the sample of 3 018 633 members, 50.2\% were men; mean (SD) age, including dependents, was 30.68 (19.05) years. A total of 2.2\% of members experienced external turnover each month and 21.5\% experienced external turnover each year. The individual market had the highest average monthly turnover rate of 3.4\% compared with 2.1\% in the group market. December had the highest rate of external turnover, with 13.8\% experiencing external turnover in the individual market and 6.9\% of members experiencing external turnover in the group market. Fourteen percent of the members who left the insurer from an individual plan reenrolled with the insurer after 1 year, and 34\% had reenrolled after 5 years. Among members who left the insurer from a group plan, 12\% reenrolled after 1 year and 32\% reenrolled after 5 years. After 10 years, reenrollment reached 47\% in the 2 markets. More than 80\% of enrollees returned to the same line of business and within the same state, suggesting findings may generalize to smaller insurers.The findings of this cohort study suggest that insurers may benefit from investing in members’ long-term health outcomes despite substantial short-term turnover rates.},

	abstract = {Employees and beneﬁciaries of public health insurance programs often have to switch involuntarily to another health plan, when a contract with their insurer is not renewed. I study the eﬀects of such involuntary switches using plans’ exit after a lost bid in Medicaid Managed Care, comparing enrollees forced to switch to enrollees in remaining plans. I ﬁnd that switching plans disrupts medical care: switchers have fewer visits to primary-care physicians and more visits to emergency departments; their utilization of prescription drugs decreases, including patients using drugs for chronic conditions; children and non-whites also have more preventable hospital admissions. At the year after the exit, insurers’ spending on switchers is 10\% lower than the pre-exit baseline, comparing to beneﬁciaries in remaining plans, and Medicaid’s total spending is lower by 4\%. Exploring possible mechanisms, I ﬁnd that loss of access to familiar primary care physicians, changes in the network of providers, and changes in drug formularies - all may play a role in disrupting care after a switch. Plans’ eﬀect on utilization may also partly explain the results.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the effect of surgeon specific outcome reporting in colorectal cancer surgery on risk averse clinical practice, “gaming” of clinical data, and 90 day postoperative mortality.

Design
National cohort study.

Setting
English National Health Service hospital trusts.

Population
111 431 patients diagnosed as having colorectal cancer from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2015 included in the National Bowel Cancer Audit.

Intervention
Public reporting of surgeon specific 90 day mortality in elective colorectal cancer surgery in England introduced in June 2013.

Main outcome measures
Proportion of patients with colorectal cancer who had an elective major resection, predicted 90 day mortality based on characteristics of patients and tumours, and observed 90 day mortality adjusted for differences in characteristics of patients and tumours, comparing patients who had surgery between April 2011 and June 2013 and between July 2013 and March 2015.

Results
The proportion of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing major resection did not change after the introduction of surgeon specific public outcome reporting (39 792/62 854 (63.3\%) before versus 30 706/48 577 (63.2\%) after; P=0.8). The proportion of these major resections categorised as elective or scheduled also did not change (33 638/39 792 (84.5\%) before versus 25 905/30 706 (84.4\%) after; P=0.5). The predicted 90 day mortality remained the same (2.7\% v 2.7\%; P=0.3), but the observed 90 day mortality fell (952/33 638 (2.8\%) v 552/25 905 (2.1\%)). Change point analysis showed that this reduction was over and above the existing downward trend in mortality before the introduction of public outcome reporting (P=0.03).

Conclusions
This study did not find evidence that the introduction of public reporting of surgeon specific 90 day postoperative mortality in elective colorectal cancer surgery has led to risk averse clinical practice behaviour or “gaming” of data. However, its introduction coincided with a significant reduction in 90 day mortality.},

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a survey administered by clinicians to evaluate symptom severity in schizophrenia. The CrossCheck symptom prediction system is capable of tracking schizophrenia symptoms based on BPRS using passive sensing from mobile phones. We present results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive sensing data, self-reports, and clinician administered 7-item BPRS surveys are collected from 36 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-12 months. We show that our system can predict a symptom scale score based on a 7-item BPRS within ±1.45 error on average using automatically tracked behavioral features from phones (e.g., mobility, conversation, activity, smartphone usage, the ambient acoustic environment) and user supplied self-reports. Importantly, we show our system is also capable of predicting an individual BPRS score within ±1.59 error purely based on passive sensing from phones without any self-reported information from outpatients. Finally, we discuss how well our predictive system reflects symptoms experienced by patients by reviewing a number of case studies.},

We collect over 125,000 photos in the wild from N=177 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder for 90 days. Images are captured naturalistically while participants respond to the PHQ-8 depression survey question: “I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless”. Our analysis explores important image attributes, such as angle, dominant colors, location, objects, and lighting. We show that a random forest trained with face landmarks can classify samples as depressed or non-depressed and predict raw PHQ-8 scores effectively. Our post-hoc analysis provides several insights through an ablation study, feature importance analysis, and bias assessment. Importantly, we evaluate user concerns about using MoodCapture to detect depression based on sharing photos, providing critical insights into privacy concerns that inform the future design of in-the-wild image-based mental health assessment tools.},

This research performed a systematic literature review on extant HCI publications that claim to use service design. The review findings from the 179 publications revealed varying dimensions of service design taken up in HCI, relations between service design scopes and emerging technologies, as well as unclarity to service design in HCI and HCI's current tendency to use service design for the interaction level rather than the system level. We discuss future design and research opportunities for HCI by integrating the system level dimensions of service design.},

The first two are not particularly controversial in terms of their contributions to larger enterprises of HCI. Human-Factors focuses on optimizing man-machine fit. Classical Cognitivism/Information Processing emphasizes (ideally predictive) models and theories and the relationship between what is in the computer and in the human mind. The third paradigm, with its base in Phenomenology, is less reified, but no less real. It focuses on the experiential quality of interaction, primarily the situated nature of meaning and meaning creation. All three paradigms drive design, but in different ways. All three have their own forms of knowledge creation and criteria for what constitutes knowledge. Identifying these approaches as paradigms allows us to value work more clearly.},

The difficulties of developing a comprehensive conceptual model are considered, and the issues involved in designing patient satisfaction surveys – and the disasters that occur when these issues are ignored – are then set out. The potential cost–effectiveness of qualitative techniques is discussed, and the paper concludes by discussing how health care management systems could more effectively absorb the findings of patient satisfaction surveys},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the predictive validity of eight different adherence measures by studying the variability explained between each measure and hospitalization episodes among Medicaid-eligible persons diagnosed with schizophrenia on antipsychotic monotherapy. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of the Arkansas Medicaid administrative claims data. Continuously eligible adult schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM = 295.**) patients on antipsychotic monotherapy were identified in the recruitment period from July 2000 through April 2004. Adherence rates to antipsychotic therapy in year 1 were calculated using eight different measures identified from the literature. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to prospectively predict all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations in the follow-up year. Results: Adherence rates were computed for 3395 schizophrenic patients with a mean age of 42.9 years, of which 52.5\% (n = 1782) were females, and 52.8\% (n = 1793) were white. The proportion of days covered (PDC) and continuous measure of medication gaps measures of adherence had equal C-statistics of 0.571 in predicting both all-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The medication possession ratio (MPR) continuous multiple interval measure of oversupply were the second best measures with equal C-statistics of 0.568 and 0.567 for any-cause and mental health-related hospitalizations. The multivariate adjusted models had higher C-statistics but provided the same rank order results. Conclusions: MPR and PDC were among the best predictors of any-cause and mental health-related hospitalization, and are recommended as the preferred adherence measures when a single measure is sought for use with administrative claims data for patients not on polypharmacy.},

	abstract = {Background
Smartphones offer the hope that depression can be detected using passively collected data from the phone sensors. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous work using geographic location (GPS) sensors to identify depressive symptom severity.

Methods
We used a dataset collected from 48 college students over a 10-week period, which included GPS phone sensor data and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptom severity at baseline and end-of-study. GPS features were calculated over the entire study, for weekdays and weekends, and in 2-week blocks.

Results
The results of this study replicated our previous findings that a number of GPS features, including location variance, entropy, and circadian movement, were significantly correlated with PHQ-9 scores (r’s ranging from −0.43 to −0.46, p-values {\textless}  .05). We also found that these relationships were stronger when GPS features were calculated from weekend, compared to weekday, data. Although the correlation between baseline PHQ-9 scores with 2-week GPS features diminished as we moved further from baseline, correlations with the end-of-study scores remained significant regardless of the time point used to calculate the features.

Discussion
Our findings were consistent with past research demonstrating that GPS features may be an important and reliable predictor of depressive symptom severity. The varying strength of these relationships on weekends and weekdays suggests the role of weekend/weekday as a moderating variable. The finding that GPS features predict depressive symptom severity up to 10 weeks prior to assessment suggests that GPS features may have the potential as early warning signals of depression.},

	abstract = {Background: Sleep is a critical aspect of people’s well-being and as such assessing sleep is an important indicator of a person’s health. Traditional methods of sleep assessment are either time- and resource-intensive or suffer from self-reporting biases. Recently, researchers have started to use mobile phones to passively assess sleep in individuals’ daily lives. However, this work remains in its early stages, having only examined relatively small and homogeneous populations in carefully controlled contexts. Thus, it remains an open question as to how well mobile device-based sleep monitoring generalizes to larger populations in typical use cases. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of machine learning algorithms to detect the sleep start and end times for the main sleep period in a 24-h cycle using mobile devices in a diverse sample. Methods: We collected mobile phone sensor data as well as daily self-reported sleep start and end times from 208 individuals (171 females; 37 males), diverse in age (18−66 years; mean 39.3), education, and employment status, across the United States over 6 weeks. Sensor data consisted of geographic location, motion, light, sound, and in-phone activities. No specific instructions were given to the participants regarding phone placement. We used random forest classifiers to develop both personalized and global predictors of sleep state from the phone sensor data. Results: Using all available sensor features, the average accuracy of classifying whether a 10-min segment was reported as sleep was 88.8\%. This is somewhat better than using the time of day alone, which gives an average accuracy of 86.9\%. The accuracy of the model considerably varied across the participants, ranging from 65.1\% to 97.3\%. We found that low accuracy in some participants was due to two main factors: missing sensor data and misreports. After correcting for these, the average accuracy increased to 91.8\%, corresponding to an average median absolute deviation (MAD) of 38 min for sleep start time detection and 36 min for sleep end time. These numbers are close to the range reported by previous research in more controlled situations. Conclusions: We find that mobile phones provide adequate sleep monitoring in typical use cases, and that our methods generalize well to a broader population than has previously been studied. However, we also observe several types of data artifacts when collecting data in uncontrolled settings. Some of these can be resolved through corrections, but others likely impose a ceiling on the accuracy of sleep prediction for certain subjects. Future research will need to focus more on the understanding of people’s behavior in their natural settings in order to develop sleep monitoring tools that work reliably in all cases for all people.

Symptoms in the Hamilton Depression Scale and in the Beigel Mania Scale which correlate with BPRS have been incorporated as far as possible.

The studies were commenced in August 1984. The rating procedure takes place between 8.15 and 9.00 a.m. and each patient is examined only once. The maximum number of raters is six but varies between three and six per rating procedure. The evaluated patients all comply with DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia.Reliability is expressed by intra-class correlation R = 0.78, p. {\textless} 0.001, for the total scale. When considering degree of severity the global estimate (validity) showed a correlation of R = 0.66, p. {\textless} 0.01.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

We found that two of the included 41 studies show characteristics of accountability towards healthcare with characteristics of integration care components, such as integration of services with accompanying accountability arrangements and development of networked accountability. The first studies are found in the literature which report on accountability in integrated care. With this we add to the international discussion about accountability as an aspect of integrated care governance, by providing insight into the current state of art of accountability in Dutch healthcare.},

We examine key characteristics of several of these private accountable care models, including their overall efforts to improve the quality, efficiency, and accountability of care; their criteria for selecting providers; the payment methods and performance measures they are using; and the technical assistance they are supplying to participating providers. Our findings show that not all providers are equally ready to enter into these arrangements with health plans and therefore flexibility in design of these arrangements is critical. These findings also hold lessons for the emerging public accountable care models, such as the Medicare Shared Savings Program—underscoring providers’ need for comprehensive and timely data and analytic reports; payment tailored to providers’ readiness for these contracts; and measurement of quality across multiple years and care settings.},

However, the collection of detailed clinical information about reported cases, which is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, to understand transmission, or to determine disease-related risk factors, is still heavily dependent on manual processes. The increasing prevalence and functionality of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the United States present important opportunities to advance public health surveillance. EHR data have the potential to further increase the breadth, detail, timeliness, and completeness of public health surveillance and thereby provide better data to guide public health interventions. EHRs also provide a unique opportunity to expand the role and vision of current surveillance efforts and to help bridge the gap between public health practice and clinical medicine.},

We contrast the history of speculative design that is often cited in HCI papers from the mid 2000s onward that frames speculative design as a critical methodological intervention in HCI linked to radical art practice and critical theory, with the history of how speculative design was introduced to HCI publications through corporate design research initiatives from the RED group at Xerox PARC. Our argument is that third wave, critically oriented, speculative design “works” in HCI because it is highly compatible with other forms of conventional corporate speculation (e.g. concept videos and scenario planning). This reading of speculative design re-centers the “criticality” from the method itself to its ability to advance agendas that challenge dominant practices in technology design. We will look at how practitioners trade on the rhetorical ambiguity of future oriented design practices to introduce these ideas in contexts where they may not otherwise have much purchase. Our chapter concludes with a call for critically oriented practitioners in this space to share their experiences navigating speculative design ambiguity and to document the disciplinary history of the method’s development.},

Drawing on fieldwork in a Danish public sector organisation, the paper identifies and conceptualizes the speculative data work performed around processes of digitalization and the push to become data-driven. The speculative dashboard is proposed as a design concept and opportunity for design, using practices from speculative design and research to facilitate speculation about data–its sources, visualizations, practices and infrastructures. It does so by hacking the ‘genre’ of the business intelligence data dashboard, and using it as a framework for the juxtaposition of different kinds of data, facilitating and encouraging speculation on alternative visions for data types and use. The paper contributes an empirical study of organizational use of and attitudes towards data, informing a novel design method and concept for co-speculating on alternative visions of and for organizational data.

	abstract = {The emergence of consumer-purchased monitoring devices in shared, intimate spaces presents new challenges to privacy and its protection. Web-enabled video cameras, which allow family members to monitor one another in the name of care, are among the most prevalent technologies in this vein. These cameras have recently gained traction for remote monitoring of vulnerable relatives in nursing homes, where they are intended to detect and deter abuse and neglect in residents’ rooms. But in so doing, they can create new privacy vulnerabilities — for residents (many of whom have dementia and lack capacity for consent), frontline care workers, roommates in shared rooms, and others. State policymakers are grappling with these issues as they craft laws governing electronic monitoring in these complex public/private spaces, in which they must balance among competing — and sometimes irreconcilable — privacy and security interests.This paper presents a comparative analysis of six state regimes that regulate the use of monitoring systems in nursing home resident rooms. We find that states attempt to protect privacy through a variety of interlocking privacy constraints: social, technical, and institutional safeguards that restrict how monitoring devices can be introduced and operated. Further, we map key relationships within which stakeholders hold specific privacy interests vis-à-vis one another, and describe how legal regimes do (and do not) address such interests. We consider implications for how privacy is conceptualized and regulated in multi-relational social contexts, in which the privacy and security interests of certain stakeholders necessarily impact the privacy experiences of others.},

In order to understand the invisible work aides perform and its relationship to technology design, we interviewed 13 aides employed by home care agencies in New York City. These aides shared examples that demonstrated the intertwined nature of both types of invisible work (i.e., emotions- and systems-based) and expanded the sociological mechanisms of invisibility (i.e., sociocultural, sociolegal, sociospatial) to include the sociotechnical. Through these findings, we investigate the opportunities, tensions, and challenges that could inform the design of tools created for these important, but often overlooked, frontline caregivers.},

These systemic or "wicked" problems present challenges for design practice due to their scope, scale, complexity, and political nature. In this paper, we develop a social justice orientation to designing for such challenges. We highlight a breadth of design strategies that target the goals of social justice along six dimensions -- transformation, recognition, reciprocity, enablement, distribution, and accountability -- and elaborate three commitments necessary to developing a social justice oriented design practice -- a commitment to conflict, a commitment to reflexivity, and a commitment to personal ethics and politics. Although there are no easy solutions to systemic social issues, a social justice orientation provides one way to foster an engagement with the thorny political issues that are increasingly acknowledged as crucial to a field that is not just about technological possibility, but also about political responsibility.},

To elicit the perspectives of aides and their supervisors on how technology interventions might contribute to moving aides towards a better future, we created a design provocation that centers aides' needs and suggests more equitable roles for them within the home care ecosystem. Findings from design sessions with 16 aides, nurses, and aide coordinators illuminate the ethical and pragmatic dilemmas inherent in this complex ecosystem, and show that designing technology for equity requires attention to structural problems in addition to workers' stated needs. We analyze our findings through the lens of social justice-oriented interaction design, and discuss how our work extends key strategies within this framework.},

As a result, functional outcomes might offer depression researchers more critical feedback and better guidance when studying depression treatment outcomes. The paper presents a case for the necessity of both functional and symptom outcomes in depression treatment research by addressing three aims—1) review the research relating symptoms and functioning, 2) provide a rationale for measuring both outcomes, and 3) discuss potential artifacts in measuring functional outcomes. The three aims are supported by an empirical review of the treatment outcome and epidemiological literatures.},

While many antidepressant medications are available, few clinical guidelines support choosing among them.

We use an iterative, co-design process to investigate clinicians’ perceptions of using DSTs in antidepressant treatment decisions. We identify ways in which DSTs need to engage with the healthcare sociotechnical system, including clinical processes, patient preferences, resource constraints, and domain knowledge. Our results suggest that clinical DSTs should be designed as multi-user systems that support patient-provider collaboration and offer on-demand explanations that address discrepancies between predictions and current standards of care. Through this work, we demonstrate how current trends in explainable AI may be inappropriate for clinical environments and consider paths towards designing these tools for real-world medical systems.},

	abstract = {Aims:
The study sought to 1) characterize the types and frequency of session-level adaptations made to multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) and 2) identify therapist-, client- and session-level predictors of adaptations.

Method:
Within the community implementation of multiple EBPs, 103 community mental health therapists reported on 731 therapy sessions for 280 clients. Therapists indicated whether they adapted EBPs in specific sessions and described adaptations in open-ended responses. Responses were coded using the Augmenting and Reducing adaptations framework. Multilevel logistic regression analyses examined predictors of Augmenting and Reducing adaptations.

Results:
Therapists reported making adaptations in 59\% of sessions. Augmenting adaptations were reported more frequently than Reducing adaptations. Multilevel models showed that greater therapist openness to EBPs, younger child age, and presenting problems were associated with Augmenting adaptations. Child presenting problem of externalizing problems predicted fewer Reducing adaptations compared to internalizing problems.

Conclusion:
This study extends the growing research examining adaptations within the context of system-driven implementation of multiple EBPs by applying the Augmenting and Reducing adaptation framework to the session-level.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent research has emphasized the need for accessing information about patients to augment mental health patients’ verbal reports in clinical settings. Although it has not been introduced in clinical settings, computational linguistic analysis on social media has proved it can infer mental health attributes, implying a potential use as collateral information at the point of care. To realize this potential and make social media insights actionable to clinical decision making, the gaps between computational linguistic analysis on social media and the current work practices of mental health clinicians must be bridged.

Objective
This study aimed to identify information derived from patients’ social media data that can benefit clinicians and to develop a set of design implications, via a series of low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes, on how to deliver the information at the point of care.

Methods
A team of clinical researchers and human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers conducted a long-term co-design activity for over 6 months. The needs-affordances analysis framework was used to refine the clinicians’ potential needs, which can be supported by patients’ social media data. On the basis of those identified needs, the HCI researchers iteratively created 3 different lo-fi prototypes. The prototypes were shared with both groups of researchers via a videoconferencing software for discussion and feedback. During the remote meetings, potential clinical utility, potential use of the different prototypes in a treatment setting, and areas of improvement were discussed.

Results
Our first prototype was a card-type interface that supported treatment goal tracking. Each card included attribute levels: depression, anxiety, social activities, alcohol, and drug use. This version confirmed what types of information are helpful but revealed the need for a glanceable dashboard that highlights the trends of these information. As a result, we then developed the second prototype, an interface that shows the clinical state and trend. We found that focusing more on the changes since the last visit without visual representation can be more compatible with clinicians’ work practices. In addition, the second phase of needs-affordances analysis identified 3 categories of information relevant to patients with schizophrenia: symptoms related to psychosis, symptoms related to mood and anxiety, and social functioning. Finally, we developed the third prototype, a clinical summary dashboard that showed changes from the last visit in plain texts and contrasting colors.

Conclusions
This exploratory co-design research confirmed that mental health attributes inferred from patients’ social media data can be useful for clinicians, although it also revealed a gap between computational social media analyses and clinicians’ expectations and conceptualizations of patients’ mental health states. In summary, the iterative co-design process crystallized design directions for the future interface, including how we can organize and provide symptom-related information in a way that minimizes the clinicians’ workloads.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure support grows.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study.
RESULTS: A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0\% attrition from the test group and less than 1\% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70\% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51\%), and white (32/74, 41\%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.

	abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

Some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care. However, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected. An integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to COVID but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic. A series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID19. The recommendations refer to low, middle and high resource settings as capabilities vary greatly between countries and within countries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-generated health data (PGHD) have been largely collected through mobile health (mHealth) apps and wearable devices. PGHD can be especially helpful in mental health, as patients' illness history and symptom narratives are vital to developing diagnoses and treatment plans. However, the extent to which clinicians use mental health-related PGHD is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: A mixed methods study was conducted to understand clinicians' perspectives on PGHD and current mental health apps. This approach uses information gathered from semistructured interviews, workflow analysis, and user-written mental health app reviews to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the current workflow of mental health practice and how are PGHD integrated into this workflow, (2) what are clinicians' perspectives on PGHD and how do they choose mobile apps for their patients, (3) and what are the features of current mobile apps in terms of interpreting and sharing PGHD?
METHODS: The study consists of semistructured interviews with 12 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists from a large academic hospital. These interviews were thematically and qualitatively analyzed for common themes and workflow elements. User-posted reviews of 56 sleep and mood tracking apps were analyzed to understand app features in comparison with the information gathered from interviews.
RESULTS: The results showed that PGHD have been part of the workflow, but its integration and use are not optimized. Mental health clinicians supported the use of PGHD but had concerns regarding data reliability and accuracy. They also identified challenges in selecting suitable apps for their patients. From the app review, it was discovered that mHealth apps had limited features to support personalization and collaborative care as well as data interpretation and sharing.
CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates clinicians' perspectives on PGHD use and explored existing app features using the app review data in the mental health setting. A total of 3 design guidelines were generated: (1) improve data interpretation and sharing mechanisms, (2) consider clinical workflow and electronic health record integration, and (3) support personalized and collaborative care. More research is needed to demonstrate the best practices of PGHD use and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving patient outcomes.},

We argue that the relationship between evidence and practice cannot be that of supplying a basis, at least not if that notion is understood in any strict logical or methodological sense. Other factors have to be taken account of in addition to evidence and their relation to the evidence has to be explained. Following others, we advocate a more comprehensive view of practice as informed by evidence and theory. Evidence-informed practice (EIP) should be understood as excluding non-scientific prejudices and superstitions, but also as leaving ample room for clinical experience as well as the constructive and imaginative judgements of practitioners and clients who are in constant interaction and dialogue with one another. Under the EIP model, there is no need for the five-steps procedure of the EBP model, but only that practitioners will become knowledgeable of a wide rang of sources—empirical studies, case studies and clinical insights—and use them in creative ways throughout the intervention process.},

Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature was conducted utilizing keywords “healthcare’’, “service quality’’, “measurement models”, “SERVQUAL”, “SERVPERF”, “HEALTHQUAL”, “PubHosQual” and “HospitalQual”. These investigations were selected from the “Emerald’’, “ABI/Inform”, “ScienceDirect” and “EBSCOhost” databases. A range of studies used in the makeup of the healthcare quality-measurement model for a 36 years period (1979 to 2015) were examined in an exhaustive survey of the literature. Of 137 studies reviewed, 74 studies were selected for analysis. Findings As yet, no consensus has been reached among scholars on the definition and indicators and factors of the quality of the healthcare services. Moreover, most of the current models are of Western origin and incongruent with the cultural and economic contexts of developing countries. The previous studies create scales resembling the generic measures of service quality, which may not be completely appropriate for assessing the perceived quality of healthcare services. Furthermore, previous studies were too narrow, overemphasizing the quality of healthcare only as far as the functional aspect of the services were concerned and paying too little attention to the technical aspects, using the experience of healthcare providers. These results have much room for failures. This is therefore advising healthcare organizations that need to develop their own models for measuring the quality of their services. Originality/value Generic models no longer suffice in measuring the quality of healthcare services. Developing countries should try and develop their own models for measuring the quality of healthcare services.},

Researchers and policy-makers are increasingly seeking to develop more systematic ways of measuring and benchmarking quality of care of different providers. Quality of care is now systematically reported as part of overall health system performance reports in many countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands, and most Nordic countries. At the same time, international efforts in comparing and benchmarking quality of care across countries are mounting. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the EU Commission have both expanded their efforts at assessing and comparing healthcare quality internationally (Carinci et al., 2015; EC, 2016). Furthermore, a growing focus on value-based healthcare (Porter, 2010) has sparked renewed interest in the standardization of measurement of outcomes (ICHOM, 2019), and notably the measurement of patient-reported outcomes has gained momentum (OECD, 2019).},

While some descriptions conflate value-based health care and cost reduction, quality improvement, or patient satisfaction, those efforts—while important—are not the same as value, which focuses primarily on improving patient health outcomes. A decade of research into organizations that have achieved better outcomes while often lowering costs suggests a strategic framework for value-based health care implementation that starts with identifying and understanding a segment of patients whose health and related circumstances create a consistent set of needs. An interdisciplinary team of caregivers then comes together to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to address those needs. The team measures the health outcomes and costs of its care for each patient and uses that information to drive ongoing improvements. Care provided in this way aligns delivery with how patients experience their health and reconnects clinicians to their purpose as healers. It also asks physicians to think differently about their role within the larger care team and about the services that team provides. The authors suggest medical schools should incorporate education on the principles and implementation of value-based health care throughout the undergraduate medical curriculum to prepare their graduates to lead the transformation to value-based health care as they enter the physician workforce.},

          Value-based initiatives are growing in importance as strategic models of healthcare management, prompting the need for an in-depth exploration of their outcome measures. This systematic review aimed to identify measures that are being used in the application of the value agenda. Multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched. Eligible studies reported various implementations of value-based healthcare initiatives. A qualitative approach was used to analyze their outcome measurements. Outcomes were classified according to a tier-level hierarchy. In a radar chart, we compared literature to cases from Harvard Business Publishing. The value agenda effect reported was described in terms of its impact on each domain of the value equation. A total of 7,195 records were retrieved; 47 studies were included. Forty studies used electronic health record systems for data origin. Only 16 used patient-reported outcome surveys to cover outcome tiers that are important to patients, and 3 reported outcomes to all 6 levels of our outcome measures hierarchy. A considerable proportion of the studies (36\%) reported results that contributed to value-based financial outcomes focused on cost savings. However, a gap remains in measuring outcomes that matter to patients. A more complete application of the value agenda by health organizations requires advances in technology and culture change management.},

Under the FFS paradigm, health-care expenditures experienced an exponential rise. In response, the managed care and capitation models of health-care delivery were developed. However, changes in Medicare reimbursement, along with an increasing volume of orthopaedic procedures and escalating implant costs, call into question the cost-effectiveness of this service line. The success of the Medicare Acute Care Episode (ACE) Demonstration Project proved the feasibility of value-based care and ushered in a new era of bundled payment initiatives.},

Instrumenting frontline clinical services to collect and steward data might mitigate the exploitation inherent to data collection---with attention to how subjects can meaningfully participate in stewardship. We explore participatory data stewardship in the context of clinical computer security for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV). Via semi-structured interviews with IPV support workers, we explore how data are produced within the IPV care ecosystem at the Clinic to End Tech Abuse (CETA). We then conduct design provocations with clients of IPV services and their support workers, exploring possibilities for participatory data mechanisms like open records and dynamic consent. We find participation in data stewardship may benefit clients through improved agency, self-reflection, and control of self-narrative, and that incurred burdens may be alleviated by enlisting trusted stewards. We close with future work for CSCW interrogating how knowledge of digital-safety harms can and should be produced from clinical encounters, towards more equitable ways of knowing.},

At this juncture, it is unclear if those who are sensed can find these systems acceptable. We conducted scenario-based interviews of 28 information workers to highlight their perspectives as data subjects in PSAI. We unpack their expectations using the Contextual Integrity framework of privacy and information gathering. Participants described appropriateness of PSAI based on its impact on job consequences, work-life boundaries, and preservation of flexibility. They perceived that PSAI inferences could be shared with selected stakeholders if they could negotiate the algorithmic inferences. Our findings help envision worker-centric approaches to implementing PSAI as an empowering tool in the future of work.},

	abstract = {Mental health clinical practice guidelines have proliferated, but there is little evidence regarding the degree to which they are actually implemented in clinical practice. The goal of this study was to locate and review all peer-reviewed reports published through 2000 that provide quantitative information on rates of adherence to specific mental health guidelines. A literature search yielded 41 pertinent studies. These studies were of three types: 26 were cross-sectional investigations performed after the release of guidelines, six were conducted before and after release of guidelines without any specific intervention (pre/post), and nine involved a controlled trial of a specific intervention. Only 37\% were conducted in the mental health specialty sector. Adequate adherence was found in 27\% of the cross-sectional and pre/post studies but in 67\% of the controlled trials. Successful interventions tended to be complex, involving system redesign or additional resources. Only six of 13 investigations (46\%) that also measured patient outcome found that better outcome was associated with greater guideline adherence. Several studies showed that after cessation of interventions, adherence rates returned to preintervention levels. Thus, evidence indicates that guideline adherence is not high without specific intervention, but that certain interventions (typically multifaceted and resource-intensive ones) improve adherence. However, the public health challenge is to design and implement interventions that are sustainable in general clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Millions of Americans today receive health care for mental or substance-use problems and illnesses. These conditions are the leading cause of combined disability and death among women and the second highest among men. Effective treatments exist and continually improve. However, as with general health care, deficiencies in care delivery prevent many from receiving appropriate treatments. That situation has serious consequences — for people who have the conditions; for their loved ones; for the workplace; for the education, welfare, and justice systems; and for the nation as a whole. A previous Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2001), put forth a strategy for improving health care overall — a strategy that has attained considerable traction in the United States and other countries. However, health care for mental and substance-use conditions has a number of distinctive characteristics, such as the greater use of coercion into treatment, separate care delivery systems, a less developed quality measurement infrastructure, and a differently structured marketplace. These and other differences raised questions about whether the Quality Chasm approach is applicable to health care for mental and substance-use conditions and, if so, how it should be applied. This new report examines those differences, finds that the Quality Chasm framework can be applied to health care for mental and substance-use conditions, and describes a multifaceted and comprehensive strategy for doing so and thereby ensuring that: Individual patient preferences, needs, and values prevail in the face of residual stigma, discrimination, and coercion into treatment; The necessary infrastructure exists to produce scientific evidence more quickly and promote its application in patient care; Multiple providers' care of the same patient is coordinated; Emerging information technology related to health care benefits people with mental or substance-use problems and illnesses; The health care workforce has the education, training, and capacity to deliver high-quality care for mental and substance-use conditions; Government programs, employers, and other group purchasers of health care for mental and substance-use conditions use their dollars in ways that support the delivery of high-quality care; Research funds are used to support studies that have direct clinical and policy relevance and that are focused on discovering and testing therapeutic advances. The strategy addresses issues pertaining to health care for both mental and substance-use conditions and the essential role of health care for both conditions in improving overall health and health care. In so doing, it details the actions required to achieve those ends — actions required of clinicians; health care organizations; health plans; purchasers; state, local, and federal governments; and all parties involved in health care for mental and substance-use conditions.},

	abstract = {Multiple barriers exist to accessing behavioral health care, and several are related to payment. The national shortage of behavioral health providers is exacerbated by their not joining health insurance networks, often shifting the cost of treatment to patients. In the face of high out-of-network expenses, deductibles, and copays, many insured patients forgo behavioral health treatment altogether. However, even when patients access care, health outcomes are not routinely measured, and there is reason to suspect that the quality of care is poor. To address these issues, value-based reimbursement for behavioral health care offers a sustainable pathway to increase payment for providers in return for improved population health outcomes and costs. This article describes a comprehensive collaborative effort between a payer and a health care technology and services organization to support behavioral health providers to enter into value-based care. This approach changes financial incentives to drive improvements in behavioral health care access and quality.},

            What makes for good mental health care? What are the barriers to good care and, when they can be overcome, what accounts for successful treatment? What does successful treatment and care, in fact, mean? Can they mean different things to different people? If so, how can we think about them in a practical way that is useful to patients, families, and clinicians? On the one hand, from work infields as various as neuroscience, clinical psychology, and anthropology, we are learning (and rediscovering) more and more about how the human mind works and the many ways that psychological suffering can be preempted and treated. On the other hand, in many ways, the mental health care system is either dysfunctional or working against what we know to be best for psychological and social flourishing-the disappearance, for example, of true “care” from medical and mental health care systems. In this essay, set against the background of diverse perspectives provided by the foregoing essays in this volume, we attempt to frame and address some of these basic questions, giving priority to practical, down-to-earth, lay, and professional considerations.},

Our main independent variables were physician specialty and year groupings (2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010).The percentage of psychiatrists who accepted private noncapitated insurance in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than the percentage of physicians in other specialties (55.3\% [95\% CI, 46.7\%-63.8\%] vs 88.7\% [86.4\%-90.7\%]; P \&lt; .001) and had declined by 17.0\% since 2005-2006. Similarly, the percentage of psychiatrists who accepted Medicare in 2009-2010 was significantly lower than that for other physicians (54.8\% [95\% CI, 46.6\%-62.7\%] vs 86.1\% [84.4\%-87.7\%]; P \&lt; .001) and had declined by 19.5\% since 2005-2006.

Psychiatrists in the Midwest were more likely to accept private noncapitated insurance (85.1\%) than those in the Northeast (48.5\%), South (43.0\%), or West (57.8\%) (P = .02).Acceptance rates for all types of insurance were significantly lower for psychiatrists than for physicians in other specialties.

Digital mental health services, such as those delivered by mobile phone or web-based platforms, offer the possibility of expanding the reach and accessibility of mental health care. To achieve this goal, digital mental health interventions and plans for their implementation must be designed with the end users in mind. In this Review, we describe the evidence base for digital mental health interventions across various diagnoses and treatment targets. Then, we explain the different formats for digital mental health intervention delivery, and offer considerations for their use across key age groups. We discuss the role that the COVID-19 pandemic has played in emphasizing the value of these interventions, and offer considerations for ensuring equity in access to digital mental health interventions among diverse populations. As healthcare providers continue to embrace the role that technology can play in broadening access to care, the design and implementation of digital mental healthcare solutions must be carefully considered to maximize their effectiveness and accessibility.},

	abstract = {The supply of psychiatrists in the United States is inadequate to address the unmet demand for mental health care. Psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) may fill the widening gap between supply of and demand for mental health specialists with prescribing privileges. Using Medicare claims for a 100 percent sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries (average age, sixty-one years) who had an office visit for either a psychiatrist or a PMHNP during the period 2011–19, we examined how the supply and use of psychiatrists and PMHNPs changed over time, and we compared their practice patterns. Psychiatrists and PMHNPs treated roughly comparable patient populations with similar services and prescriptions. From 2011 to 2019 the number of PMHNPs treating Medicare beneficiaries grew 162 percent, compared with a 6 percent relative decrease in the number of psychiatrists doing so. During the same period, total annual mental health office visits per 100 beneficiaries decreased 11.5 percent from 27.4 to 24.2, the net result of a 29.0 percent drop in psychiatrist visits being offset by a 111.3 percent increase in PMHNP visits. The proportion of all mental health prescriber visits provided by PMHNPs increased from 12.5 percent to 29.8 percent during 2011–19, exceeding 50 percent in rural, full-scope-of-practice regions. PMHNPs are a rapidly growing workforce that may be instrumental in improving mental health care access.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an elevated prevalence of mental health conditions and disrupted mental health care throughout the US.To examine mental health service use among US adults from January through December 2020.This cohort study used county-level service utilization data from a national US database of commercial medical claims from adults (age \&gt;18 years) from January 5 to December 21, 2020. All analyses were conducted in April and May 2021.Per-week use of mental health services per 10 000 beneficiaries was calculated for 5 psychiatric diagnostic categories: major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, adjustment disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Changes in service utilization rates following the declaration of a national public health emergency on March 13, 2020, were examined overall and by service modality (in-person vs telehealth), diagnostic category, patient sex, and age group.The study included 5 142 577 commercially insured adults. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with more than a 50\% decline in in-person mental health care service utilization rates. At baseline, there was a mean (SD) of 11.66 (118.00) weekly beneficiaries receiving services for MDD per 10 000 enrollees; this declined by 6.44 weekly beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees (β, –6.44; 95\% CI, –8.33 to –4.54). For other disorders, these rates were as follows: anxiety disorders (mean [SD] baseline, 12.24 [129.40] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, –5.28; 95\% CI, –7.50 to –3.05), bipolar disorder (mean [SD] baseline, 3.32 [60.39] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, –1.81; 95\% CI, –2.75 to –0.87), adjustment disorders (mean [SD] baseline, 12.14 [129.94] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, –6.78; 95\% CI, –8.51 to –5.04), and PTSD (mean [SD] baseline, 4.93 [114.23] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, –2.00; 95\% CI, –3.98 to –0.02). Over the same period, there was a 16- to 20-fold increase in telehealth service utilization; the rate of increase was lowest for bipolar disorder (mean [SD] baseline, 0.13 [16.72] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.76) and highest for anxiety disorders (mean [SD] baseline, 0.20 [9.28] beneficiaries per 10 000 enrollees; β, 9.12; 95\% CI, 7.32-10.92). When combining in-person and telehealth service utilization rates, an overall increase in care for MDD, anxiety, and adjustment disorders was observed over the period.In this cohort study of US adults, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a rapid increase in telehealth services for mental health conditions, offsetting a sharp decline in in-person care and generating overall higher service utilization rates for several mental health conditions compared with prepandemic levels.},

The objective of this scoping review is to understand the extent and type of existing mental health and psychosocial interventions aimed at addressing the mental health and psychosocial impacts of climate change. A scoping review methodology was followed. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 2022. Comprehensive gray literature search, including expert consultation, was conducted to identify interventions for which peer-reviewed academic literature may not yet be available. Data on intervention type, setting, climate stressor, mental health outcome, evaluation, and any other available details were extracted, and results were summarized narratively. Academic literature search identified 16 records and gray literature search identified a further 24 records. Altogether, 37 unique interventions or packages of interventions were identified. The interventions act at the levels of microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem through diverse mechanisms. While most interventions have not been formally evaluated, promising preliminary results support interventions in low- and middle-income-country settings disproportionately affected by climate disasters. Interventions from multidisciplinary fields are emerging to reduce psychological distress and enhance mental health and wellbeing in the context of climate change. This scoping review details existing evidence on the interventions and summarizes intervention gaps and lessons learned to inform continued intervention development and scale-up interventions.},

The use of sensor-captured patient-generated data (sPGD) has been gaining greater prominence in the assessment of physical health, but we have little understanding of the role that sPGD can play in mental health. To better understand the use of sPGD in mental health, we interviewed care providers in an intensive treatment program (ITP) for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. In this program, patients were given Fitbits for their own voluntary use. Providers identified a number of potential benefits from patients' Fitbit use, such as patient empowerment and opportunities to reinforce therapeutic progress through collaborative data review and interpretation. However, despite the promise of sensor data as offering an "objective" view into patients' health behavior and symptoms, the relationships between sPGD and therapeutic progress are often ambiguous. Given substantial subjectivity involved in interpreting data from commercial wearables in the context of mental health treatment, providers emphasized potential risks to their patients and were uncertain how to adjust their practice to effectively guide collaborative use of the FitBit and its sPGD. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing systems to leverage sPGD in mental health care.?},

As these tools develop, they invite inquiry into how they can be appropriately implemented towards improving workers' well-being. In this study, we explored this proposition through formative interviews followed by a design provocation centered around measuring burnout in a U.S. resident physician program. Residents and their supervising attending physicians were presented with medium-fidelity mockups of a dashboard providing behavioral data on residents' sleep, activity and time working; self-reported data on residents' levels of burnout; and a free text box where residents could further contextualize their well-being. Our findings uncover tensions around how best to measure workplace well-being, who within a workplace is accountable for worker stress, and how the introduction of such tools remakes the boundaries of appropriate information flows between worker and workplace. We conclude by charting future work confronting these tensions, to ensure personal sensing is leveraged to truly improve worker well-being.},

The author investigates the development of AI ethics using the case of digital psychiatry, a field that uses machine learning to study mental illness and provide mental health care. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews, the author analyzes how digital psychiatry researchers become “moral entrepreneurs,” actors who wield their social influence to define ethical conduct, through two practices. First, researchers engage in moral discovery, identifying gaps in regulation as opportunities to articulate ethical standards. Second, researchers engage in moral enclosure, specifying a community of people licensed to do moral regulation. With these techniques, digital psychiatry researchers demonstrate ethical innovation is essential to their professional identity. Yet ultimately, the author demonstrates how moral entrepreneurship erects barriers to participation in ethical decision making and constrains the focus of ethical consideration.},

In this paper, we discuss temporality as a factor in the design of health information technology. We define a temporal spectrum ranging from time-critical services that benefit from standardization to long-term services that require more flexibility. We provide empirical evidence from fieldwork that we performed in organizations providing long-term behavioral and mental health services for children. Our fieldwork in this context complements and provides contrasts to previous CSCW studies performed in time-critical hospital settings. Current literature shows a bias toward standardized records and routines in the implementation of health information technology, a policy that may not be appropriate for long-term health services. We discuss how the design of information systems should vary based on temporal factors.},

CSCW and HCI researchers have delved into various facets of collaboration in AI research; however, previous research neglects the individuals who both produce the data and will be most impacted by the resulting technologies, such as patients. This study examines how interdisciplinary researchers and mental health patients who donate their data for AI research collaborate and how we can improve human-centeredness in mental health AI research. We interviewed patient participants, AI researchers, and clinical researchers in a federally funded mental health AI research project. We used the concept of boundary objects to understand stakeholder collaboration. Our findings reveal that the social media data provided by patient participants functioned as boundary objects that facilitated stakeholder collaboration. Although the collaboration appeared to be successful, we argue that building consensus, or understanding each other's perspectives, can improve the human-centeredness of mental health AI research. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for human-centered mental health AI research, working with data donors as domain experts, making invisible work visible, and privacy implications.},

Our case study of applying a UCD process revealed that even without deploying a JITAI, UCD could uncover user interactions that inform critical design decisions of a JITAI's components. We reflect on our experiences engaging in a user-centered JITAI design process and urge the broader human-computer interaction (HCI) community to devise concrete design guidelines for JITAIs. We take the first step toward that goal by proposing a checklist of key design considerations for future JITAIs. Together, this case study contributes insights on applying UCD to the design of all components of a JITAI, which can help capture users' needs and provide actionable interventions.},

First-line treatments include specific psychotherapies and antidepressant medications. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported cognitive therapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and mindfulness-based psychotherapy all had at least medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over usual care without psychotherapy (standardized mean difference [SMD] ranging from 0.50 [95\% CI, 0.20-0.81] to 0.73 [95\% CI, 0.52-0.95]). A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported 21 antidepressant medications all had small- to medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over placebo (SMD ranging from 0.23 [95\% CI, 0.19-0.28] for fluoxetine to 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.41-0.55] for amitriptyline). Psychotherapy combined with antidepressant medication may be preferred, especially for more severe or chronic depression. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported greater symptom improvement with combined treatment than with psychotherapy alone (SMD, 0.30 [95\% CI, 0.14-0.45]) or medication alone (SMD, 0.33 [95\% CI, 0.20-0.47]). When initial antidepressant medication is not effective, second-line medication treatment includes changing antidepressant medication, adding a second antidepressant, or augmenting with a nonantidepressant medication, which have approximately equal likelihood of success based on a network meta-analysis. Collaborative care programs, including systematic follow-up and outcome assessment, improve treatment effectiveness, with 1 meta-analysis reporting significantly greater symptom improvement compared with usual care (SMD, 0.42 [95\% CI, 0.23-0.61]).Effective first-line depression treatments include specific forms of psychotherapy and more than 20 antidepressant medications. Close monitoring significantly improves the likelihood of treatment success.},

	abstract = {Background
Remote measurement technologies, such as smartphones and wearable devices, can improve treatment outcomes for depression through enhanced illness characterization and monitoring. However, little is known about digital outcomes that are clinically meaningful to patients and clinicians. Moreover, if these technologies are to be successfully implemented within treatment, stakeholders’ views on the barriers to and facilitators of their implementation in treatment must be considered.

Objective
This study aims to identify clinically meaningful targets for digital health research in depression and explore attitudes toward their implementation in psychological services.

Methods
A grounded theory approach was used on qualitative data from 3 focus groups of patients with a current diagnosis of depression and clinicians with {\textgreater}6 months of experience with delivering psychotherapy (N=22).

Results
Emerging themes on clinical targets fell into the following two main categories: promoters and markers of change. The former are behaviors that participants engage in to promote mental health, and the latter signal a change in mood. These themes were further subdivided into external changes (changes in behavior) or internal changes (changes in thoughts or feelings) and mapped with potential digital sensors. The following six implementation acceptability themes emerged: technology-related factors, information and data management, emotional support, cognitive support, increased self-awareness, and clinical utility.

Conclusions
The promoters versus markers of change differentiation have implications for a causal model of digital phenotyping in depression, which this paper presents. Internal versus external subdivisions are helpful in determining which factors are more susceptible to being measured by using active versus passive methods. The implications for implementation within psychotherapy are discussed with regard to treatment effectiveness, service provision, and patient and clinician experience.},

To address this, we present the Clinician Homework Review (CHR), a unique measure and interface that displays similarity ratings calculated using sensor-captured patient-generated data (sPGD; i.e. heart rate, phone usage, ambient noise, and physical activity) for therapeutic exercises outside of the clinical setting within the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment context. Through concept testing sessions with 10 clinicians, we examine how sPGD can be leveraged to measure and investigate what contributes to patient performance in a therapeutic exercise. We also share in-depth information regarding clinician interpretation and planned use of data displayed by CHR in clinical sessions with patients. We frame our results in the context of situated objectivity and propose the notion of "perceived reference weight," which describes the significance attributed to contextualized data. In doing so, we support clinical decision-making in PTSD therapy.},

In this Perspective, we review the foundations of LLMs. We then explain how the way that LLMs are constructed enables them to effectively generate human-like linguistic output without the ability to think or feel like a human. We argue that although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready for many of the most transformative psychological applications — but further research and development may enable such use. Next, we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for investments that could help to address these concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of LLM-powered research is equitable.},

	abstract = {Introduction The learning health system (LHS) concept represents a bold innovation that combines organizational learning, strategic analysis of patient data, stakeholder engagement and the systematic translation of research into practice – all in service of improving the quality of health care delivered across the organization. This innovation has been diffused and widely adopted by healthcare organizations over the past 15 years, but academic health centers (AHCs) have been slower on the uptake. The irony is that AHCs have the resources (e.g., trained researchers, sophisticated clinical data systems, informatics infrastructure) that are necessary to do the highest-quality and most impactful LHS work. Methods Based on a review of publications describing how AHCs have implemented LHS work, as well as the authors' direct experience promoting the adoption of the LHS paradigm at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist (AHWFB), we:identify a set of factors that have inhibited broader adoption of the LHS paradigm among AHCs; distinguish between the forms of LHS work that are consistent and inconsistent with the mission of AHCs; and offer recommendations for broader adoption and fuller implementation of the LHS paradigm. Results The LHS paradigm represents an expansion of the scientific paradigm which serves as the foundation of research enterprise within AHCs. Both paradigms value rigorous studies of new treatments and practices, including pragmatic clinical trials. The LHS paradigm also places a high value on quality improvement studies, organizational learning, and the translation of research findings into improved patient care and operations within the local health system. The two paradigms differ on the origin of the research question, i.e., a pressing patient-care issue facing the health system versus the investigator's own research interests. Academic researchers have been disincentivized from pursuing at least some forms of LHS research. However, a growing number of AHCs are finding ways to integrate the LHS paradigm into their research enterprise, either by providing research faculty with institutional funding to cover their effort on studies that address the health system's priority issues, or by establishing an institute dedicated to LHS research. Conclusions The LHS paradigm is a disruptive intervention for AHCs, one that was initially resisted but is increasingly being embraced. AHCs are developing strategies for conducting LHS research, typically in parallel to the more traditional biomedical science that is core to academic medicine. Full implementation of the LHS paradigm will require further alignment between LHS and science, including a shift in the criteria for promotion and tenure to support those researchers who choose to focus on the pressing issues facing the health system.},

	abstract = {A dynamic treatment regime (DTR) consists of a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of intervention, that dictates how to determine the treatment assignment to patients based on evolving treatments and covariates’ history. These regimes are particularly effective for managing chronic disorders and is arguably one of the critical ingredients underlying more personalized decision-making systems. All reinforcement learning algorithms for finding the optimal DTR in online settings will suffer O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbar}D\_\{X, S\}{\textbar}T\}) regret on some environments, where T is the number of experiments, and D\_\{X, S\} is the domains of treatments X and covariates S. This implies T = O ({\textbar}D\_\{X, S\}{\textbar}) trials to generate an optimal DTR. In many applications, domains of X and S could be so enormous that the time required to ensure appropriate learning may be unattainable. We show that, if the causal diagram of the underlying environment is provided, one could achieve regret that is exponentially smaller than D\_\{X, S\}. In particular, we develop two online algorithms that satisfy such regret bounds by exploiting the causal structure underlying the DTR; one is based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU-DTR), and the other uses the posterior sampling learning (PS-DTR). Finally, we introduce efficient methods to accelerate these online learning procedures by leveraging the abundant, yet biased observational (non-experimental) data.},

Traditional score-based casual discovery methods rely on various local heuristics to search for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) according to a predefined score function. While these methods, e.g., greedy equivalence search, may have attractive results with infinite samples and certain model assumptions, they are usually less satisfactory in practice due to finite data and possible violation of assumptions. Motivated by recent advances in neural combinatorial optimization, we propose to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to search for the DAG with the best scoring. Our encoder-decoder model takes observable data as input and generates graph adjacency matrices that are used to compute rewards. The reward incorporates both the predefined score function and two penalty terms for enforcing acyclicity. In contrast with typical RL applications where the goal is to learn a policy, we use RL as a search strategy and our final output would be the graph, among all graphs generated during training, that achieves the best reward. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and show that the proposed approach not only has an improved search ability but also allows a flexible score function under the acyclicity constraint.},

	abstract = {AI tools intend to transform mental healthcare by providing remote estimates of depression risk using behavioral data collected by sensors embedded in smartphones. While these tools accurately predict elevated depression symptoms in small, homogenous populations, recent studies show that these tools are less accurate in larger, more diverse populations. In this work, we show that accuracy is reduced because sensed-behaviors are unreliable predictors of depression across individuals: sensed-behaviors that predict depression risk are inconsistent across demographic and socioeconomic subgroups. We first identified subgroups where a developed AI tool underperformed by measuring algorithmic bias, where subgroups with depression were incorrectly predicted to be at lower risk than healthier subgroups. We then found inconsistencies between sensed-behaviors predictive of depression across these subgroups. Our findings suggest that researchers developing AI tools predicting mental health from sensed-behaviors should think critically about the generalizability of these tools, and consider tailored solutions for targeted populations.},

	abstract = {Background: Sensors embedded in smartphones allow for the passive momentary quantification of people’s states in the context of their daily lives in real time. Such data could be useful for alleviating the burden of ecological momentary assessments and increasing utility in clinical assessments. Despite existing research on using passive sensor data to assess participants’ moment-to-moment states and activity levels, only limited research has investigated temporally linking sensor assessment and self-reported assessment to further integrate the 2 methodologies.
Objective: We investigated whether sparse movement-related sensor data can be used to train machine learning models that are able to infer states of individuals’ work-related rumination, fatigue, mood, arousal, life engagement, and sleep quality. Sensor data were only collected while the participants filled out the questionnaires on their smartphones.
Methods: We trained personalized machine learning models on data from employees (N=158) who participated in a 3-week ecological momentary assessment study.
Results: The results suggested that passive smartphone sensor data paired with personalized machine learning models can be used to infer individuals’ self-reported states at later measurement occasions. The mean R2 was approximately 0.31 (SD 0.29), and more than half of the participants (119/158, 75.3\%) had an R2 of ≥0.18. Accuracy was only slightly attenuated compared with earlier studies and ranged from 38.41\% to 51.38\%.
Conclusions: Personalized machine learning models and temporally linked passive sensing data have the capability to infer a sizable proportion of variance in individuals’ daily self-reported states. Further research is needed to investigate factors that affect the accuracy and reliability of the inference.},

	abstract = {Prior research has recently shown that passively collected sensor data collected within the contexts of persons daily lives via smartphones and wearable sensors can distinguish those with major depressive disorder (MDD) from controls, predict MDD severity, and predict changes in MDD severity across days and weeks. Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

Thus, this study aimed to explore the utility of wrist-worn actigraphy data in combination with machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques to detect MDD using a commonly used screening method: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Participants (N = 8,378; MDD Screening = 766 participants) completed the and wore Actigraph GT3X+ for one week as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Leveraging minute-level, actigraphy data, we evaluated the efficacy of two commonly used ML approaches and identified actigraphy-derived biomarkers indicative of MDD. We employed two ML modeling strategies: (1) a traditional ML approach with theory-driven feature derivation, and (2) a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach, coupled with gramian angular field transformation. Findings revealed movement-related features to be the most influential in the traditional ML approach and nighttime movement to be the most influential in the CNN approach for detecting MDD.

	abstract = {Background: Wrist-worn smart watches and fitness monitors (ie, wearables) have become widely adopted by consumers and are gaining increased attention from researchers for their potential contribution to naturalistic digital measurement of health in a scalable, mobile, and unobtrusive way. Various studies have examined the accuracy of these devices in controlled laboratory settings (eg, treadmill and stationary bike); however, no studies have investigated the heart rate accuracy of wearables during a continuous and ecologically valid 24-hour period of actual consumer device use conditions. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the heart rate accuracy of 2 popular wearable devices, the Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2, as compared with the gold standard reference method, an ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), during consumer device use conditions in an individual. Data were collected across 5 daily conditions, including sitting, walking, running, activities of daily living (ADL; eg, chores, brushing teeth), and sleeping. Methods: One participant, (first author; 29-year-old Caucasian male) completed a 24-hour ecologically valid protocol by wearing 2 popular wrist wearable devices (Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2). In addition, an ambulatory ECG (Vrije Universiteit Ambulatory Monitoring System) was used as the gold standard reference method, which resulted in the collection of 102,740 individual heartbeats. A single-subject design was used to keep all variables constant except for wearable devices while providing a rapid response design to provide initial assessment of wearable accuracy for allowing the research cycle to keep pace with technological advancements. Accuracy of these devices compared with the gold standard ECG was assessed using mean error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percent error. These data were supplemented with Bland-Altman analyses and concordance class correlation to assess agreement between devices. Results: The Apple Watch 3 and Fitbit Charge 2 were generally highly accurate across the 24-hour condition. Specifically, the Apple Watch 3 had a mean difference of −1.80 beats per minute (bpm), a mean absolute error percent of 5.86\%, and a mean agreement of 95\% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. The Fitbit Charge 2 had a mean difference of −3.47 bpm, a mean absolute error of 5.96\%, and a mean agreement of 91\% when compared with the ECG across 24 hours. These findings varied by condition. Conclusions: The Apple Watch 3 and the Fitbit Charge 2 provided acceptable heart rate accuracy ({\textless}±10\%) across the 24 hour and during each activity, except for the Apple Watch 3 during the daily activities condition. Overall, these findings provide preliminary support that these devices appear to be useful for implementing ambulatory measurement of cardiac activity in research studies, especially those where the specific advantages of these methods (eg, scalability, low participant burden) are particularly suited to the population or research question.

	abstract = {Background: Wearable sleep monitors are of high interest to consumers and researchers because of their ability to provide estimation of sleep patterns in free-living conditions in a cost-efficient way.
Objective: We conducted a systematic review of publications reporting on the performance of wristband Fitbit models in assessing sleep parameters and stages.
Methods: In adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we comprehensively searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases using the keyword Fitbit to identify relevant publications meeting predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results: The search yielded 3085 candidate articles. After eliminating duplicates and in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 articles qualified for systematic review, with 8 providing quantitative data for meta-analysis. In reference to polysomnography (PSG), nonsleep-staging Fitbit models tended to overestimate total sleep time (TST; range from approximately 7 to 67 mins; effect size=-0.51, P\&lt;.001; heterogenicity: I2=8.8\%, P=.36) and sleep efficiency (SE; range from approximately 2\% to 15\%; effect size=-0.74, P\&lt;.001; heterogenicity: I2=24.0\%, P=.25), and underestimate wake after sleep onset (WASO; range from approximately 6 to 44 mins; effect size=0.60, P\&lt;.001; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92) and there was no significant difference in sleep onset latency (SOL; P=.37; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92). In reference to PSG, nonsleep-staging Fitbit models correctly identified sleep epochs with accuracy values between 0.81 and 0.91, sensitivity values between 0.87 and 0.99, and specificity values between 0.10 and 0.52. Recent-generation Fitbit models that collectively utilize heart rate variability and body movement to assess sleep stages performed better than early-generation nonsleep-staging ones that utilize only body movement. Sleep-staging Fitbit models, in comparison to PSG, showed no significant difference in measured values of WASO (P=.25; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.92), TST (P=.29; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.98), and SE (P=.19) but they underestimated SOL (P=.03; heterogenicity: I2=0\%, P=.66). Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed higher sensitivity (0.95-0.96) and specificity (0.58-0.69) values in detecting sleep epochs than nonsleep-staging models and those reported in the literature for regular wrist actigraphy.
Conclusions: Sleep-staging Fitbit models showed promising performance, especially in differentiating wake from sleep. However, although these models are a convenient and economical means for consumers to obtain gross estimates of sleep parameters and time spent in sleep stages, they are of limited specificity and are not a substitute for PSG.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Depression symptom questionnaires are not for diagnostic classification. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores ≥10 are nonetheless often used to estimate depression prevalence. We compared PHQ-9 ≥10 prevalence to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID) major depression prevalence and assessed whether an alternative PHQ-9 cutoff could more accurately estimate prevalence.
Study Design and Setting
Individual participant data meta-analysis of datasets comparing PHQ-9 scores to SCID major depression status.
Results
A total of 9,242 participants (1,389 SCID major depression cases) from 44 primary studies were included. Pooled PHQ-9 ≥10 prevalence was 24.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 20.8\%, 28.9\%); pooled SCID major depression prevalence was 12.1\% (95\% CI: 9.6\%, 15.2\%); and pooled difference was 11.9\% (95\% CI: 9.3\%, 14.6\%). The mean study-level PHQ-9 ≥10 to SCID-based prevalence ratio was 2.5 times. PHQ-9 ≥14 and the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm provided prevalence closest to SCID major depression prevalence, but study-level prevalence differed from SCID-based prevalence by an average absolute difference of 4.8\% for PHQ-9 ≥14 (95\% prediction interval: −13.6\%, 14.5\%) and 5.6\% for the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm (95\% prediction interval: −16.4\%, 15.0\%).
Conclusion
PHQ-9 ≥10 substantially overestimates depression prevalence. There is too much heterogeneity to correct statistically in individual studies.},

Using the Mood Disorders Insight Scale, we evaluated 247 patients with depressive disorders to determine their levels of insight with respect to their awareness of the illness, the attribution of symptoms, and their belief in the necessity of treatment. The relationships between insight and the severity of depressive symptoms, the level of self-stigma, sociodemographic characteristics, and the course of the illness were examined. The results reveal that 91 (36.8\%) subjects had impaired insight into awareness of their illness, 92 (37.2\%) had impaired insight into attribution of symptoms, and 39 (15.8\%) had impaired insight into the need for treatment. A younger age and more severe depression symptoms were significantly associated with insight into awareness of the illness. More severe depression symptoms and a higher education were associated with intact insight with respect to attribution of symptoms. Those who have a major depressive disorder were more likely to have intact insight into the need for treatment than those with depressive disorder that was not otherwise specified. Analysis of our results indicates that depressive patients with factors predicting impaired insight may benefit from intervention to improve their insight, and this should advance their recovery.},

	abstract = {The changes in diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) may appear small but have important consequences for how the diagnosis is used. In DSM-5, MDD is part of the new “Depressive disorders” section, which is separate from “Bipolar disorders”, marking a division in what had been known as “Mood disorders”. A small wording change has expanded the core mood criterion to include hopelessness, potentially broadening the diagnosis. The replacement of an operationalized bereavement exclusion with a call for clinical judgment in distinguishing normal reactions to significant loss from a disorder in need of clinical attention makes the diagnosis less objective and complicates investigations of the relationship between adversity and depression. A new persistent depressive disorder category is intended to encompass both dysthymia and chronic depression, but its relationship to MDD is ambiguous with conflicting statements on whether the two diagnoses should be concurrent if both sets of criteria are fulfilled. Clarification is also needed on whether MDD can be concurrent with the new broad “other specified bipolar and related disorders”. New specifiers of MDD “with anxious distress” and “with mixed features” allow characterization of additional symptoms. The specifier “with perinatal onset” expands on the DSM-IV “postnatal onset” to include onset during pregnancy. We review the changes in MDD definition, provide guidance on their implementation and discuss their implications for clinical practice and research.},

Through careful questioning, mental health professionals gain an understanding of the thoughts and feelings of those they serve. The information obtained from patients is considered in the context of the professional’s understanding of psychological and neuropsychological theory and scholarly research. Such information allows for an evidence-based approach to the understanding and care of others. The professional’s experience provides an additional rich source of information for understanding the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of others. Ultimately, diagnoses, recommendations, and treatment plans are based on the professional’s informed judgment. However, such judgment, regardless of the knowledge and experience of the professional, is subject to limitations, including biases. Supplementing the qualitative information obtained through interviews and observations with quantitative data improves the professional’s ability to understand, diagnose, and care for patients. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of psychological and neuropsychological diagnostic testing. An initial overview of sources of bias that can threaten the professional’s objectivity helps to illustrate the importance of adding objective, quantitative assessment to the more subjective, qualitative component of the diagnostic process.},

Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. We further review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We also discuss explainable AI (XAI) and neuromodulation in a closed human-in-the-loop manner and highlight the ML potential in multi-media information extraction and multi-modal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research., Mental health issues are an epidemic in the United States and the world and have imposed a tremendous burden to the healthcare system and society. To date, there is still a lack of biomarkers and individualized treatment guidelines for mental illnesses. In recent years, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly popular in analyzing complex patterns of neural and behavioral data for psychiatry. We provide a comprehensive review of ML methodologies and applications in precision psychiatry.

	abstract = {Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine—from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.},

The development of standardized metrics sensitive to brain-behavior relationships has shaped the neuropsychological questions we can ask, our understanding of discrete brain functions, and has informed the detection and treatment of neurological disorders. We identify key turning points and innovations in neuropsychological assessment over the past 40–50 years that highlight how the tools used in common practice today came to be. Also selected for emphasis are several exciting lines of research and novel approaches that are underway to further probe and characterize brain functions to enhance diagnostic and treatment outcomes. We provide a brief historical review of different clinical neuropsychological assessment approaches (Lurian, Flexible and Fixed Batteries, Boston Process Approach) and critical developments that have influenced their interpretation (normative standards, cultural considerations, longitudinal change, common metric batteries, and translational assessment constructs). Lastly, we discuss growing trends in assessment including technological advances, efforts to integrate neuropsychology across disciplines (e.g., primary care), and changes in neuropsychological assessment infrastructure. Neuropsychological assessment has undergone massive growth in the past several decades. Nonetheless, there remain many unanswered questions and future challenges to better support measurement tools and translate assessment findings into meaningful recommendations and treatments. As technology and our understanding of brain function advance, efforts to support infrastructure for both traditional and novel assessment approaches and integration of complementary brain assessment tools from other disciplines will be integral to inform brain health treatments and promote the growth of our field.

	abstract = {In a recent review, it was suggested that much larger cohorts are needed to prove the diagnostic value of neuroimaging biomarkers in psychiatry. While within a sample, an increase of diagnostic accuracy of schizophrenia (SZ) with number of subjects (N) has been shown, the relationship between N and accuracy is completely different between studies. Using data from a recent meta-analysis of machine learning (ML) in imaging SZ, we found that while low-N studies can reach 90\% and higher accuracy, above N/2 = 50 the maximum accuracy achieved steadily drops to below 70\% for N/2 {\textgreater} 150. We investigate the role N plays in the wide variability in accuracy results in SZ studies (63–97\%). We hypothesize that the underlying cause of the decrease in accuracy with increasing N is sample heterogeneity. While smaller studies more easily include a homogeneous group of subjects (strict inclusion criteria are easily met; subjects live close to study site), larger studies inevitably need to relax the criteria/recruit from large geographic areas. A SZ prediction model based on a heterogeneous group of patients with presumably a heterogeneous pattern of structural or functional brain changes will not be able to capture the whole variety of changes, thus being limited to patterns shared by most patients. In addition to heterogeneity (sample size), we investigate other factors influencing accuracy and introduce a ML effect size. We derive a simple model of how the different factors, such as sample heterogeneity and study setup determine this ML effect size, and explain the variation in prediction accuracies found from the literature, both in cross-validation and independent sample testing. From this, we argue that smaller-N studies may reach high prediction accuracy at the cost of lower generalizability to other samples. Higher-N studies, on the other hand, will have more generalization power, but at the cost of lower accuracy. In conclusion, when comparing results from different ML studies, the sample sizes should be taken into account. To assess the generalizability of the models, validation (by direct application) of the prediction models should be tested in independent samples. The prediction of more complex measures such as outcome, which are expected to have an underlying pattern of more subtle brain abnormalities (lower effect size), will require large samples.},

	abstract = {Background Clinical outcome prediction normally employs static, one-size-fits-all models that perform well for the average patient but are sub-optimal for individual patients with unique characteristics. In the era of digital healthcare, it is feasible to dynamically personalize decision support by identifying and analyzing similar past patients, in a way that is analogous to personalized product recommendation in e-commerce. Our objectives were: 1) to prove that analyzing only similar patients leads to better outcome prediction performance than analyzing all available patients, and 2) to characterize the trade-off between training data size and the degree of similarity between the training data and the index patient for whom prediction is to be made. Methods and Findings We deployed a cosine-similarity-based patient similarity metric (PSM) to an intensive care unit (ICU) database to identify patients that are most similar to each patient and subsequently to custom-build 30-day mortality prediction models. Rich clinical and administrative data from the first day in the ICU from 17,152 adult ICU admissions were analyzed. The results confirmed that using data from only a small subset of most similar patients for training improves predictive performance in comparison with using data from all available patients. The results also showed that when too few similar patients are used for training, predictive performance degrades due to the effects of small sample sizes. Our PSM-based approach outperformed well-known ICU severity of illness scores. Although the improved prediction performance is achieved at the cost of increased computational burden, Big Data technologies can help realize personalized data-driven decision support at the point of care. Conclusions The present study provides crucial empirical evidence for the promising potential of personalized data-driven decision support systems. With the increasing adoption of electronic medical record (EMR) systems, our novel medical data analytics contributes to meaningful use of EMR data.},

Combined with the inherent nature of medical images that make them ideal for deep-learning, further application of such systems to medical image classification holds much promise. However, the usefulness and potential impact of such a system can be completely negated if it does not reach a target accuracy. In this paper, we present a study on determining the optimum size of the training data set necessary to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image classification systems. The CNN was applied to classify axial Computed Tomography (CT) images into six anatomical classes. We trained the CNN using six different sizes of training data set (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200) and then tested the resulting system with a total of 6000 CT images. All images were acquired from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Using this data, we employ the learning curve approach to predict classification accuracy at a given training sample size. Our research will present a general methodology for determining the training data set size necessary to achieve a certain target classification accuracy that can be easily applied to other problems within such systems.},

	abstract = {Recently, IMUTube introduced a paradigm change for bootstrapping human activity recognition (HAR) systems for wearables. The key idea is to utilize videos of activities to support training activity recognizers based on inertial measurement units (IMUs). This system retrieves video from public repositories and subsequently generates virtual IMU data from this. The ultimate vision for such a system is to make large amounts of weakly labeled videos accessible for model training in HAR and, as such, to overcome one of the most pressing issues in the field: the lack of significant amounts of labeled sample data. In this paper we present the first in-detail exploration of IMUTube in a realistic assessment scenario: the analysis of free-weight gym exercises. We make significant progress towards a flexible, fully-functional IMUTube system by extending it such that it can handle a range of artifacts that are common in unrestricted online videos, including various forms of video noise, non-human poses, body part occlusions, and extreme camera and human motion. By overcoming these real-world challenges, we are able to generate high-quality virtual IMU data, which allows us to employ IMUTube for practical analysis tasks. We show that HAR systems trained by incorporating virtual sensor data generated by IMUTube significantly outperform baseline models trained only with real IMU data. In doing so we demonstrate the practical utility of IMUTube and the progress made towards the final vision of the new bootstrapping paradigm.},

This study aims to leverage recent advances in self-supervised learning to exploit the large-scale UK Biobank accelerometer dataset—a 700,000 person-days unlabelled dataset—in order to build models with vastly improved generalisability and accuracy. Our resulting models consistently outperform strong baselines across eight benchmark datasets, with an F1 relative improvement of 2.5–130.9\% (median 24.4\%). More importantly, in contrast to previous reports, our results generalise across external datasets, cohorts, living environments, and sensor devices. Our open-sourced pre-trained models will be valuable in domains with limited labelled data or where good sampling coverage (across devices, populations, and activities) is hard to achieve.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

Since 2012, there have been signiﬁcant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10× or 100×? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between ‘enormous data’ and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) ﬁndings. First, we ﬁnd that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pretraining) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-theart results for different vision tasks including image classiﬁcation, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

This paper investigates the question of whether existing detectors will continue to improve as data grows, or saturate in performance due to limited model complexity and the Bayes risk associated with the feature spaces in which they operate. We focus on the popular paradigm of discriminatively trained templates deﬁned on oriented gradient features. We investigate the performance of mixtures of templates as the number of mixture components and the amount of training data grows. Surprisingly, even with proper treatment of regularization and “outliers”, the performance of classic mixture models appears to saturate quickly (∼10 templates and ∼100 positive training examples per template). This is not a limitation of the feature space as compositional mixtures that share template parameters via parts and that can synthesize new templates not encountered during training yield signiﬁcantly better performance. Based on our analysis, we conjecture that the greatest gains in detection performance will continue to derive from improved representations and learning algorithms that can make eﬃcient use of large datasets.},

Different approaches have been introduced for developing models across multiple clinical sites, however less attention has been given to adopting ready-made models in new settings. We introduce three methods to do this—(1) applying a ready-made model “as-is” (2); readjusting the decision threshold on the model’s output using site-specific data and (3); finetuning the model using site-specific data via transfer learning. Using a case study of COVID-19 diagnosis across four NHS Hospital Trusts, we show that all methods achieve clinically-effective performances (NPV {\textgreater} 0.959), with transfer learning achieving the best results (mean AUROCs between 0.870 and 0.925). Our models demonstrate that site-specific customization improves predictive performance when compared to other ready-made approaches.},

Based on experiences from designing a computer system that supports the collaboration within a hospital, this paper discusses how plans themselves are made out of situated action, and in return are realised in situ. Thus, work can be characterised as situated planning. This understanding is backed up by Activity Theory, which emphasises the connection between plans and the contextual conditions for realising these plans in actual work.},

The association between EHR time and ambulatory care quality outcomes is unclear.To characterize measures of EHR use and ambulatory care quality performance among PCPs.A cross-sectional study of PCPs with longitudinal patient panels using a single EHR vendor was conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital during calendar year 2021.Independent variables included PCPs demographic and practice characteristics and EHR time measures (PCP-level mean of daily total EHR time, after-hours time, time from 5:30 pm to 7:00 am and time on weekends, and daily EHR time on notes, sending and receiving patient, staff, results, prescription, or system messages [in-basket], and clinical review).Outcome variables were ambulatory quality measures (year-end, PCP panel–level achievement of targets for hemoglobin A1c level control, lipid management, hypertension control, diabetes screening, and breast cancer screening).The sample included 291 physicians (174 [59.8\%] women). Median panel size was 829 (IQR, 476-1157) patients and mean (SD) clinical full-time equivalent was 0.54 (0.27). The PCPs spent a mean (SD) of 145.9 (64.6) daily minutes on the EHR. There were significant associations between EHR time and panel-level achievement of hemoglobin A1c control, hypertension control, and breast cancer screening targets. In adjusted analyses, each additional 15 minutes of total daily EHR time was associated with 0.58 (95\% CI, 0.32-0.84) percentage point greater panel-level hemoglobin A1c control, 0.52 (95\% CI, 0.33-0.71) percentage point greater hypertension control, and 0.28 (95\% CI, 0.05-0.52) higher breast cancer screening rates. Each daily additional 15 minutes of in-basket time was associated with 2.26 (95\% CI, 1.05-3.48) greater panel-wide hemoglobin A1c control, 1.65 (95\% CI, 0.83-2.47) percentage point greater hypertension control, and 1.26 (95\% CI, 0.51-2.02) percentage point higher breast cancer screening rates. Associations were largely concentrated among PCPs with 0.5 clinical full-time equivalent or less. There were no associations between EHR use metrics and diabetes screening or lipid management in patients with cardiovascular disease.This cross-sectional study found an association between EHR time and some measures of ambulatory care quality. Although increased EHR time is associated with burnout, it may represent a level of thoroughness or communication that enhances certain outcomes. It may be useful for future studies to characterize payment models, workflows, and technologies that enable high-quality ambulatory care delivery while minimizing EHR burden.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Learning health care networks can significantly improve the effectiveness, consistency, and cost-effectiveness of care delivery. As part of a data harmonization process, incorporation of the perspectives of community partners to maximize the relevance and utility of the data is critical.

Methods:

A mixed-methods focus group study was conducted with early psychosis program providers, leadership, service users, and family members to explore their priorities regarding data collection in early psychosis care. Focus group transcripts were analyzed through thematic analysis.

Results:

Twenty-two focus groups comprising 178 participants were conducted across 10 early psychosis programs. Participants considered functioning, quality of life, recovery, and symptoms of psychosis as key outcomes to assess, although variation by participants’ roles was also evident. Participants emphasized the clinical utility of assessing a broad range of predictors of care outcomes, favored a broad conceptualization of the constructs assessed, and indicated a preference for client-reported measures. Participants also emphasized the importance of surveys adopting a recovery-oriented, strengths-based approach.

Conclusions:

Large-scale aggregation of health care data collected as part of routine care offers opportunities for research and may have a positive impact on care delivery and quality improvement activities. However, these benefits are contingent on the data being both relevant and accessible to those who deliver and receive such care. This study highlights an approach that may inform the development of core assessment batteries used, optimizing the utility of such data for all community partners.},

We report the development of an infrared chromaticity (CIE-IR) chart, which mimics the CIE chart, in order to discriminate between different chemicals on the basis of the interactions of their IR signatures with three different IR optical filters, instead of the retinal photopigments in the human eye. Our results demonstrate that the CIE-IR chart enables separation of different classes of chemicals, as the visible CIE chart does with color, except for those in the IR spectral region. Such results clearly show that the biomimetic sensing method based on human color vision is in fact a true analogue to color vision and that the proposed CIE-IR chart can be used as a classification method unique to this biomimetic sensing modality.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) seeks to emulate human reasoning, but is still far from achieving such results for actionable sensing in complex situations. Instead of emulating human situation understanding, machines can amplify intelligence by accessing large amounts of data, filtering unimportant information, computing relevant context, and prioritizing results (for example, answers to human queries) to provide human–machine shared context. Intelligence support can come from many contextual sources that augment data reasoning through physical, environmental, and social knowledge. We propose a decisions-to-data multimodal sensor and action through contextual agents (human or machine) that seek, combine, and make sense of relevant data. Decisions-to-data combines AI computational capabilities with human reasoning to manage data collections, perform data fusion, and assess complex situations (that is, context reasoning). Five areas of AI developments for context-based AI that cover decisions-to-data include: (1) situation modeling (data at rest), (2) measurement control (data in motion), (3) statistical algorithms (data in collect), (4) software computing (data in transit), and (5) human–machine AI (data in use). A decisions-to-data example is presented of a command-guided swarm requiring contextual data analysis, systems-level design, and user interaction for effective and efficient multimodal sensing and action.},

	abstract = {Deep concern raised over the future of ageing infrastructure identified a need for reliable yet affordable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technologies. Damage detection and localization represent particular challenge, as the structures feature large size and localized damage can occur in large number of points. Early-stage damage detection and localization requires continuous sensing over large surface area, and with high spatial resolution (e.g. centimeter-scale resolution). Traditional sensing technologies are either limited by high cost and insufficient spatial resolution, or rely on complex algorithms that are challenged by varying environmental and loading conditions. This paper demonstrates the need for direct sensing, where anomalies are sensed at close proximity via a dense array of sensors. The hypothesis is that by substantially increasing the sensor response to local anomalies, direct sensing leads to greater robustness than current state-of-the-art approaches. To achieve this, our research presents such a technology based on Large Area Electronics (LAE) for direct sensing scalable to the level required for SHM and investigates how it could be applied in practice. A sensing sheet is manufactured based on LAE, which is capable of bonding to structural surfaces. Thin-film strain gauges and control circuits are integrated on the flexible electronics and deposited on a polyimide sheet that is possible to expand to large areas, allowing measuring and readout over a large number of sensors. In the first phase of this research, crack tests with thin resistive strain gauge sensors are utilized to identify the proper patterns (gauge length, distance, orientation, etc.) for the layout of sensing elements on the LAE sensing sheet, and indicate an average sensitivity of 0.0404 µm/µε. Then a characteristic identification test is carried out to evaluate alternative designs for sensing elements based on thin film transistors, with an approximate sensitivity of 3.3 mV/με. Results of both tests are presented in this paper, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of LAE and direct sensing approach for damage detection over large areas of structures.},

At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83\% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90\% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},

	abstract = {Objective
 A learning health care system (LHS) uses routinely collected data to continuously monitor and improve health care outcomes. Little is reported on the challenges and methods used to implement the analytics underpinning an LHS. Our aim was to systematically review the literature for reports of real-time clinical analytics implementation in digital hospitals and to use these findings to synthesize a conceptual framework for LHS implementation.
, Methods
 Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical analytics derived from electronic health records in adult inpatient and emergency department settings between 2015 and 2021. Evidence was coded from the final study selection that related to (1) dashboard implementation challenges, (2) methods to overcome implementation challenges, and (3) dashboard assessment and impact. The evidences obtained, together with evidence extracted from relevant prior reviews, were mapped to an existing digital health transformation model to derive a conceptual framework for LHS analytics implementation.
, Results
 A total of 238 candidate articles were reviewed and 14 met inclusion criteria. From the selected studies, we extracted 37 implementation challenges and 64 methods employed to overcome such challenges. We identified common approaches for evaluating the implementation of clinical dashboards. Six studies assessed clinical process outcomes and only four studies evaluated patient health outcomes. A conceptual framework for implementing the analytics of an LHS was developed.
, Conclusion
 Health care organizations face diverse challenges when trying to implement real-time data analytics. These challenges have shifted over the past decade. While prior reviews identified fundamental information problems, such as data size and complexity, our review uncovered more postpilot challenges, such as supporting diverse users, workflows, and user-interface screens. Our review identified practical methods to overcome these challenges which have been incorporated into a conceptual framework. It is hoped this framework will support health care organizations deploying near-real-time clinical dashboards and progress toward an LHS.},

The dashboards are deployed on top of a statewide health information exchange. One dashboard enables authorized users working in public health agencies to surveil populations in detail, and a public version provides higher-level situational awareness to inform ongoing pandemic response efforts in communities.Both dashboards have proved useful informatics resources. For example, the private dashboard enabled detection of a local community outbreak associated with a meat packing plant. The public dashboard provides recent trend analysis to track disease spread and community-level hospitalizations. Combined, the tools were utilized 133 637 times by 74 317 distinct users between June 21 and August 22, 2020. The tools are frequently cited by journalists and featured on social media.Capitalizing on a statewide health information exchange, in partnership with health system and public health leaders, Regenstrief biomedical informatics experts rapidly developed and deployed informatics tools to support surveillance and response to COVID-19.The application of public health informatics methods and tools in Indiana holds promise for other states and nations.

While psychotherapy treatments are largely effective, the processes and mechanisms underlying such positive changes remain somewhat unknown. Focusing on a single participant from a treatment outcome study that used a modular-based cognitive behavior therapy protocol, this article aims to answer this question by identifying changes in specific symptomatology over the course of the treatment. Using quantitative data derived from digital health methodology, we analyzed whether a given therapeutic intervention was related to downstream effects in predicted symptom domains, to assess the accuracy of our interventions.

Methods
This case study employed an observational N-of-1 study design. The participant (n = 1) was a female in the age range of 25–35 years. Using digital health data from ambulatory assessment surveys completed prior to and during therapy, separate linear regression analyses were conducted to assess if hypothesized treatment targets reduced after a given module, or intervention.

Results
Support was found for some of the hypothesized quantitative changes (e.g., decreases in avoidance after exposures module), yet not for others (e.g., decreases in rumination following the mindfulness module).

Conclusion
We present data and results from our analyses to offer an example of a novel design that may allow for a greater understanding of the nature of symptom changes with increased granularity throughout the course of a psychological treatment from the use of digital health tools.},

	abstract = {Psychotherapists are taught that when a client expresses resistance repeatedly, they must understand and address its underlying sources. Yet proponents of evidence-based practice (EBP) have routinely ignored the root causes of many clinical psychologists' reservations concerning the use of scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. As a consequence, much of the resistance to EBP persists, potentially widening the already large scientist–practitioner gap. Following a review of survey data on psychologists' attitudes toward EBP, we examine six sources underpinning resistance toward EBP in clinical psychology and allied domains: (a) naïve realism, which can lead clinicians to conclude erroneously that client change is due to an intervention itself rather than to a host of competing explanations; (b) deep-seated misconceptions regarding human nature (e.g., mistaken beliefs regarding the causal primacy of early experiences) that can hinder the adoption of evidence-based treatments; (c) statistical misunderstandings regarding the application of group probabilities to individuals; (d) erroneous apportioning of the burden of proof on skeptics rather than proponents of untested therapies; (e) widespread mischaracterizations of what EBP entails; and (f) pragmatic, educational, and attitudinal obstacles, such as the discomfort of many practitioners with evaluating the increasingly technical psychotherapy outcome literature. We advance educational proposals for articulating the importance of EBP to the forthcoming generation of clinical practitioners and researchers, and constructive remedies for addressing clinical psychologists' objections to EBP.},

The current study examines if such measurements can quantify response to antidepressant treatment (ADT) with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine uptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
Methods: Visual and auditory markers were acquired through an automated smartphone task that measures facial, vocal, and head movement characteristics across 4 weeks of treatment (with time points at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) on ADT (n = 18). MDD diagnosis was conﬁrmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was collected concordantly to assess changes in MDD severity.
Results: Patient responses to ADT demonstrated clinically and statistically signiﬁcant changes in the MADRS [F(2, 34) = 51.62, p {\textless} 0.0001]. Additionally, patients demonstrated signiﬁcant increases in multiple digital markers including facial expressivity, head movement, and amount of speech. Finally, patients demonstrated signiﬁcantly decreased frequency of fear and anger facial expressions.
Conclusion: Digital markers associated with MDD demonstrate validity as measures of treatment response.},

Additionally, it is unknown whether greater stepping intensity is associated with health benefits, independent of steps taken per day.To examine associations of number of steps per day and stepping intensity with all-cause mortality.This prospective cohort study included 18 289 US women from the Women’s Health Study who agreed to participate by wearing an accelerometer during waking hours for 7 days between 2011 and 2015. A total of 17 708 women wore and returned their devices; data were downloaded successfully from 17 466 devices. Of these women, 16 741 were compliant wearers (≥10 h/d of wear on ≥4 days) and included in the analyses, which took place between 2018 and 2019.Steps per day and several measures of stepping intensity (ie, peak 1-minute cadence; peak 30-minute cadence; maximum 5-minute cadence; time spent at a stepping rate of ≥40 steps/min, reflecting purposeful steps).All-cause mortality.Of the 16 741 women who met inclusion criteria, the mean (SD) age was 72.0 (5.7) years. Mean step count was 5499 per day, with 51.4\%, 45.5\%, and 3.1\% of time spent at 0, 1 to 39 (incidental steps), and 40 steps/min or greater (purposeful steps), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, 504 women died. Median steps per day across low-to-high quartiles of distribution were 2718, 4363, 5905, and 8442, respectively. The corresponding quartile hazard ratios (HRs) associated with mortality and adjusted for potential confounders were 1.00 (reference), 0.59 (95\% CI, 0.47-0.75), 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.41-0.72), and 0.42 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.60), respectively (P \&lt; .01). In spline analysis, HRs were observed to decline progressively with higher mean steps per day until approximately 7500 steps/d, after which they leveled. For measures of stepping intensity, higher intensities were associated with significantly lower mortality rates; however, after adjusting for steps per day, all associations were attenuated, and most were no longer significant (highest vs lowest quartile for peak 1-minute cadence, HR = 0.87 [95\% CI, 0.68-1.11]; peak 30-minute cadence, HR = 0.86 [95\% CI, 0.65-1.13]; maximum 5-minute cadence, HR = 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.62-1.05]; and time spent at a stepping rate of ≥40 steps/min, HR = 1.27 [95\% CI, 0.96-1.68]; P \&gt; .05).Among older women, as few as approximately 4400 steps/d was significantly related to lower mortality rates compared with approximately 2700 steps/d. With more steps per day, mortality rates progressively decreased before leveling at approximately 7500 steps/d. Stepping intensity was not clearly related to lower mortality rates after accounting for total steps per day.},

Mortality was ascertained through December 2015.Accelerometer-measured number of steps per day and 3 step intensity measures (extended bout cadence, peak 30-minute cadence, and peak 1-minute cadence [steps/min]). Accelerometer data were based on measurements obtained during a 7-day period at baseline.The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95\% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education; diet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.A total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54\%] women; 1732 [36\%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day. The mean number of steps per day was 9124. There were 1165 deaths over a mean 10.1 years of follow-up, including 406 CVD and 283 cancer deaths. The unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality was 76.7 per 1000 person-years (419 deaths) for the 655 individuals who took less than 4000 steps per day; 21.4 per 1000 person-years (488 deaths) for the 1727 individuals who took 4000 to 7999 steps per day; 6.9 per 1000 person-years (176 deaths) for the 1539 individuals who took 8000 to 11 999 steps per day; and 4.8 per 1000 person-years (82 deaths) for the 919 individuals who took at least 12 000 steps per day. Compared with taking 4000 steps per day, taking 8000 steps per day was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49 [95\% CI, 0.44-0.55]), as was taking 12 000 steps per day (HR, 0.35 [95\% CI, 0.28-0.45]). Unadjusted incidence density for all-cause mortality by peak 30 cadence was 32.9 per 1000 person-years (406 deaths) for the 1080 individuals who took 18.5 to 56.0 steps per minute; 12.6 per 1000 person-years (207 deaths) for the 1153 individuals who took 56.1 to 69.2 steps per minute; 6.8 per 1000 person-years (124 deaths) for the 1074 individuals who took 69.3 to 82.8 steps per minute; and 5.3 per 1000 person-years (108 deaths) for the 1037 individuals who took 82.9 to 149.5 steps per minute. Greater step intensity was not significantly associated with lower mortality after adjustment for total steps per day (eg, highest vs lowest quartile of peak 30 cadence: HR, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.65-1.27]; P value for trend = .34).Based on a representative sample of US adults, a greater number of daily steps was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality.

Of the 6,042 participants included in the study, 73\% were female, 84\% were white and 71\% had a college degree, and participants had a median age of 56.7 (interquartile range 41.5–67.6) years and body mass index of 28.1 (24.3–32.9) kg m–2. Participants walked a median of 7,731.3 (5,866.8–9,826.8) steps per day over the median activity monitoring period of 4.0 (2.2–5.6) years with a total of 5.9 million person-days of monitoring. The relationship between steps per day and incident disease was inverse and linear for obesity (n = 368), sleep apnea (n = 348), gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 432) and major depressive disorder (n = 467), with values above 8,200 daily steps associated with protection from incident disease. The relationships with incident diabetes (n = 156) and hypertension (n = 482) were nonlinear with no further risk reduction above 8,000–9,000 steps. Although validation in a more diverse sample is needed, these findings provide a real-world evidence-base for clinical guidance regarding activity levels that are necessary to reduce disease risk.},

This article examines (a) the characteristics of scales developed in the past 80 years, and (b) the frequency with which different scales have actually been used in basic science and treatment outcome studies over a 10-year period of time. Results of the authors' item analysis showed considerable variability across measures, but few consistent differences in item content emerged over time, other than in how anxiousness, suicidality, and loss of interest were assessed. Less than half of published scales assessed social withdrawal specifically, and as many as 20\% of measures did not assess either "depression" or "sadness" directly. Worthlessness was assessed as thoroughly as depressed mood and more thoroughly than all other core symptoms of depression. Results of frequency analysis showed that despite the large number of scales developed to date, relatively few scales are actually used. Far more measures are used to assess depressive severity in basic science studies than in treatment studies of depression. Treatment studies have relied primarily on 6 measures of depression, the majority of which were developed 20 years ago and which are not representative of the larger body of recently developed measures of depressive severity measures. Implications for progress in the assessment of depression are discussed.},

However, these reforms are challenging and complex to implement, requiring significant policy and delivery changes. Despite global interest, the evidence on how to implement accountable care successfully remains limited. To improve the evidence base and increase the likelihood of success, we applied a comprehensive framework for assessing accountable care implementation to three promising reforms outside the United States. The framework relates accountable care policy reforms to the competencies of health care organizations and their health policy environments to facilitate qualitative comparisons of innovations and factors that influence success. We present emerging lessons to guide future implementation and evaluation of accountable care reforms to improve access to and the quality and affordability of care.},

	abstract = {Background: Today, college students are dealing with depression at some of the highest rates in decades. As the primary mental health service provider, university counseling centers are limited in their capacity and efficiency to provide mental health care due to time constraints and reliance on students’ self-reports. A mobile behavioral-sensing platform may serve as a solution to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of university counseling services. Objective: The main objectives of this study are to (1) understand the usefulness of a mobile sensing platform (ie, iSee) in improving counseling services and assisting students’ self-management of their depression conditions, and (2) explore what types of behavioral targets (ie, meaningful information extracted from raw sensor data) and feedback to deliver from both clinician and students’ perspectives. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 9 clinicians and 12 students with depression recruited from a counseling center at a large Midwestern university. The interviews were 40-50 minutes long and were audio recorded and transcribed. The interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis with an inductive approach. Clinician and student interviews were analyzed separately for comparison. The process of extracting themes involved iterative coding, memo writing, theme revisits, and refinement. Results: From the clinician perspective, the mobile sensing platform helps to improve counseling service by providing objective evidence for clinicians and filling gaps in clinician-patient communication. Clinicians suggested providing students with their sensed behavioral targets organized around personalized goals. Clinicians also recommended delivering therapeutic feedback to students based on their sensed behavioral targets, including positive reinforcement, reflection reminders, and challenging negative thoughts. From the student perspective, the mobile sensing platform helps to ease continued self-tracking practices. Students expressed their need for integrated behavioral targets to understand correlations between behaviors and depression. They also pointed out that they would prefer to avoid seeing negative feedback. Conclusions: Although clinician and student participants shared views on the advantages of iSee in supporting university counseling, they had divergent opinions on the types of behavioral targets and feedback to be provided via iSee. This exploratory work gained initial insights into the design of a mobile sensing platform for depression management and informed a more conclusive research project for the future.},

	abstract = {Although many people access publicly available digital behavioral and mental health interventions, most do not invest as much effort in these interventions as hoped or intended by intervention developers, and ongoing engagement is often low. Thus, the impact of such interventions is minimized by a misalignment between intervention design and user behavior. Digital micro interventions are highly focused interventions delivered in the context of a person’s daily life with little burden on the individual. We propose that these interventions have the potential to disruptively expand the reach of beneficial therapeutics by lowering the bar for entry to an intervention and the effort needed for purposeful engagement. This paper provides a conceptualization of digital micro interventions, their component parts, and principles guiding their use as building blocks of a larger therapeutic process (ie, digital micro intervention care). The model represented provides a structure that could improve the design, delivery, and research on digital micro interventions and ultimately improve behavioral and mental health care and care delivery.},

	abstract = {We conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial in psychiatric outpatients with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder to measure the impact of a first-of-its-kind precision digital intervention software solution based on social rhythm regulation principles. The full intent-to-treat (ITT) sample consisted of 133 individuals, aged 18–65. An exploratory sub-sample of interest was those individuals who presented with moderately severe to severe depression at study entry (baseline PHQ-8 score ≥15; N = 28). Cue is a novel digital intervention platform that capitalizes on the smartphone's ability to continuously monitor depression-relevant behavior patterns and use each patient's behavioral data to provide timely, personalized “micro-interventions,” making this the first example of a precision digital intervention of which we are aware. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Cue plus care-as-usual or digital monitoring only plus care as usual. Within the full study and depressed-at-entry samples, we fit a mixed effects model to test for group differences in the slope of depressive symptoms over 16 weeks. To account for the non-linear trajectory with more flexibility, we also fit a mixed effects model considering week as a categorical variable and used the resulting estimates to test the group difference in PHQ change from baseline to 16 weeks. In the full sample, the group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 was negligible (Cohen's d = −0.10); however, the Cue group demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.040). In the depressed-at-entry sample, we found evidence for benefit of Cue. The group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 (Cohen's d = −0.72) indicated a meaningfully more rapid rate of improvement in the intervention group than in the control group. The Cue group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PHQ-8 from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.009). We are encouraged by the size of the intervention effect in those who were acutely ill at baseline, and by the finding that across all participants, 80\% of whom were receiving pharmacotherapy, we observed significant benefit of Cue at 16 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that a social rhythm-focused digital intervention platform may represent a useful and accessible adjunct to antidepressant treatment (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03152864?term=ellen+frank\&draw=2\&rank=3).},

We then evaluate several representative methods to illustrate the behaviour of different families of approaches. This illustration is conducted on both artificial and real datasets, with different characteristics. The main conclusions one can draw from this survey is that causal discovery in times series is an active research field in which new methods (in every family of approaches) are regularly proposed, and that no family or method stands out in all situations.

Unlike typical causal studies that focus on the effect of each treatment, we focus on the outcome and address the reverse causal question of identifying treatments that may have led to the outcome, drawing on case-control studies in epidemiology. Specifically, we define the outcome as an aggregate of affective, behavioral, and cognitive psychosocial change and identify Case (most improved) and Control (least improved) cohorts of individuals. Considering responses from peers as treatments, we evaluate the differences in the responses received by Case and Control, per matched clusters of similar individuals. We find that effective support includes complex language factors such as diversity, adaptability, and style, but simple indicators such as quantity and immediacy are not causally relevant.

	abstract = {Introduction
Major depressive disorder is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, and it has a profound negative impact on an individual's ability to function. Up to 90\% of individuals suffering from depression also report sleep and circadian disruptions. If these disruptions are not effectively resolved over the course of treatment, the likelihood of relapse into depression is greatly increased. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has shown promise in treating these sleep and circadian disturbances associated with depression, and may be effective as a stand-alone treatment for depression. This may be particularly relevant in cases where antidepressant medications are not ideal (e.g. due to contraindications, cost, or treatment resistance).
Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted of trials investigating the use of CBT-I to treat depression in adults. Therapy included in-person CBT-I, as well as telehealth and group CBT-I.
Results and conclusions
CBT-I presents a promising treatment for depression comorbid with insomnia. In-person therapy has the most supporting evidence for its efficacy, though treatment effects may not be additive with those of antidepressant medications. Insomnia improvement due to CBT-I may mediate the improvement in depressive symptoms. There is less evidence for the use of telehealth, though a stepped-care approach is indicated based on baseline depressive severity. More research on group therapy and telehealth modalities of delivering CBT-I are required before making recommendations.},

Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy grew from a chronobiological model of bipolar disorder postulating that individuals with bipolar disorder have a genetic predisposition to circadian rhythm and sleep–wake cycle abnormalities that may be responsible, in part, for the symptomatic manifestations of the illness. In our model, life events (both negative and positive) may cause disruptions in patients’ social rhythms that, in turn, perturb circadian rhythms and sleep–wake cycles and lead to the development of bipolar symptoms. Administered in concert with medications, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy combines the basic principles of interpersonal psychotherapy with behavioral techniques to help patients regularize their daily routines, diminish interpersonal problems, and adhere to medication regimens. It modulates both biological and psychosocial factors to mitigate patients ’ circadian and sleep–wake cycle vulnerabilities, improve overall functioning, and better manage the potential chaos of bipolar disorder symptomatology.

Further, we have shown that the next step after the development of theoretically driven treatment protocols is to evaluate their efficacy. Once evidence for a treatment\&apos;s efficacy has accumulated, studies of the mechanisms involved in the reduction of the targeted psychopathology are conducted, which in turn inform the theory and further refine the treatments. We conclude our review with a discussion of how the knowledge derived from Foa and colleagues\&apos; programmatic research together with knowledge emerging from basic research on extinction learning can inform future research on the psychopathology of anxiety disorders and their treatments.},

	abstract = {Background: The growing field of personal sensing harnesses sensor data collected from individuals’ smartphones to understand their behaviors and experiences. Such data could be a powerful tool within mental health care. However, it is important to note that the nature of these data differs from the information usually available to, or discussed with, health care professionals. To design digital mental health tools that are acceptable to users, understanding how personal sensing data can be used and shared is critical. Objective: This study aimed to investigate individuals’ perspectives about sharing different types of sensor data beyond the research context, specifically with doctors, electronic health record (EHR) systems, and family members. Methods: A questionnaire assessed participants’ comfort with sharing six types of sensed data: physical activity, mood, sleep, communication logs, location, and social activity. Participants were asked about their comfort with sharing these data with three different recipients: doctors, EHR systems, and family members. A series of principal component analyses (one for each data recipient) was performed to identify clusters of sensor data types according to participants’ comfort with sharing them. Relationships between recipients and sensor clusters were then explored using generalized estimating equation logistic regression models. Results: A total of 211 participants completed the questionnaire. The majority were female (171/211, 81.0\%), and the mean age was 38 years (SD 10.32). Principal component analyses consistently identified two clusters of sensed data across the three data recipients: “health information,” including sleep, mood, and physical activity, and “personal data,” including communication logs, location, and social activity. Overall, participants were significantly more comfortable sharing any type of sensed data with their doctor than with the EHR system or family members (P{\textbackslash}textless.001) and more comfortable sharing “health information” than “personal data” (P{\textbackslash}textless.001). Participant characteristics such as age or presence of depression or anxiety did not influence participants’ comfort with sharing sensed data. Conclusions: The comfort level in sharing sensed data was dependent on both data type and recipient, but not individual characteristics. Given the identified differences in comfort with sensed data sharing, contextual factors of data type and recipient appear to be critically important as we design systems that harness sensor data for mental health treatment and support.},

	abstract = {Background: At least 10-20\% of the patients suffering from depression meet criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In the last decades, an important role of glutamate in mood modulation has been hypothesized and ketamine, a non noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors, has been demonstrated to be effective in both MDD and TRD. However, concerns emerged about the optimal dosage, and frequency of administration of this treatment. Methods: aiming to systematically review the current literature focusing on the main pharmacological properties
and impact of ketamine in TRD, a detailed literature search in PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect databases was conducted. Twenty-four manuscripts including a total of 416 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Results: Most studies demonstrated that the NMDA antagonist ketamine has rapid
antidepressant effects in TRD patients, confirming the active role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of this complex condition. Ketamine has been demonstrated to be rapidly effective and was associated with a significant clinical improvement in depressive symptoms within hours after administration.
Also, ketamine was also found to be effective in reducing suicidality in TRD samples. Limitations: The long-term efficacy of ketamine has not been investigated by most studies. The psychotomimetic properties may complicate the application of this pharmacological agent. Conclusions:
Ketamine may be considered a valid and intriguing antidepressant option for the treatment of TRD. Further studies are needed to evaluate its long-term antidepressant efficacy in patients with TRD.},

We asked human clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy.Five clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy.AI-generated suggestions could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced learning health system.},

To address these challenges, we take a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to synthesize clinically useful insights from multi-sensor data. We develop chain of thought prompting methods that use LLMs to generate reasoning about how trends in data such as step count and sleep relate to conditions like depression and anxiety. We first demonstrate binary depression classification with LLMs achieving accuracies of 61.1\% which exceed the state of the art. While it is not robust for clinical use, this leads us to our key finding: even more impactful and valued than classification is a new human-AI collaboration approach in which clinician experts interactively query these tools and combine their domain expertise and context about the patient with AI generated reasoning to support clinical decision-making. We find models like GPT-4 correctly reference numerical data 75\% of the time, and clinician participants express strong interest in using this approach to interpret self-tracking data.},

We present a comprehensive evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs with diverse prompting and fine-tuning techniques on six public health datasets (PM-Data, LifeSnaps, GLOBEM, AW\_FB, MIT-BIH \& MIMIC-III). Our experiments cover thirteen consumer health prediction tasks in mental health, activity, metabolic, sleep, and cardiac assessment. Our fine-tuned model, Health-Alpaca exhibits comparable performance to larger models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), achieving the best performance in 5 out of 13 tasks. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of context enhancement strategies, and generalization capability of the fine-tuned models across training datasets and the size of training samples. Notably, we observe that our context enhancement can yield up to 23.8\% improvement in performance. While constructing contextually rich prompts (combining user context, health knowledge and temporal information) exhibits synergistic improvement, the inclusion of health knowledge context in prompts significantly enhances overall performance.},

This paper presents an experimental design, the micro-randomized trial, developed to support optimization of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). JITAIs are mHealth technologies that aim to deliver the right intervention components at the right times and locations to optimally support individuals’ health behaviors. Micro-randomized trials offer a way to optimize such interventions by enabling modeling of causal effects and time-varying effect moderation for individual intervention components within a JITAI.

Methods
The paper describes the micro-randomized trial design, enumerates research questions that this experimental design can help answer, and provides an overview of the data analyses that can be used to assess the causal effects of studied intervention components and investigate time-varying moderation of those effects.

Results
Micro-randomized trials enable causal modeling of proximal effects of the randomized intervention components and assessment of time-varying moderation of those effects.

Conclusions
Micro-randomized trials can help researchers understand whether their interventions are having intended effects, when and for whom they are effective, and what factors moderate the interventions’ effects, enabling creation of more effective JITAIs.},

	abstract = {Background: Smartphone apps for smoking cessation could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling. Although there are hundreds of publicly available smoking cessation apps, few have been empirically evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The Smart-Treatment (Smart-T2) app is a just-in-time adaptive intervention that uses ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to assess the risk for imminent smoking lapse and tailors treatment messages based on the risk of lapse and reported symptoms.
Objective: This 3-armed pilot RCT aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an automated smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention (Smart-T2) relative to standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the National Cancer Institute’s free smoking cessation app, QuitGuide.
Methods: Adult smokers who attended a clinic-based tobacco cessation program were randomized into groups and followed for 13 weeks (1 week prequitting through 12 weeks postquitting). All study participants received nicotine patches and gum and were asked to complete EMAs five times a day on study-provided smartphones for 5 weeks. Participants in the Smart-T2 group received tailored treatment messages after the completion of each EMA. Both Smart-T2 and QuitGuide apps offer on-demand smoking cessation treatment.
Results: Of 81 participants, 41 (50\%) were women and 55 (68\%) were white. On average, participants were aged 49.6 years and smoked 22.4 cigarettes per day at baseline. A total of 17\% (14/81) of participants were biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinent at 12 weeks postquitting (Smart-T2: 6/27, 22\%, QuitGuide: 4/27, 15\%, and usual care: 4/27, 15\%), with no significant differences across groups (P\&gt;.05). Participants in the Smart-T2 group rated the app positively, with most participants agreeing that they can rely on the app to help them quit smoking, and endorsed the belief that the app would help them stay quit, and these responses were not significantly different from the ratings given by participants in the usual care group.
Conclusions: Dynamic smartphone apps that tailor intervention content in real time may increase user engagement and exposure to treatment-related materials. The results of this pilot RCT suggest that smartphone-based smoking cessation treatments may be capable of providing similar outcomes to traditional, in-person counseling.

	abstract = {Background:  Individuals in stressful work environments often experience mental health issues, such as depression. Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking.
 Objective:  This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores.
 Methods:  We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns’ daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week’s mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week’s mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator.
 Results:  We found that the previous week’s mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week’s mood with an estimated moderation of −0.052 ( P =.001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week’s step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week’s step count, with an estimated moderation of −0.039 ( P =.01) and that the previous week’s sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week’s sleep with an estimated moderation of −0.075 ( P \&lt;.001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high.
 Conclusions:  These findings suggest that an individual’s current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health. Timing interventions to match an individual’s state may be critical to maximizing the efficacy of interventions.

	abstract = {Background
Relapse to smoking is commonly triggered by stress, but behavioral interventions have shown only modest efficacy in preventing stress-related relapse. Continuous digital sensing to detect states of smoking risk and intervention receptivity may make it feasible to increase treatment efficacy by adapting intervention timing.
Objective
Aims are to investigate whether the delivery of a prompt to perform stress management behavior, as compared to no prompt, reduces the likelihood of (a) being stressed and (b) smoking in the subsequent two hours, and (c) whether current stress moderates these effects.
Study design
A micro-randomized trial will be implemented with 75 adult smokers who wear Autosense chest and wrist sensors and use the mCerebrum suite of smartphone apps to report and respond to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questions about smoking and mood for 4 days before and 10 days after a quit attempt and to access a set of stress-management apps. Sensor data will be processed on the smartphone in real time using the cStress algorithm to classify minutes as probably stressed or probably not stressed. Stressed and non-stressed minutes will be micro-randomized to deliver either a prompt to perform a stress management exercise via one of the apps or no prompt (2.5–3 stress management prompts will be delivered daily). Sensor and self-report assessments of stress and smoking will be analyzed to optimize decision rules for a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) to prevent smoking relapse.
Significance
Sense2Stop will be the first digital trial using wearable sensors and micro-randomization to optimize a just-in-time adaptive stress management intervention for smoking relapse prevention.},

	abstract = {Background: Given the interrelated health of children and parents, strategies to promote stress regulation are critically important in the family context. However, the uptake of preventive mental health is limited among parents owing to competing family demands.
Objective: In this study, we aim to determine whether it is feasible and acceptable to randomize digital prompts designed to engage parents in real-time brief mindfulness activities guided by a commercially available app.
Methods: We conducted a 30-day pilot microrandomized trial among a sample of parents who used Android smartphones. Each day during a parent-specified time frame, participants had a 50\% probability of receiving a prompt with a message encouraging them to engage in a mindfulness activity using a commercial app, Headspace. In the 24 hours following randomization, ecological momentary assessments and passively collected smartphone data were used to assess proximal engagement (yes or no) with the app and any mindfulness activity (with or without the app). These data were combined with baseline and exit surveys to determine feasibility and acceptability.
Results: Over 4 months, 83 interested parents were screened, 48 were eligible, 16 were enrolled, and 10 were successfully onboarded. Reasons for nonparticipation included technology barriers, privacy concerns, time constraints, or change of mind. In total, 80\% (8/10) of parents who onboarded successfully completed all aspects of the intervention. While it is feasible to randomize prompt delivery, only 60\% (6/10) of parents reported that the timing of prompts was helpful despite having control over the delivery window. Across the study period, we observed higher self-reported engagement with Headspace on days with prompts (31/62, 50\% of days), as opposed to days without prompts (33/103, 32\% of days). This pattern was consistent for most participants in this study (7/8, 87\%). The time spent using the app on days with prompts (mean 566, SD 378 seconds) was descriptively higher than on days without prompts (mean 225, SD 276 seconds). App usage was highest during the first week and declined over each of the remaining 3 weeks. However, self-reported engagement in mindfulness activities without the app increased over time. Self-reported engagement with any mindfulness activity was similar on days with (40/62, 65\% of days) and without (65/103, 63\% of days) prompts. Participants found the Headspace app helpful (10/10, 100\%) and would recommend the program to others (9/10, 90\%).
Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that parents are receptive to using mindfulness apps to support stress management, and prompts are likely to increase engagement with the app. However, we identified several implementation challenges in the current trial, specifically a need to optimize prompt timing and frequency as a strategy to engage users in preventive digital mental health.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the feasibility of automatically assessing the Social Rhythm Metric (SRM), a clinically-validated marker of stability and rhythmicity for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), using passively-sensed data from smartphones.Methods Seven patients with BD used smartphones for 4 weeks passively collecting sensor data including accelerometer, microphone, location, and communication information to infer behavioral and contextual patterns. Participants also completed SRM entries using a smartphone app.Results We found that automated sensing can be used to infer the SRM score. Using location, distance traveled, conversation frequency, and non-stationary duration as inputs, our generalized model achieves root-mean-square-error of 1.40, a reasonable performance given the range of SRM score (0–7). Personalized models further improve performance with mean root-mean-square-error of 0.92 across users. Classifiers using sensor streams can predict stable (SRM score ≥3.5) and unstable (SRM score \&lt;3.5) states with high accuracy (precision: 0.85 and recall: 0.86).Conclusions Automatic smartphone sensing is a feasible approach for inferring rhythmicity, a key marker of wellbeing for individuals with BD.},

However, current commercial tools often do not effectively support patients and providers in collaboration surrounding these data. This paper examines patient expectations and current collaboration practices around patient-generated data. We survey 211 patients, interview 18 patients, and re-analyze a dataset of 21 provider interviews. We find that collaboration occurs in every stage of self- tracking and that patients and providers create boundary negotiating artifacts to support the collaboration. Building upon current practices with patient-generated data, we use these theories of patient and provider collaboration to analyze misunderstandings and privacy concerns as well as identify opportunities to better support these collaborations. We reflect on the social nature of patient-provider collaboration to suggest future development of the stage-based model of personal informatics and the theory of boundary negotiating artifacts.},

Chronic disease management, in particular, presents tremendous potential for intervention given patients' ability to now actively participate in their care through tracking. The focus on 'personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. To dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in Bangalore, India. In this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. We then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health.},

This paper investigates how to address challenges that result from current self-tracking tools leaving a person's goals for their data unstated and lacking explicit support. We examine supporting people and health providers in expressing and pursuing their tracking-related goals via goal-directed self-tracking, a novel method to represent relationships between tracking goals and underlying data. Informed by a reanalysis of data from a prior study of migraine tracking goals, we created a paper prototype to explore whether and how goal-directed self-tracking could address current disconnects between the goals people have for data in their chronic condition management and the tools they use to support such goals. We examined this prototype in interviews with 14 people with migraine and 5 health providers. Our findings indicate the potential for scaffolding goal-directed self-tracking to: 1) elicit different types and hierarchies of management and tracking goals; 2) help people prepare for all stages of self-tracking towards a specific goal; and 3) contribute additional expertise in patient-provider collaboration. Based on our findings, we present implications for the design of tools that explicitly represent and support an individual's specific self-tracking goals.},

The WhoIsZuki app supports goal setting and semi-automated activity tracking, and it provides an ambient display that visually encodes these tracked activities as well as progress toward goals. Half of participants received a version of the interface that supplied behavioral feedback in the form of a multi-chapter episodic narrative, while the other half received a control condition version that provided an aesthetically-similar visualization but without any characterization, episodic structure, dramatic effect, or other narrative elements. After interacting with these versions for four months, our analysis showed that participants receiving the multi-chapter narrative feedback performed more physical activity, achieved more goals, experienced more positive psychological shifts, and overall engaged more meaningfully with the digital intervention.},

Despite its longevity there is still not widespread agreement regarding how it should be defined or how it should guide the delivery of services. Generally, though, prioritizing the patient’s values and preferences seem to be at the core of this particular approach. It is not clear, however, that services attend to patient values and preferences as closely as they should. Terms such as “treatment resistant” and “noncompliant” seem to belie an attitude where the therapist’s opinion is privileged rather than the patients. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of mental health services a move from patient-centered care to patient-perspective care is recommended. An attitude of patient-perspective care would require service providers recognizing that help can only ever be defined by the helpee rather than the helper. A patientperspective service that was structure around the preferences and perspectives of patients might finally help to end the long-term suffering of many people who experience mental health problems.},

	abstract = {Understanding barriers and facilitators of healthcare for people with mental illness is essential for healthcare and mental healthcare organizations moving towards patient centered care. This paper presents findings of a measure on barriers and facilitators of healthcare completed by 204 patients being served at a co-located wellness center (primary healthcare clinic) located in an urban mental health center. The top 10 results show important findings for planning healthcare services that are responsive to the needs of people with mental illness. Basic structural issues as a result of poverty are extremely important (transportation, housing, payment) as well as difficulty with public healthcare that often involves long wait-times for appointments and at the doctor's office and hours that might not be convenient. Healthcare services that want to meet the needs of people with mental illness need to address these issues. What facilitates healthcare is not just removing the barriers to receiving healthcare services but instead involves more interpersonal aspects of healthcare such as liking your provider, being able to talk with your provider, feeling your provider cares about you and listens to you. Structural supports such as also being in mental health services, having systems for remembering appointments, and/or having appointment times that are convenient also facilitate seeking healthcare. Facilitating healthcare seeking also seems to involve a sense of agency—looking forward to taking charge of your health and feeling capable of following healthcare provider instructions. Healthcare systems for people with mental illness need to support these facilitators to give care-seekers the support they need. Key points are provided on how organizations and staff can work more effectively in implementing patient centered care.},

Contextually tailored suggestions could be delivered up to five times per day at user-selected times. At each of these five times, for each participant on each day of the study, HeartSteps randomized whether to provide an activity suggestion, and, if so, whether to provide a walking or an antisedentary suggestion. We used a centered and weighted least squares method to analyze the effect of suggestions on the 30-min step count following suggestion randomization.Averaging over study days and types of activity suggestions, delivering a suggestion versus no suggestion increased the 30-min step count by 14\% (p = .06), 35 additional steps over the 253-step average. The effect was not evenly distributed in time. Providing any type of suggestion versus no suggestion initially increased the step count by 66\% (167 steps; p \&lt; .01), but this effect diminished over time. Averaging over study days, delivering a walking suggestion versus no suggestion increased the average step count by 24\% (59 steps; p = .02). This increase was greater at the start of study (107\% or 271 additional steps; p \&lt; .01), but decreased over time.

	abstract = {Objective

The DSM-5 Field Trials were designed to obtain precise (standard error {\textless}0.1) estimates of the intraclass kappa as a measure of the degree to which two clinicians could independently agree on the presence or absence of selected DSM-5 diagnoses when the same patient was interviewed on separate occasions, in clinical settings, and evaluated with usual clinical interview methods.

Method

Eleven academic centers in the United States and Canada were selected, and each was assigned several target diagnoses frequently treated in that setting. Consecutive patients visiting a site during the study were screened and stratified on the basis of DSM-IV diagnoses or symptomatic presentations. Patients were randomly assigned to two clinicians for a diagnostic interview; clinicians were blind to any previous diagnosis. All data were entered directly via an Internet-based software system to a secure central server. Detailed research design and statistical methods are presented in an accompanying article.

Results

There were a total of 15 adult and eight child/adolescent diagnoses for which adequate sample sizes were obtained to report adequately precise estimates of the intraclass kappa. Overall, five diagnoses were in the very good range (kappa=0.60–0.79), nine in the good range (kappa=0.40–0.59), six in the questionable range (kappa=0.20–0.39), and three in the unacceptable range (kappa values {\textless}0.20). Eight diagnoses had insufficient sample sizes to generate precise kappa estimates at any site.

Conclusions

Most diagnoses adequately tested had good to very good reliability with these representative clinical populations assessed with usual clinical interview methods. Some diagnoses that were revised to encompass a broader spectrum of symptom expression or had a more dimensional approach tested in the good to very good range.},

The aim of this study is to test whether self-report provides information relevant to short-term treatment outcomes that is not captured by clinician-rating and vice versa. Methods In genome-based drugs for depression (GENDEP), 811 patients with major depressive disorder treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline were assessed with the clinician-rated Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the self-report Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D), 4,041 patients treated with citalopram were assessed with the clinician-rated and self-report versions of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C and QIDS-SR) in addition to HRSD. Results In GENDEP, baseline BDI significantly predicted outcome on MADRS/HRSD after adjusting for baseline MADRS/HRSD, explaining additional 3 to 4\% of variation in the clinician-rated outcomes (both P {\textless} .001). Likewise, each clinician-rated scale significantly predicted outcome on BDI after adjusting for baseline BDI and explained additional 1\% of variance in the self-reported outcome (both P {\textless} .001). The results were confirmed in STAR*D, where self-report and clinician-rated versions of the same instrument each uniquely contributed to the prediction of treatment outcome.

We calculated the effect size (Hedges' g) based on the self-report measures, the effect size based on the clinician-rated instruments, and the difference between these two effect sizes (Δg). A total of 48 studies including a total of 2462 participants was included in the meta-analysis. The differential effect size was Δg=0.20 (95\% CI: 0.10–0.30), indicating that clinician-rated instruments resulted in a significantly higher effect size than self-report instruments from the same studies. When we limited the effect size analysis to those studies comparing the HRSD with the BDI, the differential effect was somewhat smaller, but still statistically significant (Δg=0.15; 95\% CI: 0.03–0.27).

	abstract = {Mental health care is built around patient recall and report of clinical symptoms. However, memories of events and experiences rely on cognitive heuristics that influence our recall. The peak-end bias, which refers to the tendency for the most intense and proximate aspects of an experience to disproportionately influence our memory, has been understudied in the context of mental health symptoms and may unduly influence self-reported symptoms, even in the context of standardized assessments. To determine whether the peak-end bias applies to the report of depressive symptoms on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessment, we compared two scores from daily mood assessments collected over a 2-week period from 4,322 medical interns (56\% women; 60\% non-Hispanic White). The peak-end-mood score, which averaged the single lowest and most recent mood scores over 2 weeks had a significantly stronger correlation with the PHQ-9 than the mean-mood score, which averaged all mood scores during the 2 weeks. Likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics provided further support that the peak-end-mood score was a significantly better predictor of depression than the mean-mood score. Results were consistent when limiting the sample to those with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, and when only examining the two primary mood items as the dependent variable. These findings provide evidence for a modest peak-end recall bias for mood and depressive symptoms.

Mobile and automated technologies are increasingly becoming integrated into mental healthcare and assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine how automated daily mood ratings are related to the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9), a standard measure in the screening and tracking of depression symptoms.

Results
There was a significant relationship between daily mood scores and one-week average mood scores and PHQ-9 scores controlling for linear change in depression scores. PHQ9 scores were not related to the average of two week mood ratings. This study also constructed models using variance, maximum, and minimum values of mood ratings in the preceding week and two-week periods as predictors of PHQ-9. None of these variables significantly predicted PHQ-9 scores when controlling for daily mood ratings and the corresponding averages for each period.

Limitations
This study only assessed patients who were in treatment for depression therefore do not account for the relationship between text message mood ratings for those who are not depressed. The sample was also predominantly Spanish speaking and low-income making generalizability to other populations uncertain.

Conclusions
Our results show that automatic text message based mood ratings can be a clinically useful proxy for the PHQ9. Importantly, this approach avoids the limitations of the PHQ9 administration, which include length and a higher requirement for literacy.},

We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

The network approach, in contrast, assumes that psychopathology results from the causal interplay between psychiatric symptoms and focuses specifically on these symptoms and their complex associations. By using a sophisticated network analysis technique, this study constructed an empirically based network structure of 120 psychiatric symptoms of twelve major DSM-IV diagnoses using cross-sectional data of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, second wave; N = 34,653). The resulting network demonstrated that symptoms within the same diagnosis showed differential associations and indicated that the strategy of summing symptoms, as in current classification systems, leads to loss of information. In addition, some symptoms showed strong connections with symptoms of other diagnoses, and these specific symptom pairs, which both concerned overlapping and non-overlapping symptoms, may help to explain the comorbidity across diagnoses. Taken together, our findings indicated that psychopathology is very complex and can be more adequately captured by sophisticated network models than current classification systems. The network approach is, therefore, promising in improving our understanding of psychopathology and moving our field forward.},

Data were analyzed from April 2022 to June 2023.Patients with MDD and healthy controls.Diagnostic classification accuracy was quantified on an individual level using an extensive ML-based multivariate approach across a comprehensive range of neuroimaging modalities, including structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging as well as a polygenic risk score for depression.Of 1801 included participants, 1162 (64.5\%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 36.1 (13.1) years. There were a total of 856 patients with MDD (47.5\%) and 945 healthy controls (52.5\%). The MNC replication sample included 1198 individuals (362 with MDD [30.1\%] and 836 healthy controls [69.9\%]).

Findings were replicated within study sites and also observed in structural magnetic resonance imaging within MNC. Under simulated conditions of perfect reliability, performance did not significantly improve.

	abstract = {Background
The DSM-5 encompasses a wide range of symptoms for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Symptoms are commonly added up to sum-scores, and thresholds differentiate between healthy and depressed individuals. The underlying assumption is that all patients diagnosed with MDD have a similar condition, and that sum-scores accurately reflect the severity of this condition. To test this assumption, we examined the number of DSM-5 depression symptom patterns in the “Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression” (STAR*D) study.
Methods
We investigated the number of unique symptom profiles reported by 3703 depressed outpatients at the beginning of the first treatment stage of STAR*D.
Results
Overall, we identified 1030 unique symptom profiles. Of these profiles, 864 profiles (83.9\%) were endorsed by five or fewer subjects, and 501 profiles (48.6\%) were endorsed by only one individual. The most common symptom profile exhibited a frequency of only 1.8\%. Controlling for overall depression severity did not reduce the amount of observed heterogeneity.
Limitations
Symptoms were dichotomized to construct symptom profiles. Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported medical conditions for which prescribed medications may have affected symptom presentation.
Conclusions
The substantial symptom variation among individuals who all qualify for one diagnosis calls into question the status of MDD as a specific consistent syndrome and offers a potential explanation for the difficulty in documenting treatment efficacy. We suggest that the analysis of individual symptoms, their patterns, and their causal associations will provide insights that could not be discovered in studies relying on only sum-scores.},

These issues raise grave concerns about common uses of depression measures, such as for diagnosis or tracking treatment progress. We argue that shortcomings arise because the measurement of depression rests on shaky methodological and theoretical foundations. Moving forward, we need to break with the field’s tradition, which has, for decades, divorced theories about depression from how we measure it. Instead, we suggest that epistemic iteration, an iterative exchange between theory and measurement, provides a crucial avenue for progressing how we measure depression. Depressive disorders are among the leading causes of global disease burden.

Creating novel, unobtrusive measures of resilience would provide an accessible approach to evaluate symptom susceptibility without the perceived stigma of formal mental health assessments. In this work, we created a system to find indicators of resilience using passive wearable sensors and smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This system identified indicators of resilience during a medical internship, the high stress first-year of a residency program. We then created density estimation approaches to predict these indicators before mental health changes occurred, and validated whether the predicted indicators were also associated with resilience. Our system identified resilience indicators associated with physical activity (step count), sleeping behavior, reduced heart rate, increased mood, and reduced mood variability. Density estimation models were able to replicate a subset of the associations between sleeping behavior, heart rate, and resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first methodology to identify and predict indicators of resilience using passive sensing and EMA. Researchers studying resident mental health can apply this approach to design resilience-building interventions and prevent mental health symptom development.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of mental health among undergraduate students across the college years is of critical importance, particularly during a global pandemic. In our study, we track two cohorts of first-year students at Dartmouth College for four years, both on and off campus, creating the longest longitudinal mobile sensing study to date. Using passive sensor data, surveys, and interviews, we capture changing behaviors before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Our findings reveal the pandemic's impact on students' mental health, gender based behavioral differences, impact of changing living conditions and evidence of persistent behavioral patterns as the pandemic subsides. We observe that while some behaviors return to normal, others remain elevated. Tracking over 200 undergraduate students from high school to graduation, our study provides invaluable insights into changing behaviors, resilience and mental health in college life. Conducting a long-term study with frequent phone OS updates poses significant challenges for mobile sensing apps, data completeness and compliance. Our results offer new insights for Human-Computer Interaction researchers, educators and administrators regarding college life pressures. We also detail the public release of the de-identified College Experience Study dataset used in this paper and discuss a number of open research questions that could be studied using the public dataset.},

We propose a deep neural network framework, the Locally Connected Long Short-Term Memory Denoising AutoEncoder (LC-LSTM-DAE), to automatically extract features from passively collected raw sensor data and perform personalized prediction of self-reported mood, health, and stress scores with high precision. We enabled personalized learning of features by finetuning the general representation model with participant-specific data. The framework was evaluated using wearable sensor data and wellbeing labels collected from college students (total 6391 days from N=239). Sensor data include skin temperature, skin conductance, and acceleration; wellbeing labels include self-reported mood, health and stress scored 0 - 100. Compared to the prediction performance based on hand-crafted features, the proposed framework achieved higher precision with a smaller number of features. We also provide statistical interpretation and visual explanation to the automatically learned features and the prediction models. Our results show the possibility of predicting self-reported mood, health, and stress accurately using an interpretable deep learning framework, ultimately for developing real-time health and wellbeing monitoring and intervention systems that can benefit various populations.},

	abstract = {Stress is associated with numerous chronic health conditions, both mental and physical. However, the heterogeneity of these associations at the individual level is poorly understood. While data generated from individuals in their day-to-day lives “in the wild” may best represent the heterogeneity of stress, gathering these data and separating signals from noise is challenging. In this work, we report findings from a major data collection effort using Digital Health Technologies (DHTs) and frontline healthcare workers. We provide insights into stress “in the wild”, by using robust methods for its identification from multimodal data and quantifying its heterogeneity. Here we analyze data from the Stress and Recovery in Frontline COVID-19 Workers study following 365 frontline healthcare workers for 4–6 months using wearable devices and smartphone app-based measures. Causal discovery is used to learn how the causal structure governing an individual’s self-reported symptoms and physiological features from DHTs differs between non-stress and potential stress states. Our methods uncover robust representations of potential stress states across a population of frontline healthcare workers. These representations reveal high levels of inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity in stress. We leverage multiple stress definitions that span different modalities (from subjective to physiological) to obtain a comprehensive view of stress, as these differing definitions rarely align in time. We show that these different stress definitions can be robustly represented as changes in the underlying causal structure on and off stress for individuals. This study is an important step toward better understanding potential underlying processes generating stress in individuals.},

These models are often trained on limited datasets which do not represent the fluidity of human functioning. In contrast, generalized models capture normative behaviors between individuals but lack precision in predicting individual outcomes. This paper aims to balance the tradeoff between one-for-each and one-for-all models by clustering individuals on mutable behaviors and conducting cluster-specific predictions of psychological constructs in a multimodal sensing dataset of 754 individuals. Specifically, we situate our modeling on social media that has exhibited capability in inferring psychosocial attributes. We hypothesize that complementing social media data with offline sensor data can help to personalize and improve predictions. We cluster individuals on physical behaviors captured via Bluetooth, wearables, and smartphone sensors. We build contextualized models predicting psychological constructs trained on each cluster's social media data and compare their performance against generalized models trained on all individuals' data. The comparison reveals no difference in predicting affect and a decline in predicting cognitive ability, but an improvement in predicting personality, anxiety, and sleep quality. We construe that our approach improves predicting psychological constructs sharing theoretical associations with physical behavior. We also find how social media language associates with offline behavioral contextualization. Our work bears implications in understanding the nuanced strengths and weaknesses of personalized predictions, and how the effectiveness may vary by multiple factors. This work reveals the importance of taking a critical stance on evaluating the effectiveness before investing efforts in personalization.},

CrossCheck is the ﬁrst step towards the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention. In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically signiﬁcant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smartphone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6\% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-speciﬁc data to quickly adapt to new users.},

Behavioral rhythms, such as sleep rhythm, are usually disrupted in people with schizophrenia. As such, behavioral rhythm sensing with smartphones and machine learning can help better understand and predict their symptoms. Our goal is to predict fine-grained symptom changes with interpretable models. We computed rhythm-based features from 61 participants with 6,132 days of data and used multi-task learning to predict their ecological momentary assessment scores for 10 different symptom items. By taking into account both the similarities and differences between different participants and symptoms, our multi-task learning models perform statistically significantly better than the models trained with single-task learning for predicting patients’ individual symptom trajectories, such as feeling depressed, social, and calm and hearing voices. We also found different subtypes for each of the symptoms by applying unsupervised clustering to the feature weights in the models. Taken together, compared to the features used in the previous studies, our rhythm features not only improved models’ prediction accuracy but also provided better interpretability for how patients’ behavioral rhythms and the rhythms of their environments influence their symptom conditions. This will enable both the patients and clinicians to monitor how these factors affect a patient’s condition and how to mitigate the influence of these factors. As such, we envision that our solution allows early detection and early intervention before a patient’s condition starts deteriorating without requiring extra effort from patients and clinicians.},

We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather. Empirical results demonstrate that using MTL to account for individual differences provides large performance improvements over traditional machine learning methods and provides personalized, actionable insights.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Patient- or person-centered care (PCC) integrates people’s preferences, values, and beliefs into health decision-making. Gaps exist for defining and implementing PCC; therefore, we aimed to identify core elements of PCC and synthesize implementation facilitators and barriers.
Methods
We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (umbrella review) and included peer-reviewed literature for adults in community/primary care settings. Two reviewers independently screened at Level 1 and 2, extracted data and appraised the quality of reviews. Three reviewers conducted a thematic analysis, and we present a narrative synthesis of findings.
Results
There were 2371 citations screened, and 10 systematic reviews included. We identified 10 PCC definitions with common elements, such as patient empowerment, patient individuality, and a biopsychosocial approach. Implementation factors focused on communication, training healthcare providers, and organizational structure.
Conclusions
We provide a synthesis of key PCC elements to include in a future definition, and an overview of elements to consider for implementing PCC into practice. We extend existing literature by identifying clinician empowerment and culture change at the systems-level as two future areas to prioritize to enable routine integration of PCC into practice.
Practice implications
Findings may be useful for researchers and or health providers delivering and evaluating PCC.},

Self-report scores were compared to clinician's ratings on comparable personality and symptom dimensions on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Work Behavior Inventory (WBI), and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). The influence of insight was determined using the Scale for Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). In the first analysis, clinician SUMD ratings of patient insight were associated with self-report accuracy. In a second analysis, patients were categorized into good and poor insight groups based on SUMD ratings and compared on self-report and clinician report variables. Results suggest that poor insight patients accurately report less Neuroticism and Agreeableness, and more Psychoticism than good insight patients, but individuals with poor insight wish to present themselves as more extraverted than they actually are, and they are likely to be more certain of their perceptions than they should be. It appears that self-report measures may be valid for most personality and symptom domains.},

To investigate their effects, we deployed these explanations to 1150 users on QuickDraw, an online platform where users draw images and see whether a recognizer has correctly guessed the intended drawing. When the algorithm failed to recognize the drawing, those who received normative explanations felt they had a better understanding of the system, and perceived the system to have higher capability. However, comparative explanations did not always improve perceptions of the algorithm, possibly because they sometimes exposed limitations of the algorithm and may have led to surprise. These findings suggest that examples can serve as a vehicle for explaining algorithmic behavior, but point to relative advantages and disadvantages of using different kinds of examples, depending on the goal.},

To inform future research and policy, these four approaches are addressed through four dimensions of impact: access to care, quality, clinician-patient relationship, and patient self-disclosure and sharing.

In some individuals, these reinforcing rewards can induce maladaptive, problematic social media use, with symptoms similar to substance use disorders. This problematic social media use has been associated with poorer mental health. Previous studies have demonstrated that social support can protect against poor mental health. People can receive social support both in real-life and on social media, however, so we investigated whether these two types of social support mediate the relationship between problematic social media use and poor mental health. We conducted an online survey, collecting measures of problematic social media use and mental health (depression, anxiety, and social isolation), as well as measures of real-life social support and social support received on social media. We then performed a path analysis on these data. Our analysis revealed that problematic social media use was significantly associated with decreased real-life social support and increased social support on social media. Importantly, real-life social support was then associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and social isolation, while social support on social media was not associated with these mental health measures. Our findings reveal the value of real-life social support when considering the relationship between problematic social media use and mental health.

	abstract = {Background
The few studies that have investigated the relationship between mobile phone use and sleep have mainly been conducted among children and adolescents. In adults, very little is known about mobile phone usage in bed our after lights out. This cross-sectional study set out to examine the association between bedtime mobile phone use and sleep among adults.
Methods
A sample of 844 Flemish adults (18–94 years old) participated in a survey about electronic media use and sleep habits. Self-reported sleep quality, daytime fatigue and insomnia were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and the Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS), respectively. Data were analyzed using hierarchical and multinomial regression analyses.
Results
Half of the respondents owned a smartphone, and six out of ten took their mobile phone with them to the bedroom. Sending/receiving text messages and/or phone calls after lights out significantly predicted respondents' scores on the PSQI, particularly longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, more sleep disturbance and more daytime dysfunction. Bedtime mobile phone use predicted respondents' later self-reported rise time, higher insomnia score and increased fatigue. Age significantly moderated the relationship between bedtime mobile phone use and fatigue, rise time, and sleep duration. An increase in bedtime mobile phone use was associated with more fatigue and later rise times among younger respondents (≤ 41.5 years old and ≤ 40.8 years old respectively); but it was related to an earlier rise time and shorter sleep duration among older respondents (≥ 60.15 years old and ≥ 66.4 years old respectively).
Conclusion
Findings suggest that bedtime mobile phone use is negatively related to sleep outcomes in adults, too. It warrants continued scholarly attention as the functionalities of mobile phones evolve rapidly and exponentially.},

However, little is known about the subjective experience of anhedonia, and it is rarely targeted in psychological treatment for depression. The aim of this study is to examine how young people experience anhedonia in the context of depression. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 adolescents with a primary diagnosis of depression (N = 12) or elevated depressive symptoms (N = 22). Thematic analysis was used to identify important aspects of adolescents’ experiences. Four main themes were identified: (1) experiencing a loss of joy and a flattening of emotion; (2) struggling with motivation and active engagement; (3) losing a sense of connection and belonging; and (4) questioning sense of self, purpose, and the bigger picture. The results challenge the framing of anhedonia as simply the loss of interest and pleasure. Adolescents reported a range of experiences that mapped closely onto the cluster of negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia and were similar to the sense of ‘apathy’ characteristic in Parkinson’s disease. This highlights the potential benefit of taking a trans-diagnostic approach to understanding and treating reward deficits associated with mental health problems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital health-tracking tools are changing mental health care by giving patients the ability to collect passively measured patient-generated health data (PGHD; ie, data collected from connected devices with little to no patient effort). Although there are existing clinical guidelines for how mental health clinicians should use more traditional, active forms of PGHD for clinical decision-making, there is less clarity on how passive PGHD can be used.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to understand mental health clinicians' perceptions and concerns regarding the use of technology-enabled, passively collected PGHD for clinical decision-making. Our interviews sought to understand participants' current experiences with and visions for using passive PGHD.
METHODS: Mental health clinicians providing outpatient services were recruited to participate in semistructured interviews. Interview recordings were deidentified, transcribed, and qualitatively coded to identify overarching themes.
RESULTS: Overall, 12 mental health clinicians (n=11, 92\% psychiatrists and n=1, 8\% clinical psychologist) were interviewed. We identified 4 overarching themes. First, passive PGHD are patient driven-we found that current passive PGHD use was patient driven, not clinician driven; participating clinicians only considered passive PGHD for clinical decision-making when patients brought passive data to clinical encounters. The second theme was active versus passive data as subjective versus objective data-participants viewed the contrast between active and passive PGHD as a contrast between interpretive data on patients' mental health and objective information on behavior. Participants believed that prioritizing passive over self-reported, active PGHD would reduce opportunities for patients to reflect upon their mental health, reducing treatment engagement and raising questions about how passive data can best complement active data for clinical decision-making. Third, passive PGHD must be delivered at appropriate times for action-participants were concerned with the real-time nature of passive PGHD; they believed that it would be infeasible to use passive PGHD for real-time patient monitoring outside clinical encounters and more feasible to use passive PGHD during clinical encounters when clinicians can make treatment decisions. The fourth theme was protecting patient privacy-participating clinicians wanted to protect patient privacy within passive PGHD-sharing programs and discussed opportunities to refine data sharing consent to improve transparency surrounding passive PGHD collection and use.
CONCLUSIONS: Although passive PGHD has the potential to enable more contextualized measurement, this study highlights the need for building and disseminating an evidence base describing how and when passive measures should be used for clinical decision-making. This evidence base should clarify how to use passive data alongside more traditional forms of active PGHD, when clinicians should view passive PGHD to make treatment decisions, and how to protect patient privacy within passive data-sharing programs. Clear evidence would more effectively support the uptake and effective use of these novel tools for both patients and their clinicians.},

Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling are Nonprobability Sampling Techniques that a researcher uses to choose a sample of subjects/units from a population. Although, Nonprobability sampling has a lot of limitations due to the subjective nature in choosing the sample and thus it is not good representative of the population, but it is useful especially when randomization is impossible like when the population is very large. It can be useful when the researcher has limited resources, time and workforce. It can also be used when the research does not aim to generate results that will be used to create generalizations pertaining to the entire population. Therefore, there is a need to use nonprobability sampling techniques. The aim of this study is to compare among the two nonrandom sampling techniques in order to know whether one technique is better or useful than the other. Different articles were reviewed to compare between Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling and it is concluded that the choice of the techniques (Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling) depends on the nature and type of the research.},

This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients' complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that is undiagnosed and untreated in half of all cases. Wearable activity trackers collect fine-grained sensor data characterizing the behavior and physiology of users (ie, digital biomarkers), which could be used for timely, unobtrusive, and scalable depression screening.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of digital biomarkers, based on sensor data from consumer-grade wearables, to detect risk of depression in a working population.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 290 healthy working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 devices for 14 consecutive days and completed a health survey, including screening for depressive symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), at baseline and 2 weeks later. We extracted a range of known and novel digital biomarkers characterizing physical activity, sleep patterns, and circadian rhythms from wearables using steps, heart rate, energy expenditure, and sleep data. Associations between severity of depressive symptoms and digital biomarkers were examined with Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders, including sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption, smoking, self-rated health, subjective sleep characteristics, and loneliness. Supervised machine learning with statistically selected digital biomarkers was used to predict risk of depression (ie, symptom severity and screening status). We used varying cutoff scores from an acceptable PHQ-9 score range to define the depression group and different subsamples for classification, while the set of statistically selected digital biomarkers remained the same. For the performance evaluation, we used k-fold cross-validation and obtained accuracy measures from the holdout folds.
RESULTS: A total of 267 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 33 (SD 8.6, range 21-64) years. Out of 267 participants, there was a mild female bias displayed (n=170, 63.7\%). The majority of the participants were Chinese (n=211, 79.0\%), single (n=163, 61.0\%), and had a university degree (n=238, 89.1\%). We found that a greater severity of depressive symptoms was robustly associated with greater variation of nighttime heart rate between 2 AM and 4 AM and between 4 AM and 6 AM; it was also associated with lower regularity of weekday circadian rhythms based on steps and estimated with nonparametric measures of interdaily stability and autocorrelation as well as fewer steps-based daily peaks. Despite several reliable associations, our evidence showed limited ability of digital biomarkers to detect depression in the whole sample of working adults. However, in balanced and contrasted subsamples comprised of depressed and healthy participants with no risk of depression (ie, no or minimal depressive symptoms), the model achieved an accuracy of 80\%, a sensitivity of 82\%, and a specificity of 78\% in detecting subjects at high risk of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital biomarkers that have been discovered and are based on behavioral and physiological data from consumer wearables could detect increased risk of depression and have the potential to assist in depression screening, yet current evidence shows limited predictive ability. Machine learning models combining these digital biomarkers could discriminate between individuals with a high risk of depression and individuals with no risk.},

	abstract = {Depression is a multifaceted illness with large interindividual variability in clinical response to treatment. In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.},

Seventeen patients with schizophrenia in active treatment at a state mental health clinic in Boston used the Beiwe app on their personal smartphone for up to 3 months. By testing for changes in mobility patterns and social behavior over time as measured through smartphone use, we were able to identify statistically significant anomalies in patient behavior in the days prior to relapse. We found that the rate of behavioral anomalies detected in the 2 weeks prior to relapse was 71\% higher than the rate of anomalies during other time periods. Our findings show how passive smartphone data, data collected in the background during regular phone use without active input from the subjects, can provide an unprecedented and detailed view into patient behavior outside the clinic.

	abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are chronic conditions, but the severity of symptomatic experiences and functional impairments vacillate over the course of illness. Developing unobtrusive remote monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of impending symptomatic relapses would allow clinicians to intervene before the patient’s condition worsens.
Objective: In this study, we aim to create the first models, exclusively using passive sensing data from a smartphone, to predict behavioral anomalies that could indicate early warning signs of a psychotic relapse.
Methods: Data used to train and test the models were collected during the CrossCheck study. Hourly features derived from smartphone passive sensing data were extracted from 60 patients with SSDs (42 nonrelapse and 18 relapse {\textgreater}1 time throughout the study) and used to train models and test performance. We trained 2 types of encoder-decoder neural network models and a clustering-based local outlier factor model to predict behavioral anomalies that occurred within the 30-day period before a participant's date of relapse (the near relapse period). Models were trained to recreate participant behavior on days of relative health (DRH, outside of the near relapse period), following which a threshold to the recreation error was applied to predict anomalies. The neural network model architecture and the percentage of relapse participant data used to train all models were varied.
Results: A total of 20,137 days of collected data were analyzed, with 726 days of data (0.037\%) within any 30-day near relapse period. The best performing model used a fully connected neural network autoencoder architecture and achieved a median sensitivity of 0.25 (IQR 0.15-1.00) and specificity of 0.88 (IQR 0.14-0.96; a median 108\% increase in behavioral anomalies near relapse). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the best performing model to identify behavioral features that had a medium-to-large effect (Cohen d{\textgreater}0.5) in distinguishing anomalies near relapse from DRH among 4 participants who relapsed multiple times throughout the study. Qualitative validation using clinical notes collected during the original CrossCheck study showed that the identified features from our analysis were presented to clinicians during relapse events.
Conclusions: Our proposed method predicted a higher rate of anomalies in patients with SSDs within the 30-day near relapse period and can be used to uncover individual-level behaviors that change before relapse. This approach will enable technologists and clinicians to build unobtrusive digital mental health tools that can predict incipient relapse in SSDs.},

Prior work has trained models using data from single longitudinal studies, collected from demographically homogeneous populations, over short time periods, using a single data collection platform or mobile application. The generalizability of model performance across studies has not been assessed. This study presents a first analysis to understand if models trained using combined longitudinal study data to predict mental health symptoms generalize across current publicly available data. We combined data from the CrossCheck (individuals living with schizophrenia) and StudentLife (university students) studies. In addition to assessing generalizability, we explored if personalizing models to align mobile sensing data, and oversampling less-represented severe symptoms, improved model performance. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) results were reported. Two symptoms (sleep quality and stress) had similar question-response structures across studies and were used as outcomes to explore cross-dataset prediction. Models trained with combined data were more likely to be predictive (significant improvement over predicting training data mean) than models trained with single-study data. Expected model performance improved if the distance between training and validation feature distributions decreased using combined versus single-study data. Personalization aligned each LOSO-CV participant with training data, but only improved predicting CrossCheck stress. Oversampling significantly improved severe symptom classification sensitivity and positive predictive value, but decreased model specificity. Taken together, these results show that machine learning models trained on combined longitudinal study data may generalize across heterogeneous datasets. We encourage researchers to disseminate collected de-identified mobile sensing and mental health symptom data, and further standardize data types collected across studies to enable better assessment of model generalizability.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms.

Objective
The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity.

Methods
A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data.

Results
A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score {\textless}5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5\%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5\%.

Conclusions
Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.},

	abstract = {The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.},

Recent advances in research on mobile sensing technologies and machine learning have suggested that a person’s depression can be passively measured by observing patterns in people’s mobility behaviors. However, the majority of work in this area has relied on highly homogeneous samples, most frequently college students. In this study, we analyse over 57 million GPS data points to show that the same procedure that leads to high prediction accuracy in a homogeneous student sample (N = 57; AUC = 0.82), leads to accuracies only slightly higher than chance in a U.S.-wide sample that is heterogeneous in its socio-demographic composition as well as mobility patterns (N = 5,262; AUC = 0.57). This pattern holds across three different modelling approaches which consider both linear and non-linear relationships. Further analyses suggest that the prediction accuracy is low across different socio-demographic groups, and that training the models on more homogeneous subsamples does not substantially improve prediction accuracy. Overall, the findings highlight the challenge of applying mobility-based predictions of depression at scale.},

	abstract = {Mood inference with mobile sensing data has been studied in ubicomp literature over the last decade. This inference enables context-aware and personalized user experiences in general mobile apps and valuable feedback and interventions in mobile health apps. However, even though model generalization issues have been highlighted in many studies, the focus has always been on improving the accuracies of models using different sensing modalities and machine learning techniques, with datasets collected in homogeneous populations. In contrast, less attention has been given to studying the performance of mood inference models to assess whether models generalize to new countries. In this study, we collected a mobile sensing dataset with 329K self-reports from 678 participants in eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, UK) to assess the effect of geographical diversity on mood inference models. We define and evaluate country-specific (trained and tested within a country), continent-specific (trained and tested within a continent), country-agnostic (tested on a country not seen on training data), and multi-country (trained and tested with multiple countries) approaches trained on sensor data for two mood inference tasks with population-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized) models. We show that partially personalized country-specific models perform the best yielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores of the range 0.78--0.98 for two-class (negative vs. positive valence) and 0.76--0.94 for three-class (negative vs. neutral vs. positive valence) inference. Further, with the country-agnostic approach, we show that models do not perform well compared to country-specific settings, even when models are partially personalized. We also show that continent-specific models outperform multi-country models in the case of Europe. Overall, we uncover generalization issues of mood inference models to new countries and how the geographical similarity of countries might impact mood inference.},

	abstract = {There is a growing body of research revealing that longitudinal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearable devices can capture daily behavior signals for human behavior modeling, such as depression detection. Most prior studies build and evaluate machine learning models using data collected from a single population. However, to ensure that a behavior model can work for a larger group of users, its generalizability needs to be verified on multiple datasets from different populations. We present the first work evaluating cross-dataset generalizability of longitudinal behavior models, using depression detection as an application. We collect multiple longitudinal passive mobile sensing datasets with over 500 users from two institutes over a two-year span, leading to four institute-year datasets. Using the datasets, we closely re-implement and evaluated nine prior depression detection algorithms. Our experiment reveals the lack of model generalizability of these methods. We also implement eight recently popular domain generalization algorithms from the machine learning community. Our results indicate that these methods also do not generalize well on our datasets, with barely any advantage over the naive baseline of guessing the majority. We then present two new algorithms with better generalizability. Our new algorithm, Reorder, significantly and consistently outperforms existing methods on most cross-dataset generalization setups. However, the overall advantage is incremental and still has great room for improvement. Our analysis reveals that the individual differences (both within and between populations) may play the most important role in the cross-dataset generalization challenge. Finally, we provide an open-source benchmark platform GLOBEM- short for Generalization of Longitudinal BEhavior Modeling - to consolidate all 19 algorithms. GLOBEM can support researchers in using, developing, and evaluating different longitudinal behavior modeling methods. We call for researchers' attention to model generalizability evaluation for future longitudinal human behavior modeling studies.},

	abstract = {Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling the development of clinical support tools (CSTs) in psychiatry to facilitate the review of patient data and inform clinical care. To promote their successful integration and prevent over-reliance, it is important to understand how psychiatrists will respond to information provided by AI-based CSTs, particularly if it is incorrect. We conducted an experiment to examine psychiatrists’ perceptions of AI-based CSTs for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) and to determine whether perceptions interacted with the quality of CST information. Eighty-three psychiatrists read clinical notes about a hypothetical patient with MDD and reviewed two CSTs embedded within a single dashboard: the note’s summary and a treatment recommendation. Psychiatrists were randomised to believe the source of CSTs was either AI or another psychiatrist, and across four notes, CSTs provided either correct or incorrect information. Psychiatrists rated the CSTs on various attributes. Ratings for note summaries were less favourable when psychiatrists believed the notes were generated with AI as compared to another psychiatrist, regardless of whether the notes provided correct or incorrect information. A smaller preference for psychiatrist-generated information emerged in ratings of attributes that reflected the summary’s accuracy or its inclusion of important information from the full clinical note. Ratings for treatment recommendations were also less favourable when their perceived source was AI, but only when recommendations were correct. There was little evidence that clinical expertise or familiarity with AI impacted results. These findings suggest that psychiatrists prefer human-derived CSTs. This preference was less pronounced for ratings that may have prompted a deeper review of CST information (i.e. a comparison with the full clinical note to evaluate the summary’s accuracy or completeness, assessing an incorrect treatment recommendation), suggesting a role of heuristics. Future work should explore other contributing factors and downstream implications for integrating AI into psychiatric care.},

	abstract = {Background 
          N-of-1 trials (multiple crossover studies conducted in single individuals) may be ideal for determining individual treatment effects and as a tool to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) in a population. However, comprehensive data on n-of-1 trial methodology and analysis is lacking. We performed this study to describe n-of-1 trial characteristics, examine treatment changes resulting from n-of-1 trial participation, and to determine if trial reporting is adequate for estimating HTE.
          Methods 
          We undertook a systematic review of n-of-1 trials published between 1985 and December 2010. Included trials were those having individual treatment episodes as the unit of randomization and reporting individual-specific treatment effects. We abstracted trial characteristics, treatment change information, and analytic methods.
          Results 
          We included 108 trials reporting on 2154 participants. Approximately half (49\%) of the trials used a statistical cutoff to determine a superior treatment, whereas the remainder used a graphical comparison (25\%) or a clinical significance cutoff (20\%). Sixty-seven trials, reporting on 488 people, provided treatment change information: 54\% of participants had subsequent treatment decisions consistent with the results of the trial, 8\% had decisions inconsistent with trial results, and 38\% had ambiguous results. Less than half of the trials (45\%) reported adequate information to facilitate the calculation of HTE.
          Conclusion 
          N-of-1 trials are a useful tool for enhancing therapeutic precision in a range of conditions and should be conducted more often. To facilitate future meta-analysis, and the estimation of HTE, researchers reporting n-of-1 trial results should clearly describe individual data.},

	abstract = {Background: While digital phenotyping smartphone apps can collect vast amounts of information on participants, less is known about how these data can be shared back. Data visualization is critical to ensuring applications of digital signals and biomarkers are more informed, ethical, and impactful. But little is known about how sharing of these data, especially at different levels from raw data through proposed biomarkers, impacts patients’ perceptions. Methods: We compared five different graphs generated from data created by the open source mindLAMP app that reflected different ways to share data, from raw data through digital biomarkers and correlation matrices. All graphs were shown to 28 participants, and the graphs’ usability was measured via the System Usability Scale (SUS). Additionally, participants were asked about their comfort sharing different kinds of data, administered the Digital Working Alliance Inventory (D-WAI), and asked if they would want to use these visualizations with care providers. Results: Of the five graphs shown to participants, the graph visualizing change in survey responses over the course of a week received the highest usability score, with the graph showing multiple metrics changing over a week receiving the lowest usability score. Participants were significantly more likely to be willing to share Global Positioning System data after viewing the graphs, and 25 of 28 participants agreed that they would like to use these graphs to communicate with their clinician. Discussion/Conclusions: Data visualizations can help participants and patients understand digital biomarkers and increase trust in how they are created. As digital biomarkers become more complex, simple visualizations may fail to capture their multiple dimensions, and new interactive data visualizations may be necessary to help realize their full value.},

	abstract = {Conventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compare treatment effectiveness to provide a basis for evidence-based treatments that can be generalized to the average patient. However, this information may not always be useful for treating individual patients. We present an alternative approach to identifying optimized treatments using experimental designs that focus on individuals. Personalized designs, or N-of-1 designs, provide both a functional analysis demonstrating that changes in patient symptoms are due to the treatment implemented and a comparative analysis of treatments. This approach is relevant in the zeitgeist of personalized medicine and provides clinicians with a paradigm for investigating optimal treatments for rare diseases in which RCTs are not feasible, identifying optimal treatments for patients with comorbidities who would be excluded from most RCTs, handling clinical situations in which patients respond idiosyncratically (either positively or negatively) to treatment, and shortening the gap between identification and implementation of an evidence-based treatment. These designs merge experimental analysis of behavior methods used for decades in psychology with new methodological and statistical advances to assess significance levels of change in individual patients, and they can be generalized to larger populations for meta-analytic purposes. This paper presents a case for why these models are needed, an overview of how to apply personalized designs for different types of clinical scenarios, and a brief discussion of issues associated with interpretation and implementation of personalized designs. Our goal is to empower pediatricians to take personalized trial designs into clinical practice to identify optimal treatments for their patients.},

We found that interacting with ML recommendations did not significantly improve clinicians’ treatment selection accuracy, assessed as concordance with expert psychopharmacologist consensus, compared to baseline scenarios in which clinicians made treatment decisions independently. Interacting with incorrect recommendations paired with explanations that included limited but easily interpretable information did lead to a significant reduction in treatment selection accuracy compared to baseline questions. These results suggest that incorrect ML recommendations may adversely impact clinician treatment selections and that explanations are insufficient for addressing overreliance on imperfect ML algorithms. More generally, our findings challenge the common assumption that clinicians interacting with ML tools will perform better than either clinicians or ML algorithms individually.},

As mental healthcare expands to smartphone apps and other technologies that may offer therapeutic interventions without a therapist involved, it is important to assess the impact of non-traditional therapeutic relationships.

Aims
To determine if there were any meaningful data regarding the digital therapeutic alliance in smartphone interventions for serious mental illnesses.

Method
A literature search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science).

Results
There were five studies that discuss the therapeutic alliance when a mobile application intervention is involved in therapy. However, in none of the studies was the digital therapeutic alliance the primary outcome. The studies looked at different mental health conditions, had different duration of technology use and used different methods for assessing the therapeutic alliance.

Conclusions
Assessing and optimising the digital therapeutic alliance holds the potential to make tools such as smartphone apps more effective and improve adherence to their use. However, the heterogeneous nature of the five studies we identified make it challenging to draw conclusions at this time. A measure is required to evaluate the digital therapeutic alliance.},

La structure attendue n'est pas confirmée. Une version alternative à 12 items (WAI-SR), consistante avec le modèle de Bordin (1979) a été développée à partir d'un des échantillons et validée sur l'autre. Le WAI-SR différencie mieux les dimensions d'alliance but, tâche et lien et corrèle bien avec d'autres mesures d'alliance. La dimension tâche était particulièrement saillante, comme attendu selon la théorie originale de Bordin. Des propriétés psychométriques additionnelles et l'analyse de la réponse théorique aux items du WAI-SR sont présentées. Resumen Sviluppo e validazione di una versione abbreviata modificata del Questionario di funzionamento dell' alleanza (WAI–Working Alliance Inventory). Il Questionario di funzionamento dell' Alleanza (WAI; Horvath \& Greenberg, 1989) e il Questionario di funzionamento dell' Alleanza \_/abbreviatot (WAI\_S; Tracey \& Kokotovic, 1989) sono misure usate ampiamente sull'alleanza nella terapia. Questo studio ha valutato la struttura di fattore della WAI e della WAI\_S con l'analisi fattoriale confermativa in due campioni (Ns\_/231 e 235). Le strutture supposte non sono state confermate. Un' alternativa della WAI a 12 items (Wai-Sr), in accordo con il modello del'alleanza di Bordin (1979), è stato sviluppato in uno dei due campioni e incrociato e validato nell'altro. La Wai-Sr meglio differenziava l'obiettivo, il compito ed il vincolo e ben correlava con le altre misure dell'alleanza.La dimensione del compito risultava particolarmente saliente, come previsto nella teoria originale di Bordin. Sono presentate le proprietà, l'analisi psicometriche supplementari e di teoria della Wai-Sr. Resumo Desenvolvimento e validação da versão curta revista do Inventário da Aliança Terapêutica O Inventário da Aliança Terapêutica (WAI; Horvath \& Greenberg, 1989) e a sua versão reduzida (WAI-S; Tracey \& Kokotovic, 1989) são frequentemente utilizadas na avaliação da aliança em terapia. Este estudo avaliou a estrutura factorial do WAI e WAI-S, utilizando análise factorial confirmatória, em duas amostras (Ns\_ 231 e 235). A estrutura hipotética não foi confirmada. Uma escala WAI alternativa de 12 itens (WAI-SR), consistente com o modelo de aliança de Bordin (1979), foi desenvolvida numa amostra e validada na outra. O WAI-SR diferenciou melhor as dimensões da aliança (Objectivos, Tarefas e Relação) e correlacionou-se bem com outras medidas da aliança A dimensão da Tarefa foi particularmente saliente, tal como esperado na teoria original de Bordin. Adicionalmente, são apresentadas propriedades psicométricas e análises de teoria de item resposta da WAI-SR Sommario Desarrollo y validación de una versión corta revisada del Inventario de Alianza de trabajo. El Inventario de Alianza de trabajo (Working Alliance Inventory, WAI, Horvath y Greenberg, 1989) y el Inventario de Alianza de trabajo- Breve (Working Alliance Inventory\_Short, WAI-S; Tracey y Kokotovic, 1989) son medidas ampliamente usadas de alianza terapéutica. Este estudio evaluó el factor estructura de la WAI y WAI-S con un análisis factorial confirmatorio en dos muestras (Ns\_231 y 235). Las estructuras hipotetizadas no fueron confirmadas. En una de las muestras se desarrolló y en la otra se validó en forma cruzada (cross-validated) un item 12 alternativo para la WAI (WAI-SR), consistente con el modelo de Bordin (1979) para la alianza. El WAI-SR diferenció mejor las dimensiones del Objetivo, la Tarea (Task) y la alianza vincular (Bond alliance) y se correlacionó bien con mediciones de otras alianzas. La dimensión Tarea (Task) fue particularmente relevante, como se esperaba según la teoría original de Bordin. Se presentan propiedades psicométricas adicionales y análisis teóricos de los items de respuesta del WAI-SR.},

	abstract = {Objective
To raise awareness among clinicians and epidemiologists that single-patient (n-of-1) trials are potentially useful for informing personalized treatment decisions for patients with chronic conditions.

Study Design and Setting
We reviewed the clinical and statistical literature on methods and applications of single-patient trials and then critically evaluated the needs for further methodological developments.

Results
Existing literature reports application of 2,154 single-patient trials in 108 studies for diverse clinical conditions; various recent commentaries advocate for wider application of such trials in clinical decision making. Preliminary evidence from several recent pilot acceptability studies suggests that single-patient trials have the potential for widespread acceptance by patients and clinicians as an effective modality for increasing the therapeutic precision. Bayesian and adaptive statistical methods hold promise for increasing the informational yield of single-patient trials while reducing participant burden, but are not widely used. Personalized applications of single-patient trials can be enhanced through further development and application of methodologies on adaptive trial design, stopping rules, network meta-analysis, washout methods, and methods for communicating trial findings to patients and clinicians.

Conclusions
Single-patient trials may be poised to emerge as an important part of the methodological armamentarium for comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research. By permitting direct estimation of individual treatment effects, they can facilitate finely graded individualized care, enhance therapeutic precision, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs.},

	abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

In TAM, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are hypothesized and empirically supported as fundamental determinants of user acceptance of a given IS/IT. A review of the IS and psychology literature, however, suggests that perceived usefulness can be of two distinct types: near-term usefulness and long-term usefulness. This paper reviews the concept of perceived usefulness and modifies TAM to include the two types of perceived usefulness. Data collected from nearly 285 administrative/clerical staff in a large organization were tested against the modified model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results of the study showed that, even though perceived near-term usefulness had the most significant influence on the behavioral intention to use a technology, perceived long-term usefulness also exerted a positive, though lesser, impact. No significant, direct relationship was found between ease of use and behavioral intention to use a technology. Implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed.},

	abstract = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are increasingly used by healthcare professionals for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment support. However, research has suggested that users often over-rely on system suggestions - even if the suggestions are wrong. Providing explanations could potentially mitigate misplaced trust in the system and over-reliance. In this paper, we explore how explanations are related to user trust and reliance, as well as what information users would find helpful to better understand the reliability of a system's decision-making. We investigated these questions through an exploratory user study in which healthcare professionals were observed using a CDSS prototype to diagnose hypothetic cases using fictional patients suffering from a balance-related disorder. Our results show that the amount of system confidence had only a slight effect on trust and reliance. More importantly, giving a fuller explanation of the facts used in making a diagnosis had a positive effect on trust but also led to over-reliance issues, whereas less detailed explanations made participants question the system's reliability and led to self-reliance problems. To help them in their assessment of the reliability of the system's decisions, study participants wanted better explanations to help them interpret the system's confidence, to verify that the disorder fit the suggestion, to better understand the reasoning chain of the decision model, and to make differential diagnoses. Our work is a first step toward improved CDSS design that better supports clinicians in making correct diagnoses.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Chronic pain, defined as pain persisting longer than 3 months, is more than an unpleasant sensory experience. Persistent negative emotions and emotional comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety, plague people with chronic pain leading to worsening pain intensity and increasing disability. While cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is the gold standard psychological treatment, recent evidence highlights that CBT lacks efficacy for the physical and emotional aspects of chronic pain. Increasingly, researchers are investigating emotion-centric psychological therapies. While treatment modalities vary, these interventions frequently target understanding emotions, and train individuals for an emotionally adaptive response. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to quantify the efficacy of emotion-centric interventions for the physical and emotional characteristics of chronic pain.

Methods/analysis
Electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL and Web of Science) will be systematically searched from inception to 28 April 2022 for randomised controlled trials. Studies that compare an emotion-centric intervention with another form of treatment or placebo/control for adults (≥18 years old) with chronic pain will be included. All treatment modes (eg, online or in-person), any duration and group-based or individual treatments will be included. Studies that do not investigate at least one emotion-centric treatment will be excluded. The primary outcome is pain intensity. Secondary outcomes include emotion dysregulation, depression, anxiety, affect, safety and intervention compliance. A quantitative synthesis using a random effects meta-analysis will be adopted. Risk of bias will be evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias V.2.0 with the certainty of evidence assessed according to Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Data permitting, subgroup analysis will be conducted for intervention type and pain condition.

Ethics and dissemination
Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review. Results may inform an efficacy study examining a new emotion-centric intervention for chronic pain. Dissemination will be through peer-reviewed publications and in conference presentations.

	abstract = {Background: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms.
Objective: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.
Methods: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain.
Results: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2\% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2\% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3\% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94\% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1\% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95\% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5\% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P\&lt;.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P\&lt;.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3, SD 2.6; P\&lt;.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P\&lt;.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6\% vs 47.1\% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76\%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80\%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43\%).
Conclusions: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

Concerns were raised about privacy and the impact of low scores on therapist confidence. Desired features included intervention labeling and transparency about how scores related to session content. Opportunities for asynchronous, remote, and targeted supervision were particularly valued. Stakeholder feedback suggests that automated fidelity measurement could augment supervision practices. Future research should examine the relations among use of such supervision tools, clinician skill, and client outcomes.},

In this study, we leverage the recent advances in large language models to conduct free-form, creative conversations with children. Consequently, we developed Mathemyths, a joint storytelling agent that takes turns co-creating stories with children while integrating mathematical terms into the evolving narrative. This paper details our development process, illustrating how prompt-engineering can optimize LLMs for educational contexts. Through a user study involving 35 children aged 4-8 years, our results suggest that when children interacted with Mathemyths, their learning of mathematical language was comparable to those who co-created stories with a human partner. However, we observed differences in how children engaged with co-creation partners of different natures. Overall, we believe that LLM applications, like Mathemyths, offer children a unique conversational experience pertaining to focused learning objectives.},

	abstract = {An s stage k name snowball sampling procedure is defined as follows: A random sample of individuals is drawn from a given finite population. (The kind of random sample will be discussed later in this section.) Each individual in the sample is asked to name k different individuals in the population, where k is a specified integer; for example, each individual may be asked to name his "k best friends," or the "k individuals with whom he most frequently associates," or the "k individuals whose opinions he most frequently seeks," etc. (For the sake of simplicity, we assume throughout that an individual cannot include himself in his list of k individuals.) The individuals who were not in the random sample but were named by individuals in it form the first stage. Each of the individuals in the first stage is then asked to name k different individuals. (We assume that the question asked of the individuals in the random sample and of those in each stage is the same and that k is the same.) The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first stage but were named by individuals who were in the first stage form the second stage. Each of the individuals in the second stage is then asked to name k different individuals. The individuals who were not in the random sample nor in the first or second stages but were named by individuals who were in the second stage form the third stage. Each of the individuals in the third stage is then asked to name k different individuals. This procedure is continued until each of the individuals in the sth stage has been asked to name k different individuals. The data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure can be utilized to make statistical inferences about various aspects of the relationships present in the population. The relationships present, in the hypothetical situation where each individual in the population is asked to name k different individuals, can be described by a matrix with rows and columns corresponding to the members of the population, rows for the individuals naming and columns for the individuals named, where the entry θij in the ith row and jth column is 1 if the ith individual in the population includes the jth individual among the k individuals he would name, and it is 0 otherwise. While the matrix of the θ's cannot be known in general unless every individual in the population is interviewed (i.e., asked to name k different individuals), it will be possible to make statistical inferences about various aspects of this matrix from the data obtained using an s stage k name snowball sampling procedure. For example, when s = k = 1, the number, M11, of mutual relationships present in the population (i.e., the number of values i with θij = θji = 1 for some value of \$j {\textgreater} i\$) can be estimated. The methods of statistical inference applied to the data obtained from an s stage k name snowball sample will of course depend on the kind of random sample drawn as the initial step. In most of the present paper, we shall suppose that a random sample (i.e., the "zero stage" in snowball sample) is drawn so that the probability, p, that a given individual in the population will be in the sample is independent of whether a different given individual has appeared. This kind of sampling has been called binomial sampling; the specified value of p (assumed known) has been called the sampling fraction [4]. This sampling scheme might also be described by saying that a given individual is included in the sample just when a coin, which has a probability p of "heads," comes up "heads," where the tosses of the coin from individual to individual are independent. (To each individual there corresponds an independent Bernoulli trial determining whether he will or will not be included in the sample.) This sampling scheme differs in some respects from the more usual models where the sample size is fixed in advance or where the ratio of the sample size to the population size (i.e., the sample size-population size ratio) is fixed. For binomial sampling, this ratio is a random variable whose expected value is p. (The variance of this ratio approaches zero as the population becomes infinite.) In some situations (where, for example, the variance of this ratio is near zero), mathematical results obtained for binomial sampling are sometimes quite similar to results obtained using some of the more usual sampling models (see [4], [7]; compare the variance formulas in [3] and [5]); in such cases it will often not make much difference, from a practical point of view, which sampling model is utilized. (In Section 6 of the present paper some results for snowball sampling based on an initial sample of the more usual kind are obtained and compared with results presented in the earlier sections of this paper obtained for snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample.) For snowball sampling based on an initial binomial sample, and with s = k = 1, so that each individual asked names just one other individual and there is just one stage beyond the initial sample, Section 2 of this paper discusses unbiased estimation of M11, the number of pairs of individuals in the population who would name each other. One of the unbiased estimators considered (among a certain specified class of estimators) has uniformly smallest variance when the population characteristics are unknown; this one is based on a sufficient statistic for a simplified summary of the data and is the only unbiased estimator of M11 based on that sufficient statistic (when the population characteristics are unknown). This estimator (when s = k = 1) has a smaller variance than a comparable minimum variance unbiased estimator computed from a larger random sample when s = 0 and k = 1 (i.e., where only the individuals in the random sample are interviewed) even where the expected number of individuals in the larger random sample (s = 0, k = 1) is equal to the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1 (i.e., the sum of the expected number of individuals in the initial sample and the maximum expected number of individuals in the first stage). In fact, the variance of the estimator when s = 0 and k = 1 is at least twice as large as the variance of the comparable estimator when s = k = 1 even where the expected number of individuals studied when s = 0 and k = 1 is as large as the maximum expected number of individuals studied when s = k = 1. Thus, for estimating M11, the sampling scheme with s = k = 1 is preferable to the sampling scheme with s = 0 and k = 1. Furthermore, we observe that when s = k = 1 the unbiased estimator based on the simplified summary of the data having minimum variance when the population characteristics are unknown can be improved upon in cases where certain population characteristics are known, or where additional data not included in the simplified summary are available. Several improved estimators are derived and discussed. Some of the results for the special case of s = k = 1 are generalized in Sections 3 and 4 to deal with cases where s and k are any specified positive integers. In Section 5, results are presented about s stage k name snowball sampling procedures, where each individual asked to name k different individuals chooses k individuals at random from the population. (Except in Section 5, the numbers θij, which form the matrix referred to earlier, are assumed to be fixed (i.e., to be population parameters); in Section 5, they are random variables. A variable response error is not considered except in so far as Section 5 deals with an extreme case of this.) For social science literature that discusses problems related to snowball sampling, see [2], [8], and the articles they cite. This literature indicates, among other things, the importance of studying "social structure and...the relations among individuals" [2].},

	abstract = {Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains. However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13{\textbackslash}\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40{\textbackslash}\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts.},

It also considered addressed whether client goal setting was methodologically acceptable to integrative therapists who used Rogers’ non-directive principles as the foundation to their approach. We provided a goal setting instrument to 9 therapists and 23 of their clients, enabling them to define therapy goals, and feedback on the process. The clients set their goals using the instruments, before having at least six sessions with their therapist. We then sought joint views on the process from the therapists through a questionnaire or an interview. The data from the responses were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. The majority of the therapists considered that guided goal setting using a description of the ‘fully functioning’ individual was helpful. In terms of the applicability of goal setting to an integrative approach based on non-directive, person-centered principles, the results were mixed and in some cases contrary to those expected. For example, some of the more directive therapists disliked guided goal setting processes, whilst the more non-directive therapists appreciated the approach.},

Group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) combines the assets of the nomothetic and idiographic approaches by creating person-specific maps that contain a group-level structure. The maps show how intensively measured variables predict and are predicted by each other at different time scales. In this article, GIMME is introduced conceptually and mathematically, and then applied to an empirical data set containing the negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and hostility composite ratings from the daily diaries of 25 individuals with personality pathology.

The present study followed the recommendations of Fisher (2015) to employ a personalized modular model of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Employing the algorithms provided by Fernandez, Fisher, and Chi (2017), the present study collected intensive repeated measures data prior to therapy in order to perform person-specific factor analysis and dynamic factor modeling. The results of these analyses were then used to generated personalized modular treatment plans on a person-by-person basis. Thirty-two participants completed therapy. The average number of sessions was 10.38. Hedges g's for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were 2.33 and 1.62, respectively. The change per unit time was g = .24/session for the HRSD and g = 0.17/session for the HARS.

However, critics are also expressing concerns that these therapies are not well enough supported and “getting ahead of the data”. This article engages the literature on a small selection of modern therapy approaches, namely Mode Deactivation Therapy (MDT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and more specifically compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). On the one hand, it challenges the assumption that third wave therapies in general, but more specifically in reference to MDT, ACT, and DBT, have little new to offer by way of superior performance, often in reference to populations that are usually deemed as difficult-to-treat in traditional approaches such as CBT. While, on the other hand, it investigates claims that third wave treatments are more part of a CBT family of approaches rather than distinct treatments. It draws from the conceptualizations, practices, and experiences of the respective developers themselves to argue for the distinct value and prospects that these third wave therapies offer in terms of scientifically established treatment outcomes. For example, it is difficult and unwise to dismiss the superior results that MDT has established in treating severe multi-problem adolescents, a population that has inarguably an extremely high human and economic impact in the long run. By an improved understanding and differentiation of the third wave therapies, their proliferation can be accelerated without compromise to harness their potential more effectively and focused.},

In the final introductory chapter, Chapter 3, we try to place research in the context of health care delivery systems and present a model relating research findings to clinical practice. In many ways, the model is a guide to interpretation of all that follows. The body of the book contains research evidence relating to the treatment of each of a wide range of psychological problems.

Versions of BPT interventions tailored for specific ethnic groups have been successful at improving engagement and outcomes for ethnic minorities; however, the specificity of these models presents challenges for broad dissemination. This article presents a personalization approach (PersIn) that utilizes cultural assessment results to tailor treatment protocols to the characteristics of individual families. We believe this approach has the potential to maximize cultural sensitivity while preserving generalizability to both minority and non-minority ethnic groups. We further propose that personalization on Parent Explanatory Model (PEM) parameters that have been found to vary across ethnic groups and to impact treatment engagement and/or outcomes is a promising approach to decreasing disparities in BPTs. We describe examples of evidence-supported PEMs that present good targets for personalization and provide examples from MY PCIT to illustrate how PersIn can be applied to Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).},

HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on explainability of advanced algorithms. However, there are only few AI-systems based on machine learning algorithms that make it to the real world and everyday care. This challenging move has been named the “last mile” of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen learnings from involving users in the design or use of AI-based systems. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods, for transitioning from development to implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on healthcare AI in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts of AI in healthcare.},

Developing computational approaches for automated behavioral coding can reduce the burden on human coders and facilitate the objective evaluation of the intervention.

In this paper, we leverage a publicly available conversation-based dataset and transfer knowledge to the low-resource behavioral coding task by performing an intermediate language model training via meta-learning. We introduce a task augmentation method to produce a large number of "analogy tasks" - tasks similar to the target one - and demonstrate that the proposed framework predicts target behaviors more accurately than all the other baseline models.},

	abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

	abstract = {Objective Financial costs are a significant barrier to the uptake of empirically supported psychological interventions in clinical settings. Training may be among the largest of these costs; however, the potential magnitude of these costs is unclear. The aim of the present study was to develop a hypothetical model of potential training costs associated with adopting a novel therapy using systematic review of anticipated training durations and publicly available data on workshop costs, training materials and income.Methods Direct and indirect costs were estimated for reference categories being cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder delivered by registered psychologists. These were based on averages of 39 workshops and eight treatment manuals available in Australia identified through online searches.Results This model demonstrated that upper cost ranges for training can exceed A\$55 000, and even didactic training (reading manuals, attending workshops) may cost up to A\$9000. Indirect costs of forfeited income account for a substantial proportion of these costs.Conclusions This hypothetical model highlights why training costs should be considered in decisions about disseminating and implementing novel empirically supported psychological interventions, particularly within private workforces. In addition, the direct return on training investment for practitioners in private practice is unclear, and may vary based on caseloads and current treatment modalities. Initiatives to track competence, support training and identify novel training solutions may be required to ensure the sustainability of high-quality mental healthcare.What is known about the topic? Financial costs are one of the leading factors determining whether empirically supported mental health treatments are adopted or sustained. Training costs may be one of the largest costs of disseminating and implementing novel psychological therapies within existing workforces, including both direct (e.g. workshop fees) and indirect (e.g. lost income) costs. However, little is understood about the potential magnitude of these costs.What does this paper add? This paper presents a hypothetical modelling of potential costs associated with adopting a novel therapy, with reference categories for an empirically supported treatment (cognitive behaviour therapy) for one mental disorder (social anxiety disorder) for one mental health profession (psychologist). This model was developed and populated using systematic review of anticipated training durations and publicly available data on workshop costs, training materials and income.What are the implications for practitioners? With potential costs for adopting one novel psychological intervention exceeding A\$55 000, we highlight why training costs and pathways should be a focal point for ensuring the sustainable provision of high-quality mental healthcare in Australia.},

We found the app (Replika) beneficial in offering on-demand, non-judgmental support, boosting user confidence, and aiding self-discovery. Yet, it faced challenges in filtering harmful content, sustaining consistent communication, remembering new information, and mitigating users’ overdependence. The stigma attached further risked isolating users socially.

We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4\% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2\% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

In this paper, we propose a method able to detect and track topics in real-life psychotherapeutic conversations based on Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation. Topics detection helps in summarizing the semantic themes used during the therapeutic conversations, and in predicting a speciﬁc topic for each talk-turn. The conversation is modeled by means of a distribution of ongoing topics propagating through each talk sequence. Tracking of topics aims at exploring the dynamics of the conversation and at offering insights into the underlying conversation logic and strategy.

We achieved an F1-score of 0.646 by classifying dialogue sessions using features such as frequency-inverse, document frequency, document embedding of a large-scale language model, linguistic inquiry and word count, topic modeling, and statistics of dialogue sentences. In addition, we performed dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis.

Additionally, clustering techniques showed that language alone could identify participants who differed on both symptom severity and treatment outcomes. These findings lay the foundation for 1) tools that can rapidly identify people in need of psychological services based on language alone and 2) linguistic interventions that can improve mental health.},

Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on AI for design to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration. In this work, we conducted a landscape analysis of AI for design, via a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of tasks. They have attracted significant attention and been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin to a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could suffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and beneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation. In addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and benchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations pertaining to LLMs' performance in specialized domains, and discuss the construction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations on capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability. We hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research interests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation serve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We envision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes societal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

	abstract = {In this conceptual paper, we outline the many challenges on the road to personalized psychotherapy, using the example of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression. To optimize psychotherapy for the individual patient, we need to find out how therapy works (identification of mechanisms of change) and for whom it works (identification of moderators). To date, psychotherapy research has not resulted in compelling evidence for or against common or specific factors that have been proposed as mechanisms of change. Our central proposition is that we need to combine the “how does it work?”-question with the “for whom does it work?”-question in order to advance the field. We introduce the personalized causal pathway hypothesis that emphasizes the links and distinction between individual patient differences, therapeutic procedures and therapy processes as a paradigm to facilitate und understand the concept of personalized psychotherapy. We review the mechanism of change literature for CBT for depression to see what we have learned so far, and describe preliminary observational evidence supporting the personalized causal pathway hypothesis. We then propose a research agenda to push the ball forward: exploratory studies into the links between individual differences, therapeutic procedures, therapy processes and outcome that constitute a potential causal pathway, making use of experience sampling, network theory, observer ratings of therapy sessions, and moderated mediation analysis; testing and isolation of CBT procedures in experiments; and testing identified causal pathways of change as part of a personalized CBT package against regular CBT, in order to advance the application of personalized psychotherapy.},

	abstract = {For the past hundred years, mechanisms of change have been the black box of psychotherapy. Thousands of studies failed to produce consistent findings, even concerning factors considered crucial for treatment success by theoretical models and decades of clinical experience. This article introduces the distinction between trait-like (TL) and state-like (SL) components of any mechanism of change (the TLSL distinction) as a potential key to the black box of psychotherapy. TL refers to individual differences between patients; SL refers to changes occurring within the patient over the course of treatment. The TLSL distinction explains why past research, which conflated the two, has produced conflicting results, and predicts the conditions under which consistent results can be obtained. Data collected so far show support for the importance of the TLSL distinction and point the way toward personalized treatment. The TL components create the individual’s signature pathology and strengths map, and determine the SL changes that represent the patient-specific mechanisms most critical for optimizing treatment efficacy for each individual. The TLSL distinction has the potential to explain not only how psychotherapy works, but also how changes of any type occur in the wake of intervention, life events, and other factors.

	abstract = {Objective:
We propose several different patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from momentary, real-time collection of symptom data. In addition to the mean of momentary reports of symptoms, other types of summaries can reflect different aspects of the symptom experience.

Methods:
With secondary analyses of two studies of patients with chronic pain assessed with real-time methods, we demonstrate principles for developing outcomes that summarize symptom experience during a 1-week period. These studies focused on pain intensity, which is used to demonstrate methods for creating summary momentary measures.

Results:
Analyses from the first study (Pain 2008;139:146–57) yielded outcome measures based on the mean, median, 90th percentile, maximum, standard deviation, proportion of reports with no pain, proportion of reports with pain more than 50 (on a 0- to 100-point scale), and time-contingent measures. The second study examined the performance of these measures (and the mean) in a longitudinal study, in which some patients changed treatment (n = 78), making pain reduction likely, whereas others had no treatment change (n = 27). The measure that best discriminated the groups was the proportion of momentary reports without pain (effect size = 0.50), closely followed by the mean of all reports (effect size = 0.45). Most measures also correlated with patients’ global impression of their change (between 0.39 and 0.55, except for standard deviation [0.13]).

Conclusions:
These analyses suggest that momentary symptom data can be useful for developing new PROs that reflect symptom experience other than the mean. They highlight knowledge gleaned from real-time studies, which deepens our understanding of symptoms by demonstrating which changes in symptoms are associated with overall perceived change.},

The seven theoretical themes were purpose, moral worth, self-worth, competence, comprehensibility, connectedness, and spiritual transcendence. The pretreatment life stories mostly concerned tragic lives and problems within the seven themes, but hardly any spiritual transcendence. Being a victim of moral injustice indicated the theme of moral worth. In the post-treatment life stories comprehensibility, self-acceptance and an awareness of existential vulnerability emerged. The presence and/or emergence of the specific meaning in life themes could result from attaining treatment goals that ameliorate personality dysfunction. Here the meaning in life themes of purpose, self-worth, competence, comprehensibility and connectedness are of interest as they also turn up as personality functions in the DSM-5 alternative model for Personality Disorders.},

	abstract = {Background Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for youth with anxiety and related disorders, with a 59\% remission rate at post-treatment. Results of reviews and meta-analyses indicate that treatment gains are maintained across long-term follow-up, at least in terms of symptom improvement. Less is known about relapse, defined as patients who initially achieve remission status but then experience a return of symptoms after a follow-up period. Method The current study used meta-analysis to determine the overall rate of relapse in CBT for children and adolescents (age 18 years or younger) with anxiety and related disorders. Potential moderating factors of relapse rates, including demographic, methodological, and clinical/intervention characteristics, were also examined. Out of a pool of 78 abstracts, 13 full-text articles were retained for meta-analysis. An additional two articles were identified from other sources (total N = 535 patients). Results Results showed an overall relapse rate of 10.5\% (including comorbid autism spectrum disorder) and 8\% (excluding comorbid autism spectrum disorder) across studies. Moderator analyses demonstrated that relapse rates were higher among younger and more racially diverse samples, as well as among patients with comorbid externalizing disorders and those taking psychiatric medications. There were no differences in relapse rates as a function of primary diagnosis. Conclusions Taken together, the findings indicate that relapse rates in CBT for anxious youth are relatively low, suggesting that treatment development and refinement efforts should focus on improving treatment response and remission rates for this population.},

	abstract = {Currently there is no universally accepted definition of remission in anxiety disorders. This may be causing significantly different estimates of treatment efficacy across anxiety disorders. The aim of this paper was to determine not only the overall remission rate in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, but also to examine whether the different definitions of remission lead to significantly different remission rates. From the initial 228 abstracts reviewed by the authors, 100 articles were retained. The overall mean remission rate was 51.0\%. Remission rates were highest when remission was defined as good end state functioning or no longer meeting criteria for the primary diagnosis. Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder had the highest remission rates, while those of obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder had the lowest remission rates. Rates of remission differed by certain demographic (e.g., older age) and clinical (e.g., medication use) characteristics. Although CBT is an empirically supported treatment for anxiety disorders, it is clear that there is room for improvement, as many patients do not achieve remission status.},

We explore an opportunity for technology support for discontinuing antidepressants, where clinical guidelines increasingly recommend gradual discontinuation over abruptly stopping to avoid withdrawal symptoms, but providers have varying levels of experience and diverse strategies for supporting patients through discontinuation. We conducted two studies with 12 providers, identifying providers’ needs in developing discontinuation plans and deriving design guidelines. We then iteratively designed and implemented AT Planner, instantiating the guidelines by projecting taper schedules and providing flexibility for adjustment. Provider feedback on AT Planner highlighted that discontinuation plans required balancing interpersonal and infrastructural constraints and surfaced the need for different technological support based on clinical experience. We discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating flexibility and advice into clinical planning tools.},

Positive reinforcement is increasingly integrated into family technologies for teaching regulation skills, but typically support specific co-located activities. To better understand how technology can support co-regulation within families with ADHD children, we deployed CoolTaco, a smartwatch and phone system to support collaboration in creating tasks, gaining points for achieving them, and redeeming rewards. Ten families with ADHD children used CoolTaco in their daily routines. By qualitatively analyzing family interviews and usage logs, we find that smartwatches can help provide pervasive regulation support to children, but the division across devices and parent-child roles interfere with developing independence. We discuss how technology should support co-regulation while also fostering future self-regulation, such as by guiding children in goal setting and helping them reflect on progress and achievements.},

	doi = {10.2196/49684},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Teletherapy apps have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional in-person therapy, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, as they help overcome a range of geographical and emotional barriers to accessing care. However, the rapid proliferation of teletherapy apps has occurred in an environment in which development has outpaced the various regulatory and ethical considerations of this space. Thus, researchers have raised concerns about the ethical implications and potential risks of teletherapy apps given the lack of regulation and oversight. Teletherapy apps have distinct aims to more directly replicate practices of traditional care, as opposed to mental health apps, which primarily provide supplemental support, suggesting a need to examine the ethical considerations of teletherapy apps from the lens of existing ethical guidelines for providing therapy.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined user reviews of commercial teletherapy apps to understand user perceptions of whether and how ethical principles are followed and incorporated.
METHODS: We identified 8 mobile apps that (1) provided teletherapy on 2 dominant mobile app stores (Google Play and Apple App Store) and (2) had received {\textgreater}5000 app reviews on both app stores. We wrote Python scripts (Python Software Foundation) to scrape user reviews from the 8 apps, collecting 3268 user reviews combined across 2 app stores. We used thematic analysis to qualitatively analyze user reviews, developing a codebook drawing from the ethical codes of conduct for psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers.
RESULTS: The qualitative analysis of user reviews revealed the ethical concerns and opportunities of teletherapy app users. Users frequently perceived unprofessionalism in their teletherapists, mentioning that their therapists did not listen to them, were distracted during therapy sessions, and did not keep their appointments. Users also noted technical glitches and therapist unavailability on teletherapy apps that might affect their ability to provide continuity of care. Users held varied opinions on the affordability of those apps, with some perceiving them as affordable and others not. Users further brought up that the subscription model resulted in unfair pricing and expressed concerns about the lack of cost transparency. Users perceived that these apps could help promote access to care by overcoming geographical and social constraints.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that users perceive commercial teletherapy apps as adhering to many ethical principles pertaining to therapy but falling short in key areas regarding professionalism, continuity of care, cost fairness, and cost transparency. Our findings suggest that, to provide high-quality care, teletherapy apps should prioritize fair compensation for therapists, develop more flexible and transparent payment models, and invest in measures to ensure app stability and therapist availability. Future work is needed to develop standards for teletherapy and improve the quality and accessibility of those services.},

	abstract = {Objective:
In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have
progressed, and their application in the medical field has been tested.
However, the use of NLP to detect symptoms from medical progress notes
written in Japanese, remains limited. We aimed to detect 2 gastrointestinal
symptoms that interfere with the continuation of
chemotherapy—nausea/vomiting and diarrhea—from progress notes using NLP, and
then to analyze factors affecting NLP.

Materials and methods:
In this study, 200 patients were randomly selected from 5277 patients who
received intravenous injections of cytotoxic anticancer drugs at Kagawa
University Hospital, Japan, between January 2011 and December 2018. We aimed
to detect the first occurrence of nausea/vomiting (Group A) and diarrhea
(Group B) using NLP. The NLP performance was evaluated by the concordance
with a review of the physicians’ progress notes used as the gold
standard.

Results:
Both groups showed high concordance: 83.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]
74.1-90.1) in Group A and 97.7\% (95\% CI 91.3-99.9) in Group B. However, the
concordance was significantly better in Group B
(P = .0027). There were significantly more misdetection
cases in Group A than in Group B (15.3\% in Group A; 1.2\% in Group B,
P = .0012) due to negative findings or past
history.

Conclusion:
We detected occurrences of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea accurately using NLP.
However, there were more misdetection cases in Group A due to negative
findings or past history, which may have been influenced by the physicians’
more frequent documentation of nausea/vomiting.},

	abstract = {This chapter addresses fundamental issues of change in psychotherapy: how to measure, monitor, predict change, and provide feedback on treatment outcome. The chapter starts with a historical overview, covering several approaches applied to measure change in psychotherapy research. We proceed with a description of classical concepts to evaluate change such as effect sizes, meta-analysis and clinical significance. Next, central concepts to study treatment dosage, attrition, follow-up, as well as the handling of missing data are presented. We then cover new ways to measure and to model change including item response models, multilevel and mixed models, ecological momentary assessment and new biological and technical measures. We discuss the core questions of how to optimally measure outcomes, how often to measure change during therapy, and how therapists can use measurements to improve clinical practice. In addition, the need for further improvements in measurement precision are debated. Furthermore, the chapter discusses predictors and moderators of change, rational and empirical decision-making models, as well as methods to identify patterns of early response. We explore processes and mechanisms of change including sections on between- and within-patient variation and dyadic models. In the final section, we review the evidence base for feedback-informed treatment and the application of evidence-based personalization in clinical practice. Such new developments allow the inclusion of individually tailored problem-solving strategies for treatment selection and adaptation, especially for those patients at risk of treatment failure. The development of change measurement in psychotherapy has evolved considerably in recent decades, making it an integral part of clinical practice and training.

METHOD: Seventy clients (74\% women, 26\% men; Mage = 29.8 years, SD = 11.00) received psychodynamic psychotherapy at a university-based community outpatient clinic. Adherence to core principles of a psychodynamic treatment model were coded by independent raters at the 3rd, 9th, and termination phase sessions using a psychotherapy technique scale. Therapy outcomes were assessed at both the symptom and the broadband levels of functioning.
RESULTS: Within-case variability in adherence ratings was significantly associated with therapy outcomes (accounting for approximately 10\% of the variance in outcomes), after controlling for alliance, between-case variability, and the proportion of outcomes attributed by therapists.
CONCLUSION: The flexibility therapists demonstrate regarding the use of technique within a given treatment appears to be related to better outcomes across their caseload in relation to therapists who are less flexible with their interventions at the individual client level. The clinical implications of flexibility in adherence to a treatment model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Studies have found that psychological treatments produce positive clinical outcomes for many problems experienced by youth. However, there is limited research on whether therapist adherence and competence in delivering these treatments are related to differential clinical outcomes. Method: We examined the relationship of therapist adherence and competence to clinical outcomes in a sample of 51 youth aged 7–14 years (M age = 10.36, SD = 1.90; 86.3\% white; 60.8\% male) treated for anxiety disorders with a manualized individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. Adherence and competence were measured via coding of recorded treatment session content and outcomes were measured by caregiver and youth report across multiple timepoints. We used two-level mixed-effects regression models to test the degree to which adherence and competence predicted differential youth clinical outcomes. Results: Across multiple caregiver- and child-reported symptom and diagnostic outcomes, we found no statistically significant relationship between adherence or competence and clinical outcomes. Discussion: Although there was variability in both treatment integrity and clinical outcome, neither adherence to nor competence in youth anxiety treatment was related to clinical outcomes for youth with anxiety disorders treated with individual cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) in a research clinic-based efficacy trial.

This study investigated the association between treatment adherence, the child-therapist alliance, and child clinical outcomes in manual-guided individual- and group-based CBT for youths diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Trained observers rated tapes of therapy sessions for treatment adherence and child-therapist alliance in a sample of 52 children (aged 8 to 12) with anxiety disorders. Self-reported child anxiety was assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment; parent-reported child internalizing symptoms was assessed at pre- and posttreatment. The results showed high levels of treatment adherence and child-therapist alliance in both CBT programs. Neither treatment adherence nor child-therapist alliance predicted traditional measurements of child outcomes in the present study, but a relation between alliance and outcome was found using a more precise estimation of the true pre-post differences.

Therapist “coach” style was a significant predictor of child-reported outcome, with the collaborative “coach” style predicting fewer child-reported symptoms. Higher levels of therapist prior clinical experience and lower levels of prior anxiety-specific experience were significant predictors of better treatment outcome.

Next, we review the empirical findings regarding adjustments made for CBT for youth anxiety delivered (a) in schools, (b) in community settings, (c) through telehealth, (d) through online computer programs, and (e) by caregivers at home.

Our sample included 46 outpatients who were consecutively enrolled in individual psychodynamic psychotherapy, received a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM–IV; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994) Axis I diagnosis of a depressive spectrum disorder, and were assessed pre- and posttreatment through self-report of depressive symptoms. Psychotherapy sessions were videotaped and 3rd and 9th sessions were independently rated on the Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale (CPPS) for use of PI and CB techniques, with excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] {\textgreater} .75). Mean technique ratings across the two early treatment sessions (3rd and 9th) were calculated.

	abstract = {This study explored the meaning of “good outcome” within and beyond the much-used statistical indices of clinical significance in standard outcome research as developed by Jacobson and Truax (1991). Specifically, we examined the experiences of patients marked as “recovered” and “improved” following cognitive–behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy for major depression. A mixed-methods study was conducted using data gathered in an RCT, including patients’ pre–post outcome scores on the Beck Depression Inventory–II and posttreatment client change interviews. We selected 28 patients who showed recovery and 19 patients who showed improvement in self-reported depression symptoms. A grounded theory analysis was performed on patients’ interviews, ultimately resulting in a conceptual model of “good outcome.” From patients’ perspectives, good outcome can be understood as feeling empowered, finding personal balance and encountering ongoing struggle, indicating an ongoing process and variation in experience. The Jacobson–Truax classification of “good outcome” could not account for the (more pessimistic) nuances in outcome experiences, especially for “improved” patients, and did not grasp the multidimensional nature of outcome as experienced by patients. It is recommended that statistical indications of clinical meaningfulness are interpreted warily and ideally contextualized within personal narratives. Further research on the phenomenon of change and good outcome is required, aiming at integrating multiple perspectives and methods accordingly the multidimensional phenomenon under study.

	abstract = {Background
and purpose: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy are common psychotherapies used for mental disorders. The purpose of the present article was to achieve an integration of cognitive-behavioral therapy and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy that enjoys simultaneously the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapies and the stability of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies.
Materials and methods
It was a pre-test/post-test experimental study. Selected based on a purposive non-probabilistic sampling method, the sample studied here consisted of 36 people diagnosed with generalized anxiety according to Clinical Diagnostic Interview, psychiatrist diagnosis and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA). They were divided randomly into three 12 person groups: two treated groups by integrative therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, and one control group. Only pre-test and post-test were employed for the control group without any kind of treatment. To select patients and evaluate the effects of each type of treatments, the “Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety” and “Beck Depression Inventory” were applied for the pre-test/post-test and the differential diagnosis, respectively. The results obtained were analyzed by covariance and ANOVA analyses using SPSS software.
Results
The results of the study indicate the efficacy of both cognitive-behavioral therapy and integrative therapy in the treatment of generalized anxiety and integrative therapy was more effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety compared to cognitive-behavioral therapy.
Conclusion
Integrative treatment not only to be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and the reduction of its symptoms, but also to be more effective than cognitive-behavioral therapy.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to revolutionize healthcare, from improving diagnoses to patient safety. However, many healthcare practitioners are hesitant to adopt AI technologies fully. To understand why, this research explored clinicians’ views on AI, especially their level of trust, their concerns about potential risks, and how they believe AI might affect their day-to-day workload. We surveyed 265 healthcare professionals from various specialties in the U.S. The survey aimed to understand their perceptions and any concerns they might have about AI in their clinical practice. We further examined how these perceptions might align with three hypothetical approaches to integrating AI into healthcare: no integration, sequential (step-by-step) integration, and parallel (side-by-side with current practices) integration. The results reveal that clinicians who view AI as a workload reducer are more inclined to trust it and are more likely to use it in clinical decision making. However, those perceiving higher risks with AI are less inclined to adopt it in decision making. While the role of clinical experience was found to be statistically insignificant in influencing trust in AI and AI-driven decision making, further research might explore other potential moderating variables, such as technical aptitude, previous exposure to AI, or the specific medical specialty of the clinician. By evaluating three hypothetical scenarios of AI integration in healthcare, our study elucidates the potential pitfalls of sequential AI integration and the comparative advantages of parallel integration. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity of strategic AI integration into healthcare. AI should be perceived as a supportive tool rather than an intrusive entity, augmenting the clinicians’ skills and facilitating their workflow rather than disrupting it. As we move towards an increasingly digitized future in healthcare, comprehending the among AI technology, clinician perception, trust, and decision making is fundamental.},

Less discussed, however, is that the field of HCI routinely grapples with such challenges; across the various technologies commonly referred to as AI (e.g., predictive modeling, computer vision, NLP), what shared characteristics made human-AI interaction appeared uniquely difficult to design in the first place? Synthesizing my hands-on design and research over the past six years, in my dissertation, I worked to articulate whether, why, and how human-AI interaction appears uniquely challenging to design with established HCI methods. In this extended abstract, I first describe a human-AI interaction design framework as an answer to this question. I then discuss one critical implication of this framework: Framing data-driven AI systems as living socio-technical systems that co-evolve with their users. I analogize this reframing to the shift from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing and outline the ethnographic, design, and technological research opportunities it reveals.},

	abstract = {Psychotherapy represents a broad class of medical interventions received by millions of patients each year. Unlike most medical treatments, its primary mechanisms are linguistic; i.e., the treatment relies directly on a conversation between a patient and provider. However, the evaluation of patient-provider conversation suffers from critical shortcomings, including intensive labor requirements, coder error, nonstandardized coding systems, and inability to scale up to larger data sets. To overcome these shortcomings, psychotherapy analysis needs a reliable and scalable method for summarizing the content of treatment encounters. We used a publicly available psychotherapy corpus from Alexander Street press comprising a large collection of transcripts of patient-provider conversations to compare coding performance for two machine learning methods. We used the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation (L-LDA) model to learn associations between text and codes, to predict codes in psychotherapy sessions, and to localize specific passages of within-session text representative of a session code. We compared the L-LDA model to a baseline lasso regression model using predictive accuracy and model generalizability (measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve). The L-LDA model outperforms the lasso logistic regression model at predicting session-level codes with average AUC scores of 0.79, and 0.70, respectively. For fine-grained level coding, L-LDA and logistic regression are able to identify specific talk-turns representative of symptom codes. However, model performance for talk-turn identification is not yet as reliable as human coders. We conclude that the L-LDA model has the potential to be an objective, scalable method for accurate automated coding of psychotherapy sessions that perform better than comparable discriminative methods at session-level coding and can also predict fine-grained codes.},

	abstract = {One of the key aspects in a psychotherapeutic conversation is the understanding of topics dynamics driving the dialogue. This may provide insights on the therapeutic strategy adopted by the counselor for the specific patient, providing the opportunity of building up artificial intelligence (AI) based methods for recommending the most appropriate therapy for a new patient. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect and track topics in real-life psychotherapeutic conversations based on Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation. Topics detection helps in summarizing the semantic themes used during the therapeutic conversations , and in predicting a specific topic for each talk-turn. The conversation is modeled by means of a distribution of ongoing topics propagating through each talk sequence. Tracking of topics aims at exploring the dynamics of the conversation and at offering insights into the underlying conversation logic and strategy. We present an alternative way to look at face-to-face conversations in conjunction with a new approach that combines topic modeling and transitions matrices to elicit valuable knowledge.},

Most existing black-box-like deep learning methods for depression detection largely focused on improving classification performance. However, explaining model decisions is imperative in health research because decision-making can often be high-stakes and life-and-death. Reliable automatic diagnosis of mental health problems including depression should be supported by credible explanations justifying models' predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explainable model for depression detection on Twitter. It comprises a novel encoder combining hierarchical attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. To support psycholinguistic studies, our model leverages metaphorical concept mappings as input. Thus, it not only detects depressed individuals, but also identifies features of such users' tweets and associated metaphor concept mappings.},

	abstract = {Aim Recent advances in natural language processing models are expected to provide diagnostic assistance in psychiatry from the history of present illness (HPI). However, existing studies have been limited, with the target diseases including only major diseases, small sample sizes, or no comparison with diagnoses made by psychiatrists to ensure accuracy. Therefore, we formulated an accurate diagnostic model that covers all psychiatric disorders. Methods HPIs and diagnoses were extracted from discharge summaries of 2,642 cases at the Nara Medical University Hospital, Japan, from 21 May 2007, to 31 May 31 2021. The diagnoses were classified into 11 classes according to the code from ICD-10 Chapter V. Using UTH-BERT pre-trained on the electronic medical records of the University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan, we predicted the main diagnoses at discharge based on HPIs and compared the concordance rate with the results of psychiatrists. The psychiatrists were divided into two groups: semi-Designated with 3–4 years of experience and Residents with only 2 months of experience. Results The model's match rate was 74.3\%, compared to 71.5\% for the semi-Designated psychiatrists and 69.4\% for the Residents. If the cases were limited to those correctly answered by the semi-Designated group, the model and the Residents performed at 84.9\% and 83.3\%, respectively. Conclusion We demonstrated that the model matched the diagnosis predicted from the HPI with a high probability to the principal diagnosis at discharge. Hence, the model can provide diagnostic suggestions in actual clinical practice.},

It has been suggested that all forms of psychotherapy provide a context which enables clients to transform the meaning of their experiences and symptoms in such a way as to help clients feel better, and function more adaptively. However, psychotherapy is not the only health care intervention that has been associated with “meaning”: the reason why placebo has effects has also been proposed to be a “meaning response.” Thus, it has been argued that the meaning of treatments has a central impact on beneficial (and by extension, negative) health-related responses. In light of the strong empirical support of a contextual understanding of psychotherapy and its effects, the aim of this conceptual analysis is to examine the role of meaning and its transformation in psychotherapy—in general—and within three different, commonly used psychotherapy modalities.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely believed to increase sociability. The drug alters speech production and fluency, and may influence speech content. Here, we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content, which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions.
METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers.
RESULTS: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content, specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction. Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states, and on emotional and psychosocial interaction.},

	abstract = {Emotional distress is a common reason for seeking psychotherapy, and sharing emotional material is central to the process of psychotherapy. However, systematic research examining patterns of emotional exchange that occur during psychotherapy sessions is often limited in scale. Traditional methods for identifying emotion in psychotherapy rely on labor-intensive observer ratings, client or therapist ratings obtained before or after sessions, or involve manually extracting ratings of emotion from session transcripts using dictionaries of positive and negative words that do not take the context of a sentence into account. However, recent advances in technology in the area of machine learning algorithms, in particular natural language processing, have made it possible for mental health researchers to identify sentiment, or emotion, in therapist–client interactions on a large scale that would be unattainable with more traditional methods. As an attempt to extend prior findings from Tanana et al. (2016), we compared their previous sentiment model with a common dictionary-based psychotherapy model, LIWC, and a new NLP model, BERT. We used the human ratings from a database of 97,497 utterances from psychotherapy to train the BERT model. Our findings revealed that the unigram sentiment model (kappa = 0.31) outperformed LIWC (kappa = 0.25), and ultimately BERT outperformed both models (kappa = 0.48).},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to revolutionize healthcare, from improving diagnoses to patient safety. However, many healthcare practitioners are hesitant to adopt AI technologies fully. To understand why, this research explored clinicians’ views on AI, especially their level of trust, their concerns about potential risks, and how they believe AI might affect their day-to-day workload. We surveyed 265 healthcare professionals from various specialties in the U.S. The survey aimed to understand their perceptions and any concerns they might have about AI in their clinical practice. We further examined how these perceptions might align with three hypothetical approaches to integrating AI into healthcare: no integration, sequential (step-by-step) integration, and parallel (side-by-side with current practices) integration. The results reveal that clinicians who view AI as a workload reducer are more inclined to trust it and are more likely to use it in clinical decision making. However, those perceiving higher risks with AI are less inclined to adopt it in decision making. While the role of clinical experience was found to be statistically insignificant in influencing trust in AI and AI-driven decision making, further research might explore other potential moderating variables, such as technical aptitude, previous exposure to AI, or the specific medical specialty of the clinician. By evaluating three hypothetical scenarios of AI integration in healthcare, our study elucidates the potential pitfalls of sequential AI integration and the comparative advantages of parallel integration. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity of strategic AI integration into healthcare. AI should be perceived as a supportive tool rather than an intrusive entity, augmenting the clinicians’ skills and facilitating their workflow rather than disrupting it. As we move towards an increasingly digitized future in healthcare, comprehending the among AI technology, clinician perception, trust, and decision making is fundamental.},

There is limited research on the intention to use AI systems in mental health care. Objective: This study aimed to address this gap by examining the predictors of psychology students’ and early practitioners’ intention to use 2 specific AI-enabled mental health tools based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 206 psychology students and psychotherapists in training to examine the predictors of their intention to use 2 AI-enabled mental health care tools. The first tool provides feedback to the psychotherapist on their adherence to motivational interviewing techniques. The second tool uses patient voice samples to derive mood scores that the therapists may use for treatment decisions. Participants were presented with graphic depictions of the tools’ functioning mechanisms before measuring the variables of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. In total, 2 structural equation models (1 for each tool) were specified, which included direct and mediated paths for predicting tool use intentions. Results: Perceived usefulness and social influence had a positive effect on the intention to use the feedback tool (PP=.01 and social influence, PP=.004). In addition, a positive relationship between cognitive technology readiness (P=.02) and the intention to use the feedback tool and a negative relationship between AI anxiety and the intention to use the feedback tool (P=.001) and the treatment recommendation tool (P{\textless}.001) were observed. Conclusions: The results shed light on the general and tool-dependent drivers of AI technology adoption in mental health care. Future research may explore the technological and user group characteristics that influence the adoption of AI-enabled tools in mental health care.},

	abstract = {Neuropsychiatric disorders pose a high societal cost, but their treatment is hindered by lack of objective outcomes and fidelity metrics. AI technologies and specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as tools to study mental health interventions (MHI) at the level of their constituent conversations. However, NLP’s potential to address clinical and research challenges remains unclear. We therefore conducted a pre-registered systematic review of NLP-MHI studies using PRISMA guidelines (osf.io/s52jh) to evaluate their models, clinical applications, and to identify biases and gaps. Candidate studies (n = 19,756), including peer-reviewed AI conference manuscripts, were collected up to January 2023 through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ArXiv. A total of 102 articles were included to investigate their computational characteristics (NLP algorithms, audio features, machine learning pipelines, outcome metrics), clinical characteristics (clinical ground truths, study samples, clinical focus), and limitations. Results indicate a rapid growth of NLP MHI studies since 2019, characterized by increased sample sizes and use of large language models. Digital health platforms were the largest providers of MHI data. Ground truth for supervised learning models was based on clinician ratings (n = 31), patient self-report (n = 29) and annotations by raters (n = 26). Text-based features contributed more to model accuracy than audio markers. Patients’ clinical presentation (n = 34), response to intervention (n = 11), intervention monitoring (n = 20), providers’ characteristics (n = 12), relational dynamics (n = 14), and data preparation (n = 4) were commonly investigated clinical categories. Limitations of reviewed studies included lack of linguistic diversity, limited reproducibility, and population bias. A research framework is developed and validated (NLPxMHI) to assist computational and clinical researchers in addressing the remaining gaps in applying NLP to MHI, with the goal of improving clinical utility, data access, and fairness.},

The cross‐sectional study consisted of 742 adult outpatients with diverse mental disorders. Patients completed the perceived lack of goal clarity questionnaire, and additional items measuring goal setting and evaluation, therapeutic alliance, symptom levels, patients' dependency on their treatment, and their expected and needed number of future treatment sessions. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analyses resulted in a unidimensional and reliable questionnaire (nine items, α = .85). Additional findings showed that 23\% of the treatments lacked initial goal setting according to the patients. Also, perceived lack of goal clarity was lower when treatment goals were established explicitly at the start of treatment, were formulated together with the therapist, and were discussed regularly during treatment, and treatment progress was monitored regularly. Moreover, patients reporting their goals as unclear also reported a poorer quality of the therapeutic alliance, higher symptom levels, increased need for future sessions, but also lower levels of care dependency. These findings underscore the importance of perceived goal clarity in psychological treatments, although the relation with actual goal setting remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {Objective: To complement standardized measurement of symptoms, we developed and tested an efficient strategy for identifying (before treatment) and repeatedly assessing (during treatment) the problems identified as most important by caregivers and youths in psychotherapy. Method: A total of 178 outpatient-referred youths, 7–13 years of age, and their caregivers separately identified the 3 problems of greatest concern to them at pretreatment and then rated the severity of those problems weekly during treatment. The Top Problems measure thus formed was evaluated for (a) whether it added to the information obtained through empirically derived standardized measures (e.g., the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL; Achenbach \& Rescorla, 2001] and the Youth Self-Report [YSR; Achenbach \& Rescorla, 2001]) and (b) whether it met conventional psychometric standards. Results: The problems identified were significant and clinically relevant; most matched CBCL/YSR items while adding specificity. The top problems also complemented the information yield of the CBCL/YSR; for example, for 41\% of caregivers and 79\% of youths, the identified top problems did not correspond to any items of any narrowband scales in the clinical range. Evidence on test–retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, sensitivity to change, slope reliability, and the association of Top Problems slopes with standardized measure slopes supported the psychometric strength of the measure. Conclusions: The Top Problems measure appears to be a psychometrically sound, client-guided approach that complements empirically derived standardized assessment; the approach can help focus attention and treatment planning on the problems that youths and caregivers consider most important and can generate evidence on trajectories of change in those problems during treatment.

	abstract = {Background
Fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue are prevalent symptoms among cancer survivors, adversely affecting patients’ quality of life and daily functioning. Effect sizes of interventions targeting these symptoms are mostly small to medium. Personalizing treatment is assumed to improve efficacy. However, thus far the empirical support for this approach is lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate if systematically personalized cognitive behavioral therapy is more efficacious than standard cognitive behavioral therapy in cancer survivors with moderate to severe fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and/or cancer-related fatigue.

Methods
The study is designed as a non-blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms (ratio 1:1): (a) systematically personalized cognitive behavioral therapy and (b) standard cognitive behavioral therapy. In the standard treatment arm, patients receive an evidence-based diagnosis-specific treatment protocol for fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, or cancer-related fatigue. In the second arm, treatment is personalized on four dimensions: (a) the allocation of treatment modules based on ecological momentary assessments, (b) treatment delivery, (c) patients’ needs regarding the symptom for which they want to receive treatment, and (d) treatment duration. In total, 190 cancer survivors who experience one or more of the targeted symptoms and ended their medical treatment with curative intent at least 6 months to a maximum of 5 years ago will be included. Primary outcome is limitations in daily functioning. Secondary outcomes are level of fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, fatigue severity, quality of life, goal attainment, therapist time, and drop-out rates. Participants are assessed at baseline (T0), and after 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of personalized cognitive behavioral therapy to standard cognitive behavioral therapy in cancer survivors. The study has several innovative characteristics, among which is the personalization of interventions on several dimensions. If proven effective, the results of this study provide a first step in developing an evidence-based framework for personalizing therapies in a systematic and replicable way.

	abstract = {Many kinds of psychological treatments are available, differing in their procedures and clinical assumptions. This chapter starts by describing the history and development of psychotherapy in general and then provides an overview of the best-known schools of thought in psychotherapy today. We compare the theoretical foundation, treatment goals, therapy techniques, and therapist role of each of the following approaches: Traditional and contemporary cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy, humanistic and person-centered therapy, and systemic therapy. Because CBT is the most empirically supported and extensively researched approach, we provide a more in depth coverage of its learning principles, such as classical (Pavlovian) and operant conditioning, and the development of behavior therapy. We describe the cognitive influence and the emergence of traditional CBT with efficacious therapy techniques, such as distinguishing thoughts from feelings and behaviors (the three component model of psychological distress), cognitive restructuring, behavioral experiments and exposure, and contingency management. Furthermore, we discuss the more recently established mindfulness-based approaches, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and dialectical behavior therapy. Another commonly utilized approach is psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy. We describe Freud’s topographic and structural models and the psychosexual stages with traditional psychoanalytic therapy techniques, such as free association, analysis of transference and countertransference, analytic interpretation and dream analysis. A brief overview of some newer psychodynamic therapies, such as analytical, individual and ego psychology, object relation, self-psychology and relational psychology is also provided in this section. The third psychotherapy approach described in this chapter is the humanistic or person-centered psychotherapy. This non-directive approach highlights the two parts of the self (the real-self and the ideal self) and motivates the client towards self-actualization (i.e. finding congruence between the real-self and the ideal-self). The therapeutic relationship, in which the therapist exhibits empathy, positive regard, and genuineness, is the vital mechanism responsible for achieving this goal. The last psychotherapy approach described in this chapter is systemic therapy. This approach focuses on individuals in their social context and is nowadays synonymous with relation or family therapy. In this section we describe structural therapy, communication or strategic therapy and intergenerational or Bowen family therapy. In summary, CBT has the most empirical support and contains the most effective therapy techniques. Understanding the processes through which therapeutic change occurs and disseminating efficacious treatments through new technologies will continue to warrant future research on psychotherapy. The field will continue to embark on the journey of understanding which therapeutic techniques work for which individual, under which context and why.},

	abstract = {Background: Health researchers are increasingly using natural language processing (NLP) to study various mental health conditions using both social media and electronic health records (EHRs). There is currently no published synthesis that relates specifically to the use of NLP methods for bipolar disorder, and this scoping review was conducted to synthesize valuable insights that have been presented in the literature.
Objective: This scoping review explored how NLP methods have been used in research to better understand bipolar disorder and identify opportunities for further use of these methods.
Methods: A systematic, computerized search of index and free-text terms related to bipolar disorder and NLP was conducted using 5 databases and 1 anthology: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and the ACL Anthology.
Results: Of 507 identified studies, a total of 35 (6.9\%) studies met the inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the data, and the studies were grouped into four objectives: prediction and classification (n=25), characterization of the language of bipolar disorder (n=13), use of EHRs to measure health outcomes (n=3), and use of EHRs for phenotyping (n=2). Ethical considerations were reported in 60\% (21/35) of the studies.
Conclusions: The current literature demonstrates how language analysis can be used to assist in and improve the provision of care for people living with bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder and the medical community could benefit from research that uses NLP to investigate risk-taking, web-based services, social and occupational functioning, and the representation of gender in bipolar disorder populations on the web. Future research that implements NLP methods to study bipolar disorder should be governed by ethical principles, and any decisions regarding the collection and sharing of data sets should ultimately be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the risk to the data participants and whether their privacy can be ensured.},

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to assist mental health providers, including psychiatrists and psychologists, for decision-making based on patients’ historical data (e.g., medical records, behavioral data, social media usage, etc.). Deep learning (DL), as one of the most recent generation of AI technologies, has demonstrated superior performance in many real-world applications ranging from computer vision to healthcare. The goal of this study is to review existing research on applications of DL algorithms in mental health outcome research. Specifically, we first briefly overview the state-of-the-art DL techniques. Then we review the literature relevant to DL applications in mental health outcomes. According to the application scenarios, we categorize these relevant articles into four groups: diagnosis and prognosis based on clinical data, analysis of genetics and genomics data for understanding mental health conditions, vocal and visual expression data analysis for disease detection, and estimation of risk of mental illness using social media data. Finally, we discuss challenges in using DL algorithms to improve our understanding of mental health conditions and suggest several promising directions for their applications in improving mental health diagnosis and treatment.},

Technology-Mediated Interventions (TMI) seem to be a feasible alternative to increase access to behavioral health resources in this population. However, scaling-up treatments into TMI requires developing user-friendly, accepted, and accessible formats. A two-stage study was conducted to assess scalability of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) based strategy (named FACE COVID) delivered using technology. First, a mix-method design connected qualitative and quantitative data from health providers and ACT experts by which changes were performed to enhance scalability. Second, a pretest-posttest study was conducted to preliminary evaluate the efficacy of FACE COVID intervention on well-being, psychological distress, and psychological flexibility. Results showed a positive impact on well-being, but not distress and psychological flexibility. While this intervention has promising results, changes in dose intensity, social support, and mental health literacy could improve retention as well as increase opportunities to target distress and psychological flexibility in future studies.},

	abstract = {It remains elusive what language markers derived from psychotherapy sessions are indicative of therapeutic alliance, limiting our capacity to assess and provide feedback on the trusting quality of the patient-clinician relationship. To address this critical knowledge gap, we leveraged feature extraction methods from natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence, to quantify pronoun and non-fluency language markers that are relevant for communicative and emotional aspects of therapeutic relationships. From twenty-eight transcripts of non-manualized psychotherapy sessions recorded in outpatient clinics, we identified therapists' first-person pronoun usage frequency and patients' speech transition marking relaxed interaction style as potential metrics of alliance. Behavioral data from patients who played an economic game that measures social exchange (i.e. trust game) suggested that therapists' first-person pronoun usage may influence alliance ratings through their diminished trusting behavior toward therapists. Together, this work supports that communicative language features in patient-therapist dialogues could be markers of alliance.},

In addition, when clients used fewer negative emotion words in a session, their distress in the days prior to the next session tended to be lower. Lastly, lesser use of first-person singular words in the later versus earlier stages of therapy was associated with improved treatment outcomes.

	abstract = {Using language to distance oneself from negative stimuli (e.g., by reducing use of the word “I” and present-tense verbs) is associated with effective emotion regulation. Given that internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression are characterized by maladaptive emotion regulation, stronger linguistic distance may be both a diagnostic marker of lower internalizing symptoms and a prognostic indicator of treatment progress. Here, we tested these hypotheses in a large corpus of naturalistic psychotherapeutic exchanges between clients and their therapists ({\textgreater}1.2 million messages from 6,229 clients). In both exploratory (n = 3,729) and validation (n = 2,500) datasets, we found that clients’ internalizing symptoms decreased over therapy, that client linguistic distance increased over therapy, and that internalizing symptoms tracked fluctuations in linguistic distance both within and between individuals. In other words, clients shifted from discussing themselves and the present moment to discussing other people and time points over treatment, and this psycholinguistic shift was related to symptom reductions. However, effect sizes for linguistic results were small, and we failed to find consistent evidence that linguistic distance statistically mediated changes in symptoms over time. Finally, clustering analyses revealed that data-driven groups of clients defined solely on the basis of their linguistic distance differed in both their symptom severity and treatment outcomes. Together, these findings provide replicable evidence that linguistic distance is a marker of internalizing symptom severity and treatment progress in real-world therapeutic interactions.},

	abstract = {While artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for addressing societal challenges, issues of exactly which tasks to automate and to what extent to do so remain understudied. We approach this problem of task delegability from a human-centered perspective by developing a framework on human perception of task delegation to AI. We consider four high-level factors that can contribute to a delegation decision: motivation, difficulty, risk, and trust. To obtain an empirical understanding of human preferences in different tasks, we build a dataset of 100 tasks from academic papers, popular media portrayal of AI, and everyday life, and administer a survey based on our proposed framework. We find little preference for full AI control and a strong preference for machine-in-the-loop designs, in which humans play the leading role. Among the four factors, trust is the most correlated with human preferences of optimal human-machine delegation. This framework represents a first step towards characterizing human preferences of AI automation across tasks. We hope this work encourages future efforts towards understanding such individual attitudes; our goal is to inform the public and the AI research community rather than dictating any direction in technology development.},

Researchers have been increasingly interested in ways to apply qualitative methods to "big" data problems, hoping to achieve more generalizable results from larger amounts of data while preserving the depth and richness of qualitative methods. In this paper, we describe a study of qualitative researchers' work practices and their challenges, with an eye towards whether this is an appropriate domain for human-AI collaboration and what successful collaborations might entail. Our findings characterize participants' diverse methodological practices and nuanced collaboration dynamics, and identify areas where they might benefit from AI-based tools. While participants highlight the messiness and uncertainty of qualitative inductive analysis, they still want full agency over the process and believe that AI should not interfere. Our study provides a deep investigation of task delegability in human-AI collaboration in the context of qualitative analysis, and offers directions for the design of AI assistance that honor serendipity, human agency, and ambiguity.},

These findings suggest that the formation of a narrative is critical and is an indicator of good mental and physical health.

The procedure, Assert, is based on asking the adolescents the question “What matters to you?” to define important topics to address in treatment., Methods: Focus groups and interviews were conducted with counsellors who used Assert (N = 27), and the data were analysed with thematic analysis., Results: Five themes were identified: (a) “What Matters to You?” (b) “Professional Responsibility,” (c) “Empowering the Adolescent,” (d) “Practical Utility of Assert in Treatment,” and (e) “The Implementation of Assert.” Each theme had a number of associated sub-themes., Conclusions: Assert was perceived by the counsellors as enhancing collaboration and conveying to the adolescents that the counsellors took their concerns seriously. It also provided structure by giving the sessions a concrete focus. However, some counsellors found it difficult to surrender control to the adolescents, and finding a balance between helping and directing the adolescents to define topics could be challenging at times. Assert was generally considered a useful and simple way to assess adolescents’ concerns, and it was accepted by the counsellors as a positive contribution to their existing methods.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Compared with the treatment of physical conditions, the quality of care of mental health disorders remains poor and the rate of improvement in treatment is slow, a primary reason being the lack of objective and systematic methods for measuring the delivery of psychotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: To use a deep learning model applied to a large-scale clinical data set of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) session transcripts to generate a quantifiable measure of treatment delivered and to determine the association between the quantity of each aspect of therapy delivered and clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All data were obtained from patients receiving internet-enabled CBT for the treatment of a mental health disorder between June 2012 and March 2018 in England. Cognitive behavioral therapy was delivered in a secure online therapy room via instant synchronous messaging. The initial sample comprised a total of 17 572 patients (90 934 therapy session transcripts). Patients self-referred or were referred by a primary health care worker directly to the service.
EXPOSURES: All patients received National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence-approved disorder-specific CBT treatment protocols delivered by a qualified CBT therapist.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were measured in terms of reliable improvement in patient symptoms and treatment engagement. Reliable improvement was calculated based on 2 severity measures: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), corresponding to depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively, completed by the patient at initial assessment and before every therapy session (see eMethods in the Supplement for details).
RESULTS: Treatment sessions from a total of 14 899 patients (10 882 women) aged between 18 and 94 years (median age, 34.8 years) were included in the final analysis. We trained a deep learning model to automatically categorize therapist utterances into 1 or more of 24 feature categories. The trained model was applied to our data set to obtain quantifiable measures of each feature of treatment delivered. A logistic regression revealed that increased quantities of a number of session features, including change methods (cognitive and behavioral techniques used in CBT), were associated with greater odds of reliable improvement in patient symptoms (odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.17) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 1.20, 95\% CI, 1.12-1.27). The quantity of nontherapy-related content was associated with reduced odds of symptom improvement (odds ratio, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.92) and patient engagement (odds ratio, 0.88, 95\% CI, 0.84-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates an association between clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and the content of therapist utterances. These findings support the principle that CBT change methods help produce improvements in patients' presenting symptoms. The application of deep learning to large clinical data sets can provide valuable insights into psychotherapy, informing the development of new treatments and helping standardize clinical practice.},

However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. Method: Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (∼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. Results: Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. Conclusions: Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.},

All the children were post-tested on a set of different theory of mind tasks, sentential complements and relative clauses. The main findings were that the group trained on sentential complements not only acquired the linguistic knowledge fostered by the training, but also significantly increased their scores on a range of theory of mind tasks. In contrast, false belief training only led to improved theory of mind scores but had no influence on language. The control group, trained on relative clauses, showed no improvement on theory of mind posttests.

	abstract = {In an attempt to operationalize an implicit aspect of the therapeutic alliance, this article proposes the use of the innovative, objective, and time-efficient analysis of language style matching (LSM; Niederhoffer \& Pennebaker, 2002). LSM, defined as the degree of similarity in rates of function words in dyadic interactions, is thought to reflect the extent to which conversational partners are automatically coordinating language styles to achieve a common goal. Although LSM has often been researched in the context of everyday conversations, little is known about the matching of clients and therapists’ language style in the psychotherapy process. To demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the LSM approach in psychotherapy, 2 exploratory examples of the application of LSM in long-term psychoanalytic treatments are provided. First, LSM analyses per session and per speaking-turn are described for psychotherapy data of 140 sessions of 7 long-term psychoanalytic treatments in relation to outcome measures. Then, a case study is described in which LSM is triangulated with an observer-rated measure of working alliance in relation to outcome measures. These 2 demonstrative empirical examples were explorative in character and illustrate how LSM might tap into an implicit aspect of the therapeutic relationship, different from the working alliance measured by observers, and relevant for treatment outcome. Future larger-scale psychotherapy studies into the relationship between these implicit aspects of the alliance and treatment outcome and relevant clients and therapists’ variables are warranted.

	abstract = {Millions of people participate in online peer-to-peer support sessions, yet there has been little prior research on systematic psychology-based evaluations of fine-grained peer-counselor behavior in relation to client satisfaction. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by mapping peer-counselor chat-messages to motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. We annotate 14,797 utterances from 734 chat conversations using 17 MI techniques and introduce four new interviewing codes such as ''chit-chat'' and ''inappropriate'' to account for the unique conversational patterns observed on online platforms. We automate the process of labeling peer-counselor responses to MI techniques by fine-tuning large domain-specific language models and then use these automated measures to investigate the behavior of the peer counselors via correlational studies. Specifically, we study the impact of MI techniques on the conversation ratings to investigate the techniques that predict clients' satisfaction with their counseling sessions. When counselors use techniques such as reflection and affirmation, clients are more satisfied. Examining volunteer counselors' change in usage of techniques suggest that counselors learn to use more introduction and open questions as they gain experience. This work provides a deeper understanding of the use of motivational interviewing techniques on peer-to-peer counselor platforms and sheds light on how to build better training programs for volunteer counselors on online platforms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessing patients' suicide risk is challenging, especially among those who deny suicidal ideation. Primary care providers have poor agreement in screening suicide risk. Patients' speech may provide more objective, language-based clues about their underlying suicidal ideation. Text analysis to detect suicide risk in depression is lacking in the literature.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether suicidal ideation can be detected via language features in clinical interviews for depression using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 305 participants between October 2020 and May 2022 (mean age 53.0, SD 11.77 years; female: n=176, 57\%), of which 197 had lifetime depression and 108 were healthy. This study was part of ongoing research on characterizing depression with a case-control design. In this study, 236 participants were nonsuicidal, while 56 and 13 had low and high suicide risks, respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was adopted to assess suicide risk and depression severity. Suicide risk was clinician rated based on a suicide-related question (H11). The interviews were transcribed and the words in participants' verbal responses were translated into psychologically meaningful categories using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC).
RESULTS: Ordinal logistic regression revealed significant suicide-related language features in participants' responses to the HAMD questions. Increased use of anger words when talking about work and activities posed the highest suicide risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.91, 95\% CI 1.22-8.55; P=.02). Random forest models demonstrated that text analysis of the direct responses to H11 was effective in identifying individuals with high suicide risk (AUC 0.76-0.89; P{\textless}.001) and detecting suicide risk in general, including both low and high suicide risk (AUC 0.83-0.92; P{\textless}.001). More importantly, suicide risk can be detected with satisfactory performance even without patients' disclosure of suicidal ideation. Based on the response to the question on hypochondriasis, ML models were trained to identify individuals with high suicide risk (AUC 0.76; P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the perspective of using NLP and ML to analyze the texts from clinical interviews for suicidality detection, which has the potential to provide more accurate and specific markers for suicidal ideation detection. The findings may pave the way for developing high-performance assessment of suicide risk for automated detection, including online chatbot-based interviews for universal screening.},

As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior.},

But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” differs from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (offline sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psycho-social signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

However, such human–AI collaboration poses challenges for more complex tasks, such as carrying out empathic conversations, due to the difficulties that AI systems face in navigating complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks. Here we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We develop HAILEY, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate HAILEY in a non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on TalkLife (N = 300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that our human–AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.6\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger, 38.9\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyse the human–AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing systems to empower humans in open-ended, social and high-stakes tasks such as empathic conversations.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) such as Open AI’s GPT-3 and -4 (which power ChatGPT) and Google’s PaLM, built on artificial intelligence, hold immense potential to support, augment, or even eventually fully automate psychotherapy. Enthusiasm about such applications is mounting in the field as well as industry. These developments promise to address insufficient mental healthcare system capacity and scale individual access to personalized treatments. However, clinical psychology is an uncommonly high stakes application domain for AI systems, as responsible and evidence-based therapy requires nuanced expertise. This paper provides a roadmap for the ambitious yet responsible application of clinical LLMs in psychotherapy. First, a technical overview of clinical LLMs is presented. Second, the stages of integration of LLMs into psychotherapy are discussed while highlighting parallels to the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Third, potential applications of LLMs in clinical care, training, and research are discussed, highlighting areas of risk given the complex nature of psychotherapy. Fourth, recommendations for the responsible development and evaluation of clinical LLMs are provided, which include centering clinical science, involving robust interdisciplinary collaboration, and attending to issues like assessment, risk detection, transparency, and bias. Lastly, a vision is outlined for how LLMs might enable a new generation of studies of evidence-based interventions at scale, and how these studies may challenge assumptions about psychotherapy.},

	abstract = {Although individual psychotherapy is generally effective for a range of mental health conditions, little is known about the moment-to-moment language use of effective therapists. Increased access to computational power, coupled with a rise in computer-mediated communication (telehealth), makes feasible the large-scale analyses of language use during psychotherapy. Transparent methodological approaches are lacking, however. Here we present novel methods to increase the efficiency of efforts to examine language use in psychotherapy. We evaluate three important aspects of therapist language use - timing, responsiveness, and consistency - across five clinically relevant language domains: pronouns, time orientation, emotional polarity, therapist tactics, and paralinguistic style. We find therapist language is dynamic within sessions, responds to patient language, and relates to patient symptom diagnosis but not symptom severity. Our results demonstrate that analyzing therapist language at scale is feasible and may help answer longstanding questions about specific behaviors of effective therapists.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6\% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17\%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.},

Online psychological counselling has emerged as the predominant mode of providing services in response to this demand. In this study, we propose the Psy-LLM framework, an AI-based assistive tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering in psychological consultation settings to ease the demand for mental health professions. Our framework combines pre-trained LLMs with real-world professional Q{\textbackslash}\&A from psychologists and extensively crawled psychological articles. The Psy-LLM framework serves as a front-end tool for healthcare professionals, allowing them to provide immediate responses and mindfulness activities to alleviate patient stress. Additionally, it functions as a screening tool to identify urgent cases requiring further assistance. We evaluated the framework using intrinsic metrics, such as perplexity, and extrinsic evaluation metrics, with human participant assessments of response helpfulness, fluency, relevance, and logic. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psy-LLM framework in generating coherent and relevant answers to psychological questions. This article discusses the potential and limitations of using large language models to enhance mental health support through AI technologies.},

	abstract = {Background
Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining.

Objective
The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice

Methods
This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed.

Results
A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform.

Conclusions
Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

Social media sites are emerging as promising platforms enabling disclosure around a variety of stigmatized concerns, including mental illness. What kind of behavioral changes precede and follow such disclosures? Do the therapeutic benefits of "opening up" manifest in these changes? In this paper, we address these questions by focusing on disclosures of schizophrenia diagnoses made on Twitter. We adopt a clinically grounded quantitative approach to first identify temporal phases around disclosure during which symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be significant. Then, to quantify behaviors before and after disclosures, we define linguistic measures drawing from literature on psycholinguistics and the socio-cognitive model of schizophrenia. Along with significant linguistic differences before and after disclosures, we find indications of therapeutic outcomes following disclosures, including improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions. We discuss the implications of social media as a new therapeutic tool in supporting disclosures of stigmatized conditions.},

	abstract = {Many online communities cater to the critical and unmet needs of individuals challenged with mental illnesses. Generally, communities engender characteristic linguistic practices, known as norms. Conformance to these norms, or linguistic accommodation, encourages social approval and acceptance. This paper investigates whether linguistic accommodation impacts a specific social feedback: the support received by an individual in an online mental health community. We first quantitatively derive two measures for each post in these communities: 1) the linguistic accommodation it exhibits, and 2) the level of support it receives. Thereafter, we build a statistical framework to examine the relationship between these measures. Although the extent to which accommodation is associated with support varies, we find a positive link between the two, consistent across 55 Reddit communities serving various psychological needs. We discuss how our work surfaces a tension in the functioning of these sensitive communities, and present design implications for improving their support provisioning mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered a variety of applications. However, there is still a significant gap in research when it comes to understanding and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in the field of mental health. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data. We conduct a broad range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction fine-tuning. The results indicate a promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for the mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform the best prompt design of GPT-3.5 (25 and 15 times bigger) by 10.9\% on balanced accuracy and the best of GPT-4 (250 and 150 times bigger) by 4.8\%. They further perform on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific language model. We also conduct an exploratory case study on LLMs' capability on the mental health reasoning tasks, illustrating the promising capability of certain models such as GPT-4. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for potential methods to enhance LLMs' capability for mental health tasks. Meanwhile, we also emphasize the important limitations before achieving deployability in real-world mental health settings, such as known racial and gender bias. We highlight the important ethical risks accompanying this line of research.},

Today, online systems are increasingly being viewed as an effective solution for their ability to reach broad populations. As online support groups become popular the workload for human moderators increases. Maintaining quality feedback becomes increasingly challenging as the community grows. Tools that can automatically detect mental health problems from social media posts and then generate smart feedback can greatly reduce human overload. In this paper, we present a system for the automation of interventions using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. In particular, we focus on 'depression' and 'anxiety' related interventions. Psychologists evaluated the quality of the systems' interventions and results were compared against human (i.e. moderator) interventions. Results indicate our intervention system still has a long way to go, but is a step in the right direction as a tool to assist human moderators with their service.},

A recently proposed feature is co-tracking, where data is gathered not only from the perspective of the user managing their condition, but also from their close contacts. The proposed system therefore supports multiple perspectives (data streams) about the same variable of interest (i.e., an individual’s mood). However, the subjective and reciprocal nature of mental health data gives rise to challenges in visualizing uncertainty that must be addressed before clinical use. Here, we create an application-specific typology of uncertainty for visualizing multi-source mental health data, and propose design solutions to communicate this uncertainty. Via a case study of mood tracking with bipolar disorder, we present an interactive visualization prototype for understanding dynamic mood states in close relationships, moving toward a real-world implementation of a co-tracking informatics system.},

Our findings suggest that participants’ engagement with the apps is affected by their level of energy and motivation, depending on the severity of symptoms. Customization is deemed desirable when the required user effort does not exceed users’ mental and motivational capacity and when ample resources are available.

Method: We conducted a systematic literature search for empirical papers investigating effects and experiences of I-PROMs for ROM/CF and found a total of 13 papers. There was only one experimental controlled effectiveness study. Results: We formulated a narrative summary of the data set as a whole. We conducted a secondary analysis of nine papers containing qualitative data on stakeholder experiences with I-PROMs and found three superordinate themes and eight subthemes, summarized as "I-PROMs can facilitate self-reflection for patients, assist in identifying and tracking therapeutic topics, and make patients more committed to therapy by giving them a greater sense of responsibility and empowerment. Formulating goals and problems can be difficult, and lack of progress can be demotivating. Time in therapy is precious and must be spent wisely. Effective use of I-PROMs is facilitated by flexibility and therapists' use of clinical skills." Conclusion: We discuss the limitations of the study and provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice.},

This study examined how clinicians discuss MBC data with patients, including identifying what aspects of these discussions contribute to clinician-patient agreement on the value of MBC, and how clinicians use MBC data to inform treatment decisions. Twenty-six clinician-patient dyads participated in semi-structured interviews and provided a treatment session recording in which MBC data were discussed. Qualitative data analyses revealed four subtypes of dyads: clinician and patient both valued MBC; clinician valued MBC, patient passively participated in MBC; clinician valued MBC, patient had mixed perceptions of MBC; clinician and patient reported moderate or low value for MBC. In dyads for whom both the clinician and patient valued MBC, the clinician provided clear and repeated rationale for MBC, discussed data with patients at every administration, and connected observed scores to patient skills or strategies. Emerging best practices for discussing MBC include providing a strong rationale, discussing results frequently, actively engaging patients in discussions, and using graphs to visualize progress.},

In this Viewpoint, we discuss the CMS approach to incentivize excellent care for underserved populations.There are several challenges with commonly purported solutions to incorporate equity-related factors into quality and value programs (programs linking quality performance to payment, public reporting, or both). If CMS risk-adjusts quality performance based on care for underserved populations, it could mask disparities in quality performance. If CMS lowers quality benchmarks for clinicians treating underserved populations, it could normalize inferior treatment for underserved populations. If CMS rewards those clinicians with no disparities in performance, it could reward clinicians for having across-the-board poor performance. And if CMS only rewards clinicians for “reducing disparities,” CMS would risk only rewarding clinicians with historical disparities.},

We argue for transforming the behavioral health system to meet people where they are, decriminalizing mental illness and substance use disorders to facilitate recovery, and raising awareness of social context and social needs as essential to effective care. We call for supporting structures in the workforce and structures of accountability, outcome measurement, and more generous financing of behavioral health care. These steps have costs, but the enormous benefits of a major transformation in behavioral health policy far outweigh the expenses.},

Mental health diagnoses from medical records were coded using hierarchical categories. Mental health staffing levels and quality measures were from administrative data. Changes in MCS-12 scores were associated with demographics, baseline scores, and diagnostic categories; in fully adjusted models, differences between facilities accounted for only 0.5\% of the total variance between patients. There were small but significant associations of both baseline and changes in MCS-12 scores with staffing levels and administrative measures of the quality of care that support the potential value of adjusted measures of changes in MCS-12 as a PROM-PM. Remaining issues include the low proportion of variability that can be attributed to differences between facilities and the associations of staffing and quality with possible case-mix adjustment variables.},

	abstract = {Medicaid patients with mental illness comprise one of the most high-need and complex patient populations. Value-based reforms aim to improve care, but their efficacy in the Medicaid program is unclear.To investigate if New York state’s Medicaid value-based payment reform was associated with improved utilization patterns for patients with mental illness.This retrospective cohort study used a difference-in-differences analysis to compare changes in utilization between Medicaid beneficiaries whose outpatient practices participated in value-based payment reform and beneficiaries whose practices did not participate from before (July 1, 2013-June 30, 2015) to after reform (July 1, 2015-June 30, 2019). Participants were Medicaid beneficiaries in New York state aged 18 to 64 years with major depression disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or schizophrenia. Data analysis was performed from April 2021 to July 2023.Beneficiaries were exposed to value-based payment reforms if their attributed outpatient practice participated in value-based payment reform at baseline (July 1, 2015).Primary outcomes were the number of outpatient primary care visits and the number of behavioral health visits per year. Secondary outcomes were the number of mental health emergency department visits and hospitalizations per year.The analytic population comprised 306 290 individuals with depression (67.4\% female; mean [SD] age, 38.6 [11.9] years), 85 105 patients with bipolar disorder (59.6\% female; mean [SD] age, 38.0 [11.6] years), and 71 299 patients with schizophrenia (45.1\% female; mean [SD] age, 40.3 [12.2] years). After adjustment, analyses estimated a statistically significant, positive association between value-based payments and behavioral health visits for patients with depression (0.91 visits; 95\% CI, 0.51-1.30) and bipolar disorder (1.01 visits; 95\% CI, 0.22-1.79). There was no statistically significant changes to primary care visits for patients with depression and bipolar disorder, but value-based payments were associated with reductions in primary care visits for patients with schizophrenia (−1.31 visits; 95\% CI, −2.51 to −0.12). In every diagnostic population, value-based payment was associated with significant reductions in mental health emergency department visits (population with depression: −0.01 visits [95\% CI, −0.02 to −0.002]; population with bipolar disorder: −0.02 visits [95\% CI, −0.05 to −0.001]; population with schizophrenia: −0.04 visits [95\% CI, −0.07 to −0.01]).In this cohort study, Medicaid value-based payment reform was statistically significantly associated with an increase in behavioral health visits and a reduction in mental health emergency department visits for patients with mental illness. Medicaid value-based payment may be effective at altering health care utilization in patients with mental illness.},

PD is an iterative process where each phase is planned by reflecting on the results from the previous phase with respect to the participants’ contribution. Key activities of a PD project include: fieldwork; literature reviewing; and development and testing. All activities must be applied with a participatory mindset that will ensure genuine participation throughout the project. Challenges associated with the use of PD include: the time required to properly engage with participants; language and culture barriers amongst participants; the selection of participants to ensure good representation of the user group; and empowerment. PD is an important process, which is complemented by other evaluation strategies that assess organisational requirements, clinical safety, and clinical and cost effectiveness. PD is a methodology which encourages genuine involvement, where participants have an opportunity to identify practical problems and to design and test technology. The process engages participants in storytelling, future planning and design. PD is a multifaceted assessment tool that helps explore more accurately clinical requirements and patient perspectives in telehealth.},

The purposes for using an inductive approach are to (a) condense raw textual data into a brief, summary format; (b) establish clear links between the evaluation or research objectives and the summary findings derived from the raw data; and (c) develop a framework of the underlying structure of experiences or processes that are evident in the raw data. The general inductive approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid findings. Although the general inductive approach is not as strong as some other analytic strategies for theory or model development, it does provide a simple, straightforward approach for deriving findings in the context of focused evaluation questions. Many evaluators are likely to find using a general inductive approach less complicated than using other approaches to qualitative data analysis.},

Performance feedback, in which clinicians are given data on select metrics, is widely used in the context of quality improvement. However, there is a lack of practical guidance describing the process of developing performance feedback systems.
Initial Approach
This study took place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with hospitalist physicians. Participatory design methodology was used to develop a performance dashboard and feedback system. Twenty hospitalist physicians participated in a series of six design sessions and two surveys. Each design session and survey systematically addressed key components of the feedback system, including design, metric selection, data delivery, and incentives. The Capability Opportunity Motivation and Behavior (COM-B) model was then used to identify behavior change interventions to facilitate engagement with the dashboard during a pilot implementation.
Key Insights, Lessons Learned
In regard to performance improvement, physicians preferred collaboration over competition and internal motivation over external incentives. Physicians preferred that the dashboard be used as a tool to aid in clinical practice improvement and not punitively by leadership. Metrics that were clinical or patient-centered were perceived as more meaningful and more likely to motivate behavior change.
Next Steps
The performance dashboard has been introduced to the entire hospitalist group, and evaluation of implementation continues by monitoring engagement and physician attitudes. This will be followed by targeted feedback interventions to attempt to improve performance.},

We conducted a participatory design study, where 5 groups of older adults created 5 designs. Four groups identified at least 1 health metric not currently offered in either the iPhone app store or the Google Play store. At the end of the sessions we administered a questionnaire to determine what health topics participants would like to track via smartphone or tablet. The designs included 13 health topics that were not on the questionnaire. Seventeen of eighteen participants expressed interest in tracking health metrics using a smartphone/tablet despite having little experience with these devices. This shows that older adults have unique ideas that are not being considered by current technology designers. We conclude with recommendations for future development, and propose continuing to involve to older adults in participatory design.},

	abstract = {Background:
Increased availability of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is essential to
alleviating the negative public health and societal effects of behavioral
health problems. A major challenge to implementing and sustaining EBPs
broadly is the limited and fragmented nature of available funding.

Method:
We conducted a scoping review that assessed the current state of evidence on
EBP financing strategies for behavioral health based on recent literature
(i.e., post-Affordable Care Act). We defined financing strategies as
techniques that secure and direct financial resources to support EBP
implementation. This article introduces a conceptualization of financing
strategies and then presents a compilation of identified strategies,
following established reporting guidelines for the implementation
strategies. We also describe the reported level of use for each financing
strategy in the research literature.

Results:
Of 23 financing strategies, 13 were reported as being used within behavioral
health services, 4 had potential for use, 5 had conceptual use only, and 1
was potentially contraindicated. Examples of strategies reported being used
include increased fee-for-service reimbursement, grants, cost sharing, and
pay-for-success contracts. No strategies had been evaluated in ways that
allowed for strong conclusions about their impact on EBP implementation
outcomes.

Conclusion:
The existing literature on EBP financing strategies in behavioral health
raises far more questions than answers. Therefore, we propose a research
agenda that will help better understand these financing strategies. We also
discuss the implications of our findings for behavioral health
professionals, system leaders, and policymakers who want to develop robust,
sustainable financing for EBP implementation in behavioral health
systems.

Plain language abstract:
Organizations that treat behavioral health problems (mental health and
substance use) often seek to adopt and use evidence-based practices (EBPs).
A challenge to adopting EBPs broadly is the limited funding available, often
from various sources that are poorly coordinated with one another. To help
organizations plan effectively to adopt EBPs, we conducted a review of
recent evidence (i.e., since the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act) on
strategies for financing EBP adoption in behavioral health systems. We
present definitions of 23 identified strategies and describe each strategy’s
reported (in the research literature) level of use to fund EBP adoption in
behavioral health services. Of the 23 financing strategies, 13 strategies
had evidence of use, 4 had potential for use, 5 had conceptual use only, and
1 was potentially contraindicated. Examples of strategies with evidence of
use include increased fee-for-service reimbursement, grants, cost sharing,
and pay-for-success contracts. This comprehensive list of EBP financing
strategies may help guide decision-making by behavioral health
professionals, system leaders, and policymakers. The article also presents a
research agenda for building on the current research literature by (1)
advancing methods to evaluate financing strategies’ effects, (2) partnering
with stakeholders and decision-makers to examine promising financing
strategies, (3) focusing on strategies and service systems with the greatest
needs, (4) improving methods to guide the selection of financing strategies,
and (5) paying greater attention to sustainable long-term financing of
EBPs.},

Community and institutional efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus created several challenges to providing mental health services in an acute care setting during the April surge. Most of these challenges were successfully addressed by standardization of infection control protocols, but new challenges emerged including an increase in expenses for infection control and reduction in clinical revenues due to fewer patients, furloughs of mental health services providers and peer specialists in the ED, services not provided or delayed, increased stress due to fear of furloughs or increased workload of those not furloughed, and increases in patients seen with injuries due to risky behavior, violence, and substance use.

Originally developed within anthropology, ethnography is one of the most longstanding social science research approaches. Its emphasis is on the description and analysis of “the everyday”—routine behaviours in their natural settings. Many would characterise ethnography as the process of querying understandings and practices that are taken for granted: it renders the everyday world problematic by making the “ordinary” into the “extraordinary”. It is best understood as a holistic approach that does not rely on any single method of data collection. Observation, which may be unstructured “hanging out” or more structured and purposeful scrutiny of situations to look for particular things, is perhaps the defining feature of ethnography. These observations are often supplemented by interviews (sometimes very informal and part of the “hanging out” process) or documentary materials collected from the setting (e.g. posters, internal memos, reports of meetings), photographs, artefacts, and so on.

The interpretation of these data is very much a function of the researcher’s own skills and judgement,1 and will usually involve searching for themes and patterns in the data and generating explanations and theories …},

The Measurement-Based Care in Mental Health Initiative within the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention partnered with the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Mentoring Program to create an interdisciplinary field-based workgroup. The workgroup included psychologists, clinical social workers, and mental health counselors from PTSD Clinical Teams. The task of the workgroup was to create guidelines for best practice in delivery of MBC in PTSD Clinical Teams given anticipated policy requiring MBC to be used in PTSD Clinical Teams. Framed in the Strategic Action Field Framework for Policy Implementation Research, the current paper evaluates this hybrid top-down and bottom-up process of policy development. Major barriers included difficulty with the workgroup as an authentic bottom-up process, inability to reach the entire field (e.g., focus groups not widely attended by providers), and limited diversity in the workgroup. Facilitators included using consensus to make decisions, support provided to workgroup members by national operations partners, and collaboration and mutual respect among workgroup members. Workgroup members noted an equal, respectful partnership between operations partners and the workgroup; they reported feeling empowered and believed the viewpoints of the field were included in the guidelines. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the workgroup included more guidelines specific to telehealth into the guidelines. This hybrid model provides a process through which frontline workers can inform policy development and implementation.},

Measurement-based care using patient-reported outcome measures has been shown to improve treatment outcomes for patients with mental illness. Despite wide availability of validated measures, measurement-based care is seldom used in clinical practice.

Methods:

The authors conducted a survey of 230 mental health providers across 47 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The survey measured provider attitudes and self-reported use of various components of measurement-based care.

Results:

More than half of the providers (58\%) reported collecting at least one measure for at least half of their patients. Psychiatrists reported using and sharing results less frequently than social workers, nurses, or psychologists. Psychologists reported the most use and sharing of patient-reported measures.

Conclusions:

In this convenience sample of providers, use of measurement-based care was reported to be common and attitudes about the utility of such care were positive. However, professional differences in the use of measurement-based care must be addressed to expand its use.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Routine evaluation of mental health services has become widespread, and the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as clinical aids or discussion tools has been receiving increasing attention. The purpose of this scoping study was to provide a typology of the diverse ways in which studies reporting on PROM use in mental health services have utilized PROMs.

Methods:

Iterative scoping searches of the literature identified articles reporting on the use of PROM feedback in mental health settings, which were then categorized to develop a typology along a dimension of intensity of use of PROM feedback, ranging from no feedback to patient and clinician to clinician-patient discussion that followed a formalized structure.

Results:

Of the 172 studies that were identified, 27 were grouped into five categories, ranging from studies in which there was no PROM feedback to clinician or patient to studies in which a formalized structure was available by which PROM feedback could be discussed between clinician and patient. Of the 11 studies in the category with formalized feedback, nine reported some significant effects of feedback compared with a control condition, and two reported partial significant effects.

Conclusions:

The proposed procedural typology helps explain the diversity of results from studies reporting on the effects of PROM feedback, by highlighting that PROM feedback appears to be more effective when integrated in a formalized and structured manner. Future work is required to isolate these effects from common procedural correlates, such as monitoring of the therapeutic alliance.},

We discuss strategies for overcoming these barriers that are being implemented in several countries, including the need to have quality improvement as part of standard clinical training curricula, refinement of technologies to promote adequate data capture of mental health services, use of incentives to promote provider accountability for improving care, and the need for mental health researchers to improve the evidence base for mental health treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Generative participatory design (PD) may help in developing electronic health (eHealth) interventions. PD is characterized by the involvement of all stakeholders in creative activities. This is different from the traditional user-centered design, where users are less involved. When looking at PD from a research through design perspective, it is important to summarize the reasons for choosing a certain form of generative PD to further develop its methodology. However, the scientific literature is currently unclear about which forms of PD are used to develop eHealth and which arguments are used to substantiate the decision to use a certain form of generative PD.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the reporting and substantiation of generative PD methodologies in empirical eHealth studies published in scientific journals to further develop PD methodology in the field of eHealth.
Methods: A systematic literature review following the Cochrane guidelines was conducted in several databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL EBSCOhost). Data were extracted on the recruitment and management of stakeholders, the use of tools, and the use of outcome measures.
Results: Of the 3131 studies initially identified, 69 were selected for qualitative synthesis. The reporting was very variable, depending to a large extent on whether the study stated that reporting on the PD process was a major aim. The different levels of reporting and substantiation of the choices of a recruitment strategy, stakeholder management, and tools and outcome measures are presented. Only a few authors explicitly used arguments directly related to PD guiding principles such as democratic, mutual learning, tacit and latent knowledge, and collective creativity. Even though PD principles were not always explicitly discussed in the method descriptions of the studies, they were implicitly present, mostly in the descriptions of the use of PD tools. The arguments used to substantiate the choices made in stakeholder management, PD tools, and the type of outcome measures adopted point to the involvement of PD principles.
Conclusions: Studies that have used a PD research methodology to develop eHealth primarily substantiate the choice of tools made and much less the use of stakeholders and outcome measures.

This new context opens an opportunity to evolve norms and perspectives on what is the intent of policy, but perhaps more importantly, on how policy is constructed – and for whom. In this article, we share an alternative to conventional policy design, expanding the notion of “policy-as-content” to embrace a more participatory approach to frame, make, and implement policy. We briefly present how we combined systems and behavioral design frameworks to scaffold prototyping activities during a design research project that explored food waste as a critical path for co-designing sustainable and equitable food systems in the City of Chicago. We highlight relevant activities of this project to show how our approach can challenge embedded norms and privileges in existing urban food systems and interrogate traditional ownership of problem definition and solution finding in policy design processes. Finally, we conclude with the implications of employing this approach to policy design when promoting large-scale change.},

These developments have co-emerged with growing interest in prototyping. Synthesising literatures in design, management and computing, and informed by our participant observation of teams inside government, we propose the defining characteristics of prototyping in policy-making and review the implications of using this approach. We suggest that such activities engender a ‘new spirit’ of policy-making.

This involves the development of integrated approaches to problem solving and to include stakeholder perspectives. This tendency receives strong support by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) that emphasizes an integrated approach to water resources management at basin scale. The WFD requires the inclusion of stakeholders in the process of developing and adopting a river basin management plan. In order to improve stakeholder-based policy design and modeling processes innovation and research is required in linking analytical methods and participatory approaches.

	abstract = {In many service design projects, co-design is seen as critical to success and a range of benefits are attributed to co-design. In this paper, we present an overview of benefits of co-design in service design projects, in order to help the people involved to articulate more precisely and realistically which benefits to aim for. Based on a literature review and a discussion of three service design projects, we identified three types of benefits: for the service design project; for the service’s customers or users; and for the organization(s) involved. These benefits are related to improving the creative process, the service, project management, or longer-term effects. We propose that the people involved in co-design first identify the goals of the service design project and then align their co-design activities, and the associated benefits, to these goals. The paper closes with a brief discussion on the need for developing ways to monitor and evaluate whether the intended benefits are indeed realized, and the need to assess and take into account the costs and risks of co-design.},

Risk adjustment for mental and substance use conditions has lagged behind other areas of medicine, but model development specific to these conditions has accelerated in recent years. After describing outcomes of mental health and substance-related care and associated risk factors, we review research studies on risk adjustment meeting the following criteria: (1) publication in a peer-reviewed journal between 1980 and 2002, (2) evaluation of one or more multivariate models used to risk-adjust comparisons of utilization, cost, or clinical outcomes of mental or substance use conditions across providers, and (3) quantitative assessment of the proportion of variance explained by patient characteristics in the model (e.g., R2 or c-statistic). We identified 36 articles that included 72 models addressing utilization, 74 models of expenditures, and 15 models of clinical outcomes. Models based on diagnostic and sociodemographic information available from administrative data sets explained an average 6.7\% of variance, whereas models using more detailed sources of data explained a more robust 22.8\%. Results are appraised in the context of the mental health care system's needs for risk adjustment; we assess what has been accomplished, where gaps remain, and directions for future development.},

In this paper, we present a framework for promoting quality measurement as a tool for improving quality of mental health care. We identify key barriers to this effort, including lack of standardized information technology-based data sources, limited scientific evidence for mental health quality measures, lack of provider training and support, and cultural barriers to integrating mental health care within general health environments. We describe several innovations that are underway worldwide which can mitigate these barriers. Based on these experiences, we offer several recommendations for improving quality of mental health care. Health care payers and providers will need a portfolio of validated measures of patient-centered outcomes across a spectrum of conditions. Common data elements will have to be developed and embedded within existing electronic health records and other information technology tools. Mental health outcomes will need to be assessed more routinely, and measurement-based care should become part of the overall culture of the mental health care system. Health care systems will need a valid way to stratify quality measures, in order to address potential gaps among subpopulations and identify groups in most need of quality improvement. Much more attention should be devoted to workforce training in and capacity for quality improvement. The field of mental health quality improvement is a team sport, requiring coordination across different providers, involvement of consumer advocates, and leveraging of resources and incentives from health care payers and systems.},

	abstract = {Background
Measurement-based care (MBC) is the practice of routinely administering standardized measures to support clinical decision-making and monitor treatment progress. Despite evidence of its effectiveness, MBC is rarely adopted in routine substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings and little is known about the factors that may improve its adoptability in these settings. The current study gathered qualitative data from SUD treatment clinicians about their perceptions of MBC, the clinical outcomes they would most like to monitor in MBC, and suggestions for the design and implementation of MBC systems in their settings.

Methods
Fifteen clinicians from one publicly-funded and two privately-funded outpatient SUD treatment clinics participated in one-on-one research interviews. Interviews focused on clinicians’ perceived benefits, drawbacks, and ideas related to implementing MBC technology into their clinical workflows. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded to allow for thematic analysis using a mixed deductive and inductive approach. Clinicians also completed a card sorting task to rate the perceived helpfulness of routinely measuring and monitoring different treatment outcomes.

Results
Clinicians reported several potential benefits of MBC, including improved patient-provider communication, client empowerment, and improved communication between clinicians. Clinicians also expressed potential drawbacks, including concerns about subjectivity in patient self-reports, limits to personalization, increased time burdens, and needing to learn to use new technologies. Clinicians generated several ideas and preferences aimed at minimizing burden of MBC, illustrating clinical changes over time, improving ease of use, and improving personalization. Numerous patient outcomes were identified as “very helpful” to track, including coping skills, social support, and motivation for change.

Conclusions
MBC may be a beneficial tool for improving clinical care in SUD treatment settings. MBC tools may be particularly adoptable if they are compatible with existing workflows, help illustrate gradual and nonlinear progress in SUD treatment, measure outcomes perceived as clinically useful, accommodate multiple use cases and stakeholder groups, and are framed as an additional source of information meant to augment, rather than replace, existing practices and information sources.

	abstract = {Objective:

Measurement-based care involves the systematic administration of symptom rating scales and use of the results to drive clinical decision making at the level of the individual patient. This literature review examined the theoretical and empirical support for measurement-based care.

Methods:

Articles were identified through search strategies in PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional citations in the references of retrieved articles were identified, and experts assembled for a focus group conducted by the Kennedy Forum were consulted.

Results:

Fifty-one relevant articles were reviewed. There are numerous brief structured symptom rating scales that have strong psychometric properties. Virtually all randomized controlled trials with frequent and timely feedback of patient-reported symptoms to the provider during the medication management and psychotherapy encounters significantly improved outcomes. Ineffective approaches included one-time screening, assessing symptoms infrequently, and feeding back outcomes to providers outside the context of the clinical encounter. In addition to the empirical evidence about efficacy, there is mounting evidence from large-scale pragmatic trials and clinical demonstration projects that measurement-based care is feasible to implement on a large scale and is highly acceptable to patients and providers.

Conclusions:

In addition to the primary gains of measurement-based care for individual patients, there are also potential secondary and tertiary gains to be made when individual patient data are aggregated. Specifically, aggregated symptom rating scale data can be used for professional development at the provider level and for quality improvement at the clinic level and to inform payers about the value of mental health services delivered at the health care system level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The quality of mental health treatment has not progressed to the same extent as physical health treatment. Suboptimal mental health outcomes may be attributed to the lack of a systematic approach to tracking and measuring patient progress. In psychiatry, Measurement-Based Care (MBC) offers an objective, systematic approach to monitor clinical progress, evaluate treatment efficacy, and inform clinical decisions, yet remains seldom used in daily practice.
AIMS: To identify the clinical impact of using MBC in psychiatry.
METHODS: Using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model as a guideline, this integrative review focused on the research query, “What is the clinical impact of Measurement-Based Care when treating patients with mental illness?”
RESULTS: A total of nine articles met the inclusion criteria for this integrative review. The articles ranged from 2008 to 2021. The following themes were identified from the analysis of these articles: (1) the clinical impact of MBC, (2) provider attitudes about MBC, and (3) barriers to MBC implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: MBC, augmenting usual standard care, provides an objective, systematic approach using quantifiable data to monitor symptom severity and treatment effectiveness. This review highlights the clinical benefits of MBC, including increased remission rates, lower risk of relapse, improved medication adherence, and strengthening the therapeutic alliance. Although this review provides an overview of the benefits of MBC in psychiatry, there remains a substantial practice gap warranting further investigation. Strategies must be developed to address barriers at the individual and organizational levels which impede the successful adoption of MBC.},

	abstract = {Objective:

This review examined the extent to which existing behavioral health quality measures address the priority areas of the National Behavioral Health Quality Framework (NBHQF) as well as the extent to which the measures have received National Quality Forum endorsement and are used in major reporting programs.

Methods:

This review identified behavioral health quality measures in widely used measure inventories, including the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse, National Quality Forum, and the Center for Quality Assessment in Mental Health. Additional measures were identified through outreach to federal agencies. Measures were categorized by type, condition, target population, data source, reporting unit, endorsement status, and use in reporting programs.

Results:

The review identified 510 measures. Nearly one-third of these measures address broad mental health or substance use conditions rather than a specific condition or diagnosis. Seventy-two percent are process measures. The most common data source for measures is administrative claims, and very few measures rely on electronic health records or surveys. Fifty-three (10\%) measures have received National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement, and 28 (5\%) unique measures are used in major quality reporting programs. Several subdomains of the NBHQF, such as treatment intensification, financial barriers to care, and continuity of care, lack measures that are NQF endorsed.

Conclusions:

Despite the wide array of behavioral health quality measures, relatively few have received endorsement or are used in reporting programs. Future efforts should seek to fill gaps in measurement and to identify the most salient and strongest measures in each priority area.},

Depression quality measures aligned with evidence-based practices require that health care organizations use standardized tools for tracking and monitoring patient-reported symptoms and functioning over time. This study describes challenges and opportunities for reporting 5 HEDIS measures which use electronic clinical data to assess adolescent and perinatal depression care quality.
Methods
Two learning collaboratives were convened with 10 health plans from 5 states to support reporting of the depression measures. We conducted content analysis of notes from collaborative meetings and individual calls with health plans to identify key challenges and strategies for reporting.
Results
Health plans used various strategies to collect the clinical data needed to report the measures, including setting up direct data exchange with providers and data aggregators and leveraging data captured in health information exchanges and case management records. Health plans noted several challenges to reporting and performance improvement: 1) lack of access to clinical data sources where the results of patient-reported tools were documented; 2) unavailability of the results of patient-reported tools in usable data fields; 3) lack of routine depression screening and ongoing assessment occurring in provider practices.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate ongoing challenges in collecting and using patient-reported clinical data for health plan quality measurement. Systems to track and improve outcomes for individuals with depression will require significant investments and policy support at the point of care and across the healthcare system.},

Nonetheless, current use of MBC for mental health in VA is low and easily extractable outcomes are not available within the electronic medical record (EMR). This paper reviews obstacles to MBC for mental health in VA and the potential for a measurement feedback system (MFS) to overcome these obstacles. This paper reports the results of a local VA provider survey of barriers to MBC and describes a multidisciplinary, provider-driven local process to develop a software-based MFS to address some of these barriers. This MFS, named COMMEND (Collaborative Mental health Management ENhanced Dashboard), was developed in an iterative fashion with ongoing feedback from providers. It was created to interface with VA’s EMR and provide a way to easily input patient intervention and outcome information, create a progress note, and visualize interventions and outcomes over time on a single graph. This paper describes a pilot implementation of this tool, including a qualitative description of how it was incorporated into a particular provider’s workflow, how features were adapted based on provider feedback, and initial implementation data. Lastly, plans are described to study factors affecting successful implementation and explain how local experiences may be applicable for providers in a variety of settings.},

	abstract = {Article AbstractObjective: A survey of psychiatrists in the United Kingdom found that only a minority routinely used standardized measures to assess outcome when treating depression and anxiety disorders. The goals of the present study were to determine how frequently psychiatrists in the United States use scales to measure outcome when treating depressed patients and, for those clinicians who do not regularly use such scales, to ascertain the reasons for the lack of use. Method: The subjects were 314 psychiatrists who attended a continuing medical education conference in California, Massachusetts, New York, or Wisconsin in 2006 or 2007. Prior to a lecture, the subjects completed a questionnaire that included 2 questions regarding the use of rating scales to monitor outcome when treating depression. Results: More than 80\% of the psychiatrists indicated that they did not routinely use scales to monitor outcome when treating depression. The most frequent reasons psychiatrists gave for not using scales were that they did not believe scales would be clinically helpful, that scales take too much time to use, and that they were not trained in the use of such measures. Conclusions: The majority of psychiatrists indicated that they do not routinely use standardized measures to evaluate outcome when treating depressed patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services†Physician Quality Reporting Initiative is intended to improve quality of care by providing physicians financial incentives to document outcomes reflecting best practices. If standardized outcome assessment is to assume increasing importance in this country, either educational efforts or payor mandates, or both, will be necessary to change clinicians†behavior.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Measurement-based care (MBC) is the systematic evaluation of patient symptoms before or during an encounter to inform behavioral health treatment. Despite MBC's demonstrated ability to enhance usual care by expediting improvements and rapidly detecting patients whose health would otherwise deteriorate, it is underused, with typically less than 20\% of behavioral health practitioners integrating it into their practice. This narrative review addresses definitional issues, offers a concrete and evaluable operationalization of MBC fidelity, and summarizes the evidence base and utility of MBC. It also synthesizes the extant literature's characterization of barriers to and strategies for supporting MBC implementation, sustainment, and scale-up.
OBSERVATIONS: Barriers to implementing MBC occur at multiple levels: patient (eg, concerns about confidentiality breach), practitioner (eg, beliefs that measures are no better than clinical judgment), organization (eg, no resources for training), and system (eg, competing requirements). Implementation science-the study of methods to integrate evidence-based practices such as MBC into routine care-offers strategies to address barriers. These strategies include using measurement feedback systems, leveraging local champions, forming learning collaboratives, training leadership, improving expert consultation with clinical staff, and generating incentives.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This narrative review, informed by implementation science, offers a 10-point research agenda to improve the integration of MBC into clinical practice: (1) harmonize terminology and specify MBC's core components; (2) develop criterion standard methods for monitoring fidelity and reporting quality of implementation; (3) develop algorithms for MBC to guide psychotherapy; (4) test putative mechanisms of change, particularly for psychotherapy; (5) develop brief and psychometrically strong measures for use in combination; (6) assess the critical timing of administration needed to optimize patient outcomes; (7) streamline measurement feedback systems to include only key ingredients and enhance electronic health record interoperability; (8) identify discrete strategies to support implementation; (9) make evidence-based policy decisions; and (10) align reimbursement structures.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Ongoing consultation following initial training is one of the most commonly deployed implementation strategies to facilitate uptake of evidence-based practices, such as measurement-based care (MBC). Group consultation provides an interactive experience with an expert and colleagues to get feedback on actual issues faced, yet there is little research that unpacks the questions raised in consultation and what types of issues are important to address. Methods: The current study characterized the questions and concerns raised by community mental health clinicians (N = 38 across six clinics) during group consultation sessions completed as part of an MBC implementation trial. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of consultation forms completed by clinicians before each MBC consultation session. Results: Clinicians sought MBC consultation for clients across a range of ages and levels of depression severity. Qualitative results revealed five main questions and concerns in consultation sessions: (1) how to administer the PHQ-9, (2) how to review PHQ-9 scores, (3) how to respond to PHQ-9 score, (4) the types of clients for whom MBC would be appropriate, and (5) how MBC could impact a clinician’s usual care. Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for ongoing consultation and limitations of workshop training alone. Practical recommendations for addressing the common questions and concerns identified are presented to support MBC use.},

	abstract = {Numerous trials demonstrate that monitoring client progress and using feedback for clinical decision-making enhances treatment outcomes, but available data suggest these practices are rare in clinical settings and no psychometrically validated measures exist for assessing attitudinal barriers to these practices. This national survey of 504 clinicians collected data on attitudes toward and use of monitoring and feedback. Two new measures were developed and subjected to factor analysis: The monitoring and feedback attitudes scale (MFA), measuring general attitudes toward monitoring and feedback, and the attitudes toward standardized assessment scales-monitoring and feedback (ASA-MF), measuring attitudes toward standardized progress tools. Both measures showed good fit to their final factor solutions, with excellent internal consistency for all subscales. Scores on the MFA subscales (Benefit, Harm) indicated that clinicians hold generally positive attitudes toward monitoring and feedback, but scores on the ASA-MF subscales (Clinical Utility, Treatment Planning, Practicality) were relatively neutral. Providers with cognitive-behavioral theoretical orientations held more positive attitudes. Only 13.9 \% of clinicians reported using standardized progress measures at least monthly and 61.5 \% never used them. Providers with more positive attitudes reported higher use, providing initial support for the predictive validity of the ASA-MF and MFA. Thus, while clinicians report generally positive attitudes toward monitoring and feedback, routine collection of standardized progress measures remains uncommon. Implications for the dissemination and implementation of monitoring and feedback systems are discussed.},

STUDY DESIGN: The study used a portion of the SCL-90 (Symptom Checklist-90) to track the perceived mental health of 1374 patients in a managed behavioral healthcare system over 6 weeks.
METHODS: Participants were randomized into a feedback group whose clinicians received clinical feedback reports at intake and at 6 weeks, and a control group whose clinicians received no report.
RESULTS: Patients in the feedback group achieved statistically significant improvement in clinical status relative to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study suggests that patient-reported mental health assessments have the potential both to become acceptable to clinicians and to improve the effectiveness of clinical care.},

The development and implementation of routine monitoring and measurement-based care (MBC) strategies in naturalistic psychological service settings has emerged as a promising strategy to address fundamental questions and knowledge gaps. This conceptual paper marks the importance of routine monitoring in real world psychological services. In particular, routine monitoring has facilitated the harnessing of ecologically valid practice-based and patient-focused evidence, which would otherwise be lost to the field. In addition to tracing its historical context, the role and impact of routine monitoring is addressed in the areas of (a) documenting the effectiveness of psychological services, (b) patient-focused research and care, and (c) therapist differences and payment models. Limitations and challenges are also identified. Throughout, the public health significance of routine monitoring as it relates to clinical psychology is highlighted, including its increasingly prominent role in health care systems and mental health care policy. In addition, it is argued that routine monitoring should continue to be a vital transtheoretical and transdiagnostic evidence-based practice.},

Greater frequency of data collection is more important for shorter-term therapies, and use of graphs, greater specificity of feedback, and alerts are helpful. Overall effects on patient outcomes are statistically significant (g ≈ 0.15) and increase when clinical support tools (CSTs) are used for not-on-track cases (g ≈ 0.36–0.53). Effects are additive to standard effects of psychological therapies. Organizational, personnel, and resource issues remain the greatest obstacles to the successful adoption of ROM.Conclusion ROM offers a low-cost method for enhancing patient outcomes, on average resulting in an ≈ 8\% advantage (success rate difference; SRD) over standard care. CSTs are particularly effective for not-on-track patients (SRD between ≈ 20\% and 29\%), but ROM does not work for all patients and successful implementation is a major challenge, along with securing appropriate cultural adaptations.},
