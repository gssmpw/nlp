\section{Findings}
\label{sec:findings}

Our findings highlight three themes exploring the design of health information technologies (HITs) that support outcomes data preparation, collection, and use within value-based mental healthcare.
(1) With regards to \textit{preparation}, participants preferred that HITs store functional and engagement outcomes for VBC, as compared to symptom scales or other outcomes data, because they believed functional and engagement outcomes were most directly tied to provided mental health services (Section \ref{sec:findings:preparation}).
(2) Participants also perceived that data \textit{collection} could be improved by investing in HITs that support standardized fields to collect mental health outcomes data, and saw opportunities for devices collecting both active and passive data to improve data collection (Section \ref{sec:findings:collection}).
(3) Finally, participants emphasized that \textit{actions} with outcomes data must hold payers, providers, and social services jointly accountable to care outcomes, and outcomes data need to be risk-adjusted, otherwise providers may prioritize easier to treat patients that inflate outcome metrics (Section \ref{sec:findings:action}).
Throughout our findings, participants are referred to with a unique identifier (eg, CP30) to maintain anonymity.
\rev{These identifiers indicate participants' clinical training (CP = Clinical Psychology, PS = Psychiatry, SW = Social Work, MC = Mental Health Counseling, FT = Family and Marriage Therapist, see Table \ref{tab:participants}).}
Participants referred to individuals receiving mental health services as both ``patients'' and ``clients'', and we use these terms interchangeably in our findings.
