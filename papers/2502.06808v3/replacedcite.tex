Unsupervised domain adaptation is a wildly used setting of transfer learning methods that aims to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains. To solve cross-domain classification tasks, these methods are based on deep feature representation____, which maps different domains into a common feature space. Some recent studies have overcome the imbalance of domains and the label distribution shift of classes to transfer model well____. Some novel settings in domain adaption have also gotten a lot of attention, like source free domain adaption(SFDA)____, test time domain adaption(TTDA)____.
As for graph-structured data, several studies have been proposed for cross-graph knowledge transfer via GDA setting methods____. ACDNE____ adopt k-hop PPMI matrix to capture high-order proximity as global consistency for source information on graphs. CDNE____ learning cross-network embedding from source and target data to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) directly. GraphAE____ analyzes node degree distribution shift in domain discrepancy and solves it by aligning message-passing routers. DM-GNN____ proposes a method to propagate node label information by combining its own and neighbors’ edge structure. 
UDAGCN____ develops a dual graph convolutional network by jointly capturing knowledge from local and global levels to adapt it by adversarial training. ASN____ separates domain-specific and domain-invariant variables by designing a private en-coder and uses the domain-specific features in the network to extract the domain-invariant shared features across networks.  SOGA____ first time uses discriminability by encouraging the structural consistencies between target nodes in the same class for the SFDA in the graph. GraphAE____ focuses on how shifts in node degree distribution affect node embeddings by minimizing the discrepancy between router embedding to eliminate structural shifts.
SpecReg____ used the optimal transport-based GDA bound for graph data and discovered that revising the GNNs’ Lipschitz constant can be achieved by spectral smoothness and maximum frequency response.  JHGDA____ studies the shifts in hierarchical graph structures, which are inherent properties of graphs by aggregating domain discrepancy from all hierarchy levels to derive a comprehensive discrepancy measurement. ALEX____ first creates a label shift enhanced augmented graph view using a low-rank adjacency matrix obtained through singular value decomposition by driving contrasting loss. SGDA____ enhances original source graphs by integrating trainable perturbations (adaptive shift parameters) into embeddings by conducting adversarial learning to simultaneously train both the graph encoder and perturbations, to minimize marginal shifts.
