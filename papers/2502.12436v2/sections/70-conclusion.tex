\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Our study confirms that with a well-trained value function, we can estimate deception signs--- \emph{bait}, \emph{switch}, \emph{edge}---to predict deception. 
%
CTRL-D, our counterfactual RL against deception, has a low recall but a high precision, which can be useful for triggering friction for humans.
%Though our counterfactual RL against deception (CTRL-D) has a low recall but its precision is high that can be useful for triggering friction for humans. 
%
Comparing to a high recall LLM baseline, CTRL-D is better able to predict human lies and generalize, demonstrating high precision consistently on both evaluation data sets. 

While these tasks for deception detection are scoped within Diplomacy, they illustrate the general risks and challenges of \abr{ai}-deception. 
%
Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods to reevaluate trust in suspicious negotiations.
