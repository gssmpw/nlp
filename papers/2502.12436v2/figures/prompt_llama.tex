You are an expert assistant specializing in the Diplomacy board game. Your role is to assist a novice player by analyzing:  

        1. The current board state.  
        
        2. The message history exchanged between the novice player and the counterplayer.  
        
        3. The predicted orders for the counterplayer.  

        Your primary objective is to evaluate whether the counterplayer's predicted orders align with the message history and the board state. 

        Key Evaluation Guidelines:

        1. Consider an order aligned if its purpose or intent is consistent with the counterplayer's stated goals or the tactical/strategic needs implied by the board state.
        
        2. Special orders (e.g., supporting moves from counterplayer) can still be aligned if it serves to ensure the success of a critical move or maintains flexibility in uncertain situations.
        
        3. Misalignment occurs if the order: 
            Contradicts the stated strategy or creates unnecessary risks. 
            Fails to contribute meaningfully to the position given the board state.
            
        4. Evaluate the broader context of each move, including defensive, offensive, or preparatory purposes, and weigh these factors in your analysis. For each predicted order, explain whether it aligns with the message history and board state. Use reasoning that incorporates tactical, strategic, and contextual factors while avoiding overly strict judgments. Limit your evaluation to alignment or misalignment, with short reasoning for each.

        **Predicted Orders of ITALY:**  
        
        ['A TUN - ALB VIA', 'F ION C A TUN - ALB', 'F NAP - TYS', 'A VEN - TRI']

        **Board State:**  
        
        AUSTRIA: ['F TRI', 'A SER', 'A GAL', 'A BUD'], ENGLAND: ['F LON', 'F NWY', 'A YOR', 'F EDI'], FRANCE: ['A POR', 'A SPA', 'F BEL', 'F BRE', 'F MAR', 'A PAR'], GERMANY: ['F DEN', 'A MUN', 'A HOL', 'A BER', 'F KIE'], ITALY: ['A VEN', 'F ION', 'A TUN', 'F NAP'], RUSSIA: ['A WAR', 'F SEV', 'F BOT', 'A RUM', 'A STP'], TURKEY: ['A CON', 'A BUL', 'F BLA', 'F SMY']

        **Message History:**  
        
        Message from AUSTRIA: "France and Turkey are trying to get me to attack you, obviously I will not do that."
        
        Message from ITALY: "With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent."
        
        Message from ITALY: "Turkey will likely bounce me in EAS. Would you be willing to support me into Greece (via convoy)?"
        
        Message from ITALY: "From there, I can support you into Bulgaria."
        
        Message from AUSTRIA: "I'm willing to debate it but I had a different view on this turn. I figured he would bounce you in EAS but what if you went for AEG instead? Unless you're worried about overextending yourself due to France. Because I trust you enough at this point to move Tri to Alb and then we will definitely be able to get Gre in the fall."
        
        Message from ITALY: "Which makes going to AEG/EAS a bit of an overstretch."
        
        Message from ITALY: "If we can get Germany on board I'd feel a lot more comfortable with committing east."
        
        Message from ITALY: "Sorry, some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order."

        **Question(Direct Judgment):**  
        
        I am playing as AUSTRIA. You need to determine whether ITALY is being deceptive based on the above information. Your answer must be one of two categories: Truthful or Deceptive. Provide a brief explanation and highlight any potentially deceptive content.

        **Question(Alignment Judgment):**  
        
        I am playing as AUSTRIA. For each of ITALY's predicted orders, evaluate whether it aligns with the message history and the current board state. Explain the orders first and provide short reasoning and analysis for each predicted move.
