    \small{We have a terrific counter, if you’d like to work with me. 

I can tap Greece and Aegean, which should allow you to save Bulgaria (Const S Bulgaria holding). At the same time, Black Sea Support Armenia to Sevastopol WILL WORK! I’m planning to move over to Trieste, so the end result of all this would be Turkey regaining Sev and remaining at 5 while I take Trieste and get to 5. From there, I think we should be able to work together to finish off Austria.} & \small{Deceptive Moves} \\

    \small{This is too big a risk for me. My preferred move is to Belgium. I understand this may warrant doing a couple of favors for your next year in return. But I just feel too exposed otherwise. I'm about to head out for the evening and I have my move set for Belgium. I'm hoping for your support into there, but I understand if you can't provide it.} & \small{Deceptive Moves} \\ 
    \small{I can move on Picardy, but only if you move on Belgium.  I think Germany is going for him, so now’s your chance to get a slice of France while the getting is good.} & \small{Deceptive Moves} \\

    \small{Hi Turkey! I’m sorry that I’ve been so slow to get in touch. Kind of a rough day for me to begin a game as I e been pretty swamped. Things are clearing up now, and I appreciate you reaching out to me. 

    So far I have notes from Austria and Russia being pretty cagey and non-committal. Perhaps that is just the life of Italy? Nobody really has me in their plans?
    
    I don’t really know what I’m going to do yet, so if you have ideas, or you have a use for me, please let me know. I’d basically be delighted to work with anyone who really wants to work with me. (No sign yet that this includes anyone at all)} & \small{False Excuse} \\

    \rowcolor{grayish} \small{But yeah sorry about that, I had put that in as my orders and then forgot to change them} & \small{False Excuse} \\ 
    \small{If you want me to trust you I think you should give at least one back, as you are much bigger and frankly it's probably in your best interest to go for the solo, although if the rest of the contries cooperate you almost certaintly won't get it. And your definitly going to need me if you want to go for the draw} & \small{Feigning Trust/Loyalty} \\
    \rowcolor{grayish} \small{Well good luck to you too! Let's be friend! Have you heard anything interesting?} & \small{Feigning Trust/Loyalty}\\
    \small{I can't say ik certain of how things will go in the west but I like to maintain peace as long as possible and a few allies I can trust is important as hell in this game} & \small{Feigning Trust/Loyalty}\\
    \rowcolor{grayish} \small{Not sure what your plan is. I'm covering Marseilles, Paris, and Belgium so you have no chance to take a supply center this turn.} & \small{Withholding Information}\\
    \rowcolor{grayish} \small{I’m not sure yet. Lots to think about.} & \small{Withholding Information}\\
