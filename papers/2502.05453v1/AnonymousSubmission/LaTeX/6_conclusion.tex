%In conclusion, this paper introduces {Decentralized Adaptive Knowledge Graph Memory and Structured Communication System} (\textbf{DAMCS}), which is a decentralized cooperative framework for generative agents. \textbf{DAMCS} leverages large language models (LLMs) and a Hierarchical \textbf{Adaptive Knowledge Graph Memory System (A-KGMS)} to address the challenges of multi-agent cooperation in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach enhances agents' ability to plan, communicate, and collaborate effectively by integrating structured output prompts with the memory system for reasoning, alongside efficient \textbf{Structured Communication System (S-CS)}. These components allow agents to balance long-term planning with real-time decision-making, taking into account the motives of others, which significantly enhances task execution and coordination through task parallelization. 

%To validate our framework, we develop an open-world \textbf{Multi-Agent Crafter} for evaluating multi-agent tasks. Extensive evaluations in this environment demonstrate that our framework \textbf{DAMCS} significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in long-term collaborative planning and task efficiency, with more agents completing tasks in fewer timesteps. The introduction of \textbf{Structured Communication System (S-CS)} allowed agents to efficiently manage resource collection by dynamically assigning roles during game-play. This behavior was absent in agents lacking memory or communication, where efforts were often duplicated as agents worked on the same task rather than dividing responsibilities. These findings underscore the potential of combining LLM-driven strategies and knowledge graphs to enhance cooperation, learning, and decision-making in decentralized multi-agent systems. This work paves the way for further exploration of LLM-powered agents in complex, dynamic environments.

In conclusion, this paper introduces the Decentralized Adaptive Knowledge Graph Memory and Structured Communication System (DAMCS), a decentralized framework for generative agents. DAMCS leverages LLMs and a hierarchical Adaptive Knowledge Graph Memory System (A-KGMS) to improve multi-agent cooperation in dynamic environments. By integrating structured output with A-KGMS and the Structured Communication System (S-CS), agents effectively balance long-term planning with real-time decision-making.

%To validate our framework, we extended the open-world \textbf{Multi-Agent Crafter} environment for multi-agent tasks. Evaluations show that \textbf{DAMCS} significantly outperforms baselines, particularly in task efficiency and collaboration, reducing redundant efforts and improving coordination. The introduction of \textbf{S-CS} allowed agents to dynamically assign roles, improving resource management and task division. These results highlight the potential of LLM-driven strategies and knowledge graphs to enhance cooperation in decentralized multi-agent systems.
