\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We presented FastVim, which enhances Vim's efficiency by reducing its computational complexity and increasing practical throughput speed. Remarkably, FastVim achieves this without any performance degradation compared to the baseline Vim model across multiple tasks, even though it contextualizes significantly fewer tokens in the SSM scan at each layer. By using pooling, our method delivers up to 72.5\% overall throughput speedup (while reducing the parallel steps in SSM scan by \(2\times\)), with the gap widening at higher resolutions (longer token sequences). Our FastMaskVim sets the new state-of-the-art performance of \textit{86.7\%} on ImageNet-1k for Mamba-based encoders and ranks among the top 12 visual encoders (when only ImageNet-1k is used). Additionally, it achieves substantial improvements over Transformer baselines in microscopy imaging. Beyond extending to Mamba-2~\cite{mamba2}, future work will also explore applying FastVim in gigapixel imaging, such as histopathology~\cite{nasiri2024vim4path, graikos2024learned, xu2024whole}, as well as in video domain~\cite{li2025videomamba, das2021vpn++, ashutosh2023hiervl} aligning with FastChannelVim.
