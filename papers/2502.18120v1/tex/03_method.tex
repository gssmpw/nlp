\section{Methods}
Our goal for this paper was to understand the benefits and challenges teenager Roblox creators encountered in online communities. To this end, we interviewed participants who have joined at least one online developer community and have self-identified as "creators" in Roblox.

\subsection{Participants}
We recruited participants who met three primary criteria: 1) Teenagers between the ages of 13 - 19,\footnote{\rv{Participants in South Korea were recruited up to age 19, as 19 is the age of majority in South Korea according to legal and cultural norms. Non-Korean participants were recruited up to age 18.}} 2) ``Creators'' who have created two games or three game elements, per Roblox's definition of having created development tools (games, maps, models, or assets) or avatar items (User Generated Content, UGC), 3) being a member in at least one online developer community related to Roblox. \rv{We included participants aged 13â€“19 to capture a broad spectrum of experiences, as online behaviors and risks vary across different stages of adolescence~\cite{diaz2024dysfunctional}.} To verify that participants were creators, we required them to share their creations with us during the interview.

To recruit such participants, we posted interview calls in popular Roblox online communities. We first joined online communities that showed up in a Google search for Roblox developer communities, including the Roblox official Developer Forum (DevForum), three Discord servers, and one Reddit subcommunity (r/robloxgamedev). Within those communities, we posted interview calls after getting permission from the moderators. We also recruited participants via snowball sampling, and we posted new calls in communities we learned about in early interviews. In total, calls were posted on the DevForum English and Korean Recruitment pages, nine Discord servers, one Reddit subcommunity, and one Naver Cafe --- a social platform popular in Korea. Participants who were willing to be interviewed filled out a pre-survey that was designed to check whether participants matched our recruitment criteria. As a result, 21 participants were recruited. One participant dropped as she did not want to share what she made and two did not fit our criteria. In the end, we interviewed 18 participants. 
In Table ~\ref{tab:demographics}, we show the demographics and information about our participants. The mean age of the participants was 16.3 years old (SD = 1.3) with a range of 14--19 years old. All participants were high school students except C15 who was enrolled in college at the time of the interview. Sixteen participants identified as male, and two participants identified as female. While there is no official census on the developer gender distribution of Roblox, statistics from StackOverflow developers show that female participants may be significantly underrepresented in developer communities. Of the 18 participants, 15 identified themselves as skilled in Scripting (programming) and 7 in 3D Modeling (multiple-choice possible). The average years of experience as a Roblox creator was 3.4 years (details \rv{in} Table ~\ref{tab:demographics}). 11 Koreans, 3 Americans, and one \rv{participant from each of Malaysia, Spain, Japan, and Denmark} were recruited. While we had originally intended to report how long each participant had been in the developer community they had joined, we found that most participants had joined multiple communities (with one participant reporting having joined over 200) and could not recall the exact dates of joining. Therefore, instead, we report the platforms that each participant joined communities through.


\subsection{Semi-structured Interview Method}
We conducted semi-structured interviews to understand how teenager Roblox creators used online developer communities, the benefits they gained, and the challenges they faced. Interviews generally proceeded in four phases: 1) warm-up questions, 2) experiences as a creator, 3) developer community usage, benefits, and challenges, and 4) offline impact of Roblox developer experience. Example questions include \textit{"Where did you go when you were stuck when creating {previously mentioned creation}?", "What would you miss if {joined online community} did not exist?" "Have you shown what you made to your parents?"}. \rv{The full interview protocol is shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:questions}}. All interviews were conducted online via Discord Call or Zoom (without video) from the 3rd of July to August 15th, 2024 by the first author. The interviews were conducted in either English or Korean based on the interviewee's preference. The average length of the interview was 77 minutes. All participants received \$20 (or equivalent in local currency) for participating in the interview.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}
This study was approved by the KAIST Institutional Review Board. However, as we involved teenage participants, we took additional precautions beyond those required by our institution. Participants were sent the interview questions in advance, and before the interview, we again explained the interview process thoroughly to ensure that they fully understood the interview contents and \rv{how} the data would be collected for payment and analysis. Also, we emphasized that participants could skip a question or end the interview if they did not want to answer. Further, for payment, all participants received their parent or guardian's signature. After receiving the participants' consent, we proceeded with the interviews.

\subsection{Analysis}
We conducted inductive thematic coding~\cite{braun2006using} \rv{following the six steps of Braun's method on interview transcripts to understand the experiences of teens in Roblox developer communities and the benefits and challenges they perceived}.
%to analyze the transcriptions. 
The process started with uploading all audio recordings of the interview to Dovetail.\footnote{\url{https://dovetail.com/}} The transcriptions were automatically done in English or Korean based on the interview language by Dovetail. Then, the first and second authors each \rv{open-}coded six interview transcripts independently while correcting inaccurate transcriptions along the way, \rv{identifying} low-level \rv{themes} \rv{focusing on how various online communities support teen developers of Roblox but also the challenges they face as a teenager}. Next, the two authors discussed the \rv{themes} to reduce the initial \rv{themes} from 587 low-level concepts to 15 higher-level themes. The final themes were merged or split iteratively via Dovetail through rounds of discussion \rv{on overlapping themes or disagreements}. 
%After agreeing on the final codes, 
\rv{Based on the refined themes,} the two interviewers \rv{engaged in another iterative discussion regarding remaining inconsistencies, disagreements, and newly emarging themes, re-coding} two interviews (C5, C12) independently again \rv{to confirm agreement}. {Cohen's Kappa was calculated to determine} inter-rater agreement, \rv{reaching a value of 0.78}. After reaching agreement \rv{on the themes}, the first author coded the remainder of the interviews. The \rv{final list of themes} can be seen in Appendix~\ref{appendix:codebook}.

\subsection{Limitations}
Before presenting our results, we acknowledge several limitations of this paper. First, our participant sample does not fully represent the global population of teen Roblox developers. Though we do not know official statistics on teen Roblox developers, there is an absence of participants from South America, Africa, and other regions \rv{in our sample (See Table ~\ref{tab:demographics})}. Since different cultures have communities operating in their languages, our findings are constrained by the language capabilities of the research team. Moreover, even within the same language, each community has unique norms; for this study, we recruited primarily from larger communities with more than 10,000+ participants, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. 

Further, because our recruitment calls included criteria that required participants to have made at least two creations, our participants are likely skewed toward those who are more active community members. As seen in Table ~\ref{tab:demographics}, the majority of the participants in this study had spent more than two years creating content for Roblox, so true newcomers who had just begun creating are underrepresented in our sample.
