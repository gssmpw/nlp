\section{Conclusion}

For teenagers, creating games is a valuable and engaging method for fostering skills in computational thinking, collaboration, and creative problem-solving. Despite the increased accessibility of game development, many \rv{teen} developers encounter challenges due to the diverse skill sets required. Based on interviews with 18 teen Roblox \rv{developers}, we show how online communities can provide significant benefits, including access to learning resources, opportunities for collaboration, and the growth of transferable skills beyond the gaming platform. However, these communities also present challenges, often stemming from problematic behaviors exhibited by other users within the community, unsupportive guardians, or community environment factors such as school-life balance. These findings highlight the need for more structured guidance and best practices to maximize the positive impacts of online communities and provide a safer space for \rv{teen developers} in their developmental journeys. We hope our work can further spur discussion on the nuances of designing positive online social experiences for \rv{teen developers}.
