\textbf{Prompt: } You are now working as an excellent expert in chemistry and drug discovery.\\
\\
Your task is to predict \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Task Description\}}} \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}}.\\
\\
Your reasoning should be based on reports from various agents involved in drug discovery:\\
- Molecule Understanding Agent: Focuses on analyzing the structure of the target molecule.\\
- Drug Relation Agent: Evaluates the structural similarity between the target molecule and related molecules.\\
- Biology Relation Agent: Examines the biological relationships among the related molecules.\\
\\
Below is the report from each agent.\\
\\
Molecule Understanding Agent:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Report from Molecule Understanding Agent\}}}\\
\\
Drug Relation Agent:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Report from Drug Relation Agent\}}}\\
\\
Biology Relation Agent:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Report from Biology Relation Agent\}}}\\
\\
Based on the reports, \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Task Description and Answering Format\}}}\\
\\
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER CONTENT INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE.\\
