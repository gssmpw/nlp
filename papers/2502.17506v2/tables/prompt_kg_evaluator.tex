\textbf{Prompt: } You are now working as an excellent expert in chemistry and drug discovery.\\
Your task is to decide whether to utilize the knowledge graph structure by evaluating the structural \\ similarity between the target molecule and the anchor drug within the knowledge graph.\\
If the target molecule and the anchor drug show high similarity, the knowledge graph should be \\ leveraged to extract relevant information.\\
\\
The Tanimoto similarity between the target molecule \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}} and the anchor drug \\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}} (\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Drug Name\}}}) is \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Tanimoto Similarity\}}}.\\
\\
You should answer in the following format:\\
\\
Answer = YES or NO\\
REASON = YOUR REASON HERE\\
\\
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER CONTENT INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE.\\
