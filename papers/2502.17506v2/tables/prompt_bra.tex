\textbf{Prompt: } You are now working as an excellent expert in chemistry and drug discovery.\\
Your task is to predict \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Task Description\}}} by analyzing the relationships between the anchor drug, \\which shares tanimoto similarity of \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Tanimoto Similarity\}}} with the target molecule, \\and the most closely related drugs in the knowledge graph. \\
\\
You should explain the reasoning based on the intermediate nodes between the \\related drugs and the anchor drug, as well as the types of relationships they have.\\
\\
The two-hop relationships between the drugs will be provided in the following format:\\
(Drug A, relation, Entity, relation, Drug B), where the entity can be one of the following \\three types of entities: (gene/protein, effect/phenotype, disease)\\
\\
Are you ready?\\
\\
Target molecule: \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}}\\
\\
Here are the two-hop relationships:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Two-hop Paths\}}}\\
\\
DO NOT ANSWER IN THE PROVIDED FORMAT.\\
DO NOT WRITE MORE THAN 300 TOKENS.\\
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER CONTENT INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE.\\
