\textbf{Prompt: } You are now working as an excellent expert in chemistry and drug discovery.\\
\\
Your task is to \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Task Description\}}} by analyzing its structural similarity to anchor drugs \\and related drugs, and provide an explanation grounded in its resemblance to these other drugs.\\
\\
Are you ready?\\
\\
The Tanimoto similarity between the target molecule \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}} and the anchor drug \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}} \\ (\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Drug Name\}}} is \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Tanimoto Similarity\}}}.\\
\\
The anchor drug \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Drug Name\}}} is highly associated with the following molecules \\in the knowledge graph: \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Reference Drugs\}}}.\\
\\
The Tanimoto similarities between the target molecule \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}} and the related drugs \\in the knowledge graph are \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Tanimoto Similarity\}}}.\\
\\
DO NOT WRITE MORE THAN 300 TOKENS.\\
