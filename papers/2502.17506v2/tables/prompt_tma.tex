\textbf{Prompt: } You are now working as an excellent expert in chemistry and drug discovery.\\
\\
Your task is to predict \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Task Description\}}} by using the SMILES representation \\and description of a molecule, and explain the reasoning based on its description.\\
\\
You can also consider the report from other agents involved in drug discovery:\\
- Drug Relation Agent: Evaluates the structural similarity between the target molecule and related molecules.\\
- Biology Relation Agent: Examines the biological relationships among the related molecules.\\
\\
Are you ready?\\

SMILES: \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{SMILES\}}}\\
Description: \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Caption\}}}\\
\\
Below is the report from other agents.\\

Drug Relation Agent:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Report from Drug Relation Agent\}}}\\
\\
Biology Relation Agent:\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\{Report from Biology Relation Agent\}}}\\
\\
DO NOT WRITE MORE THAN 300 TOKENS.\\
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER CONTENT INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE.\\
