% \noindent \textbf{Notations and Problem Setup.}
% % We consider a molecule $g$ as a 2D molecular graph denoted as $g = (\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{A})$, with node features $\mathbf{X}$, and adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
% In this paper, we assume access to two external databases: a molecule caption database $\mathcal{C}$ and biology knowledge graph $\mathcal{G}$. Together, these account for the majority of molecular databases typically available. 

% The molecule caption database $\mathcal{C}$ consists of a collection of tuples $(g,c)$, where each molecule $g$ is associated with a textual description $c$.
% %Although each molecule may have multiple captions from various sources, we consolidate all captions into a single unified caption. 
% The knowledge graph $\mathcal{G}$ is composed of a set of entities $\mathcal{E}$ and a set of relation $\mathcal{R}$ connecting these entities. While entities can include various concepts such as drugs, proteins, or diseases, our work assumes that molecule (or drug) entities are present.

% Given any molecule $g$ that is not necessarily in databases $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{G}$, our goal is to predict specific properties of interest of that molecule.

% %The entities in knowledge graph $\mathcal{E}$ include various biological entities such as drugs, proteins, and diseases.
% %Moreover, these entities are interconnected within the knowledge graph through various relationships $\mathcal{R}$. 
% %For instance, drugs and proteins are connected if the drugs target the proteins.

\noindent \textbf{Tanimoto Similarity.}
The Tanimoto similarity is a widely accepted criterion for calculating the similarity between two molecules based on their molecular fingerprint \cite{bajusz2015tanimoto}, which are the binary sequences that denote the presence or absence of specific substructures \cite{rogers2010extended}.
Given two molecules $g_i$ and $g_j$ with fingerprints $\mathtt{fp}_i$ and $\mathtt{fp}_j$, the Tanimoto similarity $s_{i,j}$ is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\small
s_{i,j} = \frac{|\mathtt{fp}_i \cap \mathtt{fp}_j|}{|\mathtt{fp}_i| + |\mathtt{fp}_j| -  |\mathtt{fp}_i \cap \mathtt{fp}_j|}.
\label{eq: Tanimoto}
\end{equation}
Intuitively, the Tanimoto similarity is the intersection-over-union of the sets of molecular substructures of both molecules.

% \noindent \textbf{Tasks.}
% For a given molecule $g$, our objective is to perform various drug discovery tasks through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents using external knowledge sources, i.e., molecule caption database $\mathcal{C}$ and biological knowledge graph $\mathcal{G}$.
