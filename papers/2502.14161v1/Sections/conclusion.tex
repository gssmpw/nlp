\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we studied the {\InducedM} and {\AcyclicM} problems under the perspective of parameterized complexity.
In particular, we presented tight lower bounds under the pw-SETH for the pathwidth parameterization of both problems
(equivalence even in the case of \InducedM), rendering known treewidth algorithms optimal.
Furthermore, we considered the parameterization by clique-width and developed a tight $\sO(3^{\cw})$ algorithm for \InducedM,
as well as an $2^{\bO(\cw)} n^{\bO(1)}$ algorithm for \AcyclicM, which is optimal under the ETH.
As a direction for future work, it would be interesting to develop an algorithm for {\AcyclicM} parameterized by clique-width
that is optimal under the (pw-)SETH.
Although recently there has been a flurry of results regarding optimal algorithms for connectivity problems parameterized by clique-width~\cite{arxiv/BojikianK24,icalp/BojikianK24,esa/HegerfeldK23},
the case of \FVS, which is closely related to \AcyclicM, remains open.
