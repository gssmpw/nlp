\section{Induced Matching}\label{sec:induced}

In this section we consider the {\InducedM} problem.
Chaudhary and Zehavi~\cite{wg/ChaudharyZ23a} developed an algorithm of running time $\sO(3^\tw)$,
where $\tw$ denotes the treewidth of the input graph, and left as an open question whether this is optimal.
As our first result, in \cref{thm:induced:lb} we show that this is indeed the case,
as obtaining an algorithm of running time $\sO((3 - \varepsilon)^\pw)$ is equivalent to falsifying the pw-SETH.
Next, we develop a DP algorithm of running time $\sO(3^\cw)$ for the problem, where $\cw$ denotes the clique-width of the input graph.
Since $\cw(G) \le \pw(G) + 2$ for any graph $G$, our algorithm is optimal under the pw-SETH due to \cref{thm:induced:lb}.
