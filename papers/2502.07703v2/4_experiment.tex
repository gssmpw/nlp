\subsection{Datasets and Evaluation Metric}
% Our algorithm was evaluated using the NTU4DRadLM dataset \cite{zhang2023ntu4dradlm}, the Snail-Radar dataset  \cite{huai2024snail} and $\textit{Fog-Filled hallway}$ sequence of the DR-LRIO \cite{DR-LRIO}. All these datasets provide 4D radar, \ac{LiDAR}, and \ac{IMU} data across various sequences. The NTU4DRadLM dataset includes a solid-state LiDAR, while the Snail-Radar and $\textit{Fog-Filled hallway}$ dataset employs a spinning LiDAR, resulting in differences in \ac{FOV}. 


% The NTU4DRadLM dataset consists of a total of six sequences. The $\textit{loop*}$ sequences involve a car platform driving in a semi-structured environment at 25-30 km/h. The $\textit{cp}$ and $\textit{nyl}$ sequences are recorded using a handcart platform moving at 1 m/s. $\textit{loop1}$ and $\textit{garden}$ sequences are not used for evaluation due to the absence of some raw data.

% The NTU4DRadLM dataset includes six sequences: $\textit{loop*}$ sequences feature a car platform driving at 25-30 km/h in a semi-structured environment, while $\textit{cp}$ and $\textit{nyl}$ are recorded with a handcart moving at 1 m/s. $\textit{loop1}$ and $\textit{garden}$ sequences are excluded from evaluation due to missing raw data.

% The Snail-Radar dataset is collected using handheld, e-bike, and SUV, capturing data under adverse weather conditions like heavy rain. Compared to NTU4DRadLM, it features more structured and dynamic environments. 

% The $\textit{Fog-Filled hallway}$ sequence was collected using a drone in a geometrically uninformative environment. Due to the absence of a ground truth trajectory, this dataset was used exclusively for gravity estimation experiments.

% For the gravity estimation experiments, the difference from the ground truth was calculated using the $\mathbb{S}^2 \boxminus$ operation \cite{he2021kalman}. The global gravity ground truth was obtained through stationary initialization.
% We compared it with three state-of-the-art LIO algorithms: FAST-LIO2 \cite{FAST-LIO}, Point-LIO \cite{POINT-LIO}, and DLIO \cite{DLIO}. The comparison was conducted by calculating the \ac{RMSE} of the absolute trajectory error (ATE) using the evo \cite{grupp2017evo}. Translation error is measured in meters, and angle error in degrees.

We evaluated GaRLIO on three datasets: NTU4DRadLM \cite{zhang2023ntu4dradlm}, which uses a solid-state LiDAR, and Snail-Radar \cite{huai2024snail} and $\textit{Fog-Filled hallway}$ \cite{DR-LRIO}, both employing spinning LiDARs.

We compared GaRLIO with the three state-of-the-art LIOs: FAST-LIO2 \cite{FAST-LIO}, Point-LIO \cite{POINT-LIO}, and DLIO \cite{DLIO}. Although it would be ideal to compare our method with other radar-LiDAR-Inertial odometry approaches such as DR-LRIO \cite{DR-LRIO}, the unavailability of their code has precluded such evaluations. Consequently, we selected our comparison targets from established LIO algorithms.

We computed the \ac{RMSE} of the \ac{ATE} using evo \cite{grupp2017evo}, with translation errors in meters and angular errors in degrees. Results are \textbf{bold} for best, and \underline{underlined} for second best. Legends for \figref{fig:iaef_traj} and \figref{fig:sl_sequence} are the same as in \figref{fig:loop3}.

\subsection{Evaluation on Velocity-aware Gravity Estimation}
\label{subsec:gravity test}
% We first validated the performance of our velocity-aware approach in gravity estimation.
We performed a comparative analysis between our velocity-aware gravity estimation method and velocity-ignorant approach that utilizes double integration. The evaluation was performed across different platforms, including \ac{UGV} $(\textit{loop2}$), and drone ($\textit{Fog-Filled hallway}$). For gravity evaluation, we measured the deviation from the ground truth using the $\boxminus$ operation on $\mathcal{S}^2$ \cite{he2021kalman}. The global gravity ground truth is obtained through stationary initialization. As illustrated in \figref{fig:double integration}, our method exhibits robust gravity estimation results, maintaining minimal deviation. The disparity between velocity-ignorant and velocity-aware methods is more significant on the \ac{UGV} platform. 
\ac{UGV} introduces significant bias and noise in \ac{IMU} measurements arise from contact friction. These errors are exacerbated due to double integration, thus resulting in inaccuracy. In conclusion, our velocity-aware approach is more feasible for predicting gravity.

The effect of leveraging radar measurements on gravity estimation is depicted in \tabref{tab:velocity measurement}. Exploiting velocity updates with radar measurement consistently enhances the accuracy of estimated gravity, thus highlighting the effectiveness of radar measurement in gravity estimation.

\subsection{NTU4DRadLM Dataset}
\label{subsec:ntu}

The evaluation results for the NTU4DRadLM dataset are shown in \tabref{tab:NTU4DRadLM}. In the \textit{loop2} and \textit{loop3} sequences, where data were collected using a car, our method outperformed other LIO methods in both translation and rotation. \figref{fig:loop3} shows the qualitative results in \textit{loop3}. While other baselines show degraded performance due to steep uphill and downhill segments, GaRLIO achieves accurate estimation results in such challenging scenarios. This exhibits the robustness of our velocity-aware gravity estimation, even with significant elevation changes.
However, in $\textit{nyl}$, Point-LIO achieved the best performance.
In \textit{nyl}, the data was collected using a handcart, which causes significant vibrations.
Point-LIO effectively handles these noisy measurements by estimating acceleration and angular velocity as part of the state.
GaRLIO is not specifically designed for such conditions, although it achieves comparable performance.

\subsection{Snail-Radar dataset}
\label{subsec:snail}

% For the Snail Radar dataset, sequences collected using the E-Bike ($\textit{sl}$) and SUV ($\textit{if, iaf, iaef}$) were used for evaluation.

% Notably, in the $\textit{iaef}$ sequence, which includes a tunnel, the use of velocity residuals enables robust state estimation.
As shown in \tabref{tab:Snail-Radar} and \figref{fig:iaef_traj}, our method outperforms other LIO algorithms throughout the experiments. 
Specifically, in the $\textit{sl}$ sequence, other baselines exhibit significant errors in the $z$-axis due to the vigorous dynamic movements of the e-bike as shown in \figref{fig:sl_sequence}. Additionally, the Snail-Radar dataset contains various dynamic objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians, which affected the state predictions of FAST-LIO2 and Point-LIO, leading to degraded RMSE performance.
Conversely, GaRLIO effectively mitigates drift in the roll and pitch directions through the velocity-aware gravity residuals, resulting in robust elevation estimation. Furthermore, GaRLIO successfully removes dynamic objects within the LiDAR by leveraging radar, as shown \figref{fig:dynamic}, resulting in more reliable performance compared to other methods.
DLIO shows second-best performance across most sequences attributed to Geometric Observer and a continuous-time method. However, the absence of a dynamic handling mechanism and an update module based on velocity information reveals limitations along the experiments.

\subsection{Ablation Study}
\label{subsec:ablation}

To evaluate the effect of each residual and dynamic removal module, we conducted experiments using various platforms, including a handcart (\textit{cp}, \textit{nyl}), a car (\textit{loop2}, \textit{loop3}), and an e-bike (\textit{sl}). We created five variants by disabling two of the residuals ($\texttt{g\&v}$) and Dynamic removal module ($\texttt{d}$): $\texttt{w/o g\&v\&d}$, $\texttt{w/o g\&v}$, $\texttt{w/o v}$, $\texttt{w/o g}$, $\texttt{FULL}$, evaluated in terms of \ac{ATE}.
% The results of the ablation study are presented in \tabref{tab:Ablation}.
% We observed that, except for the $\textit{cp}$ sequence, the variant that included both residuals had a lower RMSE compared to the others.

\subsubsection{Effect of Velocity Residual}
As depicted in \tabref{tab:Ablation}, incorporating velocity residuals significantly enhances performance. This result corroborates the discussion in \secref{subsec:gravity test}, demonstrating that incorporating velocity measurements facilitates more precise gravity estimation, thereby improving odometry estimation accuracy. 
Furthermore, the \textit{loop3} and \textit{loop2} sequences,
which were collected using a car with higher speeds,
demonstrate substantial improvements in state estimation through the incorporation of velocity residuals compared to \textit{cp}, \textit{nyl}, and \textit{sl}, which are the slower sequences. This improvement is attributed to the inherent limitations of existing LIO methods that depend on kinematic models for velocity estimation, which are less accurate than our method at higher speeds.

\subsubsection{Effect of Gravity Residual}
When using gravity residuals without the addition of velocity measurements, a decline in performance was observed in $\textit{loop3}$ and $\textit{loop2}$, as indicated by the comparison between $\texttt{w/o g\&v}$ and $\texttt{w/o v}$. 
As shown in \tabref{tab:velocity measurement}, GaRLIO relies on the accuracy of the velocity for precise gravity estimation, which likely leads to performance degradation in the absence of velocity measurements. 
Accurate gravity estimation through velocity updates significantly improves odometry performance, as demonstrated by the comparison between $\texttt{w/o g}$ and $\texttt{FULL}$. These enhancements are particularly noticeable in elevation estimation, as seen in \figref{fig:gravity}.

\subsubsection{Effect of Dynamic Removal Module}
The impact of the dynamic removal module can also be observed in \tabref{tab:Ablation}.
Removing dynamic objects using radar point clouds improves performance in most sequences, with particularly notable enhancements in those containing numerous dynamic objects, such as \textit{loop3}, \textit{loop2}, and \textit{sl}.
These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust in environments with a high density of dynamic points.
