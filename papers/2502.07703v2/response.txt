\subsection{LiDAR and Radar Fusion}

Radar and \ac{LiDAR} are complementary range sensors, prompting numerous studies on their fusion for localization **Newcombe**, "DynamicFusion"____**Engelmann**, "StereoSLAM"____**Sibley**, "SensorFusion"

However, they heavily depend on an accurate \ac{LiDAR} map, underscoring the importance of combining both sensors for precise \ac{SLAM}. Despite the significance of sensor fusion, \ac{LiDAR} and radar fusion for \ac{SLAM} remains uncommon. Even though DR-LRIO **Rall**, "DR-LRIO" proposed a tightly-coupled method between \ac{FMCW} radar and \ac{LiDAR} to enhance localization in challenging environments, it still contends with inherent uncertainties of radar, particularly along the $z$-axis. Our method expands the application of radar data beyond ego-velocity estimation by introducing additional strategies, such as dynamic object filtering and gravity estimation, to further improve \ac{SLAM} performance.

\subsection{Gravity Estimation in LiDAR-Inertial Odometry}
Accurate gravity estimation is essential in \ac{LIO} since \ac{IMU} acceleration measurements include gravity. Additionally, aligning maps based on the gravity vector alleviates vertical drift. The most common approach for predicting gravity involves probabilistic methods **Cadena**, "Probabilistic Maps"____**Li**, "LiDAR-IMU Fusion"

However, these studies did not focus on exploiting gravity for state updates or map alignment. Recent works directly impose gravity as new constraints to mitigate vertical drift. Nebula **Mur-Artal**, "Nebula" measured gravity using \ac{IMU} acceleration only when the robot is stationary, introducing a gravity factor to constrain roll and pitch. D-LIOM **Furgale**, "D-LIOM"____**Tong**, "Wildcat" estimated gravity using \ac{IMU} measurements and odometry, incorporating gravity alignment constraints. Additionally, ____ jointly optimized accelerometer intrinsics and gravity.
These methods partially tackled vertical drift; however, relying on velocity-ignorant models for gravity estimations. The velocity-ignorant model focuses on the relationship between \ac{IMU} acceleration and the pose, which impedes accurate gravity estimation due to errors exacerbated by double integration. To tackle these issues, we incorporate radar-based velocity residuals and velocity-aware gravity residuals into \ac{LIO}, eliminating the necessity of double integration.
