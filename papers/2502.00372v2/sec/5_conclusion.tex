\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces a Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Automaton for Visual Grounding with Explicit Logic Reasoning (\methodname{}), a novel method that overcomes limitations in previous works by combining explicit logic reasoning, and self-correcting mechanisms as a finite-state automaton. This design enhances \methodname{}â€™s capacity to address complex visual queries with improved accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks confirm that \methodname{} achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a more interpretable and robust solution for reasoning-based visual grounding tasks.

\noindent\textbf{Broader Impact.} The overall design of \methodname{}, using an automaton to combine perception and logic generation and reasoning to provide robust and interpretable answers seems applicable to many other complex query answering problems. \methodname{} makes use of the fact that LLMs are better at confirming that a given answer satisfies a complex query, than finding the answer itself; and uses this, together with other methods, to self-correct. 

\noindent\textbf{Limitation.} The logic code generation is limited by the capabilities of the LLMs. Enhancing LLMs for code generation can be the future direction.
%The current system design is limited to single frame images, and is not designed for video reasoning.
