\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a new compilation language, \ADDAND, which combines ADD and conjunctive decomposition to optimize the search process in the first stage of precise Shannon entropy computation. 
In the second stage of precise Shannon entropy computation, we optimize model counting queries by utilizing the shared component cache.
We integrated preprocessing, heuristic, and other methods into the precise Shannon computation tool PSE, with its trace corresponding to \ADDAND. 
Experimental results demonstrate that PSE significantly enhances the scalability of precise Shannon entropy computation, even outperforming the state-of-the-art entropy estimator EntropyEstimation in overall performance.
We believe that PSE has opened up new research directions for entropy computing in Boolean formula modeling.% such as caching schemes, variable heuristics, preprocessing, etc.
We look forward to designing more effective techniques for Shannon entropy computation in the future to further enhance the scalability of precise Shannon entropy.
