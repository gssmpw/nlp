\section{Conclusion}

% \ml{We need a conclusion section!}

In this paper, we propose LightMamba,
an efficient FPGA-based Mamba acceleration framework
featuring quantization and hardware co-design.
We point out three challenges of accelerating Mamba on FPGA.
To solve them, we propose an FPGA-friendly rotation-assisted PTQ algorithm
quantizing Mamba to 4-bit with minimal accuracy degradation.
We further propose an FPGA accelerator with computation reordering 
and fine-grained tiling and fusion.
With these methods, LightMamba achieves 7.21 tokens/s on VCK190 FPGA and 4.65$\sim$6.06$\times$ higher energy efficiency over the GPU baseline.
