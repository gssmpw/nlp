While this paper embarks on the task of grounded persuasion for language agents, there have been a few recent work in evaluating the persuasive capabilities of LLMs~\citep{durmus2024measuring} with a key focus on the risks of LLM-generated propaganda in politically sensitive domains~\citep{voelkel2023artificial,goldstein2024persuasive, hackenburg2024evidence, luciano2024hypersuasion}. In addition, several work focus on the power of LLM in personalized persuasion~\citep{hackenburg2024evaluating,salvi2024conversational,matz2024potential}.  \citet{breum2024persuasive} study the potential impact of LLM in the opinion dynamics of multi-round persuasion. 
Meanwhile, several LLM capabilities related to persuasion have been investigated including negotiation~\citep{bianchi2024well}, debate~\citep{khan2024debating} and sycophancy~\citep{sharma2023towards, denison2024sycophancy}.  The persuasion capability also
relates to the rationality of LLMs in strategic games, 
as assessed in \citet{chen2023emergence} and \citet{ramansteer}. 

Similar to our work, \citet{angelopoulos2024value} also study the potential of LLMs in marketing applications. With marketing email generated by a fine-tuned LLM, they report a 33\% improvement in email click-through rates compared to human expert baselines. In comparision, our work develops a full agentic solution for automated marketing from learning domain expert knowledge to crafting localized features, which significantly outperforms the model with supervised fine-tuning in our human-subject experiments.
