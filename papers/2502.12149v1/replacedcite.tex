\paragraph{Multi-Agent Frameworks}\;
LLM agents are employed in advanced tasks for their ability to reason over diverse inputs and generate responses in complex scenarios____. Past studies have explored different evaluation frameworks____, emphasizing the need for rigorous practices in developing productized LLM agents. While these agents have shown remarkable success, their experiments are often limited by a lack of dynamic interactions.

Multi-agent systems explore LLMs' capabilities in complex environments____. For instance, ____ examined simulations where agents interact and collaborate within group chat settings, while ____ explored social simulations and board games, finding that even advanced models struggle to fully utilize their reasoning potential. ____ introduced an evaluation metric to assess LLMs' gaming abilities in multi-agent settings through game-theoretic experiments. ____ proposed a method to enhance LLMs through linguistic feedback, and ____ developed methodologies to evaluate their decision-making capabilities.

Our work extends AucArena____ by exploring persona dynamics in a bidding framework that enables multiple agents to compete for maximum profit in an auction. Our framework aims for a deeper investigation of a single agent's ability to profile other agents. Moreover, we explore how theory of mind influences an agent's performance in a competitive multi-agent setting.

\paragraph{Persona in LLM Agents}\;
Personas function as identities assigned to LLM agents, enhancing their ability to generate personalized or specialized outputs____. Prior research has extensively examined the influence of personas across various roles____. Leveraging their role-playing nature, some studies have applied personas to social simulations by assigning diverse identities to entire agent populations____. ____ find that persona prompting can introduce shortcut learning, causing LLM agents to deviate from rational objectives.  
Building on this work, we incorporate persona into a multi-agent auction to examine its effects in competitive settings.

\paragraph{Theory of Mind (ToM)}\;\;
Theory of Mind, the ability to understand and infer one's own and others' mental states, is fundamental to human social interaction and a crucial capability for LLMs to achieve human-like reasoning____. An accurate ToM in others' intentions and actions provides significant advantages____. Past studies have applied ToM to simulate social behaviors. ____ explored its role in negotiation tasks, while ____ proposed an interactive learning environment to train LLMs in social interactions. 

Previous studies have examined collaborative multi-agent settings. For example, ____ and ____ explored LLMs using ToM for task collaboration, while others demonstrated its effectiveness in structured games with rules and rewards. ____ investigated how LLMs infer players' motives in the Avalon board game, highlighting ToM capabilities within a constrained and predefined context. Similarly, ____ evaluated ToM in cooperative scenarios through a poker game called Guandan. In contrast, our work investigates whether ToM can enhance agent performance in competing multi-agent environments with auction as the testbed.
