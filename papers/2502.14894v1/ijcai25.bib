PFAS have been found all across the planet, from the polar regions to the global ocean. Global oceans have emerged as a substantial sink for the carbon in the environment due to their remarkable capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. Oceans absorb around 24% of the world’s CO2 emissions. Thus, the ocean plays a prominent role in the earth’s carbon cycle. However, the widespread application of PFAS in a wide range of products and the inefficient management of PFAS-containing wastes made them ubiquitous pollutants, which are increasingly getting as a pollutant of emerging concern. Marine PFAS pollutants can produce harmful effects on gas exchange and the ocean’s carbon cycle. Thus, it leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which eventually adversely affects global warming and climate change. Consequently, threats of marine PFAS to oceans carbon sequestration are discussed in this paper. Marine PFAS pollutants adversely affect the following sectors: (1) The growth and photosynthesis of phytoplankton, (2) development and reproduction of zooplankton by causing toxicity in zooplankton, (3) marine biological pomp, and (4) carbon stock of oceans. In this way, marine PFAS can pose a threat to ocean carbon sequestration. It is expected that this study can develop knowledge about the potential impact of PFAS on ocean carbon sequestration. However, the need for further research to investigate the hidden dimensions of this issue, including the potential scope and scale of this impact, should not be overlooked.}, number={2}, journal={Environmental Monitoring and Assessment}, author={Mahmoudnia, Ali}, year={2023}, month=jan, pages={310}, language={eng} }

  abstractNote={<p>Land cover change and its impact on food security is a topic that has major implications for development in population-dense Southeast Asia. The main drivers of forest loss include the expansion of agriculture and plantation estates, growth of urban centers, extraction of natural resources, and water infrastructure development. The design and implementation of appropriate land use policies requires accurate and timely information on land cover dynamics to account for potential political, economical, and agricultural consequences. Therefore, SERVIR-Mekong led the collaborative development of a Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS) with key regional stakeholders across the greater Mekong region. Through this effort, a modular system was used to create yearly land cover maps for the period 1988–2017. In this study, we compared this 30-year land cover time-series with Vietnam national forest resources and agricultural productivity statistics. We used remote sensing-derived land cover products to quantify landscape changes and linked those with food availability, one of food security dimension, from a landscape approach perspective. We found that agricultural production has soared while the coverage of agricultural areas has remained relatively stable. Land cover change dynamics coincide with important legislation regarding environmental management and sustainable development strategies in Vietnam. Our findings indicate that Vietnam has made major steps toward improving its’ food security. We demonstrate that RLCMS is a valuable tool for evaluating the relationship between policies and their impacts on food security, ecosystem services and natural capital.</p>},

To do so, we implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on Imagenet data and labelled landscape features in satellite data from London. We then incorporate landscape features from satellite image data from Pakistan, labelled using the CNN, in a well-known Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemic model, alongside dengue case data from 2012-2016 in Pakistan. We study improvement of the prediction model for each of the individual landscape features, and assess the feasibility of using image labels from a different place.

  abstractNote={While research and regulatory attention to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has increased exponentially in recent years, data are uneven and incomplete about the scale, scope, and severity of PFAS releases and resulting contamination in the United States. This paper argues that in the absence of high-quality testing data, PFAS contamination can be presumed around three types of facilities: (1) fluorinated aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) discharge sites, (2) certain industrial facilities, and (3) sites related to PFAS-containing waste. While data are incomplete on all three types of presumptive PFAS contamination sites, we integrate available geocoded, nationwide data sets into a single map of presumptive contamination sites in the United States, identifying 57,412 sites of presumptive PFAS contamination: 49,145 industrial facilities, 4,255 wastewater treatment plants, 3,493 current or former military sites, and 519 major airports.

  abstractNote={Decision makers in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) are currently challenged with identifying and characterizing the extent of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination and human exposure to PFAS. This work aims to develop and pilot a methodology to help decision makers target and prioritize sampling investigations and identify contaminated natural resources. Here we use random forest models to predict ∑PFAS in fish tissue; understanding PFAS levels in fish is particularly important in the CRB because fish can be a major component of tribal and indigenous people diet. Geospatial data, including land cover and distances to known or potential PFAS sources and industries, were leveraged as predictors for modeling. Models were developed and evaluated for Washington state and Oregon using limited available empirical data. Mapped predictions show several areas where detectable concentrations of PFAS in fish tissue are predicted to occur, but prior sampling has not yet confirmed. Variable importance is analyzed to identify potentially important sources of PFAS in fish in this region. The cost-effective methodologies demonstrated here can help address sparsity of existing PFAS occurrence data in environmental media in this and other regions while also giving insights into potentially important drivers and sources of PFAS in fish.},

However, research on disparities in drinking water PFAS exposures and the siting of PFAS sources in marginalized communities is limited. Here, we use monitoring data from 7873 U.S. community water systems (CWS) in 18 states to show that PFAS detection is positively associated with the number of PFAS sources and proportions of people of color who are served by these water systems. Each additional industrial facility, military fire training area, and airport in a CWS watershed was associated with a 10–108% increase in perfluorooctanoic acid and a 20–34% increase in perfluorooctane sulfonic acid in drinking water. Waste sector sources were also significantly associated with drinking water PFAS concentrations. CWS watersheds with PFAS sources served higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black residents compared to those without PFAS sources. CWS serving higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black residents had significantly increased odds of detecting several PFAS. This likely reflects disparities in the siting of PFAS contamination sources. Results of this work suggest that addressing environmental justice concerns should be a component of risk mitigation planning for areas affected by drinking water PFAS contamination.}, number={21}, journal={Environmental Science \& Technology}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Liddie, Jahred M. and Schaider, Laurel A. and Sunderland, Elsie M.}, year={2023}, month=may, pages={7902–7912} }

The main objective of Active Learning is to automatically identify a subset of unlabeled data samples for annotation. This identification process is based on an acquisition function that assesses the value of each sample for model training. In the context of computer vision, image classification is a crucial task that typically requires a substantial training dataset. This research paper introduces innovative selection methods within the Active Learning framework, aiming to identify informative images from unlabeled datasets while minimizing the number of required training data. The proposed methods, namely Similari-ty-based Selection, Prediction Probability-based Selection, and Competence-based Active Learning, have been extensively evaluated through experiments conducted on popular datasets like Cifar10 and Cifar100. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform random selection and conventional selection techniques.

We use real-world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional-level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses.

Instead of requesting high-quality yet costly human annotations, it allows training models with noisy annotations obtained from various weak sources. Recently, many sophisticated approaches have been proposed for robust training under label noise, reporting impressive results. In this paper, we revisit the setup of these approaches and find that the benefits brought by these approaches are significantly overestimated. Specifically, we find that the success of existing weakly supervised learning approaches heavily relies on the availability of clean validation samples which, as we show, can be leveraged much more efficiently by simply training on them. After using these clean labels in training, the advantages of using these sophisticated approaches are mostly wiped out. This remains true even when reducing the size of the available clean data to just five samples per class, making these approaches impractical. To understand the true value of weakly supervised learning, we thoroughly analyze diverse NLP datasets and tasks to ascertain when and why weakly supervised approaches work. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future research.}, note={arXiv:2305.17442 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2305.17442}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhu, Dawei and Shen, Xiaoyu and Mosbach, Marius and Stephan, Andreas and Klakow, Dietrich}, year={2023}, month=sep }

Here, we analyze publicly accessible data sets of PFAS occurrence in drinking water in the United States. Testing with detection limits below 1 ng/L revealed that mixtures of PFAS are nearly ubiquitous in surface water, the predominate source of drinking water for the U.S. population. We estimate that 18–80 million people in the U.S. receive tap water with 10 ng/L or greater concentration of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) combined, and over 200 million people likely receive water with a PFOA and PFOS concentration at or above 1 ng/L. Multiple U.S. states including California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont have either set or proposed limits for PFOA and PFOS that are significantly lower than the nonregulatory U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established lifetime drinking water health advisory level of 70 ng/L for the combined concentration of PFOA and PFOS. There is significant variation in PFAS occurrence within and between different U.S. states, highlighting the need for systematic monitoring of PFAS in both source and finished drinking water.}, number={12}, journal={Environmental Science \& Technology Letters}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Andrews, David Q. and Naidenko, Olga V.}, year={2020}, month=dec, pages={931–936} }

The performance depends critically on the amount of labeled examples, and in current practice the labels are assumed to be unambiguous and accurate. However, this assumption often does not hold; e.g. in recognition, class labels may be missing; in detection, objects in the image may not be localized; and in general, the labeling may be subjective. In this work we propose a generic way to handle noisy and incomplete labeling by augmenting the prediction objective with a notion of consistency. We consider a prediction consistent if the same prediction is made given similar percepts, where the notion of similarity is between deep network features computed from the input data. In experiments we demonstrate that our approach yields substantial robustness to label noise on several datasets. On MNIST handwritten digits, we show that our model is robust to label corruption. On the Toronto Face Database, we show that our model handles well the case of subjective labels in emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the- art results, and can also benefit from unlabeled face images with no modification to our method. On the ILSVRC2014 detection challenge data, we show that our approach extends to very deep networks, high resolution images and structured outputs, and results in improved scalable detection.}, note={arXiv:1412.6596 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1412.6596}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Reed, Scott and Lee, Honglak and Anguelov, Dragomir and Szegedy, Christian and Erhan, Dumitru and Rabinovich, Andrew}, year={2015}, month=apr }

Other than data reported for contaminated sites, no systematic or prospective data exist on the relative source contribution (RSC) of drinking water to human PFAS exposures.
OBJECTIVES: This study estimates the RSC of tap water to overall PFAS exposure among members of the general U.S.
METHODS: We measured concentrations of 15 PFAS in home tap water samples collected in 1989-1990 from 225 participants in a nationwide prospective cohort of U.S. women: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS). We used a one-compartment toxicokinetic model to estimate plasma concentrations corresponding to tap water intake of PFAS. We compared modeled results with measured plasma PFAS concentrations among a subset of 110 NHS participants.
RESULTS: Tap water perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were statistically significant predictors of plasma concentrations among individuals who consumed [Formula: see text] cups of tap water per day. Modeled median contributions of tap water to measured plasma concentrations were: PFOA 12% (95% probability interval 11%-14%), PFNA 13% (8.7%-21%), linear perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (nPFOS) 2.2% (2.0%-2.5%), branched perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (brPFOS) 3.0% (2.5%-3.2%), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) 34% (29%-39%). In five locations, comparisons of PFASs in community tap water collected in the period 2013-2016 with samples from 1989-1990 indicated increases in quantifiable PFAS and extractable organic fluorine (a proxy for unquantified PFAS).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for 1989-1990 compare well with the default RSC of 20% used in risk assessments for legacy PFAS by many agencies.

This has been home to sources of PFAS air-emissions from Teflon-coating operations for over 50 years. Since 2015, the Vermont and New York Departments of Environmental Conservation have documented ∼1200 residential wells and two municipal water systems across a 200 km2 area contaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Given the large areal extent of the plume, and the fact that much of the contaminated area lies up-gradient and across rivers from manufactures, we seek to determine if groundwater contamination could have resulted primarily from air-emission, land deposition, and subsequent leaching to infiltrating groundwater. Sampling of soils and groundwater in the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF) downwind of factories shows that both soil and groundwater PFOA contamination extend uninterrupted from inhabited areas into conserved forest lands. Groundwater springs and seeps in the GMNF located 8 km downwind, but >300 meters vertically above factories, contain up to 100 ppt PFOA. Our results indicate that air-emitted PFAS can contaminate groundwater and soil in areas outside of those normally considered down-gradient of a source with respect to regional groundwater flow.}, number={2}, journal={Environmental Science.

Deemed forever chemicals, many congeners bioaccumulate and are incredibly persistent in the environment due to the presence of the strong carbon-fluorine covalent bonds. Notable PFAS compounds include perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and GenX. Robust toxicological knowledge exists for these substances, but regulatory decisions based on this knowledge has fallen behind. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has addressed this issue with the PFAS Action Plan and EPA Council on PFAS, but the regulatory framework is severely lacking. Currently, no federal regulations or standards exist. Many occupational and non-occupational human cohorts exist that can lend knowledge on the environmental implications of PFAS and associated health effects. Occupationally, firefighters face significant exposure risks due to use of PFAS containing aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) and personal protective equipment contamination. Non-occupationally, wastewater discharge in North Carolina led to chronic and widespread residential exposure to GenX via drinking water contamination. This public health review seeks to convey the current and future significance of PFAS as an environmental contaminate, to lend considerations on regulatory frameworks within the USA, and to help guide and promote the need for future epidemiological studies in order to tackle this environmental emergency. While the PFAS Action Plan creates a scientific and regulatory foundation, it is important to take these lessons and apply them to future environmental health issues.}, number={21}, journal={International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health}, author={Langenbach, Blake and Wilson, Mark}, year={2021}, month=oct, pages={11142}, language={eng} }

PFAS include legacy and emerging structures and are characterized by a range of functional groups and carbon–fluorine chains that vary in length (from fewer than 3 carbons to more than 7 carbons). Research has linked PFAS exposure to an array of health concerns, ranging from developmental and reproductive disorders to immune system impairments and an increased risk of certain cancers. In this new era of personalized health, measuring markers of PFAS exposure in human biospecimens is an important part of environmental public health surveillance. PFAS are typically measured in human blood and tissues using targeted approaches, which quantify individual PFAS structures using specific instrumentation. The diversity and complexity of PFAS, the limitations of the targeted approaches due to the sheer number of structures, and the absence of publicly available analytical standards pose significant challenges for measurement methodologies. This perspective aims to describe aggregate PFAS exposure measurements and their potential for use in precision medicine applications including a discussion of the limitations and potential benefits of these aggregate measurements. As public health organizations, healthcare professionals, and the public look for guidance regarding the safe use of and exposure to PFAS, in a pragmatic cost-effective manner, the dynamic field of measurement science is poised to respond with innovative technological solutions to an important public health need.}, number={6}, journal={ACS Measurement Science Au}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Manz, Katherine E.}, year={2024}, month=dec, pages={620–628} }

Yet, their superior performance comes with the expensive cost of requiring correctly annotated large-scale datasets. Moreover, due to DNNs’ rich capacity, errors in training labels can hamper performance. To combat this problem, mean absolute error (MAE) has recently been proposed as a noise-robust alternative to the commonly-used categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. However, as we show in this paper, MAE can perform poorly with DNNs and challenging datasets. Here, we present a theoretically grounded set of noise-robust loss functions that can be seen as a generalization of MAE and CCE. Proposed loss functions can be readily applied with any existing DNN architecture and algorithm, while yielding good performance in a wide range of noisy label scenarios. We report results from experiments conducted with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FASHION-MNIST datasets and synthetically generated noisy labels.}, note={arXiv:1805.07836 [cs]}, number={arXiv:1805.07836}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhang, Zhilu and Sabuncu, Mert R.}, year={2018}, month=nov }

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a large class of synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS.
Objective
To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS.
Methods
A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d). PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org.
Results
Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall observations are included in this report.
Conclusions
The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching, filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts, facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS, or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination. We also discuss how this tool supports scientists, regulatory agencies, and other individuals by increasing awareness and access to current evidence regarding the health effects associated with PFAS exposure.}, journal={Environment International}, author={Pelch, Katherine E. and Reade, Anna and Kwiatkowski, Carol F. and Merced-Nieves, Francheska M. and Cavalier, Haleigh and Schultz, Kim and Wolffe, Taylor and Varshavsky, Julia}, year={2022}, month=sep, pages={107408} }

Detailed per-pixel annotations enable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain; image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision and objectness potential yields an improvement of $$12.9,%$$mIOU over image-level supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level, squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.}, booktitle={Computer Vision – ECCV 2016}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Bearman, Amy and Russakovsky, Olga and Ferrari, Vittorio and Fei-Fei, Li}, editor={Leibe, Bastian and Matas, Jiri and Sebe, Nicu and Welling, Max}, year={2016}, pages={549–565}, language={en} }
