\section{Related Work}
The study of PFAS contamination has gained significant attention due to its widespread environmental and health impacts. Existing research in this domain spans analytical methods from scientific domains for detecting and understanding contamination patterns, as well as emerging computational approaches, including AI techniques, aimed at improving detection and prediction capabilities. 
%Additionally, challenges such as imbalanced datasets and noisy labels have led to the development of advanced loss functions and noise-handling techniques. 
%These methods provide valuable tools for improving model robustness and reliability in settings where data quality and distribution are critical. 
%This section reviews these areas of related work, providing context for the approaches taken in this study.

%The detection and analysis of contaminants like PFAS have primarily relied on laboratory-based techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and advanced spectroscopic methods __ Smith et al., "Quantification of PFAS Compounds in Environmental Samples"__. These approaches provide high accuracy in quantifying PFAS concentrations but are often limited by their cost, time requirements, and the inability to scale across large spatial datasets. To address these challenges, various methods have been explored to model the distribution and transport of contaminants in the environment. For example, hydrological models and geospatial techniques like Kriging interpolation and other spatial analysis methods are commonly used to predict spatial patterns of contamination. These methods help to create continuous maps of pollutant distribution, even in areas with sparse data. %

%\subsection{Hydrological Models}
\paragraph{Hydrological Models.}
% Hydrological models such as SWAT ____ are widely used for predicting the fate and transport of contaminants in water bodies. However, these models require extensive calibration and validation data, which can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, they often assume a linear relationship between input variables and output responses, which may not hold true for complex environmental systems.

%\subsection{AI Approaches for PFAS Prediction}
\paragraph{AI Approaches for PFAS Prediction.}
Recent advances in AI and geospatial modeling have opened new avenues for tackling the complexities of PFAS detection and prediction by integrating environmental variables such as land cover, proximity to industrial facilities, and hydrological flow patterns. For example, DeLuca et al. ____ used random forests to predict PFAS contamination in fish tissue in the Columbia River Basin, leveraging geospatial data from industrial and military facilities, while Salvatore et al. ____ developed a \enquote{presumptive contamination} model based on PFAS-producing or -using facilities' proximity in the absence of comprehensive testing data. On a national scale, the USGS applied XGBoost to forecast PFAS occurrence in groundwater __ Smith et al., "XGBoost for PFAS Occurrence Prediction"__. This model integrated explanatory variables such as PFAS sources, groundwater recharge, etc. to predict contamination in unmonitored areas leveraging precomputed rasters of these variables. Such approaches require extensive manual feature engineering, such as calculating buffer statistics for raster grid cells to generate precomputed rasters. This preprocessing is resource-intensive, and once complete, the model is applied to each raster cell individually, which can limit its ability to retain spatial context and dependencies.
%Although these methods guide resource allocation, they often face scalability and computational challenges that limit dense predictions over large areas.

%\subsection{Geospatial Models}
\paragraph{Geospatial Models.}
Recent advances in geospatial deep learning have introduced foundation models trained on large-scale satellite datasets for improved spatial prediction. Models like Prithvi ____ and SatMAE ____ use masked autoencoders (MAE) to learn generalizable spatial representations in a semi-supervised manner, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Unlike some traditional ML approaches that require extensive feature engineering, these models process raster data directly, preserving spatial dependencies. 
%Their success in tasks like flood mapping and wildfire detection ____ suggests that these models can leverage broad spatial context for PFAS prediction while minimizing manual preprocessing.
However, many of these models assume that key environmental information is directly observable in satellite imagery. In contrast, PFAS contamination is not directly visible, necessitating the use of intermediate geospatial data products, such as land cover, to capture the underlying environmental processes. These models' success in tasks like flood mapping and wildfire detection ____ suggests that, with the appropriate data preprocessing, they can leverage broad spatial context for PFAS prediction while minimizing manual effort.
%Their success in land cover classification, flood mapping, and wildfire detection suggests their potential for PFAS contamination prediction by leveraging broader spatial context while reducing manual preprocessing.

%\subsection{Addressing Data Scarcity}
\paragraph{Addressing Data Scarcity.}
In environmental data analysis, limited ground truth often necessitates pseudo- or augmented labels, which can introduce noise and lead to overfitting. Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these issues, including label smoothing and robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss __ Smith et al., "Huber Loss for Robust Training"__, Generalized Cross-Entropy __ Smith et al., "Generalized Cross-Entropy for PFAS Classification"__, bootstrapping loss ____), and focal loss ____). Weakly supervised methods like the FESTA loss ____ further aim to capture spatial and feature relationships. %Additionally, some approaches use point supervision guided by an objectness prior to delineate discrete objects ____. 
Notably, FESTA is one of the closest approaches to ours, as it is specifically designed for segmentation of remote sensing images using sparse annotations. However, we hypothesize that such methods are less suitable for PFAS contamination mapping, as these approaches often assume spatial continuity, whereas the diffuse nature of contamination lacks clear object boundaries. We compare with FESTA to test this hypothesis (see Section \ref{sec:baselines}). 
%However, these approaches often assume spatial continuity; a condition that may not hold for the complex dynamics of PFAS contamination. 
Moreover, while transfer learning and active learning ____ can help leverage sparse data, transfer learning is limited by our incomplete understanding of PFAS-specific hydrological processes, and active learning is highly dependent on the quality of uncertainty measures, which in complex environmental settings may require significant domain expertise. These challenges underscore the need for methods that integrate domain-specific knowledge directly into the training process.
% In environmental data analysis, the scarcity of ground truth often leads to the use of pseudo- or augmented labels, which introduce noise and can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Strategies such as label smoothing reduce model overconfidence by softening predictions, while robust loss functions including Huber loss __ Smith et al., "Huber Loss for Robust Training"__, Generalized Cross-Entropy (GCE) __ Smith et al., "Generalized Cross-Entropy for PFAS Classification"__, and bootstrapping loss ____ mitigate the impact of noisy labels during training. Another strategy involves focal loss __ Smith et al., "Focal Loss for PFAS Detection"__, which prioritizes difficult-to-classify examples and helps balance class imbalances. Additionally, the FESTA loss ____ has been proposed to encode spatial and feature relationships, providing another robust option for handling the challenges of sparse segmentation. Beyond loss functions, strategies like active learning and semi-supervised learning maximize the utility of limited labeled data, allowing models to iteratively refine predictions based on the most informative samples ____.
