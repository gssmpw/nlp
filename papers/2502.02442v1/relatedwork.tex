\section{Related Work}
At a high level, our result shows a difference between the computational power of the permanent polynomial and the determinant polynomial. Other works in a similar spirit have been conducted, all of which have the ultimate goal of helping us understand why VP and VNP are likely different from each other. 

The results of von zur Gathen~\cite{gathen} and Mignon and Ressayre~\cite{mignon2004quadratic} (see also~\cite{cai2010quadratic}) show a difference in the ``geometry of the underlying varieties'' of the two polynomials. This difference implies a quadratic lower bound on the determinantal complexity of the permanent (we shall also use techniques from~\cite{mignon2004quadratic}).

Recent work of Hrub\v{e}s and Joglekar~\cite{HJ} points to a distinction in reductions to \emph{read-once} determinants and permanents. This work also gives a lower bound on the cost of certain reductions which are incomparable to ours. 

Our work is different from the two lines of works above in that we seek to justify why one might expect an \emph{exponential} blow-up is required in reductions from the permanent to the determinant.


The work of Landsberg and Ressayre~\cite{LR} gives an exponential lower bound in a restricted setting. They showed that any reductions from the permanent to the determinant that preserve the underlying symmetries must have exponential cost. Our results imply a similar bound within the general framework of Valiant's reduction, but without assuming symmetry.
Our bounds are restricted in a different way; they hold just for a particular type
of reductions that are built by ``iteratively 
applying a single building block''.
