abstract = {Proper calibration of human reliance on AI is fundamental to achieving complementary performance in AI-assisted human decision-making. Most previous works focused on assessing user reliance, and more broadly trust, retrospectively, through user perceptions and task-based measures. In this work, we explore the relationship between eye gaze and reliance under varying task difficulties and AI performance levels in a spatial reasoning task. Our results show a strong positive correlation between percent gaze duration on the AI suggestion and user AI task agreement, as well as user perceived reliance. Moreover, user agency is preserved particularly when the task is easy and when AI performance is low or inconsistent. Our results also reveal nuanced differences between reliance and trust. We discuss the potential of using eye gaze to gauge human reliance on AI in real-time, enabling adaptive AI assistance for optimal human-AI team performance.},

abstract = {AI explanations are often mentioned as a way to improve human-AI decision-making, but empirical studies have not found consistent evidence of explanations' effectiveness and, on the contrary, suggest that they can increase overreliance when the AI system is wrong. While many factors may affect reliance on AI support, one important factor is how decision-makers reconcile their own intuition---beliefs or heuristics, based on prior knowledge, experience, or pattern recognition, used to make judgments---with the information provided by the AI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a think-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and example-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers' intuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately their choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of intuition involved in reasoning about AI predictions and explanations: intuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on these, we summarize three observed pathways for decision-makers to apply their own intuition and override AI predictions. We use these pathways to explain why (1) the feature-based explanations we used did not improve participants' decision outcomes and increased their overreliance on AI, and (2) the example-based explanations we used improved decision-makers' performance over feature-based explanations and helped achieve complementary human-AI performance. Overall, our work identifies directions for further development of AI decision-support systems and explanation methods that help decision-makers effectively apply their intuition to achieve appropriate reliance on AI.},
