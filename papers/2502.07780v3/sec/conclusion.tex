\section{Conclusion}

We introduced a novel non-uniform, training-aware structured pruning method called \sysname,  which generates compressed models by evolutionary search. We propose the training-aware offspring selection to select the optimal sparse model for post-training.   Experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. \sysname is remarkably sample-efficient, as it can match or even improve upon the performance of prior methods which required 10x more data and training computation.


\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
