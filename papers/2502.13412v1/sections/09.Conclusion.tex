\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}
This paper proposes an LLM-based automated KG construction method to address the issues of high manual cost, and noise in existing method.
The method introduces three key improvements: automation to enhance efficiency, comprehensive type discover to improve richness, and the ``explore-construct-filter'' strategy to ensure reliability.
Specifically, this method includes three core modules: the KG exploration module, the KG construction module, and the KG filtering module.
The KG exploration module generates a complete schema through diverse type combinations based on the ``fully connected graph'' concept, ensuring the schema's completeness and comprehensiveness.
Next, the KG construction module leverages LLMs to extract schema-compliant instances from large-scale text corpora, forming a preliminary KG. Finally, the KG filtering module enhances reliability by filtering out suspicious triples using probabilistic methods.
Experimental results show that this method can explore a schema that includes comprehensive entity types and relation types, and based on this, construct a rich and reliable KG.
While effective with API data, the method's adaptability suggests broader applications across various fields and data structures.
Looking ahead, we aim to integrate this method with KG retrieval tools like GraphRAG to create a comprehensive knowledge extraction, analysis, and utilization toolkit.
