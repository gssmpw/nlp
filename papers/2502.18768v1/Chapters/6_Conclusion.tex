This paper provided conditions ensuring various stability properties of two-time-scale singularly perturbed networked control systems (SPNCSs) under a single communication channel, including semi-global practical asymptotic stability, uniformly globally asymptotic stability, and uniformly globally exponential stability.

We introduce a framework for analyzing SPNCSs, extendable to multiple channels and time scales, and other stability properties. Additionally, we propose a resource-aware strategy for stabilizing SPNCSs, laying a foundation for further research.

%We introduced a framework for analyzing SPNCSs that can be extended to other settings, such as multiple channels and time scales, and other stability properties. Additionally, we proposed a resource-aware strategy for stabilizing SPNCSs with a single channel. Our approach enhances the understanding and design of SPNCSs, laying a foundation for further research in more complex networked control scenarios.
