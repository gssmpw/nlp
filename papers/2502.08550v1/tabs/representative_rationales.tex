\prompttop{rat:cot}{CoT}{The provided answer is correct as it solves the word problem correctly by letting the number of fish in each aquarium be x. The answer follows the narrative of the problem and uses the information that the difference in snails between the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The solution is coherent and arrives at the conclusion that each aquarium has 14 fish.\label{rat:cot}}
\prompttop{rat:exp}{Explicit}{The provided answer is incorrect because it does not actually provide a numerical value for the number of fish in each aquarium, which is what the question is asking for. Instead, it repeats the expression "Let x be the number of fish in each aquarium" multiple times, which is not a valid answer. The answer also does not explain how the problem's conditions are reflected in the solution, which is twice the number of fish in each aquarium is equal to the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums.\label{rat:exp}}
\prompttop{rat:imp}{Implicit}{The provided answer is incorrect because the solution fails to provide the final calculation to determine the number of fish in each aquarium. The answer assumes the role of x as the number of fish in each aquarium but does not conclude the equation.\label{rat:imp}}
