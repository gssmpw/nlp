\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a novel unified framework, UniBrain, the first end-to-end model to jointly perform a diverse set of brain imaging analysis tasks, including extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation and classification. UniBrain integrates heterogeneous information into a single system, enabling efficient knowledge transfer across different modules, and avoiding the need for extensive task-specific labels. Experimental results show that UniBrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all tasks while also demonstrating robustness and time efficiency.
