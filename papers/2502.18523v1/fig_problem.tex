The problem of end-to-end learning for brain imaging tasks. Given a set of raw images, each with a corresponding extraction mask and diagnosis label, along with a labeled template brain (with segmentation and parcellation masks), the goal is to train a model to simultaneously perform extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation, network generation, and classification tasks.
