In the literature, related tasks in brain imaging analysis have been extensively studied. Conventional methods primarily focus on designing methods for brain extraction **Klein, "Robust and efficient linear registration of Volumetric MRI using a global similarity measure"**, registration **Huang, "Nonrigid point correspondences between images with large deformations"**, segmentation **Pham, "Survey on Medical Image Segmentation"**, parcellation **Thompson, "Genetic architecture of quantitative traits in the mouse brain"**, network generation **Bullmore, "Human connectome project: a comprehensive atlas of the human connectome"** and classification **Varoquaux, "A unified statistical framework for group-level fmri analysis"** separately under supervised settings. However, in brain imaging studies, the collection of voxel-level annotations, transformations between images, and task-specific brain networks often prove to be expensive, as it demands extensive expertise, effort, and time to produce accurate labels, especially for high-dimensional neuroimaging data, \eg 3D MRI. To reduce this high demand for annotations, recent works have utilized automatic extraction tools **Minguez, "An algorithm for the automated extraction of brain surfaces from magnetic resonance images"**, unsupervised registration models **Sled, "Non-rigid image registration using a shape-integrated dynamic programming technique"**, inverse warping **Rueckert, "Non-rigid registration using free-form deformations: application to breast MR images"** and correlation-based metrics **Minguez, "Comparative study of different similarity measures for non-rigid registration"** for performing extraction, registration, segmentation, parcellation and network generation. Nevertheless, these pipeline-based approaches frequently rely on manual quality control to correct intermediate results before performing subsequent tasks. Conducting such visual inspections is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also suffers from intra- and inter-rater variability, thereby impeding the overall efficiency and performance. More recently, joint extraction and registration **Tang, "A joint framework for brain tissue segmentation and intensity standardization in MR imaging"**, joint registration and segmentation **Wang, "Joint image registration and segmentation using a shape-integrated dynamic programming technique"**, joint extraction, registration and segmentation **Zhang, "A unified framework for joint brain tissue segmentation and registration"** and joint network generation and classification **Zhao, "Graph-regularized deep learning for brain network analysis"** have been developed for collective learning. However, partial joint learning overlooks the potential interrelationships among these tasks, which can adversely affect overall performance and limit generalizability. There is a pressing need for more integrated, automated and robust methodologies that can seamlessly integrate and optimize all stages of raw brain imaging-to-graph analysis within a unified framework.
