  %Visual comparisons for brain extraction, registration, segmentation, and parcellation tasks. We show 3D visualizations and middle slices in sagittal, axial, and coronal planes. On the left, source and target (template) images are displayed with their ground truth labels.
  %The results and predicted labels for each method in extraction, registration, segmentation and parcellation are illustrated for performance assessment. 
  %Successful extraction, segmentation and parcellation imply a high overlap between predicted and ground truth masks. For registration, the higher similarity between the registered and template brains indicates better performance.
