    \caption{Temporal raster plot of spikes in the controller neuron during the inference of the examples in N-MNIST and DVS-Gesture by SkipSNN. The spikes shown are generated from the controller, and used to control when to enter awake state. The blue box represents the period of useful signals. The dash red line represents the location of awake state. }
