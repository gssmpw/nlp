\subsection{Interactive Segmentation}
Interactive segmentation enables users to provide cues for target regions and guide the segmentation process. User interactions can take various forms, including scribbles____, bounding boxes____, clicks____, or language prompts____. Traditional methods utilize pixel-level energy minimization methods, capturing low-level appearance features through unary potentials and ensuring consistent segmentation results with pairwise ones____. 
In recent years, many studies leverage prompts as input features and inject them into the models to produce segmentation results____. The Segment Anything Model (SAM)____ pre-trained on a large-scale datasets has emerged as a benchmark for interactive segmentation. 
Considering that SAM cannot perform semantic prediction, many works____ utilize category labels to further fine-tune SAM and enable it to achieve the semantic segmentation task. For example, SEEM____ further trains SAM using labeled segmentation data through a bipartite matching constraint, thus providing the model with the ability to predict semantics. Semantic-SAM____ proposes a multi-choice learning scheme via multi-task training across diverse datasets, enabling the model to segment at various granularities while predicting semantic labels.
Other works____ apply SAM to diverse specific domains to solve application tasks. MedSAM____ fine-tunes SAM by collecting a large-scale dataset of medical image samples in multiple imaging modalities and types of cancer, achieving superior results in disease segmentation.
Gaussian-Grouping____ leverages the SAM as supervision model to jointly train a reconstruction and segmentation of objects in open-world 3D scenes for high-quality 3D edit.
% For instance, SAM functions as a robust pretrained encoder-decoder model that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks____. Some other approaches maintain the interactive nature of segmentation by focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques____. 
% To achieve robust segmentation across diverse scenarios, some methods fine-tune SAM’s decoder using large-scale domain datasets____. 
% Although these approaches show notable advantages across various benchmarks, they have yet to be consistently evaluated against similar methods, and a comprehensive analysis of how different interaction strategies influence outcomes is still lacking.

\subsection{High-Quality Segmentation}
High-quality segmentation as a fundamental computer vision task focuses on accurately segmenting various complex and detail-rich objects, which ranges from many sub-tasks including semantic segmentation____, instance segmentation____ and panoptic segmentation____. 
% Recent researches like SegGPT____ enable diverse segmentation tasks through in-context visual learning.
% Existing methods for high-quality segmentation are tailored to specific tasks, such as image and video semantic segmentation____, instance segmentation____ or panoptic segmentation____. 
Traditional methods____ on high-quality segmentation dedicate to designing elaborate structures upon on CNN-based networks in order to capture both low-level local patterns and semantic global features through various reception fields towards holistic representation.
Deeplab-v3____ designs a set of multi-level convolution kernels to capture features with diverse reception fields and HRNet____ employs cascaded structures to fuse features from different layers to learn both low-level and high-level information.
% More recently, many approaches focus on post-segmentation refinement using graphical models like CRF____ and other utilize separate deep networks for iterative improvements____.
More recently, many approaches____ built on the transformer backbone focus on introducing local patterns into the model by narrow the reception field of self-attention module. For example, Mask2Former____ presents an efficient versatile architecture by using masked attention to extract local features for high-quality image segmentation tasks. Swin-Unet____ adopts the Swin-Transformer network to the UNet like structures to adaptively capture object features with various scales via hierarchical attention.
Latest, the Pi-SAM____ designs a mask decoder to expands SAM’s ability at high resolution images, however, it may diminish the response of the input prompt and exhibit biased preferences for background clicks. 
% In contrast, our work emphasizes accurately segmenting diverse objects in new data using flexible prompting. We propose HQ-SAM, a high-quality zero-shot segmentation model that generalizes across various tasks and domains. Unlike post-segmentation refinement approaches, HQ-SAM directly predicts high-quality masks by reusing the image encoder and mask decoder from SAM, rather than relying on a coarse mask as input for a separate refinement network. Our model architecture builds upon SAM with minimal overhead, incorporating efficient token learning for accurate mask predictions. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive zero-shot experiments.
