\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Rumours in online social media pose significant risks to modern society, motivating the need for better understanding of how they develop. We focus specifically on the interface between emotion and rumours in threaded discourses, building on the surprisingly sparse literature on the topic which has largely focused on emotions within the original rumour posts themselves, and largely overlooked the comparative differences between rumours and non-rumours. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytical emotion framework, contrasting rumour and non-rumour cases using existing NLP datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics within rumours. Our framework reveals several findings: rumours exhibit more negative sentiment and emotions, including anger, fear and pessimism, while non-rumours evoke more positive emotions; emotions are contagious in online interactions, with rumours facilitate negative emotions and non-rumours foster positive emotions; and based on causal analysis, surprise acts as a bridge between rumours and other emotions, pessimism is driven by sadness and fear, optimism by joy and love.

\section{Conclusion}
% our methods and key findings
In this work, we presented a analytical emotion framework for online rumours. We make the use of EmoLLM for automatic emotion detection and ground its predictions to the categorical emotion labeling scheme. The framework analyzes the emotion from various aspects, from simply emotion polarity (sentiment valence), emotion distribution, emotion transition and trajectory, we also analyze the causal relationship between rumour label and emotions. The key findings include: compared with non-rumour contents, rumour are significantly more negative in sentiments, containing more negative emotions like anger, fear and pessimism; emotions are contagious in online social context, rumour contents usually trigger negative responses and non-rumours tend to receive positive ones; Cumulative emotion regression coefficient showed that negative emotions grow significantly faster in rumours comments as positive emotions in non-rumour ones; the rumour tweets are not directly connected with other emotions and rely on the emotion surprise as a bridge. Pessimism is primarily influenced by negative emotions (sadness and fear), while optimism is causally influenced by positive emotions (joy, love, and trust), anger and disgust exhibit bidirectional causation. By presenting the framework, we hope to facilitate research in more comprehensive and fine-grained study in emotion in online rumour contents and better detection techniques.



\paragraph{Limitations and future work}
% language, only English
% noisy detection methods
% lack of conversational structure
% more datasets and multilingual settings
% more detailed analysis over rumour types
This work also faces several challenges and limitations: 1) We rely on EmoLLM as our automatic emotion detection tool for all emotion-related tasks. While it is generally efficient and effective, it exhibits inaccuracies in analyzing complex online discussions, such as those involving sarcasm; 2) Although we have access to the chronological order of tweets within conversations, explicit conversation structures are not available for all data; and 3) The datasets used in this study are limited to English textual rumour data. Future work should explore multilingual and multimodal content in rumour conversations to provide a more comprehensive analysis.


\paragraph{Ethical Impacts}
% potential ethical impacts and considerations of the work, rumour and misinformation
Analyzing emotions in rumour detection presents ethical challenges, such as privacy invasion, interpretative biases, risks of emotional manipulation, amplification of harmful content, and cultural insensitivity. To address these concerns, we advocate for responsible and transparent use, prioritizing individual privacy and freedom of expression, with clear communication and opt-out options for users. This research was conducted independently using publicly available datasets, and the framework was developed to enhance academic understanding and combat misinformation online for the public good.
