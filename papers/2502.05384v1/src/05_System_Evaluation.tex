\section{System Evaluation}



 
\subsection{Mechanical Stability under Hydrostatic Pressure}
\label{sub:Stability}
The CavePI system is evaluated for structural robustness and functional durability to support long-term autonomous operation at depths. Critical components of AUVs generally include the interfacing joints of the actuators (thrusters), sensors (\eg, cameras and sonar), and enclosure doors~\cite{macias2024numerical}. As shown earlier in Fig.~\ref{fig:system_design}, CavePIâ€™s \textit{head} section is connected to the \textit{main body} via a custom-designed aluminum plate, referred to as the dome connector, which ensures a watertight interface for the forward-facing camera. Similarly, the clamps used in the thruster and sonar subassemblies, as well as the plates for electronics mounting within the computational enclosure, are custom-designed to enhance mechanical efficiency and dynamic stability. Components exposed directly to the underwater environment, including thrusters, the Ping2 sonar, the dome connector, and external cables, are identified as sensitive elements requiring careful design and validation to ensure system reliability under challenging conditions.

%With the broader objective of long-term autonomous operation, we evaluate the CavePI system based on structural robustness and functional durability. For autonomous underwater robots, critical components are the actuators (thrusters in this case), sensor interfaces (camera, sonar), and a watertight enclosure~\cite{macias2024numerical,estarki2021design}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:system_design}, CavePI's \textit{head} section is connected to the \textit{main body} through a custom-designed aluminum plate called the dome connector, ensuring watertight camera interfacing. The clamps used for thrusters- and sonar-assembly, and the plates used for electronics assembly inside the computational enclosure are likewise custom-designed to ensure an efficient and dynamically stable robotic system. Thrusters, Ping2 sonar, the dome connector, and cables are the sensitive components as they are exposed to underwater environment. 
%; Thus, we conduct their mechanical analyses to ensure the structural integrity and performance safety margins. 

The thrusters and Ping2 sonar have depth ratings of more than $500$ meters and $300$ meters, respectively, along with their cables. To evaluate the structural strength of the dome connector of CavePI, we use finite element analysis (FEA) methods~\cite{bieze2018finite}. Tetrahedral elements are utilized to generate the finite element mesh from the 3D model of the dome connector, while the Von Mises yield criterion is applied to assess the \textbf{maximum stresses}, \textbf{total deformation}, and \textbf{factor of safety ({\tt FoS})}. The analysis considered hydrostatic pressures~\cite{macias2024numerical,li2023soft} at the maximum water depth of $65$\,m.


The number of nodes and finite elements in the mesh indicates the mathematical model's quality: a higher count typically reflects a more accurate model. In the analysis of the dome connector, the mesh contained $4,636,236$ nodes and $3,300,641$ elements; see Fig.~\ref{fig:dome_connector_stress}. Based on the Von-Mises criterion, the maximum equivalent stress was calculated to be $15.3$\,MPa. The maximum deformation, observed at the inner most circumference of the dome connector, was $0.005$\,mm. The minimum {\tt FoS} is calculated using the yield strength ($\sigma_y$) of the material (Aluminium 6061-T6), and maximum stress ($\sigma_{max}$) as follows: 
\begin{equation*}
    \text{{\tt FoS}} = \frac{\sigma_y}{\sigma_{\text{max}}} = \frac{240 \text{ MPa}}{15.3 \text{ MPa}} \approx 15.76.
\end{equation*}
Note that a {\tt FoS} greater than $2$ for hydrostatic applications and $4$ for hydrodynamics applications is considered sufficient~\cite{kazemi2004reliability,SafetyCulture}. Thus, an {\tt FoS} over $15$ indicates that the dome connector is sufficiently stable for the intended operation pressure.



 




 
\subsection{Caveline Following Performance}\label{sec_5b}
\noindent
\textbf{Setup.} The line following experiments are initially conducted in a  $2$\,m$\times3$\,m laboratory water tank with a maximum depth of $1.5$\,m. 
%$10'\times6'$ laboratory water tank with a maximum depth of $5'$ ($1.52$\,m). 
As a first setup, a line is laid on the tank floor in a rectangular loop, without any depth variation; see Fig.~\ref{fig:tank_setup}. Subsequently, we add small obstacles and vertical slopes in the tank to simulate the rough underwater terrains; see Fig.~\ref{fig:all_setup}\,(a). Upon detecting the line via the down-facing camera, CavePI autonomously follows the loop while maintaining a specified depth. The system's line-following accuracy, depth-holding capabilities, and control smoothness are evaluated and fine-tuned to prepare for field deployments.

\noindent
\textbf{Evaluation process.}  CavePI's caveline-following performance is evaluated by measuring the \textit{tracking error}, defined as the perpendicular distance between the optical center of the downward-facing camera and the nearest point on the caveline in the plane of caveline; see Fig.~\ref{fig:deviation}. This measurement leverages pose information from CavePI's IMU, depth readings from the sonar, and visual information from the segmentation mask of the caveline captured by the down-facing camera.

To formalize the calculation, we define several reference frames. The initial pose of the robot assumes its front axis is aligned with the caveline and its downward axis perpendicular to the caveline plane. This reference frame, denoted as \{N\}, has its origin at the camera. A corresponding frame \{S\}, with the same orientation as \{N\} but with its origin at the sonar, is also defined. Additionally, we define the global reference frame \{G\}, and the CavePI body frame \{C\} with its origin at the down-facing camera. The transformation matrix from any frame $a$ to $b$ is defined as ${}^{b}_{a}\mathbf{T} = [ {}^{b}_{a}\mathbf{R}_{3\times3} \,|\, {}^{b}_{a}\mathbf{t}_{3\times1}]$. The roll, pitch, and yaw angle measurements from IMU are expressed in the global frame \{G\} at any time instance.

For a given image $I$, we extract the caveline contour closest to the camera center and calculate the distance between the camera center and the pixel ${}^IP$ on the contour edge, then convert it to a 3D point ${}^C\boldsymbol{P}$ using:

\[
  {}^I{P} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
      u_{P} & v_{P} & 1
  \end{bmatrix}^T, 
  \quad
  {}^C\boldsymbol{P} = \lambda \, K^{-1} ({}^IP);
\] where $K$ is the camera intrinsic matrix and  $\lambda$ is the depth scale factor.
The rotation of the CavePI's frame with respect to the sonar frame is calculated as follows:
\[
      {}^{C}_{S}\boldsymbol{R} 
      = \left({}^{S}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}\right)^{-1} {}^{C}_{G}\boldsymbol{R} 
      = \left({}^{N}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}\right)^{-1} {}^{C}_{G}\boldsymbol{R};
    \]
where ${}^{C}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}$ and ${}^{N}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}$ are computed from instantaneous and initial IMU measurements, respectively. %Note that, ${}^{S}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}$ and ${}^{N}_{G}\boldsymbol{R}$ are same because of the same orientation of frame \{S\} and \{N\}.
Subsequently, ${}^C\boldsymbol{P}$ is transformed to the sonar frame using:   
\[
      \begin{bmatrix}
          {}^S\boldsymbol{P} \\
          1
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
          {}^{C}_{S}\boldsymbol{R} & {}^{C}_{S}\boldsymbol{t} \\
          0 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
          {}^C\boldsymbol{P} \\
          1
      \end{bmatrix},
    \]
    \[
      {}^S\boldsymbol{P} 
      = \lambda
      \begin{bmatrix}
          a & b & c
      \end{bmatrix}^T,
    \]
where the scalars \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are obtained from the above equation. The raw depth measurement from sonar ${}^Cd$ is converted to the sonar frame ${}^Sd$ and $\lambda$ is calculated as:
    % \[
    %   {}^Sd = {}^Cd \cos\phi \cos\theta, ~ \text{and}~\lambda = \frac{{}^Sd}{c}.
    % \]
    \[
        {{}^{S}d} = {}^{C}_{S}\boldsymbol{R}_{(3,3)} \cdot {}^{C}d, ~ \text{and}~\lambda = \frac{{}^Sd}{c}.
    \]
The 3D coordinates of ${}^N\boldsymbol{P}$ is calculated using:
    \[
      {}^N\boldsymbol{P} = -{}^{C}_{S}\boldsymbol{t} + {}^S\boldsymbol{P}
    \]
Finally, $\delta$ is obtained from the \(y\)-coordinate of \({}^N\boldsymbol{P}\).





    % where ${}^Cd$ is given by the Ping2 sonar measurement.
    % \[
    %   \lambda = \frac{(d_{S})}{c}
    % \]
    
% The \(z\)-coordinate of \({}^S\boldsymbol{P}\) is also derived from sonar measurements.

\subsection{PID Controller Tuning}
\vspace{-1 mm}
To ensure stable operation in turbulent water conditions, CavePIâ€™s PID-based Pure Pursuit controller is designed and fine-tuned through extensive experimentation. Initial trials reveal challenges, including high overshoot, difficulty maintaining depth, and instability at sharp corners. These issues are iteratively calibrated to achieve robust and reliable motion control. A grid search technique is employed to optimize the proportional gain ($K_p$) and differential gain ($K_d$) for the two onboard controllers -- depth and heading. For each tested parameter pair, the robot traverses a complete 6-meter loop in the testbed at a depth of $0.35$ meters. Tracking ($\delta$) and depth errors for each trial are recorded at $0.6$\,Hz. Table~\ref{tab:performance_metrics} and~\ref{tab:depth_controller_tuning} summarize the observations of the tuning parameters combinations for heading and depth controllers, respectively. We identified that a controller tuned with $K_p = 3.4$ and $K_d = 0.9$ minimized the tracking error, and therefore employed these values as the heading controller gains in all subsequent experiments. Similarly, $K_p = 600$ and $K_d = 50$ are chosen for the depth controller.

\subsection{ROS Prototyping and Gazebo Simulation}
The digital twin of CavePI is developed using ROS and simulated within Gazeboâ€™s underwater environment to evaluate its line-tracking performance; see Fig.~\ref{fig:gazebo}. As a simplified representation of the physical platform, it enables extensive pre-deployment testing of mission-critical functionalities. While the actual CavePI is positively buoyant -- automatically resurfacing in the absence of control signals -- the digital twin is designed to be neutrally buoyant to minimize continuous depth-control inputs. Simulating the digital twin under realistic underwater conditions allows for detailed analysis of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, informing component placement for stable buoyancy and achieving near-zero roll and pitch angles when stationary. A complete sensor suite is integrated to confirm optimal camera placement, particularly for the downward-facing camera essential for caveline detection. Additionally, it incorporates a PID controller to simulate CavePIâ€™s line-tracking functionality, serving as a platform for preliminary control algorithm design and validation. Nevertheless, final controller tuning is performed on the physical system through experimental trials due to factors such as nonlinear drag forces, caveline detection dependencies, and design parameter variations between the CAD model and the actual hardware, which cannot be replicated in simulation.
