\vspace{-1mm}
This work demonstrates CavePI, a portable and cost-effective AUV tailored for semantic-guided navigation in GPS-denied underwater environments. The platformâ€™s key strength lies in extracting sparse semantic cues from noisy, low-light conditions through a fast and precise segmentation pipeline, enabling intelligent and adaptive navigation. The planning and control systems have been meticulously designed, rigorously tested, and fine-tuned within controlled laboratory settings to ensure robust and reliable performance. Comprehensive field deployments in diverse, challenging underwater environments, along with extensive digital twin simulations, have demonstrated CavePI's reliability, adaptability, and operational efficiency. These results underscore its potential as a versatile and dependable tool for safe, long-term autonomous exploration of underwater caves. Future iterations will focus on optimizing system performance and expanding its capabilities to support a wider range of applications in marine robotics.
