\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion} 
We propose \methodname, the first RVQ-based discrete diffusion framework for \taskname with high diversity and quality, serving as a foundation for future research in multimodal personalized TTS systems. 
Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that we outperform existing methods.
In the future, we will scale up the datasets with more diverse speakers and languages covering various scenarios. 


\textbf{Social impact.~~\xspace} 
Given the privacy of identity information in face and speech, we stress the necessity of consent agreements for using published models, to ensure responsible application while respecting individual privacy and rights.
