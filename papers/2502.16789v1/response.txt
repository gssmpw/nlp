\subsection{Foundation Models in Finance}
Recent advances in foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have spurred the development of multi-agent frameworks designed for financial applications. Such systems often feature different agents specialized in tasks like fundamental analysis, sentiment detection, and risk management, thereby replicating the collaborative nature of real-world trading teams.

Alpha factors (often referred to simply as ``alphas'') are essential to quantitative finance, designed to generate excess returns by exploiting specific market patterns, anomalies, or inefficiencies.
