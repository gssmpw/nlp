\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}

% Attempt 1
In this work, we introduce \textbf{FourieRF}, a novel approach for achieving fast and high-quality reconstruction in the few-shot setting. Our method effectively parameterizes features through an explicit curriculum training procedure, incrementally increasing scene complexity during optimization. Experimental results show that the prior induced by our approach is both robust and adaptable across a wide variety of scenes, establishing \textbf{FourieRF} as a strong and versatile baseline for the few-shot rendering problem. While our approach significantly reduces artifacts, it may still lead to reconstruction errors in severely under-constrained scenarios, particularly where view occlusion leaves parts of the shape uncovered.  In the future, our method could be enhanced by integrating foundation models to complete missing parts using large data-driven priors.

% While our approach is robust, since the optimization starts from convex simple shapes, it might still struggle with hard concave areas when faced with extremely under-constrained scenarios. In the future, it would be interesting to combine our approach with data-driven regularization, e.g., by \textit{learning} the optimal curriculum schedule. Furthermore, the efficiency of our method could enable the use of expensive pre-trained models in the few shot-setting, i.e LLMs or foundation models.
