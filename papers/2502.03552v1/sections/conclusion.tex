\section{Conclusion}
We show that contrary to popular belief, 
% cross encoder embeddings 
CE can produce useful sentence embeddings from initial layers. Further, initial layers of CE 
can be used to build more efficient DEs with significant inference speedup. 
%For the 10 datasets we tested on, we observed less than 1\% average difference in Hits@10 between the CE infused DE model vs the baseline, and an average of 5x speedup across all datasets.  
This has important implications for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
