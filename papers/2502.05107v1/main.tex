% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% Background
Structure-based drug discovery, encompassing the tasks of protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, represents a core challenge in drug discovery. However, no existing work can deal with both tasks to effectively leverage the duality between them, and current methods for each task are hindered by challenges in modeling 3D information and the limitations of available data.
% Method
To address these issues, we propose 3DMolFormer, a unified dual-channel transformer-based framework applicable to both docking and 3D drug design tasks, which exploits their duality by utilizing docking functionalities within the drug design process. Specifically, we represent 3D pocket-ligand complexes using parallel sequences of discrete tokens and continuous numbers, and we design a corresponding dual-channel transformer model to handle this format, thereby overcoming the challenges of 3D information modeling. Additionally, we alleviate data limitations through large-scale pre-training on a mixed dataset, followed by supervised and reinforcement learning fine-tuning techniques respectively tailored for the two tasks. 
% Results
Experimental results demonstrate that 3DMolFormer outperforms previous approaches in both protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, highlighting its promising application in structure-based drug discovery.
