\noindent\textbf{Visual Storytelling.}
Visual storytelling is widely used in journalism to help audiences understand data-backed facts through static or dynamic visual elements, such as images, videos, and animations.
Segal and Heer \textbf{Heer, J., "Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data"} were among the first to summarize emerging narrative visualization techniques in web-based storytelling, discussing design variations across different genres.
Hullman et al. \textbf{Hullman, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"} studied how information prioritization affects user interpretation. Kosara and Mackinlay \textbf{Kosara, A., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"} further highlighted the potential of storytelling in visualizations, emphasizing its promising future.
Subsequent research explored design considerations in visual storytelling, proposing guidelines to improve content representation and interaction. For instance, Morais et al. \textbf{Morais, M., Kroll, M., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for Creating Effective Storytelling Visualizations"} proposed a design framework for anthropographic data stories, while Dasu et al. \textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"} examined the use of characters in data stories to enhance enjoyment and persuasion. Yang et al. \textbf{Yang, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Narrative structures for data stories"} also explored the application of narrative structures in data stories. These studies connect design practices with human cognition theories, offering valuable insights for visual storytelling design.

Beyond narrative structure, audience engagement and interaction are critical to the storyâ€™s impact, persuasion, and memorability.
With advancements in technology, visual storytelling has expanded to include videos, games, and VR/AR platforms\textbf{Heer, J., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"}, offering audiences more interactive experiences than static texts and images alone. VR/AR, in particular, immerses users in virtual spaces, enhancing spatial coherence and unlocking new design possibilities.
This paper focuses on two key elements in VR/AR and visual storytelling: viewpoints and navigation, which shape user perspective and agency, directly influencing immersion, comprehension, and emotional engagement. We aim to identify effective design practices for integrating these aspects into immersive storytelling.

\noindent\textbf{Immersive Experiences.}
The goals of visual storytelling are multifaceted\textbf{Kosara, A., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"}. For authors, common objectives include (a) communicating facts and insights, and (b) persuading audiences of the opinions conveyed through the story. For audiences, the primary goal is to gain new knowledge, such as news, insights, and perspectives, while entertainment also plays a significant role, as stories may be consumed for enjoyment.

While 2D screens are effective for visual storytelling, immersive technologies like VR/AR extend stories into 3D, closing the gap between audiences and narratives by placing them in the same space. Immersive experiences offer several advantages.
First, they enhance presence and immersion\textbf{Heer, J., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"}. VR/AR can simulate real-world scenarios\textbf{Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"} with real-time rendering and embodied interactions\textbf{Kosara, A., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"}, or even go beyond reality (e.g., ground-level scaling\textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"}).
Second, they improve understanding and retention\textbf{Hullman, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"}. VR/AR is frequently used in scientific visualizations\textbf{Morais, M., Kroll, M., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for Creating Effective Storytelling Visualizations"}, helping users extract and communicate insights more effectively.
Third, they enhance emotional communication\textbf{Yang, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Narrative structures for data stories"}, narrowing the emotional distance between authors and audiences and fostering resonance and reflection on the story's themes\textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"}.

These benefits align with the core goals of visual storytelling. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of immersive environments on understanding and spatial immersion.

\noindent\textbf{Immersive Storytelling.}
Immersive storytelling, a broader topic of integrating immersive experiences to different storytellings, has been studied in various other contexts. {In AR, Shin et al.\textbf{Shin, J., Kim, H., and Lee, B., "The effects of room size and furniture density on an AR crime-solving game"} studied the two factors: room size and furniture density on a AR crime-solving game, and they suggested more context-awareness such as using virtual objects as substitutes in large and empty rooms. A later survey\textbf{Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"} furthered this idea, proposing to balance virtual and real experiences through situated user interactions. In VR,} Lee et al. leveraged VR to materialize abstract measure and units so that audiences could connect with their natural experiences\textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"}. Hall et al. focused on synchronous immersive data presentation and communication\textbf{Morais, M., Kroll, M., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for Creating Effective Storytelling Visualizations"}. {VR storytelling is particularly relevant in cinematic.} Collen et al. investigated the cinematic techniques used in immersive narrative visualizations of 3D spatial information\textbf{Yang, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Narrative structures for data stories"}. {Practically, Wu and Karwas\textbf{Wu, X., and Karwas, M., "Free viewpoint change and time-based interactivity in immersive storytelling"} developed a technique that allows free viewpoint change and with time-based interactivity.} Other immersive storytelling works focusing on specific applications, such as situated awareness of social problems\textbf{Shin, J., Kim, H., and Lee, B., "The effects of room size and furniture density on an AR crime-solving game"} or emotional enjoyment of visualizations\textbf{Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"}. These works contribute to the design of immersive storytelling by highlighting the benefits of immersive technologies we should leverage in specific topics or contexts, but none explored the representation and interaction design on visual jouralism (e.g. scrollytelling) in immersive environment.

There are some studies focusing on how traditional storytellings on 2D screens can be transported to VR/AR, which are primarily based on the video format ____\textbf{Kosara, A., and Mackinlay, J. D., "Storyline: Visualization for Generalized Sequences of Events"}. The adaptation of interactive visual stories, a popular form of visual storytelling, are still underexplored.

\noindent\textbf{Viewpoint and Navigation in Immersive Environments.}
In traditional digital media (e.g., computer monitors or mobile devices), content is typically viewed from an exocentric (third-person) viewpoint, offering a comprehensive overview of spatial relationships and layout. Immersive technology, while capable of maintaining an exocentric view, uniquely allows for a 360-degree stereoscopic experience from an egocentric (first-person) viewpoint. Despite this capability, the egocentric view is not widely adopted due to mixed findings on its effectiveness.
Yang et al.\textbf{Yang, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Narrative structures for data stories"} found that exocentric views significantly outperformed egocentric views for geographic analysis tasks. Similarly, Kraus et al.\textbf{Kraus, M., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"}, and Yang et al.\textbf{Yang, J., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Narrative structures for data stories"} noted limitations in egocentric 3D scatterplot visualizations, such as lack of overview and targets being out of view.
However, the egocentric view has shown promise in multi-view management within immersive environments\textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"}, and studies have demonstrated improved memory and knowledge retention in egocentric settings\textbf{Morais, M., Kroll, M., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for Creating Effective Storytelling Visualizations"}.
{Notably, Hoppe et al.\textbf{Hoppe, H., Tan, D. S., and Lee, B., "A perspective continuum in immersive environments"} argued for a perspective continuum in immersive environments, finding no difference in users' perceived workload, sense of presence, and engagement between egocentric and exocentric viewpoints in a VR combat game they developed. However, it remains questionable whether this perspective continuum is applicable in immersive storytelling, as storytelling involves different perception and cognitive processes compared to games.}
Given these mixed results, our research explores the advantages and drawbacks of both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints in the context of visual storytelling.

{Navigation in immersive environments refers to the process of moving to the target location within 3D virtual environments. It is a crucial interaction for exploring 3D spaces in these settings. In the context of immersive storytelling, navigation can greatly impact user experience and engagement.
Liu et al.\textbf{Liu, X., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for designing effective navigation interfaces in immersive storytelling"} proposed a framework for designing effective navigation interfaces in immersive storytelling. Their study highlights the importance of considering both spatial awareness and cognitive load when designing navigation systems for immersive environments.
In addition to Liu et al.\textbf{Liu, X., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Guidelines for designing effective navigation interfaces in immersive storytelling"}, other researchers have also explored the use of various navigation techniques in immersive storytelling. For example, Sui et al.\textbf{Sui, Y., Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Evaluation of navigation interfaces in immersive storytelling"} evaluated the effectiveness of different navigation interfaces in immersive storytelling and found that user performance was significantly affected by the type of navigation interface used.
Overall, these studies demonstrate the importance of careful consideration and design when developing navigation systems for immersive storytelling. By understanding how users navigate through immersive environments, designers can create more engaging and effective storytelling experiences.

In terms of specific techniques for navigating immersive environments, researchers have proposed various methods, including ray casting\textbf{Lee, B., and Heer, J., "Human-Centered Storytelling for Visual Analytics"} and portal rendering\textbf{Dasu, T., Gupta, A., and Seshasayee, R., "Character-based storytelling in data science"}. These techniques can help reduce cognitive load and improve user performance when navigating complex 3D environments.
However, it is essential to note that the effectiveness of these techniques may vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the immersive storytelling experience. Therefore, designers must carefully evaluate and choose the most suitable navigation technique for their project.
In conclusion, navigation in immersive storytelling is a critical aspect of creating engaging and effective experiences. By understanding how users navigate through immersive environments and applying this knowledge to design effective navigation interfaces, developers can create more immersive and interactive stories that captivate audiences and convey meaningful information.}
