\label{sec:sec-Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \oursolution, a novel algorithm for approximate matrix multiplication over sliding windows. \oursolution achieves  the optimal space complexity  in both the normalized and unnormalized settings. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its space efficiency and superior estimation accuracy. Future work will focus on reducing the time complexity to achieve linear dependence on the number of non-zero entries.
