The closest to our work are surveys and tutorials on ML for data management
and data management for ML, emphasizing on relational
data and RDBMS ____.
However, graph data result in unique challenges to both data management and ML (\S\ref{sec:introduction}), justifying the importance of our survey.


Additionally, there are related surveys and tutorials on, e.g., graph representation learning ____, graph neural networks ____, AI for data preparation ____, the role of graph data in graph ML ____, distributed GNN training ____, explainable AI in data management ____, ML explainability and robustness ____, LLM+KG ____, and high-dimensional vector similarity search ____, etc.
However, none of them investigate the synergy of GDM and GML. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first survey exploring the synergies between graph data management and graph ML over the end-to-end graph data pipeline. We hope that our survey will bridge the gap between these two popular domains -- GDM and GML, and would inspire others to work on the emerging graph data challenges at their intersection.
