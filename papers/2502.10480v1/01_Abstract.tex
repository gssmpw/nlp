% This manuscript develops a guidance, navigation, and control framework for safe multi-agent servicing of a tumbling space object.
The use of control barrier functions under uncertain pose information of multiple small servicing agents is analyzed for a satellite servicing application. The application consists of modular servicing agents deployed towards a tumbling space object from a mothership. Relative position and orientation of each agent is obtained via fusion of relative range and inertial measurement sensors. The control barrier functions are utilized to avoid collisions with other agents for the application of simultaneously relocating servicing agents on a tumbling body. A differential collision detection and avoidance framework using the polytopic hull of the tumbling space object is utilized to safely guide the agents away from the tumbling object.
