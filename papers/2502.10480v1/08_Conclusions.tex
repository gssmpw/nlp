This manuscript explores the use of a hybrid approach for adherence to multiple state constraints during a satellite servicing mission of an RSO. Control barrier functions (CBFs) and a differential collision detection strategy (DCOL) are toggled effectively in this hybrid approach, exhibiting a delicate trade-off between computational efficiency, and fuel efficiency. Whilst the CBF approach was ideal for inter-agent collision avoidance and was more computationally efficient, the DCOL approach was shown to be more fuel efficient in avoiding collisions with the RSO, minimizing reactionary corrective actions. Using only reconstructions of the true state via a MEKF, this hybrid approach was shown to be effective at avoiding collisions whilst performing the servicing. A $500$ trial Monte Carlo simulation resulted in a $97.6\%$ success rate even in the presence of non-trivial state uncertainty.
