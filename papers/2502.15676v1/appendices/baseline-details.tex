% BigToM situation. 
For the baselines, we use \texttt{gpt-4o-2024-08-06\\} for GPT-4o, \texttt{meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Inst-\\ruct} from Hugging Face for Llama 3.1 70B, \texttt{gemini-2.0-flash} for Gemini 2.0 Flash, and \texttt{gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05} for Gemini 2.0 Pro. 
Among the ToM prompting for LLM benchmarks previously tested on the BigToM dataset, e.g., TimeToM and SimToM, they only tested the subset of the entire dataset with questions for forward action and forward belief and did not test on backward belief questions. With the available SimToM code, we tested it on the full BigToM dataset with GPT-4o, while TimeToM does not have its code available. 


% WHy symoblic tom different
SymbolicToM maps out the agents' beliefs throughout stories of different levels of reasoning via symbolic graphs. However, the construction of these graphs is specifically designed for the ToMi dataset, where there are fixed actions and sentence formats in the story. Thus it is difficult to generalize to more open-ended scenarios (e.g., BigToM) or stories with multiple agents acting simultaneously (e.g., Hi-ToM). Therefore, we can only evaluate  SymbolicToM on ToMi (tested with GPT-4o on the full dataset), for which it was designed.  

TimeToM is not open-source. We rely on its self-reported accuracy on ToMi. However, since it was only evaluated on a subset of BigToM with forward inference questions, its accuracy on the full BigToM benchmark remains unknown. Similarly, PercepToM is not open-source, and we rely on its self-reported accuracy on ToMi.


% why we can't use BIP-ALM and LIMP
BIP-ALM and LIMP are both models that combine BIP and LLMs to solve ToM problems. BIP-ALM manually defines symbolic representations of observable and latent variables and assumes POMDP. LIMP is designed to only solve two-level reasoning problems. It uses natural language to represent variables. Both methods assume that the goals are about finding an object and the beliefs are about the locations of that object in a household environment.
