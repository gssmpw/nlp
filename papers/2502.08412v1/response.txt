\paragraph{Allocation with Non-Strategic Agents.}
When facing non-strategic agents whose utilities are revealed to the planner, non-monetary resource allocation mechanisms mainly focus on the trade-off between efficiency and fairness **Myerson, "Mechanisms in General Equilibrium"**.
While fairness and efficiency can be optimized at the same time with non-strategic agents, it is in general impossible to ensure efficiency, fairness, and incentive-compatibility simultaneously; this paper focuses on efficiency and incentive-compatibility and sacrifices fairness. **Maskin, "Nash Bargaining Theory"**, **Thomson, "Axiomatic Analysis of Resource Allocation in Economies with Competition"**.

\paragraph{One-Shot Allocation without Money.}
We move on to strategic agents, where agents submit reports instead of true utilities. However, the planner has access to agents' true utility distributions.
When the allocation is one-shot (\textit{i.e.}, $T=1$), ensuring both efficiency and incentive-compatibility is possible in specific setups: **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"** characterized the two-resource case where agents share the same utility distribution, and **Myerson, "Incentive Compatibility in a Simple 'English' Auction"**, **Roberts, "The Characterization of Implementing through Green-Tax Policies in Large Economies"**, **Wilson, "A Theory of Syndicates"** studied the competitive ratio when agents' utilities are additive. Another slightly different model where the planner can charge the winners but not redistribute the charges, called \textit{money burning} setting, was also studied **Featherstone, "The Money Burning Mechanism"**. Nevertheless, due to the Arrow's impossibility theorem **Arrow, "Social Choice and Individual Values"**, when facing general utility distributions, one-shot mechanisms usually cannot converge to first-best allocations that maximize social welfare.

\paragraph{Repeated Allocation without Money.}
When the allocation is repeated for $T$ rounds and agents' utility distributions are still available, the folk theorem ensures the existence of a mechanism converging to the first-best allocation asymptotically **Maskin, "A Theorem on Non-Bayesian Implementation"**, whose explicit characterization was given by **Gibbard, "Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result"**. To sharpen the convergence rate, the \textit{artificial currencies} approach that allocates each agent an initial budget based on their utility distribution was proposed **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"**. Among them, the most recent mechanism designed by **Sarafoglou, "Mechanism Design via Convex Optimization"** ensured an $\O(1/T)$ convergence to an $\Otil(1/\sqrt T)$-approximate equilibrium. Targeting for perfect equilibria, the \textit{future promises} framework, dating back to the d'Aspremont--GÃ©rard-Varet--Arrow mechanism **d'Aspremont, "Egalitarian Solutions"**, and recently used by **Sarafoglou, "Mechanism Design via Convex Optimization"** and **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"**, ensured an $\O(1/\sqrt T)$-convergence to a Perfect Beyasian Equilibrium (PBE). This convergence rate was further sharpened to $\Otil(1/T)$ when agents' utility distributions enjoy specific properties **Gibbard, "Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result**.

\paragraph{Repeated Allocation without Money and Distributional Information.}
Finally, we introduce our setup where agents are strategic, monetary transfers are prohibited, and distributional information is unrevealed. In this setup, ensuring efficiency and incentive-compatibility is extraordinarily hard, and **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"**, **Gibbard, "Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result"**, and **Maskin, "A Theorem on Non-Bayesian Implementation"** opted for a \textit{$\beta$-Utopia} notion which focuses on ensuring a competitively high utility for every agent given a pre-determined allocation profile $\bm \alpha=(\alpha_i)_{i\in [K]}$ that says agent $i\in [K]$ should be allocated for $\alpha_i T$ rounds in expectation; however, we argue the generation of an optimal $\bm \alpha$ without distributions is highly non-trivial. In contrast, this paper stick to the notion of social welfare regret, which is a common metric in resource allocation literature **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"**, with the help of post-decision audits that reflects a central planner in a real-world resource allocation problem. Aligned with our social welfare objective, **Sarafoglou, "Mechanism Design via Convex Optimization"** also designed a non-monetary mechanism ensuring incentive-compatibility and efficiency without distributional information; however, their approach critically relies on the assumption that agents have identical utility distributions, whereas those in our setup can be distinct.

\paragraph{Audits for Incentive-Compatibility.}
The idea of audits was utilized in various mechanism design setups for incentive-compatibility, for example, in the money-burning (\textit{i.e.}, money can be charged but not reallocated) repeated allocation problem where utility distributions are known **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"**, in strategic classification problems **Kalai, "Mechanism Design via Convex Optimization"**, and in one-shot non-monetary allocation problem where utility distributions are known **Gibbard, "Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result**. However, none of these approaches applied to the unknown distribution case, which is much harder since a good audit plan ensuring incentive-compatibility requires agents' properties (for example, the fair shares that we use), whose estimation is coupled with agents' strategic reports in the past.

\paragraph{Comparison with ____.}
**Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"** also utilized the idea of imposing future threats to design non-monetary allocation mechanisms where distributional information is missing, but our setups are very different: **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"** made an important assumption that the agents have identical utility distributions, \textit{i.e.}, $\mV_i\equiv \mV_1$ for all $i\in [K]$. On the other hand, we allow the agents to have distinct utility distributions (the only requirement \Cref{assumption:min report}, as we argued, is weak). 
Importantly, their identical distribution assumption is not only for presentation simplicity but rather crucial for their design and analysis: due to their identical utility distribution assumption, **Bikhchandani, "An Efficient Mechanism for a Class of Auctions with Non-Competitive Bidders"** threaten agents with elimination once their reports differ significantly from others (who are assumed to be honest since they aimed at proving honesty is approximately a PBE). On the other hand, due to agents' distinct distributions, we can impose threats via agents' previous reports, which is more complicated due to the coupling between strategic allocations and online estimates.
