\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we study the problem of repeatedly allocating a single resource to $K$ strategic agents for $T$ rounds, where monetary transfers are disallowed. Specifically, in each round, each agent $i\in[K]$ first observes their private utility $u_{t,i}$ for the resource, which is assumed to be sampled \textit{i.i.d.} from their utility distribution $\mV_i$. Agents then submit reports $v_{t,i}$ strategically to the central planner, which may differ from their true utilities. Based on current agent reports and the history from prior rounds, the planner then allocates the resource and is not allowed to charge the agents for such allocations. This setup captures many realistic applications where monetary charges are impossible or undesirable, for example, allocating computational resources within an organization \citep{ng2011online}, distributing foods in a food bank \citep{prendergast2017food,prendergast2022allocation}, or pairing volunteers with volunteering opportunities \citep{manshadi2023redesigning}. In the literature, there has been a growing interest in designing such non-monetary resource allocation mechanisms \citep{schummer2007mechanism}.

From a technical standpoint, prohibiting monetary transfers -- while necessary for certain applications -- severely limits the strength of the central planner. Indeed, standard allocation mechanisms use monetary transfers as the main tool to ensure \emph{incentive-compatibility}, that is, incentivizing agents to report their true utilities. In particular, the seminal Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism \citep{vickrey1961counterspeculation,clarke1971multipart,groves1973incentives} achieves the optimal social welfare for a single allocation, by designing adequate monetary charge to the winner. However, for a single allocation without monetary transfers, it is in general impossible to ensure incentive-compatibility while maximizing social welfare, as per Arrow's theorem and related impossibility results \citep{arrow1950difficulty,gi73,s75}. We refer to \citep{schummer2007mechanism} for an overview.


While the single allocation setting is prohibitive for non-monetary mechanisms, a steam of papers showed positive results for the repeated allocation setting. Intuitively, the central planner can incentivize agents by favoring or penalizing certain behaviors during future allocations. The most natural approach for designing non-monetary resource allocation mechanisms is to allocate a budget to each agent in \textit{artificial currencies} and perform a monetary mechanism thereon. This approach not only enjoys approximate incentive-compatibility (\textit{i.e.}, truthful reporting is an approximate Bayesian Nash equilibrium) and efficiency guarantees \citep{gorokh2021monetary}, but also exhibits practical success in allocating courses \citep{budish2016bringing} or food-bank donations \citep{prendergast2017food,prendergast2022allocation} due to its simplicity. On the other hand, non-monetary mechanisms using the so-called \textit{promised-utility} framework \citep{balseiro2019multiagent} are exactly incentive-compatible (\textit{i.e.}, truthful reporting is a Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium, or PBE in short) and often yield a faster convergence rate to the optimal social welfare \citep{balseiro2019multiagent,blanchard2024near}.

Both approaches rely on the critical assumption that all agent utility distributions are known to the mechanism \emph{a-priori}: the artificial currency approach uses as initial budgets the expected payments for each agent when all agents are truthfully reporting, and the promised-utility framework computes a fixed point for a Bellman-like operator induced by agents' utility distributions. We argue, however, that information about strategic agents' utility distributions is very difficult to obtain directly. The classical rationale for assuming distributional information in practice is that this can be gathered through historical data, for example, a store estimates their demand distribution via past sales. Unfortunately, historical data on \emph{strategic} agents' private utility distribution can only be gathered indirectly by observing their past behaviors while interacting in game-theoretic environments. These behaviors are the result of complex individual strategic considerations and consequently may be biased, especially when incentive-compatibility for past environments is not ensured.

Rather than assuming that the (difficult) task of estimating agents' true utility distributions has been somehow done a-priori, in this paper, we aim to understand what can be done without such an estimation when the agents are strategic.
Therefore, we ask the following question:
\begin{center}
\textbf{\textit{(Q): Without prior distributional information on agent's utilities, is it still possible to design a non-monetary resource allocation mechanism that maximizes social welfare?}}
\end{center}

Without further information, the answer is likely negative as agents can arbitrarily manipulate their reports. In fact, hardness results arising from Arrow's impossibility theorem still apply if the central planner does not have a means to acquire information on agent utilities. In practice, organizations can evaluate the effect of their past allocations when necessary, although often costly and time-consuming. For instance, organizations may design surveys, request resource utilization reports, or conduct in-depth audits. We consider the case where the planner can occasionally request \emph{post-allocation audits} and observe the true utility of the allocated agent. Audits have been used in various other mechanism design problems to enforce incentive-compatibility \citep{lundy2019allocation,jalota2024catch}, albeit not within our unknown distribution resource allocation setup.

Under this model, we study how many audits are needed for good social welfare. Importantly, we answer \textit{\textbf{(Q)}} positively by designing a mechanism \mechname (\textbf{Ada}ptive \textbf{Audit}ing) which, under some PBE of the agents, ensures $\O(K^2)$ regret while making $\O(K^3\log T)$ audits in expectation -- that is, the regret is independent of $T$ and the number of audits is logarithmic. We also provide lower bounds essentially showing that polynomial dependency in $K$ is unavoidable for the regret and that at least $\Omega(1)$ audits are necessary (see \Cref{fig:main_plot}). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that provides a general sub-linear social welfare guarantee for non-monetary mechanisms without prior distributional information on agent utilities. In the special case when all agent distributions are identical, however, \citet{yin2022online} provided a mechanism in which truthful reporting is an approximate PBE and ensured $\O(\sqrt{K^3 T \log(KT)})$ social welfare regret. Their approach heavily relies on the assumption that all agents have identical distributions, which we discuss more in \Cref{sec:related work}.


\subsection{Notations}\label{footnote:break ties} For $n\in\mathbb N$, we use $[n]$ to denote the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.
We use bold letters like $\bm u$ and $\bm v$ to denote a vector, and normal letters like $u_i$ and $v_i$ for elements therein.
We use standard Landau notations, in particular $\O$ and $\Omega$ only hide universal constants.

As an important notation, to avoid subtleties, when comparing utilities or reports across agents, we always break ties by the lexicographical order given by agent indices: for any agents $i,j\in[K]$, whenever we write $u_i<u_j$, this should be interpreted as $(u_i,i)<_{lex} (u_j,j)$.
