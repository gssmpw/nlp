\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a learning-based two-stage network incorporating Region Importance Network and Defocus Prediction Network to enable autofocus for both dense, sparse or even extremely sparse microscopy images under the one-shot setting.
Our method can effectively identify local regions with important content and subsequently estimate the defocus distance using these regions.
We also introduce a new large-scale dataset that provides a variety of defocused images with dense and sparse scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves defocus distance estimation accuracy compared to existing learning-based one-shot methods, especially in sparse scenarios.
Building on this method, we develop a WSI system that exhibits promising focusing capabilities in real-world applications.
