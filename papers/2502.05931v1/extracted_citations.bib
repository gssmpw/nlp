  abstract = 	 {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are considered as intellectual property of their corresponding owners and thus are in urgent need of ownership protection, due to the massive amount of time and resources invested in designing, tuning and training them. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based ownership protection method by using the residuals of important parameters. Different from other watermark-based ownership protection methods that rely on some specific neural network architectures and during verification require external data source, namely ownership indicators, our method does not explicitly use ownership indicators for verification to defeat various attacks against DNN watermarks. Specifically, we greedily select a few and important model parameters for embedding so that the impairment caused by the changed parameters can be reduced and the robustness against different attacks can be improved as the selected parameters can well preserve the model information. Also, without the external data sources for verification, the adversary can hardly cast doubts on ownership verification by forging counterfeit watermarks. The extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in five tasks.}

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are revolutionizing various critical fields by providing an unprecedented leap in terms of accuracy and functionality. Due to the costly training procedure, high-performance DNNs are typically considered as the Intellectual Property (IP) of the model builder and need to be protected. While DNNs are increasingly commercialized, the pre-trained models might be illegally copied or redistributed after they are delivered to malicious users. In this paper, we introduce DeepMarks, the first end-to-end collusion-secure fingerprinting framework that enables the owner to retrieve model authorship information and identification of unique users in the context of deep learning (DL). DeepMarks consists of two main modules: (i) Designing unique fingerprints using anti-collusion codebooks for individual users; and (ii) Encoding each constructed fingerprint (FP) in the probability density function (pdf) of the weights by incorporating an FP-specific regularization loss during DNN re-training. We investigate the performance of DeepMarks on various datasets and DNN architectures. Experimental results show that the embedded FP preserves the accuracy of the host DNN and is robust against different model modifications that might be conducted by the malicious user. Furthermore, our framework is scalable and yields perfect detection rates and no false alarms when identifying the participants of FP collusion attacks under theoretical guarantee. The runtime overhead of retrieving the embedded FP from the marked DNN can be as low as 0.056\%.},

abstract = {Significant progress has been made with deep neural networks recently. Sharing trained models of deep neural networks has been a very important in the rapid progress of research and development of these systems. At the same time, it is necessary to protect the rights to shared trained models. To this end, we propose to use digital watermarking technology to protect intellectual property and detect intellectual property infringement in the use of trained models. First, we formulate a new problem: embedding watermarks into deep neural networks. Second, we propose a general framework for embedding a watermark in model parameters, using a parameter regularizer. Our approach does not impair the performance of networks into which a watermark is placed because the watermark is embedded while training the host network. Finally, we perform comprehensive experiments to reveal the potential of watermarking deep neural networks as the basis of this new research effort. We show that our framework can embed a watermark during the training of a deep neural network from scratch, and during fine-tuning and distilling, without impairing its performance. The embedded watermark does not disappear even after fine-tuning or parameter pruning; the watermark remains complete even after 65\% of parameters are pruned.},

In this paper, we generalize white-box watermarking algorithms for DNNs, where the data owner needs white-box access to the model to extract the watermark. White-box watermarking algorithms have the advantage that they do not impact the accuracy of the watermarked model. We propose Robust whIte-box GAn watermarking (RIGA), a novel white-box watermarking algorithm that uses adversarial training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed watermarking algorithm not only does not impact accuracy, but also significantly improves the covertness and robustness over the current state-of-art.},
