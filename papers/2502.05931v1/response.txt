\subsection{Protecting Intellectual Property of Deep Neural Networks}
The protection of intellectual property (IP) in deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a critical area of research due to the increasing deployment of DNNs in commercial and sensitive applications. DNN models require substantial computational resources, proprietary datasets, and extensive fine-tuning, making them valuable assets prone to unauthorized duplication and misuse **Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks"**.

Existing approaches to protecting the IP of DNNs can be broadly categorized into invasive and non-invasive methods **Sze et al., "Efficient Processing of Deep Neural Networks: A Tutorial on Distributed, Parallel, and Approximate Computing" ____ or cryptographic signatures ____**. These methods have demonstrated resilience against model theft but often introduce overhead and may degrade performance. Non-invasive methods, including fingerprinting and behavioral authentication, focus on capturing unique model characteristics without modifying the model’s architecture or weights ____.

A prominent line of research focuses on model fingerprinting, which leverages decision boundary analysis to detect stolen models **Tramèr et al., "You Only Need Adversarial Training for Deep Neural Networks"**. While effective in black-box settings, fingerprinting methods face challenges in scalability and robustness against fine-tuning and adversarial attacks ____**. Additionally, watermarking-based methods such as **DeepMarks** and **DeepSigns** have been proposed to embed resilient identifiers within model parameters. However, these approaches are susceptible to removal via model pruning and parameter tuning ____.

A critical gap in existing IP protection methods is the lack of standardization and legal enforcement mechanisms. Most frameworks assume the presence of a trusted verification authority, which may not always be feasible ____**. Moreover, current solutions struggle with balancing robustness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency ____.

\subsection{Watermarking Deep Neural Networks}
Watermarking is a widely explored technique for embedding unique identifiers within DNN models to assert ownership. It can be categorized into black-box and white-box watermarking. Black-box watermarking involves embedding trigger-based patterns in the model’s decision-making process, which can be detected using specific queries. White-box watermarking, on the other hand, modifies internal parameters to encode ownership information in an imperceptible manner ____**.

A seminal work by **Uchida et al., "Embedding Watermarks into Deep Neural Networks"** introduced a method for embedding watermarks into model weights, demonstrating resilience against model compression and fine-tuning. Other approaches, such as adversarial frontier stitching **,** leverage backdoor triggers to verify ownership without affecting model performance. However, these techniques have been shown to be vulnerable to model distillation and adversarial countermeasures ____**.

Recent advances in persistent and unforgeable watermarking techniques have addressed some of these vulnerabilities. **Li et al., "Wonder Filters: Unifying Watermark Robustness and Inference Efficiency"** introduced wonder filters, a novel watermarking primitive that embeds a persistent bit-sequence into a model during its initial training phase. Unlike previous watermarking schemes, wonder filters offer strong resilience against fine-tuning and adversarial attacks by leveraging out-of-bound values and null-embedding techniques. This ensures that the watermark cannot be removed or forged without destroying the model’s functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that wonder filters achieve high levels of persistence and piracy resistance, making them a promising direction for future watermarking techniques ____**.

Reversible watermarking techniques, which allow watermark extraction without degrading model performance, have gained traction ____**. Methods like **Greedy Residuals Watermarking** have been proposed to enhance robustness while maintaining fidelity. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in ensuring watermark detectability under extensive model modifications ____.

One major research gap in DNN watermarking is the lack of a theoretical framework for assessing watermark capacity and robustness. Existing solutions rely on empirical evaluations without formal guarantees on the detectability and permanence of embedded marks ____**. Additionally, watermarking techniques primarily target classification models, with limited applicability to generative and reinforcement learning models ____.

\subsection{Watermarking EEG-Based Neural Networks for IP Protection}
The protection of EEG-based deep learning models has gained increasing importance due to their unique privacy and security concerns. EEG models, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, encode highly sensitive neurological data, making them valuable assets in need of robust IP protection ____**.

Despite the extensive research on watermarking standard DNNs, the application of watermarking for EEG-based models remains relatively unexplored. The work by **Xu et al., "EEG-Based Neural Networks Watermarking: A New Approach"** represents the first attempt to integrate watermarking into EEG-based neural networks for IP protection. Their method employs a trigger set specifically designed for EEG data, ensuring that watermarks can be embedded without significantly affecting model performance. By leveraging neuroscientific insights, they propose three key constraints that EEG-based watermarks should satisfy: symbolic representation, consistency with EEG input characteristics, and uniqueness.

Their study demonstrates the robustness of their watermarking approach against common anti-watermarking attacks such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and pruning. The proposed watermarking framework embeds distinct patterns into EEG models while maintaining classification accuracy, making it resistant to piracy ____**. However, their work focuses exclusively on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), limiting its generalizability to other deep learning architectures. Additionally, a significant limitation of their approach is the lack of authentication mechanisms. Their method verifies watermark presence but does not establish a direct link between the model and its rightful owner, making it vulnerable to ownership disputes.

\subsection{Novelty of Our Work}
While significant progress has been made in protecting the intellectual property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNNs), existing methods fall short when applied to EEG-based models. Current approaches either lack robust mechanisms for establishing definitive ownership claims or fail to address the unique challenges posed by EEG data ____**. Our work bridges this gap by introducing the first framework for protecting EEG-based neural networks using unforgeable watermarks. By integrating cryptographic techniques, we ensure a definitive and undisputable link between the model and its owner, addressing critical limitations in ownership verification and robustness against attacks. This represents a significant advancement in IP protection for EEG-based applications.
