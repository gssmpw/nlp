\textbf{ConFrag} and \textbf{Co-ConFrag} use a teacher-student learning framework, where a teacher model predicts the noisy labels for each sample. The student model is trained to predict the same noisy labels as the teacher model but with a different architecture. In this case, the teacher model is \citet{van2015learning}, and the student model is \textbf{ConFrag} or \textbf{Co-ConFrag}.
