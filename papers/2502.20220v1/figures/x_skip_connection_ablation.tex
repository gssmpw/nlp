    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative Ablation of Skip Connections.} Not employing skip connections~(a) causes misalignments, blurry renderings, and a slight color shift. Adding the color skip connection~(b) already noticeably improves sharpness and color fidelity. On the other hand, if the position skip connection is added~(c), geometric details are improved but the overall color slightly off. Using both skip connections~(d) yields the best result.  }
