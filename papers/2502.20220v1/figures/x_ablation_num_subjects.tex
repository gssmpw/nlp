    \caption{\textbf{Effect of Number of Train Subjects.} Training on a larger and more diverse set of people enhances the Avat3r's generalization capabilities, as expected. This leads to more accurate reconstructions, with avatars better matching the identities shown in the input images. For instance, when dealing with complex hairstyles, a model trained on a broader range of individuals reproduces the hairstyle more accurately. All ablations are trained without LPIPS loss. }
