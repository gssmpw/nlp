    \caption{\textbf{Ablation study.} Adding Sapiens features (b) noticeably improves sharpness but still exhibits misalignments. Conversely, using position maps from Dust3r improves alignment but is overall less sharp (c). Combining both but training on multi-view images from the same timestep produces sharp results but is less robust to inconsistencies in the input (d). Our final model exhibits the best trade-off between alignment, sharpness, and robustness (e).  }
