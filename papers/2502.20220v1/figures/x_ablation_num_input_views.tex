    \caption{\textbf{Effect of Number of Input Views.} Training with just a single input image noticeably impairs quality. On the other hand, using more than 4 input images during training does not lead to significant improvements. Models are trained without DUSt3R position maps and without LPIPS loss in the interest of comparability.}
