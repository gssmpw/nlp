    \caption{\textbf{Performance on NeRSemble dataset.} We show reconstructed and animated avatars using 4 images from the NeRSemble dataset. Note that this dataset was not used during training and contains images with different lighting conditions, viewpoints, and camera intrinsics than the Ava-256 dataset that was used to train {\OURS}.}
