\section{Limitation}

Our method showed limited performance improvement when time indicators, such as specific years (e.g., 1980), are involved in temporal understanding. This is implied from our evaluations on event-time ordering and time-time ordering tasks, as shown in Appendix~\ref{appndx:detail_limitation_temporal_indicator}. The findings suggest that arithmetic reasoning is essential for grounding timelines with absolute time indicators, as emphasized in prior studies~\cite{su2024timo,zhu2023question}. 

Another limitation is that we focused on pointwise and pairwise event reasoning to highlight the model's struggles with basic temporal reasoning due to consistency issues. We anticipate future work expanding our approach to more complex listwise ordering like event schema prediction~\cite{zhang-etal-2024-narrative}.

Finally, the effectiveness of LLMs can be impacted by the specific wording of prompts~\cite{jiang2020can}. For example, Appendix~\ref{appndx:detail_limitation_prompt_sensitivity} shows that, although our revised prompts generally yield better results than CoT, \ours experienced a slight decrease in performance.
