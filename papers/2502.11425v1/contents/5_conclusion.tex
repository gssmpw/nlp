\section{Conclusion}


We targeted the temporal inconsistency in relative event understanding with LLMs by proposing a prompting approach using \contrast questions.
This encourages the model to focus more on the temporal aspects and collectively evaluate its answer with imposed constraints.
Experiments with the INC metric show that our approach mitigates inconsistency and improves overall performance.
