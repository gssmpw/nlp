We now turn to explore the consequences that this choice might lead to. First, we consider a simple case of random node contraction on a random graph to theoretically explore how node aggregation affects graph structure. We then explore how aggregating individuals into household nodes on empirical networks can impact (i) local network metrics, (ii) the spread of information over a network and influence maximization, and (iii) node centrality.

In relation to the closely related work on \textit{coarse-graining}, which we mention in \Cref{sec:background}, recent work by \cite{griebenow2019finding} explores how different network properties (e.g., average degree, eigenvector centrality, betweenness) change on simulated networks after aggregating nodes according to a proposed spectral algorithm. The consequences we explore in this section explore how the network properties change under \textit{household-defined node aggregation}.
