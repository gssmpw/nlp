\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

We have presented \emph{SASVi}, a novel re-prompting mechanism for \emph{SAM2} based on a frame-wise object detection \emph{Overseer} model. Our novel contribution allows us to leverage the excellent temporal properties of \emph{SAM2} and smoothly and consistently segment arbitrary videos from various surgical domains with scarce annotation data. We have demonstrated the approach on three different surgical segmentation datasets covering cholecystectomy and cataract surgery. The obtained segmentation annotations for complete videos will be publicly available, enabling further development of surgical data science models and potentially mitigating class imbalance issues. We believe \emph{SASVi} can serve as a baseline for smooth and temporally consistent segmentation of surgical videos with scarcely available annotation data, taking surgical data science to the next level of automatisation.
