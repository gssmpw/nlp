\subsection{Formal Methods and Specifications}
Hoare's axiomatic basis for computer programming____ established the foundation for reasoning about program correctness through preconditions and postconditions, while Dijkstra's weakest precondition calculus____ provided systematic approaches for deriving specifications. These theoretical frameworks influenced the development of specification languages like JML____ and modern verification-oriented programming languages such as \formal{Dafny}____. Meyer's design by contract____ further popularized the use of preconditions and postconditions in software development. However, the manual effort required to write formal specifications has historically limited their widespread adoption in industrial practice____.
