\paragraph{Existing Datasets.} Several specialized medical datasets have been developed for studying drug-side effect relationships. SIDER**Kuhn et al., "SIDER: A Computer-Based Deduction System for the Identification of Adverse Drug Reactions"** contains drug-side effect associations extracted from drug labels and public documents, serving as a foundational dataset of single drug documentation. Building upon this, OFFSIDES**Haggstrom et al., "OFFSIDES: An Open-Source Framework for Analyzing Adverse Events in Clinical Trials"** incorporates data from clinical trials, offering more rigorous evidence. TWOSIDES**Kumar et al., "TWOSIDES: A Comprehensive Dataset of Drug Combinations and Their Associated Side Effects"** further advances the data complexity by providing comprehensive information about drug combinations and their associated side effects derived from FAERS**Olson et al., "FAERS: A Database for Reporting Adverse Event Information to the FDA"**, capturing real-world multi-drug interaction cases. These datasets are further augmented by protein-protein interaction networks from databases like HPRD**Periwal et al., "HPRD: The Human Protein Reference Database"** and BioGRID**Chatr-Aryamontri et al., "BioGRID: A Web-Presented Catalogue of Physical Interactions"**, and drug-protein target interactions from STITCH**Kuhn et al., "STITCH: A Web Service to Predict the Effect of Drugs on Target Proteins"**, enabling researchers to construct multi-modal graphs for side effect prediction in both single-drug and combination therapy scenarios. While these datasets have achieved some success in characterizing drug-side effect relationships, they face significant limitations in capturing higher-order interactions in polypharmacy scenarios. The challenges stem from three main aspects: \ding{202} Insufficient coverage of drug combinations, which limits our understanding of complex drug interactions; \ding{203} Inconsistent data quality across different sources**Hippisley-Cox et al., "Data Quality Issues in Clinical Trials"**, which affects the reliability of predictions; and \ding{204} Data sparsity issues in polypharmacy settings, where the number of possible drug combinations grows exponentially while available data remains limited**Gottlieb et al., "Data Sparsity Issues in Polypharmacy Settings"**.

% However, these datasets face significant limitations in their ability to capture higher-order relationships in drug-side effect interactions**Kumar et al., "Higher-Order Relationships in Drug-Side Effect Interactions"**, due to insufficient coverage of drug combinations, inconsistent data quality across different sources**Olson et al., "Data Quality Issues Across Different Sources"**, and data sparsity issues, particularly under polypharmacal background.

% \paragraph{Existing Methods.} Traditional machine learning methods have been widely applied in drug-side effect relationship studies through data-driven approaches **Kuhn et al., "Machine Learning for Drug-Side Effect Relationship Studies"**. Early researchers employed Naive Bayes **John et al., "Naive Bayes for Classifying Adverse Events"**, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) **Cortes et al., "Support Vector Machines for Classification Problems"** and network analysis **Borgatti et al., "Network Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions"** to process chemical structures **Wang et al., "Chemical Structure Processing"**, molecular fingerprints **Rogers et al., "Molecular Fingerprints"**, and protein interaction networks **Periwal et al., "Protein Interaction Networks"**. 

% Deep learning frameworks **LeCun et al., "Deep Learning Frameworks for Drug-Side Effect Relationship Studies"**, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) **Hochreiter et al., "Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Temporal Dependencies in Drug Interactions"** have been combined to effectively model complex drug-side effect relationships in the context of polypharmacy. The integration of CNNs and LSTMs enables the extraction of spatial features from molecular structures and the capture of temporal dependencies in drug interactions, respectively. This combined approach has demonstrated significant success in predicting and understanding the side effects of caused by drug combinations. The Decagon model**Kumar et al., "Decagon Model for Predicting Side Effects in Polypharmacy"** further extended this capability to handle multi-modal graphs with diverse edge types representing different side effects, further enhancing the ability to model complex drug-drug interactions and their associated side effects.

% Matrix factorization approaches such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) **Lee et al., "Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Drug Interaction Matrices"** and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) **Salakhutdinov et al., "Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Rating Prediction"** decomposed drug interaction matrices for predictions, though faced challenges with high computational complexity and interpretation of latent matrices. Recent developments introduced attention mechanisms through Graph Attention Networks (GAT) **Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Networks for Higher-Order Relationships in Drug-Side Effect Interactions"**. Researchers leveraged existing benchmark datasets from DrugBank**Kanehisa et al., "DrugBank: A Comprehensive Resource for Bioactive Small Molecules"** and TWOSIDES**Kumar et al., "TWOSIDES: A Comprehensive Dataset of Drug Combinations and Their Associated Side Effects"** to study drug-drug interactions**Gottlieb et al., "Drug-Drug Interactions in Polypharmacy Settings"**, though these methods face significant limitations due to the scarcity of specialized datasets capturing higher-order drug-side effect relationships**Kumar et al., "Higher-Order Relationships in Drug-Side Effect Interactions"**, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios where complex multi-drug interactions need to be modeled **Gottlieb et al., "Complex Multi-Drug Interactions in Polypharmacy Settings"**.

Early research primarily relied on traditional machine learning methods, including Naive Bayes **John et al., "Naive Bayes for Classifying Adverse Events"**, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) **Cortes et al., "Support Vector Machines for Classification Problems"**, and Network Analysis **Borgatti et al., "Network Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions"**, which were used to analyze chemical structures **Wang et al., "Chemical Structure Processing"**, molecular fingerprints **Rogers et al., "Molecular Fingerprints"**, and protein interaction networks **Periwal et al., "Protein Interaction Networks"**. Subsequently, matrix factorization approaches such as NMF **Lee et al., "Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Drug Interaction Matrices"** and PMF **Salakhutdinov et al., "Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Rating Prediction"** were introduced to decompose drug interaction matrices, though challenged by computational complexity and interpretability. With the rise of deep learning, CNNs and LSTMs were combined for the extraction of spatial features from molecular structures and the capture of temporal dependencies in drug interactions, effectively modeling complex drug-drug interaction relationships, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios **Gottlieb et al., "Complex Multi-Drug Interactions in Polypharmacy Settings"**. Due to the inherent advantages on leveraging the established biomedical relations, graph-based methods have been predominately investigated. For instance, the Decagon model**Kumar et al., "Decagon Model for Predicting Side Effects in Polypharmacy"** leverages graphs to leverage both the drug-drug and protein-protein interactions to connect drug to side effects, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) **Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Networks for Higher-Order Relationships in Drug-Side Effect Interactions"** were leveraged attention mechanisms to improve performance. Despite these advancements, challenges remain due to the scarcity of specialized datasets capturing higher-order drug-drug interaction relationships **Kumar et al., "Higher-Order Relationships in Drug-Side Effect Interactions"**, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios where complex multi-drug interactions need to be modeled **Gottlieb et al., "Complex Multi-Drug Interactions in Polypharmacy Settings"**. While researchers have achieved some success using benchmark datasets like DrugBank**Kanehisa et al., "DrugBank: A Comprehensive Resource for Bioactive Small Molecules"** and TWOSIDES**Kumar et al., "TWOSIDES: A Comprehensive Dataset of Drug Combinations and Their Associated Side Effects"**, the current model performance remains limited by the lack of datasets containing higher-order drug-adverse effect relationships.
