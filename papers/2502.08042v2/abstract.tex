\begin{abstract} This paper proposes efficient solutions for \kcore{} decomposition with high parallelism. 
    The problem of \kcore{} decomposition is fundamental in graph analysis and has applications across various domains. 
    However, existing algorithms face significant challenges in achieving work-efficiency in theory and/or high parallelism in practice, 
    and suffer from various performance bottlenecks.

    We present a simple, work-efficient parallel framework for $k$-core decomposition that is easy to implement and adaptable to various strategies for improving work-efficiency. 
    We introduce two techniques to enhance parallelism: a sampling scheme to reduce contention on high-degree vertices, and vertical granularity control (VGC) to mitigate scheduling overhead for low-degree vertices. 
    Furthermore, we design a hierarchical bucket structure to optimize performance for graphs with high coreness values.
    
    We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse set of real-world and synthetic graphs. 
    Compared to state-of-the-art parallel algorithms, including \ParK, \PKC, and \Julienne, 
    our approach demonstrates superior performance on 23 out of 25 graphs when tested on a 96-core machine. 
    Our algorithm shows speedups of up to 315$\times$ over \Park{}, 33.4$\times$ over \PKC{}, and 52.5$\times$ over \Julienne{}.
