\begin{itemize}
  \item In \cref{sec:prelim}, we revised the definition of the computational model, and give the definition of \emph{span} in the standard work-span model. We also stated the result from the work-stealing scheduler~\cite{arora2001thread, BL98}, which explains how work and span are related to the running time on a parallel algorithm on $P$ processors. 
  \item At the end of \cref{sec:peeling}, we added a paragraph \emp{Span Analysis}, which analyzes the span of the existing algorithms, including \Julienne{}, and the plain version of our framework (without VGC). Indeed, the same analysis in \Julienne{} directly applies here.  We extend the analysis to the \emph{burdened span} for these algorithms. 
  \item At the end of \cref{sec:vgc}, we added a paragraph \emp{Burdened Span Analysis}, which analyzes the burdened span of our new algorithm with VGC, and compare it with \Julienne{}. This analysis helps justify why our algorithm may achieve better parallelism than \Julienne{} on certain graphs. We also briefly modified some texts in the description of the VGC part in \cref{sec:vgc} to match our new content on the analysis for burdened span. 
  \item In \cref{sec:exp:span}, we added a paragraph to experimentally evaluate the burdened span using CilkView. We compare the burdened span of our algorithm (with and without VGC) with the state-of-the-art implementation \Julienne{}. Results are provided in \cref{fig:burdened_span}. 
      The results in burdened span mostly matches the relative trend in running time. This suggests that our speedup over \Julienne{} mainly comes from better burdened span, which is enabled by using VGC to reduce synchronization overhead. 
      
      In the appendix of the full paper, we also put two figures side-by-side to make this point more clear: the speedup of our algorithm (with and without VGC) over \Julienne{} in \emph{burdened span} (\cref{fig:app:burdened_span}, the same as \cref{fig:burdened_span} in the main paper), and the speedup of our algorithm (with and without VGC) over \Julienne{} in \emph{running time} (\cref{fig:app:burdened_span_speedup}). 
      We note that, the information of \cref{fig:app:burdened_span_speedup} about the running time is fully covered in \cref{fig:overall}. 
      For page limit, we did not include \cref{fig:app:burdened_span_speedup} in the main paper, but only provide it in the full version for better illustration.
