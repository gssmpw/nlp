  abstract = {A reachability oracle (or hop labeling) assigns each vertex v two
              sets of vertices: Lout(v) and Lin(v), such that u reaches v iff
              Lout(u) ∩ Lin(v) ≠ 0. Despite their simplicity and elegance,
              reachability oracles have failed to achieve efficiency in more than
              ten years since their introduction: The main problem is high
              construction cost, which stems from a set-cover framework and the
              need to materialize transitive closure. In this paper, we present
              two simple and efficient labeling algorithms, Hierarchical-Labeling
              and Distribution-Labeling, which can work onmassive real-world
              graphs: Their construction time is an order of magnitude faster
              than the set-cover based labeling approach, and transitive closure
              materialization is not needed. On large graphs, their index sizes
              and their query performance can now beat the state-of-the-art
              transitive closure compression and online search approaches.},
