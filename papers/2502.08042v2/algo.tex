\section{Our New Techniques}\label{sec:online-framework}
In this section, we introduce our new techniques to overcome challenges in existing solutions. 
Our algorithm is also based on the online algorithm shown in \cref{algo:peel_online}. 
We use the parallel hash bag introduced in \cref{sec:prelim} 
to maintain the frontiers in the algorithm. 
%We emphasize the optimization strategies for the framework of the algorithm, 
%which are designed to improve the performance of the algorithm on different types of graphs.
%As we have discussed in the previous sections,
%$k$-core decomposition may face different computing challenges on different types of graphs,
%which may extremely dominate the performance of the algorithm.

As discussed, there exist two main challenges in existing solutions that limits parallelism on different types of graphs.
The first occurs on graphs with high-degree vertices, 
where the atomic operations in the online algorithm cause high contention.
%The semisort algorithm in \GBBS does not contain the overhead of contention.
The second occurs on sparse graphs with low-degree vertices, where synchronization between subrounds causes high scheduling overhead. 
%However, the fixed number of buckets in \GBBS may cause a large number of frontier generating rounds for large-diameter graphs.
%Therefore, we propose targeted design strategies to improve the bottlenecks of the algorithm framework in 
%multiple aspects, including the frontier processing step, the hashbag operations, and the load balancing of the algorithm.
In this section, we propose our solutions to these two challenges, including a \emph{sampling scheme} to reduce high contention on concurrent atomic operations,
and a \emph{vertical granularity control} approach that uses a local search to reduce the number of subrounds.
