  over to the best sequential time (our sequential time or the BZ algorithm time~\cite{batagelj2003m}) on 14 representative graphs. Higher is better.} 
  Full results are in \cref{table:fulltable}.
  %Numbers below 1 means the parallel running time is slower than the sequential baseline, and numbers under 2 are given on top of the bars.
  Numbers below 2 are given on the bars, meaning the parallel code is no more than $2\times$ faster than a sequential one.
