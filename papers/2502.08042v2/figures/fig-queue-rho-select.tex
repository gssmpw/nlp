  \caption{\textbf{Number of subrounds with and without VGC.} 
  Each point $(x,y)$ means VGC reduces a round with $y$ subrounds to $x$ subrounds. 
  The blue dotted line is the baseline where $y=x$. 
  %The y-axis shows the initial number of total rounds, 
  %x-axis shows the number of total rounds with local search. 
  The number $R$ in each subtitle is the reduction ratio of the number of subrounds.
