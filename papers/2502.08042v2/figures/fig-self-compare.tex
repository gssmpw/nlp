  \caption{\textbf{Speedup of VGC and sampling over a plain implementation. Higher is better.}
  %The speedup is the ratio of the running time over the plain version to the running time of with VGC only, with sampling only, and with both.
  The plain version does not use VGC or sampling. 
  The bars are truncated at 2.5 for better visualization. The text on the bars are the actual speedup values.
