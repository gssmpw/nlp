\section{Conclusion} 
In this paper, we present an efficient parallel solution to \kcore{} decomposition.
Our contributions include 1) an algorithmic framework that can achieve work-efficiency using various peeling strategies,
2) a sampling scheme to reduce contention on high-degree vertices on dense graphs,
3) a vertical granularity control (VGC) algorithm to hide the scheduling overhead for low-degree vertices on sparse graphs,
and 4) a hierarchical bucketing structure (HBS) to improve the performance of managing frontiers. 
With the new techniques, our algorithm achieves high performance on a variety of graphs. 
We compare our algorithm with three state-of-the-art algorithm \Julienne{}, \Park{}, and \PKC{}.
Due to different design, each baseline may exhibit worse performance than a sequential implementation on certain graphs. 
Our algorithm consistently performs well on all graphs, and always outperforms the best sequential algorithm by 7.3-84 times. 
In the experiment, our algorithm is faster than the baselines on all 12 dense graphs and 11 out of 13 sparse graphs. 
Experimental results also show that each of our new technique is effective in improving performance. 
%On sparse graphs, our algorithm is up to 53$\times$ faster than \Julienne{}, up to 28$\times$ than \Park{} and up to 11$\times$ faster than \PKC{}.
