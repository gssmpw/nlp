%\IEEEPARstart{P} 
Privacy of machine learning models deployed on Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms can be compromised by

adversaries to extract sensitive details, including model architecture
and hyperparameters~\cite{TramerZJRR16}. 
%, which are often proprietary and essential to the performance and commercial value of the model.
%These attacks are often based on gradient based inference, path-searching and surrogate model training methods to leak the target data. Adversary can train shadow models based on the output of the target model and then based on the confidence score leak the members on which model is trained.
%Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a secure enclave within a processor, safeguarding sensitive data and code from unauthorized access, even if the operating system is compromised. They protect against threats such as malicious software and physical attacks such as memory bus snooping. The CPU acts as the root of trust, establishing secure enclaves with hardware-enforced encryption and attestation. Intel SGX is a prime example, creating isolated "enclaves". TEEs like SGX are increasingly used to secure ML models (e.g., Slalom \cite{tram√®r2019slalomfastverifiableprivate}, DarkneTZ \cite{Mo2020DarkneTZ}, TEESlice \cite{li2024teesliceprotectingsensitiveneural}, Occlumency \cite{Lee2019Occlumency}). These works leverage TEEs to protect sensitive computations and data within isolated enclaves, mitigating model stealing and unauthorized access risks. Being more efficient than cryptographic techniques, TEEs are being utilized as the root of trust by most current MLaaS applications to secure ML models.

the tight integration of on-core AI accelerators like Intel AMX\cite{intel2023amx} causes AMX performance to depend upon operand value which works as proxy, enabling timer attacks on ML models thus introducing a timing side channel that bypasses conventional defenses like speculative execution mitigations %~\cite{yan2018invisispec}

and challenges the architectural and data privacy of ML.

\begin{comment}

Intel AMX's versatility supports both training and inference workloads in AI applications. Bfloat16 operations balance precision and dynamic range, making them suitable for neural network training, %~\cite{googleBFloat16Secret} 
while 8-bit integer operations enhance inference performance with negligible accuracy loss, providing significant acceleration for modern AI workloads.

We show that AMX performance depends on an operand value.

%\subsection{Attacks on ML}
%\noindent\textbf{Model and Hyperparameter Extraction.} 
Black-box attacks extract model functionality or hyperparameters with minimal access but require confidence scores and are mitigated by  various methods like limiting the query rate, obfuscating the input data by masking, rounding confidence, or using homomorphic encryption.  
%Model inversion attacks~\cite{Fredrikson2015ModelInversion,Wand2022VarModelInversion} reconstruct sensitive inputs such as facial images.
%\noindent\textbf{Physical and Microarchitectural Attacks on ML.} 
Early physical attacks, such as IKWYS~\cite{wei2018know}  %and CSI NN~\cite{CSINN2018}, 
used power or EM side channels to infer neural network (NN) parameters but required physical access. %. Cache Telepathy
~\cite{Yan2020Cachetelepathy} 
%and DeepRecon~\cite{HongDeepRecon2018} 
leverages cache timing to leak NN architecture but is reliant on particular ML libraries and co-location. 
%Rowhammer-based attacks like DeepSteal~\cite{RakinDeepSteal2021} leak partial weights but assume partial black-box knowledge~\textcolor{red}
 We confirmed that vulnerabilities on NNs using floating-point timing~\cite{9218707} have been completely mitigated in the Intel AMX design and thus are no longer available to the attacker. 
%Despite advances, non-cache based microarchitectural side-channel attacks targeting NN parameters remain unexplored.

%  Traditionally, power side-channel attacks require physical access to a system to measure power consumption or electromagnetic emissions. Such attacks are less common and practical because they require a high level of access. However, Lipp et al. \cite{Lipp2021Platypus} demonstrated a method to exploit the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface for power side-channel attacks without needing physical access. However, RAPL is now a privileged interface, making this technique inaccessible to the unprivileged attacker. 
% %
% Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), an optimization technique for power management, can paradoxically open up new attack surfaces by converting power side channels into timing attacks. This vulnerability was exploited in Hertzbleed \cite{wang2022hertzbleed} to leak data by throttling under power limits, and in Collide+Power \cite{kogler2023collide+}, where power limits and throttling were manipulated to convert the memory power side channels into timing variations. Notably, power limit controls are usually privileged, and throttling can be mitigated by disabling Turbo Boost. As such, our work reveals a new, generic vulnerability in Intel AMX, specifically within its power and performance management mechanisms. Interestingly, unlike DVFS-related vulnerabilities, our discovered vulnerability persists irrespective of DVFS states and allows for exploitation regardless of whether DVFS is on or off. Additionally, our attack does not require a shared cache‚Äîunlike Collide+Power, which necessitates shared cache access to leak data, is now patched and leaks significantly lower rate (4.82 compared to 76.8 bits per hour for our attack).

 In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting Intel AMX 
 %this newly discovered vulnerability in NN operations 
 to leak sensitive information in NN, such as sparsity of it's weights. Inferring sparsity could inadvertently reveal sensitive data patterns. Understanding the sparsity pattern might provide insights into the underlying data distributions, potentially breaching data privacy.
Additionally, knowledge of sparsity patterns could enable attackers to craft more effective adversarial attacks. By understanding the structure of a model, an attacker might design inputs that strategically exploit sparsity, leading to degraded model performance or incorrect predictions.
 %Previous works in the literature have targeted NN models to infer architectural details, inputs, and weights, often necessitating physical access for power and electromagnetic measurements \cite{CSINN2018} or shared cache manipulation via known cache side channels \cite{Yan2020Cachetelepathy}.  
 Our approach is notable for not requiring physical access or a shared cache, unlike previous works %in the literature have targeted NN models to infer architectural details, inputs, and weights,

This phenomenon is different from the observed Hertzbleed~\cite{wang2022hertzbleed} because our attack continues to function even with the Intel Turbo Boost (DVFS) feature turned off, suggesting a novel root cause specific to the Intel AMX design compared to the Hertzbleed that relies on DVFS feature enabled and obsolete cryptographic libraries.

% New
This phenomenon is different from the observed Hertzbleed\cite{wang2022hertzbleed, liu2022frequency}, which is a side-channel attack that leverages dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on modern x86 processors to transform power fluctuations into timing attacks, extractable without direct power measurement. Hertzbleed exploits CPU frequency variations, linked to data-dependent power consumption. Our attack continues to function even with the Intel Turbo Boost (DVFS) feature turned off, suggesting a novel root cause specific to the Intel AMX design compared to Hertzbleed, which relies on the DVFS feature being enabled and obsolete cryptographic libraries.
Our attack also bypasses TEE based defenses in contrary to Rowhammer-based attacks like DeepSteal~\cite{RakinDeepSteal2021} that leak partial weights but can be protected by TEE-based defenses. 
%assume partial black-box knowledge

%Particularly, after exiting high-latency states and before stabilizing to a steady state, the execution time becomes a data-dependent process. 
%This dependency arises because 

%Our reverse engineering suggests that Intel AMX has a separate clock from the CPU clock and skipping the zero values in the multiplication operands of the accelerator influence the trend of frequency adjustments by leading to less power consumption, creating exploitable and unique timing differences.
%
%We demonstrate the exploitation of this side-channel vulnerability, showing that the execution time of AMX multiplications can be systematically measured to infer the sparsity of hidden weights of a NN. In this first study,
%our practical example, 
We successfully leaked zeros in 64 hidden weights with 100\% accuracy within 50 minutes of observation without access to the NN output value, confidence score or shared cache bypassing state of the art defenses such as obfuscation, masking or rounding confidence values of NN and cache defenses.
% 
Our proof of concept (PoC) attack  (\textsc{Thor}) represents the first step toward a new direction in ML privacy attacks. It is an attack on a single-layer NN but its significance is that, unlike prior approaches that rely on {{confidence scores}}, logits,  physical access, or higher privilege, \textsc{Thor} leverages timing information alone to infer critical and private parameters like NN's weight sparsity patterns and distributions. 
%Thor is fast but is limited to a single layer NN.

This paper presents the following contributions:
\begin{compactitem}
\item It characterized and reverse-engineered the Intel AMX, 
% data-dependent timing 
uncovering 
%its unique exploitable properties of Intel AMX features
%\item It identifies 
a novel type of data-dependent timing side-channel vulnerability within the Intel AMX accelerator.

\item It demonstrates the techniques necessary to exploit this newly discovered timing side-channel for launching attacks on NNs. Specifically, it illustrates how to determine the sparsity of NN weights by measuring execution time.
We show that the \textsc{Thor} leakage rate is 631\% and 1,493\% higher than the maximum leakage rates in the Hertzbleed and Collide+Power~\cite{kogler2023collide+} attacks, respectively.
\item We discuss defenses, propose a counter-measurement and measure its overhead on power consumption (2.59\% to 12.33\%).

% However, no work has been done on security evaluation of Intel AMX.  

% \subsection{Intel AMX Architecture and Instructions.}
% Intel AMX is an integrated accelerator introduced with the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors, specifically engineered to boost the efficiency of matrix computations. %Figure~\ref{fig:AMX-arch} illustrates the Intel AMX architecture.

% AMX introduces a new set of registers and instructions. The registers in Intel AMX are known as Tiles, a new concept in Intel CPUs that provide a matrix of data registers, as opposed to the traditional vector registers seen in previous SIMD architectures like AVX-512. AMX includes 8 Tile registers, each capable of holding up to 16 rows with 64 bytes per row, amounting to a total of 1 KB per Tile. The number of rows and the number of bytes per row can be adjusted using the LDTILECFG instruction, and this configuration information is stored as metadata in a control register known as TILECFG. Once this configuration is set, AMX instructions such as load, store, and matrix multiplication will operate according to the specified dimensions for each Tile. Intel AMX instructions are synchronized with the Intel Architecture host (IA host) instruction stream, and the Tile loads and stores are coherent with the host memory \cite{Intel_Arc_Ins_Set_Extensions}.

% Tile Matrix Multiply unit (TMUL) serves as the accelerator engine for executing multiplication calculations. When using full-size Tile operands, the latency of the multiplication instruction is 52 cycles, while pipelining allows for a throughput of 16 cycles. Intel AMX supports two data types: BF16 and INT8. Consequently, it can perform 512 multiplications and 512 additions per cycle for BF16 and 1024 multiplications and 1024 additions per cycle for INT8 \cite{IntelOptRefManual}. 

\begin{comment}
AMX instructions utilize port 5 as their dedicated execution port. When two hyper-threads are active within a core, they compete for the same resources to execute AMX instructions.

This unit can potentially access or create frequencies that differ from the CPU frequency as shown as Transition Behavior of AMX Frequency to CPU Frequency in Warm State. 
% This finding is in contrast to the root cause known for AVX performance variation, known as power up/down~\cite{netspectre} which does not vary to match  the core frequency.

%\subsection{Non-speculative Value-based Vulnerability}

%\subsubsection{Value Dependency of Transition Time} \label{sec:valuedependencyofTransitionTime}
We studied the impact of operand sparsity on TMUL operations. % in Warm State.
%In our investigation of the TMUL execution time transition in the Warm State, we discovered an interesting effect involving zero values in the Tile operands during multiplication. 
By varying the number of zero values in the Tile operands during multiplication, we observed that increasing the number of zeros accelerates the 
AMX execution. 
%transition period. 
This effect is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Cumulative_execution_time}
%\ref{fig:Effect_of_zeros_on_transition}
, which presents three distinct distributions showing the sparsity levels of the operand: 100\% sparsity, 50\% sparsity, and 0\% sparsity. 
The results indicate that a greater sparsity of operands in the tile operands leads to faster 
execution of the TMUL. The program with 1,000 AMX multiplications averages 54,005 cycles when operands have 0\% sparsity. Increasing sparsity to 50\% and 100\% reduces the average execution time to 45,953 and 38,747 cycles, respectively. In this case, 50\% and 100\% more sparsity make the execution 17.5\% and 39.4\% faster, respectively.
%Consequently, the execution time of a program that utilizes AMX multiplications is closely associated with the sparsity of its input operands. In Figure \ref{fig:Cumulative_execution_time}, we demonstrate this relationship 
%by executing 
%three test programs with 100, 1000, and 10,000 AMX multiplications, each 
%with varying levels of tile operand sparsity (0\%, 50\%, and 100\%). Each scenario was executed 1,000 times to construct the histogram. Our results reveal that varying sparsity levels significantly impact the execution time of AMX multiplications, with increased sparsity leading to faster program execution.

This discovery uncovers a new value-dependent timing side channel that reveals the sparsity of Tile operands in Intel AMX. Our results suggest the presence of a zero-skipping-like mechanism for both BF16 and INT8 operands in Intel AMX design for acceleration and power saving purposes. 
%The energy consumption of the 0 matrix (100\% sparsity) is approximately \(6.45 \times 10^{-7}\) J, while the 255 matrix (0\% sparsity) consumes \(6.7 \times 10^{-7}\) J, resulting in a difference of \(0.25 \times 10^{-7}\) J. This represents a 3.88\% increase in energy consumption for the 0\% compared to the 100\% sparse weights. This observation shows a clear dependence of energy consumption on operand values.

\begin{comment}
Since the operand value timing dependence persists even with Turbo Boost disabled, we hypothesized that AMX operates under a separate clock and analyzed its performance to estimate its internal frequency. Our findings reveal that AMX transitions through intermediate frequencies before stabilizing to match the CPU frequency. For a CPU frequency of 1.2 GHz, AMX first stabilizes at 1 GHz before aligning with 1.2 GHz. Similarly, at a CPU frequency of 2 GHz, AMX transitions through 1 GHz and 1.3 GHz before reaching 2 GHz (see Figure~\ref{fig:Freq_transition}). These consistent transitions across tests strongly suggest that AMX operates under an independent clock, adjusting its frequency autonomously to match the CPU frequency. Interestingly the latency of this adjustment is also operand value dependent.

% New
Since the operand value timing dependence persists even with Turbo Boost disabled and the CPU frequency fixed, we hypothesized that AMX operates under a separate clock domain. To estimate its internal independent frequency (assuming there is one), we analyzed its performance and observed that the execution times initially fluctuate through intermediate levels before stabilizing. We measured the stabilized execution time of AMX multiplications at each available CPU frequency. By comparing these times, we found that interestingly the intermediate levels correspond precisely to some frequencies in our dataset. This suggests that AMX transitions through intermediate frequencies before stabilizing to match the CPU frequency. For example, at a fixed CPU frequency of 1.2 GHz, AMX stabilizes at 1 GHz before aligning with 1.2 GHz. Similarly, at a fixed CPU frequency of 2 GHz, AMX progresses through 1 GHz and 1.3 GHz before reaching 2 GHz (see Figure~\ref{fig:Freq_transition}). These consistent transitions across tests strongly suggest that AMX may operate under an independent clock, autonomously adjusting its frequency to match the CPU frequency. Interestingly, the latency of this adjustment also depends on operand values.


% However we noticed that there are only 13 available frequencies between 800 MHz and 2 GHz (800, 900, 1100, ... , 1900, and 2 GHz). All the levels before reaching the stabilized timing exactly match the speculated value for the Intel AMX clock frequency. If there was another underlying cause, we would have expected to see at least one value that is not present among these 13 timing measurements or a continuous transaction. However, in all of our experiments, we have never seen an intermediate level outside of these 13 values. Hence, a separate clock controlling the frequency is the most plausible conclusion.

% \subsection{{\textbf{\textsc{Thor} Building Blocks}}} 
% We showed that the execution time of the \texttt{TMUL} instruction exhibits a dependency on operand values (Figure~\ref{fig:Cumulative_execution_time}.
% %, particularly when the AMX multiplier transitions into its Warm State. 
% This dependency is most pronounced in the presence of zeros in the operands, allowing attackers to exploit this behavior to infer hidden neural network weights. 

\subsection{Attack Building Blocks}
The \textsc{Thor} attack begins with strategically crafted input vectors, where the adversary measures \texttt{TMUL} execution time under different operand conditions. Multiple measurements mitigate inherent noise, yielding a composite timing value. 
\begin{comment}
Comparing execution times for inputs with all zeros and all non-zeros establishes a differential threshold, guiding the selection of random input vectors for further analysis.
\end{comment}

% The execution times for two input vectors, the original \( W_s \) and its inverse \( W_r \), are compared. The vector with the longest execution time is selected if the difference exceeds \( Thr \). This selected vector, \( W_x \), is then used to update the scoring tables \( Score0 \) and \( Score1 \). For each element of \( W_x \), \( Score0[i] \) is incremented for 0 entries, and \( Score1[i] \) is incremented for 1 entries. Over time, these scores accumulate evidence about hidden weights.

\paragrabf{(1) Setting Threshold.}
By comparing execution times with inputs of full zeros and full non-zeros, we establish a differential threshold (\(Thr\)). This threshold enables the selective acceptance of randomly generated input vectors for scoring. The essence of the attack involves two key steps: (1) continuously generating random input vectors throughout the attack and (2) using the execution time associated with each vector to accumulate evidence that helps refine the estimates of the weight scores.
%
Suppose a weight element is non-zero; then, the execution time will be longer if the corresponding input element is non-zero compared to when it is zero. Conversely, if a weight element is zero, the execution time remains unchanged whether the corresponding input element is zero or not. Based on these assumptions, if a generated input vector has a higher number of correct non-zeros according to the unknown weights, it is more likely to be accepted by this algorithm, thereby impacting the scoring tables.



\paragrabf{(2) Execution Time Analysis and Vector Selection.}
\begin{comment}
The attacker measures the execution times for two scenarios: one for the randomly generated vector (\(W_s\)) and another for its inverted version (\(W_r\)) (in \(W_r\), all zeros in \(W_s\) are switched to non-zeros, and all non-zeros are changed to zeros). 
We predict that the vector holding more correct non-zeros according to the unknown weights will require a longer execution time.
If the difference in execution times exceeds the threshold, then either \(W_s\) or \(W_r\)‚Äîthe one which records the longer time will be selected (\(W_x\)) for updating the score vectors (\(ScoreZ\) and \(ScoreN\)). 
After selecting \(W_x\), a scoring method updates the score vectors according to \(W_x\) entries. This update involves iterating through each element of \(W_x\) from 0 to 63, incrementing the corresponding entry in \(ScoreZ\) by one if the element is zero and in \(ScoreN\) if the element is non-zero (see Figure~\ref{fig:ML_Scoring}).
\end{comment}
The attacker measures execution times for two scenarios: one for the randomly generated vector (\(W_s\)) and another for its inverted version (\(W_r\)) (in \(W_r\), all zeros in \(W_s\) become non-zeros, and all non-zeros become zeros). We predict that the vector holding more correct non-zeros according to the unknown weights will require a longer execution time. If the difference in execution times exceeds the threshold, either \(W_s\) or \(W_r\)‚Äîwhichever records the longer time‚Äîwill be selected (\(W_x\)) for updating score vectors (\(ScoreZ\) and \(ScoreN\)). After selecting \(W_x\), a scoring method updates the score vectors according to \(W_x\) entries. This involves iterating through each element of \(W_x\) from 0 to 63, incrementing the corresponding entry in \(ScoreZ\) by one if the element is zero and in \(ScoreN\) if the element is non-zero (see Figure~\ref{fig:ML_Scoring}).

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{images/ML_Scoring_new_v5.pdf}}
\caption{Scoring Update Process Diagram: \(ScoreZ\) and \(ScoreN\) increment based on \(W_x\) values.}
%For each index \(i\) from 0 to 63, if \(W_x[i] == 0\), \(ScoreZ[i]\) increases by one; otherwise, \(ScoreN[i]\) increases by one.}
\label{fig:ML_Scoring}
\end{figure}
\paragrabf{(3) Inferring Weights from Scoring Vectors.}
Following the attack period, the attacker analyzes the ScoreZ and ScoreN vectors%as illustrated in lines 25-31
. A weighted element marked as zero would be expected to yield similar scores in both \(ScoreZ\) and \(ScoreN\) vectors. However, for a weight element marked as non-zero, a higher score is expected in the \(ScoreN\) vector compared to the \(ScoreZ\).
%
By dividing each element of \(ScoreN\) by \(ScoreZ\), the attacker can infer the zero weights. If the ratio is close to 1, it suggests that the weight scores are equivalent; thus, the weight is likely zero. A ratio significantly above 1 indicates that the weight is likely non-zero.

Figure \ref{fig:thorleakage} shows \textsc{Thor} leakage rate of 76.8 bits/hour compared to other related side channels. While Platypus has a higher leakage rate, it is patched and unavailable to non-privileged users. While \textsc{Thor} does not require access to RAPL and is not limited to SGX, it exhibits a higher leakage rate compared to Hertzbleed and Collide+Power attacks.  
\textsc{Thor}'s leakage rate is {1,493\% faster than Collide+Power (MDS)} (76.8 vs. 4.82 bits/hour), and {631\% faster than Hertzbleed} (10.5 bits/hour), which exploits outdated libraries now replaced by more secure cryptographic implementations. Collide+Power attacks, which leveraged {Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)} and {Meltdown}, have been patched on modern Intel Xeon servers. Similarly, Platypus, which depends on the RAPL interface, is mitigated by restricting access to energy and power reporting. With these mitigations, \textsc{Thor} remains one of the few viable microarchitectural attack methods available to low-privilege attackers, posing a unique and unpatched threat to AI applications, even in environments where traditional microarchitecture side channels have been neutralized.

\subsection{Counter-measurement}
\begin{comment}
\textsc{Thor} relies only on precise \textit{timing} measurements. Therefore, it cannot be mitigated by defenses that alter the classification output of NNs, such as adding noise or rounding confidence scores \cite{Fredrikson2015ModelInversion}. 
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-based defenses, such as those performing non-linear computations inside the TEE while offloading linear computations to untrusted sources \cite{tram√®r2019slalomfastverifiableprivate}, are also inadequate since we confirmed that the value dependencies of Intel AMX timing that \textsc{Thor} relies on are unaffected by TEE environments like Intel SGX. 
AI workloads demand high speed and efficiency, prompting AI libraries to prioritize performance optimizations. As a result, known constant-time programming techniques are often unsuitable as a defense. For example, masking can help protect weights from leaking but introduces extra computational overhead, increasing both power consumption and execution time.

For example, masking can help protect weights from leaking but introduces extra computational overhead, increasing both power consumption and execution time.

A more effective strategy involves introducing response randomness by delaying execution, which disrupts the timing signals relied upon by \textsc{Thor}. However, this approach adds latency to AI applications. Limiting the query rate of the model 
could also slow these attacks, but at the cost of reducing system responsiveness.
Extending detection mechanisms, 
to identify malicious patterns in power and performance characteristics offers a promising defense against \textsc{Thor}.
Lastly, employing homomorphic encryption 
could provide robust protection but comes with substantial computational overhead and performance costs, making it less practical for high-speed AI applications.


%\subsection{Power \& Performance Overhead}
% In an experiment, we measured the time to execute a single AMX multiplication instruction while varying the intervals between consecutive executions. By adjusting the length of these intervals, we identified five distinct execution times, classifying them into performance states. The shortest execution time with the lowest intervals was labeled as the "Warm State," while the longer execution times with higher intervals were classified as "Cold States." 
One mitigation which can be applied through a micro-code update or a software patch is to keep the AMX unit moderately in the Warm State at all times or at least during Intel SGX execution to protect TEEs computation against \textsc{Thor}.
%
This approach is effective because we observed that timing differences dependent on zero values are only significantly measurable when the Intel AMX is in a Cold State. Warm and Cold States introduced here come from an interesting observation in which 
%In an experiment,

By adjusting the length of these intervals, we identified five distinct execution times, classifying them into performance states. The shortest execution time with the lowest intervals was labeled as the Warm State, while the longer execution times with higher intervals were classified as Cold States.  These performance states are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Performance_Stages}.
However, this mitigation comes with trade-offs in power management and execution speed, as system power limits could be more easily reached, leading to unnecessary throttling of the AMX unit. We measured the power overhead of such defense for \textsc{Thor} and found that depending on the cold vs. warm stage,  the overhead ranges from 2.59\% to 12.33\%. Although this secure design requires more power consumption, it is faster as it keeps the Intel AMX in the highest performance state at all time; this is in contrary to other secure designs for different microarchitectural attacks which almost always incurred a high performance overhead. 
%\textcolor{red}{Todo  quantitatively calculate the AMX latency in warm state over cold state and add numbers here saying how much faster approx.  }

%Although the secure design requires more power consumption, it could be faster in scenarios such as workloads with infrequent multiplications.
