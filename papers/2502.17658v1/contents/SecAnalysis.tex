\subsection{Success Rate Analysis}
After extensive experiments, the configurable parameters in Algorithm \ref{alg:alg1} were selected to the following values: \(N=10000\), \(M=40\), \(L=20\), \(K=3\), \(\alpha=0.9\), and \(\gamma=1.13\), which were effective in demonstrating the outcome. Prolonging the attack duration reduces noise in the scores and enhances the success rate of accurately determining the weights.

Figure \ref{fig:ML_SuccessRate} shows success rates increasing with longer attack durations, from 60\% at 5 minutes to a complete 100\% success rate at 50 minutes (0.02 bit/s) and beyond. Since cooling down the AMX is necessary for every timing measurement, over 99\% of the attack duration is consumed by cooling delays. Additionally, the results of the algorithm for two different attack durations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:LeakedWeights}.

\subsubsection{Frequency Scaling Analysis}

% \paragrabf{Potential Countermeasures.}
% Eliminating the cooldown state could defend against Thor but at a high power cost since Intel AMX is an energy-intensive accelerator designed for AI tasks. Keeping AMX continuously active would be power-prohibitive.

% Masking is a proven countermeasure for protecting AI model parameters against power side-channel attacks and could be adapted for future AMX versions despite the performance overhead. Additionally, machine learning models should incorporate techniques to detect unusual usage patterns, which can help identify and thwart attacks attempting to infer parameter values using methods similar to our AMX-type attack. One well-known countermeasure to these timing attacks is to coarsen the timer. By reducing the timer's precision, it becomes much harder for attackers to measure the subtle differences in execution times that they rely on for their exploits.

% In summary, while various countermeasures exist for different attack vectors, protecting against Thor on Intel AMX accelerators requires novel approaches to power and frequency management alongside traditional techniques.
