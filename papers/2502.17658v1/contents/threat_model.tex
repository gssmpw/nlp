The attacker and victim are two distinct processes running on the same server. These processes are entirely isolated in terms of address space and can be executed on different CPU cores. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Thor-threat-model}, the victim process is an API that runs a NN designed for specific tasks and utilizes Intel AMX for matrix computations. The attacker process, which operates as a non-privileged user, does not have direct access to the modelâ€™s parameters but interacts with the model via the inference API. The attacker sends crafted inputs to the inference API and measures the timing of the victim process's responses. By examining timing variations, the attacker can gain insights into the NN's internal parameters by taking advantage of the timing differences caused by Intel AMX computations. We assume cache defenses are deployed or there is no shared cache,  thus channels such as \cite{Yan2020Cachetelepathy} is not available to the adversary. The ML model is a single layer NN protected by obfuscated the confidence score and the output by methods such as adding noise or rounding confidence scores \cite{Fredrikson2015ModelInversion}. The victim may leverage TEEs, Intel SGX, to execute the NN computations within isolated enclaves.


% \textsc{Thor} exploits Intel AMX timing variations to infer sparsity patterns in neural network weights hosted on inference APIs. As a non-privileged attacker, it sends tailored inputs and measures response times, leveraging amplified timing differences in AMX Warm-State transitions to detect zero weights.
% % The attack works for both binary and non-binary weight patterns without requiring confidence scores, logits, or training data. It is adaptable to diverse environments, including cloud systems, MLaaS platforms, and SGX enclaves. By avoiding reliance on shared memory or privileged interfaces (for example, Flush + Reload, PlatyPus), and speculative or physical access attacks (for example, Specter, EM based methods), \textsc{Thor} offers a purely timing-based approach. Thor is limited to a single-layer neural network.
