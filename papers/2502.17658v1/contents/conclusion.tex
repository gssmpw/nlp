% This paper has exposed a new vulnerability inherent to the Intel AMX architecture. The proposed attack demonstrates how the value-dependent execution time of AMX multiplications can be leveraged to infer secret information, such as zero weights of neural networks.

% Future research must prioritize the development of innovative mechanisms to mitigate the proposed threat vector introduced by AMX and similar technologies. 
%Until then, the adoption of accelerators presents a significant escalation in the ongoing battle to secure computing systems and the sensitive data they process.
