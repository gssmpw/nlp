abstract = {Side-channel attacks pose serious threats to many security models, especially sandbox-based browsers. While transient-execution side channels in out-of-order processors have previously been blamed for vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown, we show that in fact, the capability of out-of-order execution itself to cause mayhem is far more general.  

We develop Hacky Racers, a new type of timing gadget that uses instruction-level parallelism, another key feature of out-of-order execution, to measure arbitrary fine-grained timing differences, even in the presence of highly restricted JavaScript sandbox environments. While such environments try to mitigate timing side channels by reducing timer precision and removing language features such as SharedArrayBuffer that can be used to indirectly generate timers via thread-level parallelism, no such restrictions can be designed to limit Hacky Racers. We also design versions of Hacky Racers that require no misspeculation whatsoever, demonstrating that transient execution is not the only threat to security from modern microarchitectural performance optimization.  

We use Hacky Racers to construct novel backwards-in-time Spectre gadgets, which break many hardware countermeasures in the literature by leaking secrets before misspeculation is discovered. We also use them to generate the first known last-level cache eviction set generator in JavaScript that does not require SharedArrayBuffer support.},

abstract = {Violating the Von Neumann sequential processing principle at the microarchitectural level is commonplace to reach high performing CPU hardware — violations are safe as long as software executes correctly at the architectural interface. Speculative execution attacks exploit these violations and queue up secret-dependent memory accesses allowed by long speculation windows due to the late detection of these violations in the pipeline. In this paper, we show that recent AMD and Intel CPUs speculate very early in their pipeline, even before they decode the current instruction. This mechanism enables new sources of speculation to be triggered from almost any instruction, enabling a new class of attacks that we refer to as Phantom. Unlike Spectre, Phantom speculation windows are short since the violations are detected early. Nonetheless, Phantom allows for transient fetch and transient decode on all recent x86-based microarchitectures, and transient execution on AMD Zen 1 and 2. We build a number of exploits using these new Phantom primitives and discuss why mitigating them is difficult in practice.},

% Please generate all citations with Google Scholar, leave the ID as it gives you, and put them in the Google Scholar section below following the alphabetical order of the ID. In the case that you can't find it on Scholar, then it's fine to use another source or make it manually, and put it in the "Others/Manual" section at the bottom (make sure to look through that section first to make sure the source you need isn't already there).
% This has become necessary as we had A LOT of duplicate entries, which was not only cluttering the log with warnings, but some of them had different IDs (which causes duplicate entries in the paper). Sifting through to get rid of duplicates takes a long time, so we're gonna need to keep it organized. Using the same source as much as possible and following a sorting order ensures that.
% I fixed all current citations to references whose ID changed, but I went by errors in the compile log so probably missed citations that were commented. I'll leave a table at the end of the file of which IDs changed to what just in case.

	abstract = {Forecasting AI progress is essential to reducing uncertainty in order to appropriately plan for research efforts on AI safety and AI governance. While this is generally considered to be an important topic, little work has been conducted on it and there is no published document that gives a balanced overview of the field. Moreover, the field is very diverse and there is no published consensus regarding its direction. This paper describes the development of a research agenda for forecasting AI progress which utilized the Delphi technique to elicit and aggregate experts' opinions on what questions and methods to prioritize. Experts indicated that a wide variety of methods should be considered for forecasting AI progress. Moreover, experts identified salient questions that were both general and completely unique to the problem of forecasting AI progress. Some of the highest priority topics include the validation of (partially unresolved) forecasts, how to make forecasts action-guiding, and the quality of different performance metrics. While statistical methods seem more promising, there is also recognition that supplementing judgmental techniques can be quite beneficial.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks pose serious threats to many security models, especially sandbox-based browsers. While transient-execution side channels in out-of-order processors have previously been blamed for vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown, we show that in fact, the capability of out-of-order execution itself to cause mayhem is far more general.  

We develop Hacky Racers, a new type of timing gadget that uses instruction-level parallelism, another key feature of out-of-order execution, to measure arbitrary fine-grained timing differences, even in the presence of highly restricted JavaScript sandbox environments. While such environments try to mitigate timing side channels by reducing timer precision and removing language features such as SharedArrayBuffer that can be used to indirectly generate timers via thread-level parallelism, no such restrictions can be designed to limit Hacky Racers. We also design versions of Hacky Racers that require no misspeculation whatsoever, demonstrating that transient execution is not the only threat to security from modern microarchitectural performance optimization.  

We use Hacky Racers to construct novel backwards-in-time Spectre gadgets, which break many hardware countermeasures in the literature by leaking secrets before misspeculation is discovered. We also use them to generate the first known last-level cache eviction set generator in JavaScript that does not require SharedArrayBuffer support.},

abstract = {Violating the Von Neumann sequential processing principle at the microarchitectural level is commonplace to reach high performing CPU hardware — violations are safe as long as software executes correctly at the architectural interface. Speculative execution attacks exploit these violations and queue up secret-dependent memory accesses allowed by long speculation windows due to the late detection of these violations in the pipeline. In this paper, we show that recent AMD and Intel CPUs speculate very early in their pipeline, even before they decode the current instruction. This mechanism enables new sources of speculation to be triggered from almost any instruction, enabling a new class of attacks that we refer to as Phantom. Unlike Spectre, Phantom speculation windows are short since the violations are detected early. Nonetheless, Phantom allows for transient fetch and transient decode on all recent x86-based microarchitectures, and transient execution on AMD Zen 1 and 2. We build a number of exploits using these new Phantom primitives and discuss why mitigating them is difficult in practice.},

%        IMPORTANT - READ THIS       %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Please generate all citations with Google Scholar, leave the ID as it gives you, and put them in the Google Scholar section below following the alphabetical order of the ID. In the case that you can't find it on Scholar, then it's fine to use another source or make it manually, and put it in the "Others/Manual" section at the bottom (make sure to look through that section first to make sure the source you need isn't already there).
% This has become necessary as we had A LOT of duplicate entries, which was not only cluttering the log with warnings, but some of them had different IDs (which causes duplicate entries in the paper). Sifting through to get rid of duplicates takes a long time, so we're gonna need to keep it organized. Using the same source as much as possible and following a sorting order ensures that.
% I fixed all current citations to references whose ID changed, but I went by errors in the compile log so probably missed citations that were commented. I'll leave a table at the end of the file of which IDs changed to what just in case.

@article{ForcastAI2019,
	abstract = {Forecasting AI progress is essential to reducing uncertainty in order to appropriately plan for research efforts on AI safety and AI governance. While this is generally considered to be an important topic, little work has been conducted on it and there is no published document that gives a balanced overview of the field. Moreover, the field is very diverse and there is no published consensus regarding its direction. This paper describes the development of a research agenda for forecasting AI progress which utilized the Delphi technique to elicit and aggregate experts' opinions on what questions and methods to prioritize. Experts indicated that a wide variety of methods should be considered for forecasting AI progress. Moreover, experts identified salient questions that were both general and completely unique to the problem of forecasting AI progress. Some of the highest priority topics include the validation of (partially unresolved) forecasts, how to make forecasts action-guiding, and the quality of different performance metrics. While statistical methods seem more promising, there is also recognition that supplementing judgmental techniques can be quite beneficial.},

abstract = {Recent security vulnerabilities that target speculative execution (e.g., Spectre) present a significant challenge for processor design. These highly publicized vulnerabilities use speculative execution to learn victim secrets by changing the cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has focused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in cache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant success in preventing Spectre and other attacks at modest performance costs. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show that prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block speculation-based attacks that use cache state. We make two key observations. First, mis-speculated younger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire instructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a memory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to other memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state. Using both of these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that secret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order of bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave secret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible speculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix. Speculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state changes, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We develop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete proof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We conclude with a discussion of security definitions that are sufficient to block the attacks, along with preliminary defense ideas based on those definitions.},

abstract = {Sharing memory pages between non-trusting processes is a common method of reducing the memory footprint of multi-tenanted systems. In this paper we demonstrate that, due to a weakness in the Intel X86 processors, page sharing exposes processes to information leaks. We present FLUSH+RELOAD, a cache side-channel attack technique that exploits this weakness to monitor access to memory lines in shared pages. Unlike previous cache side-channel attacks, FLUSH+RELOAD targets the Last-Level Cache (i.e. L3 on processors with three cache levels). Consequently, the attack program and the victim do not need to share the execution core.We demonstrate the efficacy of the FLUSH+RELOAD attack by using it to extract the private encryption keys from a victim program running GnuPG 1.4.13. We tested the attack both between two unrelated processes in a single operating system and between processes running in separate virtual machines. On average, the attack is able to recover 96.7\% of the bits of the secret key by observing a single signature or decryption round.},

abstract = {Compiler-based static vectorization is used widely to extract data-level parallelism from computation-intensive applications. Static vectorization is very effective in vectorizing traditional array-based applications. However, compilers’ inability to do accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis severely limits vectorization opportunities. HW/SW codesigned processors provide an excellent opportunity to optimize the applications at runtime. The availability of dynamic application behavior at runtime helps in capturing vectorization opportunities generally missed by the compilers.This article proposes to complement the static vectorization with a speculative dynamic vectorizer in an HW/SW codesigned processor. We present a speculative dynamic vectorization algorithm that speculatively reorders ambiguous memory references to uncover vectorization opportunities. The speculative reordering of memory instructions avoids the need for accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis. The hardware checks for any memory dependence violation due to speculative vectorization and takes corrective action in case of violation. Our experiments show that the combined (static + dynamic) vectorization approach provides a 2\texttimes{} performance benefit compared to the static GCC vectorization alone, for SPECFP2006. Furthermore, the speculative dynamic vectorizer is able to vectorize 48\% of the loops that ICC failed to vectorize due to conservative dependence analysis in the TSVC benchmark suite. Moreover, the dynamic vectorization scheme is as effective in vectorization of pointer-based applications as for the array-based ones, whereas compilers lose significant vectorization opportunities in pointer-based applications. Furthermore, we show that speculation is not only a luxury but also a necessity for runtime vectorization.},

abstract = {In the last 10 years, cache attacks on Intel x86 CPUs have gained increasing attention among the scientific community and powerful techniques to exploit cache side channels have been developed. However, modern smartphones use one or more multi-core ARM CPUs that have a different cache organization and instruction set than Intel x86 CPUs. So far, no cross-core cache attacks have been demonstrated on non-rooted Android smartphones. In this work, we demonstrate how to solve key challenges to perform the most powerful cross-core cache attacks Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, and Flush+Flush on non-rooted ARM-based devices without any privileges. Based on our techniques, we demonstrate covert channels that outperform state-of-the-art covert channels on Android by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we present attacks to monitor tap and swipe events as well as keystrokes, and even derive the lengths of words entered on the touchscreen. Eventually, we are the first to attack cryptographic primitives implemented in Java. Our attacks work across CPUs and can even monitor cache activity in the ARM TrustZone from the normal world. The techniques we present can be used to attack hundreds of millions of Android devices.},

Intel SGX is an Intel technology for application developers who are seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX makes such protections possible through the use of enclaves, which are protected areas of execution. Security critical application code can be put into an enclave by special instructions and is then hardware protected from attacks by other potentially malicious software. An enclave can therefore be shielded against attacks by untrusted application parts, by other applications, and also against attacks by a compromised operating system.},

This leakage reveals memory access patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization. Some of our methods require only the ability to trigger services that perform encryption or MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts nor ciphertexts, and works by merely monitoring the effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We discuss in detail several such attacks on AES, and experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux’s dm-crypt encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key can be recovered after just 800 writes to the partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we describe several countermeasures for mitigating such attacks.},

abstract = {Speculative execution attacks present an enormous security threat, capable of reading arbitrary program data under malicious speculation, and later exfiltrating that data over microarchitectural covert channels. Since these attacks first rely on being able to read arbitrary data (potential secrets), a conservative approach to defeat all attacks is to delay the execution of instructions that read those secrets, until those instructions become non-speculative.This paper's premise is that it is safe to execute and selectively forward the results of speculative instructions that read secrets, which improves performance, as long as we can prove that the forwarded results do not reach potential covert channels. We propose a comprehensive hardware protection based on this idea, called Speculative Taint Tracking (STT), capable of protecting all speculatively accessed data.Our work addresses two key challenges. First, to safely selectively forward secrets, we must understand what instruction(s) can form covert channels. We provide a comprehensive study of covert channels on speculative microarchitectures, and use this study to develop hardware mechanisms that block each class of channel. Along the way, we find new classes of covert channels related to implicit flow on speculative machines. Second, for performance, it is essential to disable protection on previously protected data, as soon as doing so is safe. We identify that the earliest time is when the instruction(s) producing the protected data become non-speculative, and design a novel microarchitecture for disabling protection at this moment.We provide an extensive formal analysis showing that STT enforces a novel form of non-interference, with respect to all speculatively accessed data. We further evaluate STT on 21 SPEC and 9 PARSEC workloads, and find it adds only 8.5\%/14.5\% overhead (depending on attack model) relative to an insecure machine, while reducing overhead by 4.7\texttimes{}/18.8\texttimes{} relative to a baseline secure scheme.},

abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are ubiquitous components used across the range of today's computing platforms, from phones and tablets, through personal computers, to high-end server class platforms. With the increasing importance of graphics and video workloads, recent processors are shipped with GPU devices that are integrated on the same chip. Integrated GPUs share some resources with the CPU and as a result, there is a potential for microarchitectural attacks from the GPU to the CPU or vice versa. We consider the potential for covert channel attacks that arise either from shared microarchitectural components (such as caches) or through shared contention domains (e.g., shared buses). We illustrate these two types of channels by developing two reliable covert channel attacks. The first covert channel uses the shared LLC cache in Intel's integrated GPU architectures. The second is a contention based channel targeting the ring bus connecting the CPU and GPU to the LLC. This is the first demonstrated microarchitectural attack crossing the component boundary (GPU to CPU or vice versa). Cross-component channels introduce a number of new challenges that we had to overcome since they occur across heterogeneous components that use different computation models and are interconnected using asymmetric memory hierarchies. We also exploit GPU parallelism to increase the bandwidth of the communication, even without relying on a common clock. The LLC based channel achieves a bandwidth of 120 kbps with a low error rate of 2\%, while the contention based channel delivers up to 400 kbps with a 0.8\% error rate. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept prime-and-probe side channel attack that probes the full LLC from the GPU.},

abstract = {This paper describes context-sensitive fencing (CSF), a microcode-level defense against multiple variants of Spectre. CSF leverages the ability to dynamically alter the decoding of the instruction stream, to seamlessly inject new micro-ops, including fences, only when dynamic conditions indicate they are needed. This enables the processor to protect against the attack, but with minimal impact on the efficacy of key performance features such as speculative execution. This research also examines several alternative fence implementations, and introduces three new types of fences which allow most dynamic reorderings of loads and stores, but in a way that prevents speculative accesses from changing visible cache state. These optimizations reduce the performance overhead of the defense mechanism, compared to state-of-the-art software-based fencing mechanisms by a factor of six.},

year = {2023},
volume = {},

pages = {468-484},
abstract = {Modern superscalar CPUs have multiple execution units that independently execute operations from the instruction stream. Previous work has shown that numerous side channels exist around these out-of-order execution pipelines, particularly for an attacker running on an SMT core.
In this paper, we present the SQUIP attack, the first side-channel attack on scheduler queues, which are critical for deciding the schedule of instructions to be executed in superscalar CPUs. Scheduler queues have not been explored as a side channel so far, as Intel CPUs only have a single scheduler queue, and contention thereof would be virtually the same as contention of the reorder buffer. However, the Apple M1, AMD Zen 2, and Zen 3 microarchitectures have separate scheduler queues per execution unit. We first reverse-engineer the behavior of the scheduler queues on these CPUs and show that they can be primed and probed. The SQUIP attack observes the occupancy level from within the same hardware core and across SMT threads. We evaluate the performance of the SQUIP attack in a covert channel, exfiltrating 0.89 Mbit/s from a co-located virtual machine at an error rate below 0.8 \%, and 2.70 Mbit/s from a co-located process at an error rate below 0.8 \%. We then demonstrate the side channel on an mbedTLS RSA signature process in a co-located process and in a co-located virtual machine. Our attack recovers full RSA-4096 keys with only 50 500 traces and less than 5 to 18 bit errors on average. Finally, we discuss mitigations necessary, especially for Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems, to prevent our attacks.},

abstract="By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed Diffie-Hellman exponents, factor RSA keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext. Actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements. Techniques for preventing the attack for RSA and Diffie-Hellman are presented. Some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevent timing attacks.",

abstract = {A convolutional neural network (CNN) model represents a crucial piece of intellectual
property in many applications. Revealing its structure or weights would leak confidential
information. In this paper we present novel reverse-engineering attacks on CNNs running
on a hardware accelerator, where an adversary can feed inputs to the accelerator and
observe the resulting off-chip memory accesses. Our study shows that even with data
encryption, the adversary can infer the underlying network structure by exploiting
the memory and timing side-channels. We further identify the information leakage on
the values of weights when a CNN accelerator performs dynamic zero pruning for off-chip
memory accesses. Overall, this work reveals the importance of hiding off-chip memory
access pattern to truly protect confidential CNN models.},

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses.We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks pose serious threats to many security models, especially sandbox-based browsers. While transient-execution side channels in out-of-order processors have previously been blamed for vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown, we show that in fact, the capability of out-of-order execution itself to cause mayhem is far more general.  

We develop Hacky Racers, a new type of timing gadget that uses instruction-level parallelism, another key feature of out-of-order execution, to measure arbitrary fine-grained timing differences, even in the presence of highly restricted JavaScript sandbox environments. While such environments try to mitigate timing side channels by reducing timer precision and removing language features such as SharedArrayBuffer that can be used to indirectly generate timers via thread-level parallelism, no such restrictions can be designed to limit Hacky Racers. We also design versions of Hacky Racers that require no misspeculation whatsoever, demonstrating that transient execution is not the only threat to security from modern microarchitectural performance optimization.  

We use Hacky Racers to construct novel backwards-in-time Spectre gadgets, which break many hardware countermeasures in the literature by leaking secrets before misspeculation is discovered. We also use them to generate the first known last-level cache eviction set generator in JavaScript that does not require SharedArrayBuffer support.},

abstract = {Violating the Von Neumann sequential processing principle at the microarchitectural level is commonplace to reach high performing CPU hardware — violations are safe as long as software executes correctly at the architectural interface. Speculative execution attacks exploit these violations and queue up secret-dependent memory accesses allowed by long speculation windows due to the late detection of these violations in the pipeline. In this paper, we show that recent AMD and Intel CPUs speculate very early in their pipeline, even before they decode the current instruction. This mechanism enables new sources of speculation to be triggered from almost any instruction, enabling a new class of attacks that we refer to as Phantom. Unlike Spectre, Phantom speculation windows are short since the violations are detected early. Nonetheless, Phantom allows for transient fetch and transient decode on all recent x86-based microarchitectures, and transient execution on AMD Zen 1 and 2. We build a number of exploits using these new Phantom primitives and discuss why mitigating them is difficult in practice.},

% Please generate all citations with Google Scholar, leave the ID as it gives you, and put them in the Google Scholar section below following the alphabetical order of the ID. In the case that you can't find it on Scholar, then it's fine to use another source or make it manually, and put it in the "Others/Manual" section at the bottom (make sure to look through that section first to make sure the source you need isn't already there).
% This has become necessary as we had A LOT of duplicate entries, which was not only cluttering the log with warnings, but some of them had different IDs (which causes duplicate entries in the paper). Sifting through to get rid of duplicates takes a long time, so we're gonna need to keep it organized. Using the same source as much as possible and following a sorting order ensures that.
% I fixed all current citations to references whose ID changed, but I went by errors in the compile log so probably missed citations that were commented. I'll leave a table at the end of the file of which IDs changed to what just in case.

	abstract = {Forecasting AI progress is essential to reducing uncertainty in order to appropriately plan for research efforts on AI safety and AI governance. While this is generally considered to be an important topic, little work has been conducted on it and there is no published document that gives a balanced overview of the field. Moreover, the field is very diverse and there is no published consensus regarding its direction. This paper describes the development of a research agenda for forecasting AI progress which utilized the Delphi technique to elicit and aggregate experts' opinions on what questions and methods to prioritize. Experts indicated that a wide variety of methods should be considered for forecasting AI progress. Moreover, experts identified salient questions that were both general and completely unique to the problem of forecasting AI progress. Some of the highest priority topics include the validation of (partially unresolved) forecasts, how to make forecasts action-guiding, and the quality of different performance metrics. While statistical methods seem more promising, there is also recognition that supplementing judgmental techniques can be quite beneficial.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks pose serious threats to many security models, especially sandbox-based browsers. While transient-execution side channels in out-of-order processors have previously been blamed for vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown, we show that in fact, the capability of out-of-order execution itself to cause mayhem is far more general.  

We develop Hacky Racers, a new type of timing gadget that uses instruction-level parallelism, another key feature of out-of-order execution, to measure arbitrary fine-grained timing differences, even in the presence of highly restricted JavaScript sandbox environments. While such environments try to mitigate timing side channels by reducing timer precision and removing language features such as SharedArrayBuffer that can be used to indirectly generate timers via thread-level parallelism, no such restrictions can be designed to limit Hacky Racers. We also design versions of Hacky Racers that require no misspeculation whatsoever, demonstrating that transient execution is not the only threat to security from modern microarchitectural performance optimization.  

We use Hacky Racers to construct novel backwards-in-time Spectre gadgets, which break many hardware countermeasures in the literature by leaking secrets before misspeculation is discovered. We also use them to generate the first known last-level cache eviction set generator in JavaScript that does not require SharedArrayBuffer support.},

abstract = {Violating the Von Neumann sequential processing principle at the microarchitectural level is commonplace to reach high performing CPU hardware — violations are safe as long as software executes correctly at the architectural interface. Speculative execution attacks exploit these violations and queue up secret-dependent memory accesses allowed by long speculation windows due to the late detection of these violations in the pipeline. In this paper, we show that recent AMD and Intel CPUs speculate very early in their pipeline, even before they decode the current instruction. This mechanism enables new sources of speculation to be triggered from almost any instruction, enabling a new class of attacks that we refer to as Phantom. Unlike Spectre, Phantom speculation windows are short since the violations are detected early. Nonetheless, Phantom allows for transient fetch and transient decode on all recent x86-based microarchitectures, and transient execution on AMD Zen 1 and 2. We build a number of exploits using these new Phantom primitives and discuss why mitigating them is difficult in practice.},

%        IMPORTANT - READ THIS       %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Please generate all citations with Google Scholar, leave the ID as it gives you, and put them in the Google Scholar section below following the alphabetical order of the ID. In the case that you can't find it on Scholar, then it's fine to use another source or make it manually, and put it in the "Others/Manual" section at the bottom (make sure to look through that section first to make sure the source you need isn't already there).
% This has become necessary as we had A LOT of duplicate entries, which was not only cluttering the log with warnings, but some of them had different IDs (which causes duplicate entries in the paper). Sifting through to get rid of duplicates takes a long time, so we're gonna need to keep it organized. Using the same source as much as possible and following a sorting order ensures that.
% I fixed all current citations to references whose ID changed, but I went by errors in the compile log so probably missed citations that were commented. I'll leave a table at the end of the file of which IDs changed to what just in case.

@article{ForcastAI2019,
	abstract = {Forecasting AI progress is essential to reducing uncertainty in order to appropriately plan for research efforts on AI safety and AI governance. While this is generally considered to be an important topic, little work has been conducted on it and there is no published document that gives a balanced overview of the field. Moreover, the field is very diverse and there is no published consensus regarding its direction. This paper describes the development of a research agenda for forecasting AI progress which utilized the Delphi technique to elicit and aggregate experts' opinions on what questions and methods to prioritize. Experts indicated that a wide variety of methods should be considered for forecasting AI progress. Moreover, experts identified salient questions that were both general and completely unique to the problem of forecasting AI progress. Some of the highest priority topics include the validation of (partially unresolved) forecasts, how to make forecasts action-guiding, and the quality of different performance metrics. While statistical methods seem more promising, there is also recognition that supplementing judgmental techniques can be quite beneficial.},

abstract = {Recent security vulnerabilities that target speculative execution (e.g., Spectre) present a significant challenge for processor design. These highly publicized vulnerabilities use speculative execution to learn victim secrets by changing the cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has focused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in cache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant success in preventing Spectre and other attacks at modest performance costs. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show that prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block speculation-based attacks that use cache state. We make two key observations. First, mis-speculated younger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire instructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a memory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to other memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state. Using both of these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that secret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order of bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave secret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible speculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix. Speculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state changes, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We develop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete proof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We conclude with a discussion of security definitions that are sufficient to block the attacks, along with preliminary defense ideas based on those definitions.},

abstract = {Sharing memory pages between non-trusting processes is a common method of reducing the memory footprint of multi-tenanted systems. In this paper we demonstrate that, due to a weakness in the Intel X86 processors, page sharing exposes processes to information leaks. We present FLUSH+RELOAD, a cache side-channel attack technique that exploits this weakness to monitor access to memory lines in shared pages. Unlike previous cache side-channel attacks, FLUSH+RELOAD targets the Last-Level Cache (i.e. L3 on processors with three cache levels). Consequently, the attack program and the victim do not need to share the execution core.We demonstrate the efficacy of the FLUSH+RELOAD attack by using it to extract the private encryption keys from a victim program running GnuPG 1.4.13. We tested the attack both between two unrelated processes in a single operating system and between processes running in separate virtual machines. On average, the attack is able to recover 96.7\% of the bits of the secret key by observing a single signature or decryption round.},

abstract = {Compiler-based static vectorization is used widely to extract data-level parallelism from computation-intensive applications. Static vectorization is very effective in vectorizing traditional array-based applications. However, compilers’ inability to do accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis severely limits vectorization opportunities. HW/SW codesigned processors provide an excellent opportunity to optimize the applications at runtime. The availability of dynamic application behavior at runtime helps in capturing vectorization opportunities generally missed by the compilers.This article proposes to complement the static vectorization with a speculative dynamic vectorizer in an HW/SW codesigned processor. We present a speculative dynamic vectorization algorithm that speculatively reorders ambiguous memory references to uncover vectorization opportunities. The speculative reordering of memory instructions avoids the need for accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis. The hardware checks for any memory dependence violation due to speculative vectorization and takes corrective action in case of violation. Our experiments show that the combined (static + dynamic) vectorization approach provides a 2\texttimes{} performance benefit compared to the static GCC vectorization alone, for SPECFP2006. Furthermore, the speculative dynamic vectorizer is able to vectorize 48\% of the loops that ICC failed to vectorize due to conservative dependence analysis in the TSVC benchmark suite. Moreover, the dynamic vectorization scheme is as effective in vectorization of pointer-based applications as for the array-based ones, whereas compilers lose significant vectorization opportunities in pointer-based applications. Furthermore, we show that speculation is not only a luxury but also a necessity for runtime vectorization.},

abstract = {In the last 10 years, cache attacks on Intel x86 CPUs have gained increasing attention among the scientific community and powerful techniques to exploit cache side channels have been developed. However, modern smartphones use one or more multi-core ARM CPUs that have a different cache organization and instruction set than Intel x86 CPUs. So far, no cross-core cache attacks have been demonstrated on non-rooted Android smartphones. In this work, we demonstrate how to solve key challenges to perform the most powerful cross-core cache attacks Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, and Flush+Flush on non-rooted ARM-based devices without any privileges. Based on our techniques, we demonstrate covert channels that outperform state-of-the-art covert channels on Android by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we present attacks to monitor tap and swipe events as well as keystrokes, and even derive the lengths of words entered on the touchscreen. Eventually, we are the first to attack cryptographic primitives implemented in Java. Our attacks work across CPUs and can even monitor cache activity in the ARM TrustZone from the normal world. The techniques we present can be used to attack hundreds of millions of Android devices.},

Intel SGX is an Intel technology for application developers who are seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX makes such protections possible through the use of enclaves, which are protected areas of execution. Security critical application code can be put into an enclave by special instructions and is then hardware protected from attacks by other potentially malicious software. An enclave can therefore be shielded against attacks by untrusted application parts, by other applications, and also against attacks by a compromised operating system.},

This leakage reveals memory access patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization. Some of our methods require only the ability to trigger services that perform encryption or MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts nor ciphertexts, and works by merely monitoring the effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We discuss in detail several such attacks on AES, and experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux’s dm-crypt encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key can be recovered after just 800 writes to the partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we describe several countermeasures for mitigating such attacks.},

abstract = {Speculative execution attacks present an enormous security threat, capable of reading arbitrary program data under malicious speculation, and later exfiltrating that data over microarchitectural covert channels. Since these attacks first rely on being able to read arbitrary data (potential secrets), a conservative approach to defeat all attacks is to delay the execution of instructions that read those secrets, until those instructions become non-speculative.This paper's premise is that it is safe to execute and selectively forward the results of speculative instructions that read secrets, which improves performance, as long as we can prove that the forwarded results do not reach potential covert channels. We propose a comprehensive hardware protection based on this idea, called Speculative Taint Tracking (STT), capable of protecting all speculatively accessed data.Our work addresses two key challenges. First, to safely selectively forward secrets, we must understand what instruction(s) can form covert channels. We provide a comprehensive study of covert channels on speculative microarchitectures, and use this study to develop hardware mechanisms that block each class of channel. Along the way, we find new classes of covert channels related to implicit flow on speculative machines. Second, for performance, it is essential to disable protection on previously protected data, as soon as doing so is safe. We identify that the earliest time is when the instruction(s) producing the protected data become non-speculative, and design a novel microarchitecture for disabling protection at this moment.We provide an extensive formal analysis showing that STT enforces a novel form of non-interference, with respect to all speculatively accessed data. We further evaluate STT on 21 SPEC and 9 PARSEC workloads, and find it adds only 8.5\%/14.5\% overhead (depending on attack model) relative to an insecure machine, while reducing overhead by 4.7\texttimes{}/18.8\texttimes{} relative to a baseline secure scheme.},

abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are ubiquitous components used across the range of today's computing platforms, from phones and tablets, through personal computers, to high-end server class platforms. With the increasing importance of graphics and video workloads, recent processors are shipped with GPU devices that are integrated on the same chip. Integrated GPUs share some resources with the CPU and as a result, there is a potential for microarchitectural attacks from the GPU to the CPU or vice versa. We consider the potential for covert channel attacks that arise either from shared microarchitectural components (such as caches) or through shared contention domains (e.g., shared buses). We illustrate these two types of channels by developing two reliable covert channel attacks. The first covert channel uses the shared LLC cache in Intel's integrated GPU architectures. The second is a contention based channel targeting the ring bus connecting the CPU and GPU to the LLC. This is the first demonstrated microarchitectural attack crossing the component boundary (GPU to CPU or vice versa). Cross-component channels introduce a number of new challenges that we had to overcome since they occur across heterogeneous components that use different computation models and are interconnected using asymmetric memory hierarchies. We also exploit GPU parallelism to increase the bandwidth of the communication, even without relying on a common clock. The LLC based channel achieves a bandwidth of 120 kbps with a low error rate of 2\%, while the contention based channel delivers up to 400 kbps with a 0.8\% error rate. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept prime-and-probe side channel attack that probes the full LLC from the GPU.},

abstract = {This paper describes context-sensitive fencing (CSF), a microcode-level defense against multiple variants of Spectre. CSF leverages the ability to dynamically alter the decoding of the instruction stream, to seamlessly inject new micro-ops, including fences, only when dynamic conditions indicate they are needed. This enables the processor to protect against the attack, but with minimal impact on the efficacy of key performance features such as speculative execution. This research also examines several alternative fence implementations, and introduces three new types of fences which allow most dynamic reorderings of loads and stores, but in a way that prevents speculative accesses from changing visible cache state. These optimizations reduce the performance overhead of the defense mechanism, compared to state-of-the-art software-based fencing mechanisms by a factor of six.},

year = {2023},
volume = {},
issn = {},
pages = {468-484},
abstract = {Modern superscalar CPUs have multiple execution units that independently execute operations from the instruction stream. Previous work has shown that numerous side channels exist around these out-of-order execution pipelines, particularly for an attacker running on an SMT core.
In this paper, we present the SQUIP attack, the first side-channel attack on scheduler queues, which are critical for deciding the schedule of instructions to be executed in superscalar CPUs. Scheduler queues have not been explored as a side channel so far, as Intel CPUs only have a single scheduler queue, and contention thereof would be virtually the same as contention of the reorder buffer. However, the Apple M1, AMD Zen 2, and Zen 3 microarchitectures have separate scheduler queues per execution unit. We first reverse-engineer the behavior of the scheduler queues on these CPUs and show that they can be primed and probed. The SQUIP attack observes the occupancy level from within the same hardware core and across SMT threads. We evaluate the performance of the SQUIP attack in a covert channel, exfiltrating 0.89 Mbit/s from a co-located virtual machine at an error rate below 0.8 \%, and 2.70 Mbit/s from a co-located process at an error rate below 0.8 \%. We then demonstrate the side channel on an mbedTLS RSA signature process in a co-located process and in a co-located virtual machine. Our attack recovers full RSA-4096 keys with only 50 500 traces and less than 5 to 18 bit errors on average. Finally, we discuss mitigations necessary, especially for Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems, to prevent our attacks.},

abstract="By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed Diffie-Hellman exponents, factor RSA keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext. Actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements. Techniques for preventing the attack for RSA and Diffie-Hellman are presented. Some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevent timing attacks.",

abstract = {A convolutional neural network (CNN) model represents a crucial piece of intellectual
property in many applications. Revealing its structure or weights would leak confidential
information. In this paper we present novel reverse-engineering attacks on CNNs running
on a hardware accelerator, where an adversary can feed inputs to the accelerator and
observe the resulting off-chip memory accesses. Our study shows that even with data
encryption, the adversary can infer the underlying network structure by exploiting
the memory and timing side-channels. We further identify the information leakage on
the values of weights when a CNN accelerator performs dynamic zero pruning for off-chip
memory accesses. Overall, this work reveals the importance of hiding off-chip memory
access pattern to truly protect confidential CNN models.},

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses.We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks pose serious threats to many security models, especially sandbox-based browsers. While transient-execution side channels in out-of-order processors have previously been blamed for vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown, we show that in fact, the capability of out-of-order execution itself to cause mayhem is far more general.  

We develop Hacky Racers, a new type of timing gadget that uses instruction-level parallelism, another key feature of out-of-order execution, to measure arbitrary fine-grained timing differences, even in the presence of highly restricted JavaScript sandbox environments. While such environments try to mitigate timing side channels by reducing timer precision and removing language features such as SharedArrayBuffer that can be used to indirectly generate timers via thread-level parallelism, no such restrictions can be designed to limit Hacky Racers. We also design versions of Hacky Racers that require no misspeculation whatsoever, demonstrating that transient execution is not the only threat to security from modern microarchitectural performance optimization.  

We use Hacky Racers to construct novel backwards-in-time Spectre gadgets, which break many hardware countermeasures in the literature by leaking secrets before misspeculation is discovered. We also use them to generate the first known last-level cache eviction set generator in JavaScript that does not require SharedArrayBuffer support.},

abstract = {Violating the Von Neumann sequential processing principle at the microarchitectural level is commonplace to reach high performing CPU hardware — violations are safe as long as software executes correctly at the architectural interface. Speculative execution attacks exploit these violations and queue up secret-dependent memory accesses allowed by long speculation windows due to the late detection of these violations in the pipeline. In this paper, we show that recent AMD and Intel CPUs speculate very early in their pipeline, even before they decode the current instruction. This mechanism enables new sources of speculation to be triggered from almost any instruction, enabling a new class of attacks that we refer to as Phantom. Unlike Spectre, Phantom speculation windows are short since the violations are detected early. Nonetheless, Phantom allows for transient fetch and transient decode on all recent x86-based microarchitectures, and transient execution on AMD Zen 1 and 2. We build a number of exploits using these new Phantom primitives and discuss why mitigating them is difficult in practice.},

%%%%%%%%%%[ FILE STRUCTURE ]%%%%%%%%%%
%        IMPORTANT - READ THIS       %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Please generate all citations with Google Scholar, leave the ID as it gives you, and put them in the Google Scholar section below following the alphabetical order of the ID. In the case that you can't find it on Scholar, then it's fine to use another source or make it manually, and put it in the "Others/Manual" section at the bottom (make sure to look through that section first to make sure the source you need isn't already there).
% This has become necessary as we had A LOT of duplicate entries, which was not only cluttering the log with warnings, but some of them had different IDs (which causes duplicate entries in the paper). Sifting through to get rid of duplicates takes a long time, so we're gonna need to keep it organized. Using the same source as much as possible and following a sorting order ensures that.
% I fixed all current citations to references whose ID changed, but I went by errors in the compile log so probably missed citations that were commented. I'll leave a table at the end of the file of which IDs changed to what just in case.

@article{ForcastAI2019,
	abstract = {Forecasting AI progress is essential to reducing uncertainty in order to appropriately plan for research efforts on AI safety and AI governance. While this is generally considered to be an important topic, little work has been conducted on it and there is no published document that gives a balanced overview of the field. Moreover, the field is very diverse and there is no published consensus regarding its direction. This paper describes the development of a research agenda for forecasting AI progress which utilized the Delphi technique to elicit and aggregate experts' opinions on what questions and methods to prioritize. Experts indicated that a wide variety of methods should be considered for forecasting AI progress. Moreover, experts identified salient questions that were both general and completely unique to the problem of forecasting AI progress. Some of the highest priority topics include the validation of (partially unresolved) forecasts, how to make forecasts action-guiding, and the quality of different performance metrics. While statistical methods seem more promising, there is also recognition that supplementing judgmental techniques can be quite beneficial.},

abstract = {Recent security vulnerabilities that target speculative execution (e.g., Spectre) present a significant challenge for processor design. These highly publicized vulnerabilities use speculative execution to learn victim secrets by changing the cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has focused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in cache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant success in preventing Spectre and other attacks at modest performance costs. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show that prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block speculation-based attacks that use cache state. We make two key observations. First, mis-speculated younger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire instructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a memory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to other memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state. Using both of these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that secret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order of bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave secret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible speculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix. Speculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state changes, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We develop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete proof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We conclude with a discussion of security definitions that are sufficient to block the attacks, along with preliminary defense ideas based on those definitions.},

abstract = {Sharing memory pages between non-trusting processes is a common method of reducing the memory footprint of multi-tenanted systems. In this paper we demonstrate that, due to a weakness in the Intel X86 processors, page sharing exposes processes to information leaks. We present FLUSH+RELOAD, a cache side-channel attack technique that exploits this weakness to monitor access to memory lines in shared pages. Unlike previous cache side-channel attacks, FLUSH+RELOAD targets the Last-Level Cache (i.e. L3 on processors with three cache levels). Consequently, the attack program and the victim do not need to share the execution core.We demonstrate the efficacy of the FLUSH+RELOAD attack by using it to extract the private encryption keys from a victim program running GnuPG 1.4.13. We tested the attack both between two unrelated processes in a single operating system and between processes running in separate virtual machines. On average, the attack is able to recover 96.7\% of the bits of the secret key by observing a single signature or decryption round.},

abstract = {Compiler-based static vectorization is used widely to extract data-level parallelism from computation-intensive applications. Static vectorization is very effective in vectorizing traditional array-based applications. However, compilers’ inability to do accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis severely limits vectorization opportunities. HW/SW codesigned processors provide an excellent opportunity to optimize the applications at runtime. The availability of dynamic application behavior at runtime helps in capturing vectorization opportunities generally missed by the compilers.This article proposes to complement the static vectorization with a speculative dynamic vectorizer in an HW/SW codesigned processor. We present a speculative dynamic vectorization algorithm that speculatively reorders ambiguous memory references to uncover vectorization opportunities. The speculative reordering of memory instructions avoids the need for accurate interprocedural pointer disambiguation and interprocedural array dependence analysis. The hardware checks for any memory dependence violation due to speculative vectorization and takes corrective action in case of violation. Our experiments show that the combined (static + dynamic) vectorization approach provides a 2\texttimes{} performance benefit compared to the static GCC vectorization alone, for SPECFP2006. Furthermore, the speculative dynamic vectorizer is able to vectorize 48\% of the loops that ICC failed to vectorize due to conservative dependence analysis in the TSVC benchmark suite. Moreover, the dynamic vectorization scheme is as effective in vectorization of pointer-based applications as for the array-based ones, whereas compilers lose significant vectorization opportunities in pointer-based applications. Furthermore, we show that speculation is not only a luxury but also a necessity for runtime vectorization.},

abstract = {In the last 10 years, cache attacks on Intel x86 CPUs have gained increasing attention among the scientific community and powerful techniques to exploit cache side channels have been developed. However, modern smartphones use one or more multi-core ARM CPUs that have a different cache organization and instruction set than Intel x86 CPUs. So far, no cross-core cache attacks have been demonstrated on non-rooted Android smartphones. In this work, we demonstrate how to solve key challenges to perform the most powerful cross-core cache attacks Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, and Flush+Flush on non-rooted ARM-based devices without any privileges. Based on our techniques, we demonstrate covert channels that outperform state-of-the-art covert channels on Android by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we present attacks to monitor tap and swipe events as well as keystrokes, and even derive the lengths of words entered on the touchscreen. Eventually, we are the first to attack cryptographic primitives implemented in Java. Our attacks work across CPUs and can even monitor cache activity in the ARM TrustZone from the normal world. The techniques we present can be used to attack hundreds of millions of Android devices.},

This presentation will survey the recently announced Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) as well as innovative usages for building secure systems using security-enhanced hardware. Intel SGX is an Intel technology for application developers who are seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX makes such protections possible through the use of enclaves, which are protected areas of execution. Security critical application code can be put into an enclave by special instructions and is then hardware protected from attacks by other potentially malicious software. An enclave can therefore be shielded against attacks by untrusted application parts, by other applications, and also against attacks by a compromised operating system.},

abstract = {We describe several software side-channel attacks based on inter-process leakage through the state of the CPU’s memory cache. This leakage reveals memory access patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization. Some of our methods require only the ability to trigger services that perform encryption or MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts nor ciphertexts, and works by merely monitoring the effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We discuss in detail several such attacks on AES, and experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux’s dm-crypt encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key can be recovered after just 800 writes to the partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we describe several countermeasures for mitigating such attacks.},

abstract = {Speculative execution attacks present an enormous security threat, capable of reading arbitrary program data under malicious speculation, and later exfiltrating that data over microarchitectural covert channels. Since these attacks first rely on being able to read arbitrary data (potential secrets), a conservative approach to defeat all attacks is to delay the execution of instructions that read those secrets, until those instructions become non-speculative.This paper's premise is that it is safe to execute and selectively forward the results of speculative instructions that read secrets, which improves performance, as long as we can prove that the forwarded results do not reach potential covert channels. We propose a comprehensive hardware protection based on this idea, called Speculative Taint Tracking (STT), capable of protecting all speculatively accessed data.Our work addresses two key challenges. First, to safely selectively forward secrets, we must understand what instruction(s) can form covert channels. We provide a comprehensive study of covert channels on speculative microarchitectures, and use this study to develop hardware mechanisms that block each class of channel. Along the way, we find new classes of covert channels related to implicit flow on speculative machines. Second, for performance, it is essential to disable protection on previously protected data, as soon as doing so is safe. We identify that the earliest time is when the instruction(s) producing the protected data become non-speculative, and design a novel microarchitecture for disabling protection at this moment.We provide an extensive formal analysis showing that STT enforces a novel form of non-interference, with respect to all speculatively accessed data. We further evaluate STT on 21 SPEC and 9 PARSEC workloads, and find it adds only 8.5\%/14.5\% overhead (depending on attack model) relative to an insecure machine, while reducing overhead by 4.7\texttimes{}/18.8\texttimes{} relative to a baseline secure scheme.},

abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are ubiquitous components used across the range of today's computing platforms, from phones and tablets, through personal computers, to high-end server class platforms. With the increasing importance of graphics and video workloads, recent processors are shipped with GPU devices that are integrated on the same chip. Integrated GPUs share some resources with the CPU and as a result, there is a potential for microarchitectural attacks from the GPU to the CPU or vice versa. We consider the potential for covert channel attacks that arise either from shared microarchitectural components (such as caches) or through shared contention domains (e.g., shared buses). We illustrate these two types of channels by developing two reliable covert channel attacks. The first covert channel uses the shared LLC cache in Intel's integrated GPU architectures. The second is a contention based channel targeting the ring bus connecting the CPU and GPU to the LLC. This is the first demonstrated microarchitectural attack crossing the component boundary (GPU to CPU or vice versa). Cross-component channels introduce a number of new challenges that we had to overcome since they occur across heterogeneous components that use different computation models and are interconnected using asymmetric memory hierarchies. We also exploit GPU parallelism to increase the bandwidth of the communication, even without relying on a common clock. The LLC based channel achieves a bandwidth of 120 kbps with a low error rate of 2\%, while the contention based channel delivers up to 400 kbps with a 0.8\% error rate. We also demonstrate a proof-of-concept prime-and-probe side channel attack that probes the full LLC from the GPU.},

abstract = {This paper describes context-sensitive fencing (CSF), a microcode-level defense against multiple variants of Spectre. CSF leverages the ability to dynamically alter the decoding of the instruction stream, to seamlessly inject new micro-ops, including fences, only when dynamic conditions indicate they are needed. This enables the processor to protect against the attack, but with minimal impact on the efficacy of key performance features such as speculative execution. This research also examines several alternative fence implementations, and introduces three new types of fences which allow most dynamic reorderings of loads and stores, but in a way that prevents speculative accesses from changing visible cache state. These optimizations reduce the performance overhead of the defense mechanism, compared to state-of-the-art software-based fencing mechanisms by a factor of six.},

pages = {468-484},
abstract = {Modern superscalar CPUs have multiple execution units that independently execute operations from the instruction stream. Previous work has shown that numerous side channels exist around these out-of-order execution pipelines, particularly for an attacker running on an SMT core.
In this paper, we present the SQUIP attack, the first side-channel attack on scheduler queues, which are critical for deciding the schedule of instructions to be executed in superscalar CPUs. Scheduler queues have not been explored as a side channel so far, as Intel CPUs only have a single scheduler queue, and contention thereof would be virtually the same as contention of the reorder buffer. However, the Apple M1, AMD Zen 2, and Zen 3 microarchitectures have separate scheduler queues per execution unit. We first reverse-engineer the behavior of the scheduler queues on these CPUs and show that they can be primed and probed. The SQUIP attack observes the occupancy level from within the same hardware core and across SMT threads. We evaluate the performance of the SQUIP attack in a covert channel, exfiltrating 0.89 Mbit/s from a co-located virtual machine at an error rate below 0.8 \%, and 2.70 Mbit/s from a co-located process at an error rate below 0.8 \%. We then demonstrate the side channel on an mbedTLS RSA signature process in a co-located process and in a co-located virtual machine. Our attack recovers full RSA-4096 keys with only 50 500 traces and less than 5 to 18 bit errors on average. Finally, we discuss mitigations necessary, especially for Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems, to prevent our attacks.},

abstract="By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed Diffie-Hellman exponents, factor RSA keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext. Actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements. Techniques for preventing the attack for RSA and Diffie-Hellman are presented. Some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevent timing attacks.",

abstract = {A convolutional neural network (CNN) model represents a crucial piece of intellectual
property in many applications. Revealing its structure or weights would leak confidential
information. In this paper we present novel reverse-engineering attacks on CNNs running
on a hardware accelerator, where an adversary can feed inputs to the accelerator and
observe the resulting off-chip memory accesses. Our study shows that even with data
encryption, the adversary can infer the underlying network structure by exploiting
the memory and timing side-channels. We further identify the information leakage on
the values of weights when a CNN accelerator performs dynamic zero pruning for off-chip
memory accesses. Overall, this work reveals the importance of hiding off-chip memory
access pattern to truly protect confidential CNN models.},

Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses.We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance. Our results show that our new cache designs with built-in security can defend against cache-based side channel attacks in general-rather than only specific attacks on a given cryptographic algorithm-with very little performance degradation and hardware cost.},
