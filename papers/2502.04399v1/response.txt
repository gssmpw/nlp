\noindent\textbf{Vehicle Crowdsensing (VCS).}
In VCS systems, vehicles move within defined ranges and collect data for performing VCS tasks, e.g., machine learning driven traffic monitoring. Various studies consider optimizing different metrics for these tasks, such as the volume of data collected, the geographic fairness of the collection, or the sensing coverage. For example, Fan \emph{et al.}, "Fine-Grained Spatio-Temporal Sensing Coverage" formulate the VCS problem as a stochastic dynamic program and achieve fine-grained spatio-temporal sensing coverage at the minimum long-term cost. Other works, Zhang, "Vehicle Crowdsensing with Privacy Preservation", Liu, "Spatio-Temporal Data Collection in Vehicular Networks", focus on protecting the privacy of the vehicles participating in the crowdsensing tasks. In Chen, "Optimal Selection of Mobile Vehicles for Data Collection", researchers explore the optimal selection of mobile vehicles using a deep learning-based offline algorithm that predicts vehicle mobility. Recently, to overcome the constraint of ground-only operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been incorporated for data collection, collaborating with ground vehicles. Yu \emph{et al.}, "Cooperative Data Collection by Unmanned Ground Vehicles and UAVs" maximize the amount of collected data and minimize energy consumption through the cooperation between unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and UAVs.

Furthermore, the EHTA framework, Guo, "Environmentally-Aware Heterogeneous Task Allocation for Vehicular Crowdsensing" introduces an environmentally-aware heterogeneous task allocation mechanism to ensure fairness and efficiency in vehicular crowdsensing.

In terms of traffic monitoring, Li \emph{et al.}, "Misbehavior Detection in Traffic Monitoring via Fog-Assisted Vehicular Crowdsensing" introduced a novel security model to define the misbehavior of malicious drivers in traffic monitoring via fog-assisted vehicular crowdsensing.

Notably, our approach diverges from these studies as we study a new scenario where ride-hailing vehicles can gain utilities in joint tasks of order serving and model fine-tuning.

\noindent\textbf{Model Fine-tuning in Vehicular Networks.}
% \broken{
Numerous studies have explored the integration of machine learning (ML) tasks within vehicular networks, demonstrating their potential to enhance intelligent transportation systems. For instance, ML algorithms have been employed for tasks such as real-time traffic prediction, Li, "Real-Time Traffic Prediction Using Machine Learning", dynamic routing optimization, Zhang, "Dynamic Routing Optimization in Vehicular Networks", and autonomous vehicle decision-making, Wang, "Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making using Machine Learning". These studies underscore the growing reliance on vehicular networks for executing computationally intensive tasks in distributed environments. Recent works have increasingly focused on fine-tuning models for vehicular networks, particularly leveraging RSUs and edge devices for collaborative learning. GIOV, Liang, "Federated Learning Framework Using RSUs" proposed a federated learning framework using RSUs to fine-tune models for adaptive vehicular applications, achieving enhanced performance in resource-constrained environments. Similarly, GAI-IOV, Zhang, "Deployment of Pre-Trained Generative Models for Connected Vehicles" explored the deployment of pre-trained generative models for connected vehicles. In contrast to prior work, our approach introduces a novel reward and optimization framework that incorporates data freshness as a pivotal factor influencing the utility of UFM fine-tuning task.

\noindent\textbf{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).}
%(减少强化学习算法的介绍，用一两句介绍。后面介绍在smart city中的应用，在车辆调度和crowdsensing的介绍）
DRL is a powerful technique that uses neural networks to simulate or evaluate the actions of agents that play actions in sequential timesteps through the feedback from environments and revealed states, Liu, "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Smart City Applications". In recent years, a series of research works applied DRL to VCS or vehicle dispatching systems. For instance, IMPALA-based, He, "IMPALA-Based Framework for Multi-Task-Oriented VCS" framework is proposed for multi-task-oriented VCS, which features a centralized control and distributed execution system. Ding \emph{et al.}, "Graph Neural Networks Enhanced DRL for Route Selection in Taxis" use graph neural networks to extract road network information and combine it with reinforcement learning to select routes for taxis participating in the VCS task.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}
Given the dynamics and potential complex-structured items in the environments, DRL algorithms may benefit from enhanced state representation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an advantageous tool for state representation to extract the graph-structured dependencies across different entities in DRL environments. Recently, Li \emph{et al.}, "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Enhanced MARL Framework" nicely integrate Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HAN) techniques and attention mechanisms into an MARL framework for minimizing the aggregate completion time for machine learning tasks in distributed edge cluster serving systems. You \emph{et al.}, "Jointly Optimizing Content Recommendation and Caching in IVI Systems using GNN" jointly optimize the content recommendation and caching in IVI systems, and they propose a GNN for user-item prediction to capture the intricate topological relationship between different agents, outperforming the conventional MARL strategies in agent coordination.
