\begin{abstract}
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban living. %Collecting urban data through crowdsensing plays a distinctive role in the development of smart cities. 
Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data.
However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.
%a larger age-of-information (AoI) has lower utility. 
%Exploiting these insights, this work takes the first attempt to optimize the joint tasks of order serving and model fine-tuning using spatio-temporal heterogeneous urban data. %AoI for VCS into order serving, the common main task of ride-hailing vehicles. 
To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.
% \xiaoxi{Please replace the crowdsensing task to Scenario I: large-model fine-tuning tasks and change the AoI metric to test accuracy. The large-model driven task can be for entertainment supported by future IVI systems. For each vehicle, it can collect data at a PoI, either does local fine-tuning (meaning it has to pull from the RSU and store a large-language model and LoRA adapters), or uploads data to the RSU for fine-tuning at the RSU. The input data for fine-tuning has temporal-spacial heterogeneity. Specifically, the data at different PoI locations are non-IID and have different data sizes. Therefore, the sequence of locations each vehicle arrives to collect the data affects the accuracy, similar to conventional training. Here, we consider fine-tuning because vehicles can't do entire model training due to resource limits.} 

%\xiaoxi{Scenario II, which is continuous FT: In this map, the PoIs include two types of points: data locations and model RSU locations. The fine-tuned models are large and stored at RSUs. For any given geo-distributed RSU server, after a previous vehicle that finishes fine-tuning and updates the large model to the server when it moves near the RSU. it'd be better if another vehicle that has collected some data and does fine-tuning on the road to arrive sooner to use the updated fine-tuned model, in proximity to this RSU, for continuous fine-tuning and pushing back the fined-tuned adapters to the RSU. The entire model will be updated at the RSU immediately, and the old model won't be stored. If a vehicle comes late, the fetched model at the RSU might be stale, and thus the accuracy will be lower and the fine-tuned adapters may be discarded without collecting any reward. After a period of time, the model may be refreshed, once a new vehicle pushes its newly fine-tuned model.}
