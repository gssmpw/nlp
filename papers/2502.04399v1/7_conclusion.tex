This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework that integrates dispatching and data collection for fine-tuning in ride-hailing vehicles. We recognize that data freshness and volume are crucial factors influencing fine-tuning accuracy. Specifically, the amount of collected data and its freshness significantly affect the accuracy of model fine-tuning, which in turn impacts the overall system performance. We model the tasks of dispatching, order-serving, and data collection for fine-tuning as a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the QoS. To solve this, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on the R-GCN model, enabling effective fusion of diverse environmental states and improving the efficiency of fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively optimizes both ride-hailing services and data collection for fine-tuning, achieving superior results in terms of accuracy and overall system performance.
