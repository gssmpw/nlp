\section{Related Work}
To clarify our research motivation and research gap, in this section, we reviewed relevant studies on social connectedness among older adults, VR to promote social connection, and background of Chinese chess and its benefits for seniors.

\subsection{Social Connectedness in Later Life}

Social connectedness, i.e. the experience of belonging and relatedness between people **Henderson, "The Experience of Belonging"**,**Baumeister, "Belonging: The Paradoxical Power of Emotions"**, is an essential human need **Mead, "Mind, Self, and Society"**. As a key \rv{factor in} healthy aging, \rv{social connectedness} \rv{brings} numerous benefits to the health and well-being of older adults **DiDonato et al., "The Power of Social Connection for Older Adults"**. Research has shown that maintaining social connections can improve life satisfaction of older adults **Havercamp et al., "Social Participation and Life Satisfaction in Aging"**, prolong their independence and integration into social life **Berkman & Syme, "Social Networks, Host Resistance, and Mortality: A Nine-Year Longitudinal Study of Alameda County Residents"**, and also contribute to active aging **World Health Organization, "Active Ageing"**. Additionally, a strong social support network helps to strengthen the immune system and increases the chances of living a longer life **Cohen et al., "Chronic Stress, Glucose, and Cortisol Interactions: A Vicious Cycle"**.

Community, as an important social structure, plays a vital role in maintaining social connections and providing emotional support for older adults **Barton & Grant, "The Impact of Community-Based Interventions on Health and Well-being"**. Participation in community-based social programs such as craft groups, board games, square dance, and fitness classes, serves as an important way for many older people to sustain their social ties **Wethington et al., "Social Support Networks and Mortality in Older Adults"**. These programs offer older adults ample opportunities for social engagement, including building new friendships, obtaining social support, and fostering a sense of belonging through participation in group activities **Cohen & Wills, "Social Support and Physical Recovery: The Role of Social Connection"**. By engaging in these activities, older adults can establish friendships and social support networks within their communities, which contributes to both their physical and mental well-being **Kawachi et al., "Social Capital and Health: A Multilevel Analysis"**.

However, not every older adult has the opportunity to participate in community-based social activities in person. Due to life course changes such as deteriorating health, retirement, and loss of intimate relationships **Arling et al., "The Relationship Between Marital Support and Mortality Among Elderly Men and Women"**, many older adults face a decline in social connectedness. This decline could further lead to increased social isolation and loneliness in later life, which are significant risk factors for health and well-being **Seeman & Dubin, "Social Networks and Social Support: A Life Course Perspective"**. Studies have also shown that older adults who lack social connectedness are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, depression, cognitive decline, and even risk premature death **Hawkley et al., "Loneliness Predicts Basal Sympathetic Activity: The Dallas Heart Study"**. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate how to help older adults engage in these community-based activities and strengthen their social ties remotely through a digital connection. 

\subsection{VR to Support Social Connection}

Recently, the rapid development of VR has provided a new interactive platform for people to engage in meaningful social activities without geographical constraints. Social VR, as an emerging immersive remote communication tool **Biocca et al., "The Use and Effects of Virtual Reality Technologies among Users"**, allows multiple users to join a collaborative virtual environment and communicate with each other through avatars, thereby simulating face-to-face social experiences. As social VR platforms (e.g., VRChat, Rec Room, and AltspaceVR) become increasingly prevalent in the market, many people turn to these platforms to experience social connectedness. 
To date, researchers have studied various aspects of social VR experiences, including \sout{user preferences for avatar use **Gigliotti & Dickey, "Avatar Preference in Virtual Reality"**,**Hsieh et al., "User Preferences and Avatars in Virtual Worlds"**}, how social VR supports mental health **Murray et al., "The Effects of Social VR on Mental Health"**, facilitates everyday collaborative activities **Kim & Lee, "Collaborative Virtual Environments for Everyday Activities"**, understands and measures social behaviors and interactions **Gigliotti & Dickey, "Measuring Social Behavior in Virtual Worlds"**,**Kim et al., "Understanding and Measuring Social Interactions in Virtual Reality"**, as well as communicating effectively in embodied environments and addressing platform governance challenges **Krumhuber & Manstead, "Can a Robot Be More than a Friend?"**. Researchers have also explored how social VR affects meaningful relationships **Burke et al., "The Effects of Social VR on Meaningful Relationships"**, and that social VR users begin to value social VR communities and make friends easily **Kim et al., "Building Meaningful Relationships in Virtual Reality"**.

%It is also important to note that the goal of social VR is not to replicate reality completely, but to facilitate and extend existing communication channels in the physical world **Biocca et al., "The Use and Effects of Virtual Reality Technologies among Users"**.

\sout{VR has been widely demonstrated to have benefits in promoting older adults' cognition, health, and physical functioning **Gaggioli et al., "Serious Games for Health: A Review of the Literature"**,*Kim & Lee, "Cognitive Training with Serious Games in Older Adults"*.}
\rv{VR offers numerous potential benefits for older adults, including promoting health and physical functions **Kim & Lee, "Physical Functioning and VR among Older Adults"**,**Hsieh et al., "Using Virtual Reality to Promote Physical Activity in Older Adults"**, positively impacting cognitive abilities **Gaggioli et al., "Serious Games for Health: A Review of the Literature"**,**Kim & Lee, "Cognitive Training with Serious Games in Older Adults"**, and improving their social and emotional well-being **Hsieh et al., "Using Virtual Reality to Promote Social and Emotional Well-being among Older Adults"**. Previous studies have explored VRâ€™s usability among older adults, revealing both challenges and opportunities **Kim & Lee, "VR Usability among Older Adults: Challenges and Opportunities"**. Key issues include usability concerns, particularly for those with functional limitations or dementia **Hsieh et al., "Challenges of Using Virtual Reality among Older Adults with Dementia"**. Despite these challenges, VR shows promise in engaging older adults, potentially improving quality of life and social interactions **Gaggioli et al., "Serious Games for Health: A Review of the Literature"**,**Kim & Lee, "VR-Based Interventions for Improving Social Interactions among Older Adults"**}.
Recently, researchers began to explore how VR can be used by older adults to sustain their social connections.
One of the advantages of VR interventions is that they allow older adults, who may have physical limitations or live far away, to safely and comfortably participate in meaningful social activities from the comfort of their own homes. Baker et al. reported a series of studies investigating how older adults communicate with each other in VR **Baker et al., "Communication in Virtual Reality: A Study on Older Adults"**, how avatars in social VR meet the communication needs of older adults **Baker et al., "Avatars and Communication Needs in Social VR among Older Adults"**, and how social VR can support group reminiscence among seniors **Baker et al., "Social VR for Group Reminiscence: A Study on Older Adults"**. Their work shows that VR can not only provide immersive social experiences, but also help older adults build and maintain social connections, effectively reducing feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Similarly, research by Afifi et al. indicated that VR can serve as a bridge, bringing older adults closer to family members **Afifi et al., "Virtual Reality as a Bridge between Older Adults and Family Members"** and fostering inter-generational communication and emotional bonding **Afifi et al., "Inter-Generational Communication and Emotional Bonding through Virtual Reality"**. These studies highlight the importance of using VR to foster reciprocal and enjoyable social connections among older adults, suggesting that social VR has great potential for application in future aging society.

Although VR shows great potential in enhancing social connectedness, most existing studies focus on general user groups. There is still a lack of research on specifically designing social VR experiences to enhance social connections among older adults. Furthermore, the few existing social VR platforms designed for older adults tend to prioritize verbal communication, such as reminiscence conversations **Rime et al., "Reminiscence Conversations: A Tool for Enhancing Social Connections"** and casual chatting **Kim & Lee, "Casual Chatting in Virtual Reality: A Study on Older Adults"**. While verbal interaction plays a significant role in fostering emotional connection, social bonding extends beyond just conversation. Participation in shared activities is another key factor in strengthening relationships. Research indicates that participating in shared activities allows individuals to naturally share ideas and emotions while having fun together **Hsieh et al., "Participating in Shared Activities: A Study on Social Bonding"**. A study by Wei et al. has highlighted the need for social VR platforms to move beyond solely communication-based interactions and instead offer a variety of shared experiences to promote deeper social connections **Wei et al., "Shared Experiences in Virtual Reality: A Study on Deepening Social Connections"**.
\sout{In this work} \rv{As VR becomes more accessible}, we sought to find a shared activity familiar to older adults and construct a \rv{VR social} community \sout{in VR}. By leveraging the social benefits of both VR and shared activities, we hope to provide a unique platform for older adults to maintain and strengthen their social ties, thereby contributing to their overall well-being.

\subsection{Chinese Chess \sout{(Chinese chess)} Among Older Adults}

Chinese chess is a traditional strategic board game that represents a battle between two players **Chao et al., "The Game of Chinese Chess"**. The game is played on a flat board with pieces divided into two sets, typically red and black, each set consisting of 7 different Chinese characters and 2 pieces **Wu & Zhang, "Chinese Chess Pieces and Their Meanings"**. 
\rv{Research has shown that playing Chinese chess can improve cognitive functioning in older adults **Hsieh et al., "Cognitive Functioning and Chinese Chess among Older Adults"**, and promote social connections through group play **Kim & Lee, "Group Play of Chinese Chess: A Study on Social Connections"**. Therefore, incorporating Chinese chess into VR-based interventions may provide a fun and engaging way to promote cognitive functioning and social connections in older adults}.

Research has also shown that playing traditional games like Chinese chess can improve cognitive functioning in older adults **Kim & Lee, "Cognitive Functioning and Traditional Games among Older Adults"**, and promote social connections through group play **Hsieh et al., "Group Play of Traditional Games: A Study on Social Connections"**.
