\section{Conclusion}
We present a first systematization of the timing stack security. Our framework identifies three layers constituting a typical time stack: hardware, software and network. Through our framework, we identify new vulnerabilities of timing stack originating in the hardware and software layers. Further, we compare and contrast two classes i.e. system-based and theoretical of tools used for mitigating time stack security issues. We conclude by providing concrete recommendations for the design of a trusted timing stack.
