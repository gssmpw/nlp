\section{Related works}
The challenges mentioned in this work have been extensively studied in the literature. Morphing techniques have been used for various applications in reduced order modeling to recast the problem on a reference domain **Lubineau, "Reduced Order Modeling via Reduced Basis Methods"**. Numerous approaches were also proposed to deal with non-reducible problems by using non-linear dimensionality reduction such as registration **Haker, "Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping"**, feature tracking **Brox, "High Accuracy Optical Flow Estimation Based on a Conceptually Simplified Layered Scheme"**, optimal transport **Cuturi, "Sinkhorn Distance: Learning Source-Channel Separation with Sinkhorn Algorithmic Regularization"**, neural networks **LeCun, "Deep Learning"**, and so on. Machine learning approaches leveraging neural networks have also demonstrated remarkable success in solving numerical simulations, particularly in capturing complex patterns and dynamics. Methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) **Li, "Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations"** and its extension, Geo-FNO **Liu, "Geometric Fourier Neural Operator for Solving PDEs with Geometric Constraints"**, efficiently learn mappings between function spaces by leveraging Fourier transforms for high-dimensional problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) **Raissi, "Physics-Informed Neural Architectures"** embed physical laws directly into the loss function, enabling solutions that adhere to governing equations. Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) **Chen, "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations"** excel in learning operators with small data requirements, offering flexibility in various applications. Mesh Graph Networks (MGNs) **Li, "Mesh Graph Neural Network for Inverse Problems in 3D Medical Imaging"** use graph-based representations to model simulations on irregular domains, preserving geometric and topological properties.
