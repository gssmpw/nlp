\begin{abstract}
We present a Real-Time Operator Takeover (RTOT) paradigm enabling operators to seamlessly take control of a live visuomotor diffusion policy, guiding the system back into desirable states or reinforcing specific demonstrations.
We present new insights in using the Mahalonobis distance to automatically identify undesirable states. 
Once the operator has intervened and redirected the system, the control is seamlessly returned to the policy, which resumes generating actions until further intervention is required. We demonstrate that incorporating the targeted takeover demonstrations significantly improves policy performance compared to training solely with an equivalent number of, but longer, initial demonstrations. We provide an in-depth analysis of using the Mahalanobis distance to detect out-of-distribution states, illustrating its utility for identifying critical failure points during execution. Supporting materials, including videos of initial and takeover demonstrations and all rice scooping experiments, are available on the project website\footnote{\label{fn:website} \url{https://operator-takeover.github.io/}}.
