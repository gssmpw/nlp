    \caption{Evaluation results of $11$ LLMs on the $392$ tasks of \benchmark{}. Full bars represent \secpassk{1}, while full bars and shaded bars together show \passk{1}. Concerningly, around $50\%$ of the passing programs for each model are exploitable. While \secpassk{1} is significantly higher for models with a higher \passk{1} score, even for the best model, \openaiothree{}, it only reaches $35\%$.}
