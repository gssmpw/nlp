\toprule 
\textbf{CWE} & \textbf{CWE Description} & \textbf{MITRE Top 25} & \textbf{OWASP Top 10} \\
\midrule
20: Improper Input Validation & The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly. & \#12 & A03 \\
22: Path Traversal & The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. & \#5 & A01 \\
78: OS Injection & The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component. & \#7 & A03 \\
79: XSS & The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. & \#1 & A03 \\
89: SQL Injection & The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data. & \#2 & A03 \\
94: Code Injection & The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment. & \#11 & A03 \\
117: Improper Output Neutralization For Logs & The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs. & & A09 \\
284: Improper Access Control & The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. & & A01 \\
400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption & The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources. & \#24 &  \\
434: Unrestricted Upload With Dangerous File & The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment. & \#10 &  \\
522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials & The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval. & & A04 \\
703: Improper Check Or Handling Of Exceptional Conditions & The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product. & &  \\
863: Incorrect Authorization & The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. & \#18 & A01 \\
