\begin{abstract}
Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task.
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, \ie reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem.
% 
From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations.
Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability.
To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. 
In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones.
Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20\% and maintaining nearly complete general capability.
% SOTA-comparable defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks with about 20\% lower over-refusal rate and almost no reduction in general capability.}
% reduces the over-refusal rate by about 20\% across four LLMs while maintaining state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks.}
Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training. 
Please see our code at: https://github.com/AI45Lab/X-Boundary.

% X-Boundary inspires efficient and fine-grained defense techniques by leveraging LLM's intrinsic features.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This work aims to advance the field of large language models (LLMs) safety alignment by proposing X-Boundary, a method that maintains state-of-the-art performance in multi-turn jailbreak attack defenses while effectively mitigating the over-safety problem. We do not consider that this method will directly lead to severe negative consequences for societal development. However, we must be aware that malicious actors could exploit various approaches to induce LLMs to generate misleading or harmful content. Therefore, we expect that future research will focus on enhancing content moderation mechanisms and setting up ethical usage protocols to effectively reduce potential risks. From a constructive perspective, this method can significantly enhance the reliability, safety, and usability of LLMs.
