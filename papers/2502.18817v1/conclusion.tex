\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes the \method{} method, which enhances the judgment ability of LLMs in a self-improvement method. It prompts LLMs to generate different judgments based on various combinations of judgment dimensions and utilizes the consistency between judgments to enhance LLMs to generate more accurate judgments. Our experimental results show that \method{} has the ability to choose appropriate evaluation dimensions to generate reliable and comprehensive assessments.
