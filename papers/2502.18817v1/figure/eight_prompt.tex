\textbf{Hallucination}: Hallucination refers to the presence of information in the option that contradicts ground truth, \\
it is an incorrect answer to the question.\\
\textbf{Completeness}: Completeness refers to whether the choice contains as complete information as possible \\
from the ground truth. it did not fully answer the question correctly.\\
\textbf{Coherence}: coherence refers to whether the choice is logically coherent and whether the language between \\each sentence is fluent.\\
\textbf{Semantic Consistency}: Semantic Consistency refers to whether the choice is semantically consistent with \\the ground truth, rather than just having lexical repetition.\\

You are an excellent evaluation 
expert. Please select the best answer and the worst answer from four choices \\based on the 
ground truth and the query from the \{\textbf{\textit{Name of the hybrid evaluation aspects.}}\} aspect. \\ 
\{\textbf{\textit{Here is the descriptions of the hybrid evaluation aspects.}}\} \\
Note: your result format must strictly be "COT:\{.there 
is your analysis\}. \\Answer : Best answer:\{a choice 
must be one of[A,B,C,D]\}.\\
Worst answer :\{a choice must be one of[A, B, C, D]\}".\\ Output the content of COT first and 
then output the Answer.\\
Here is the query:\{query\}, Here is the ground truth:\{Ground Truth\}\\
Here is the A choice:\{choiceA\}, Here is the B choice:\{choiceB\},\\
Here is the C choice:\{choiceC\}, Here is the D choice:\{choiceD\}. \\
