\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we address the issue of learning complex manipulation skills from manuals, which is essential for robots to execute such tasks based on human-designed instructions.
We propose \ours, a novel framework that leverages VLM to understand manuals and learn robotic manipulation skills from manuals.
We design a pipeline for assembling IKEA furniture and validate its effectiveness in real scenarios.
We also demonstrate that our method extends beyond the task of furniture assembly.
This work represents a significant step toward enabling robots to learn complex manipulation skills with human-like understanding. It could potentially unlock new avenues for robots to acquire diverse complex manipulation skills from human instructions.
