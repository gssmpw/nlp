\section{Limitations}
This paper explores the acquisition of complex manipulation skills from manuals and introduces a method for automated IKEA furniture assembly. Despite this progress, several limitations remain. First, our approach mainly identifies the objects that need assembly but overlooks other details, such as grasping position markings and precise connector locations (e.g., screws). Integrating a vision-language model (VLM) module to extract this information could significantly enhance robotic insertion capabilities. Second, the method does not cover the automated execution of fastening mechanisms, like screwing or insertion actions, which depend heavily on force and tactile sensing signals. We leave these challenges as directions for future work.
