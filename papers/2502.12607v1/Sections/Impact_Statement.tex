\section*{Impact Statement}

This work presents a new method of dataset distillation, aiming to reduce storage requirements and computational costs in machine learning while maintaining model performance. The positive societal impacts include privacy advantages by minimizing disclosure of sensitive information and changing the environmental consideration of training large models by reducing the amount of data needed to achieve acceptable accuracy. Currently, we do not identify any immediate, critical ethical concerns specific to our method.
