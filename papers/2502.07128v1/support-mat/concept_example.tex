[Wild Card Mechanics]
Wild cards are special cards that can substitute for any other card in a hand or meld, offering strategic flexibility.

The variations involve the specific types of wild cards used (Jokers, Deuces) and the specific actions players can take, such as exchanging cards with opponents or enhancing poker hands.

[Existing Instances]
- **Use of Wild Cards**: Wild cards, if implemented in the game, can substitute for any card to form a strong hand.

- **Utilize Wild Cards Effectively**: Jokers can be used as wild cards to complete or enhance poker hands.

- **Exchange Wild Cards**: Players may exchange a natural card from their hand with a 2 or Joker from an opponent's meld.

- **Mystic Wild Echoes (New)**: Wild cards in this game can echo the previous card played, not only mirroring its value but also granting players the added strategic benefit of amplifying any special effects associated with that card.

- **Ethereal Wild Convergence (New)**: In moments of convergence, players can use wild cards to merge two unrelated sequences or hands, forging powerful combinations and unlocking hidden advantages in their decks.
