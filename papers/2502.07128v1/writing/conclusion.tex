\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \ourwork, an integrated pipeline leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist designers in card game prototyping. Our approach integrates three key components: (1) a graph-based representation of game mechanics that facilitates the extraction, clustering, and generation of novel game mechanics, promoting innovation in game design; (2) an LLM-driven code generation system that aligns game code more rigorously with textual game descriptions through iterative gameplay validation; and (3) a scalable gameplay AI that generates ensembles of action-value functions optimized through self-play.

Our work could inspire several directions for broader research. For example, the graph-based game mechanic representation could pave the way for better game design recommendation system, more explainable game distance metrics, and mechanic-driven game generation models. Additionally, our code generation pipeline can create synthetic data for domain-specific code generation models. Lastly, LLM reasoning skills are difficult to evaluate when the game strategies appear in its training corpus. Our work contributes to addressing this gap by reducing the human effort required for the design of novel games.
