	abstract = {Protecting the privacy of individuals in graph structured data while making accurate versions of the data available is one of the most challenging problems in data privacy. Most efforts to date to perform this data release end up mired in complexity, overwhelm the signal with noise, and are not effective for use in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new method which guarantees differential privacy. It specifies a probability distribution over possible outputs that is carefully defined to maximize the utility for the given input, while still providing the required privacy level. The distribution is designed to form a 'ladder', so that each output achieves the highest 'rung' (maximum probability) compared to less preferable outputs. We show how our ladder framework can be applied to problems of counting the number of occurrences of subgraphs, a vital objective in graph analysis, and give algorithms whose cost is comparable to that of computing the count exactly. Our experimental study confirms that our method outperforms existing methods for counting triangles and stars in terms of accuracy, and provides solutions for some problems for which no effective method was previously known. The results of our algorithms can be used to estimate the parameters of suitable graph models, allowing synthetic graphs to be sampled.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of big data technology, the issue of preserving personal privacy has attracted more and more attention. It has been shown that protecting the published graph with the differential privacy can ensure not only the quantitative privacy, but also the data usability. In this paper, we first put forward an optimized randomized response algorithm for generating synthetic graph, which dose not depend on a trusted third party in charge of collecting data. Furthermore, based on multi-party computation clustering, we propose a generated graph model under local differential privacy ({LDPGM}). The experiment indicates that {LDPGM} can effectively control the density of the synthetic graph so that significantly reduce the error between the synthetic graph and the original graph. Therefore, it maintains the properties of the original graph well and ensures high usability.},
