$k$-star counting ____, {triangle counting ____}, and core decomposition ____, and {graph learning ____}. 
% Some approaches adopt {\em central differential privacy} ____, where a trusted data curator can access the whole graph.

Some approaches adopt {\em central differential privacy} ____, where a trusted curator can access the entire graph. However, if this curator is compromised, all users' privacy is at risk ____. 
% central models face challenges in finding a trusted third party.

____ proposes k-star LDP to addresses differentially private $(p,q)$-biclique counting over bipartite graphs. Specifically, each vertex reports its perturbed k-star neighbor lists instead of the classic edge neighbor lists to the data curator.

% (it splits the privacy budget into e1 and e2. It uses e1 to perturb adjacency lists and uses e2 to perturb the node degree. ) % Interestingly, in this work, it also discusses how to split the privacy budget for the downstream task. It adopts the RABV protocol, which in essence perturbs one and only one bit for each pair of symmetric bits in the adjacency matrix. This is equivalent to the handling in ____ where RNL is applied to the lower/upepr triangle of the adjacency matrix.

% ____ studies data aggregation in the context of local differential privacy (LDP). It specifically addresses the problem of frequent itemset mining (FIM) in LDP, which is the task of identifying sets of items that frequently co-occur in a dataset while preserving privacy. The paper proposes a new approach called LDP-FPMiner that utilizes the concept of a frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) to achieve FIM in LDP -> we do not consider this paper because it is not on graphs
