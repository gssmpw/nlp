\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we study the problem of common neighborhood estimation on bipartite graphs under edge LDP. 
To address overcounting with the \naive approach, we propose the \bs algorithm that leverages the flipping probability to construct unbiased estimates. 
% \bs considers all vertices on the opposite layer as common neighbor candidates. 
To improve data utility, we propose a multiple-round framework and a single-source algorithm \advss, which enables the query vertices to download noisy edges and construct unbiased estimators locally. 
This significantly reduces error compared to \bs by limiting the candidate pool. 
% for common neighbors to the neighbors of query vertices. 
To tackle cross-round privacy budget allocation and the variety of query vertices, 
% To tackle cross-round privacy budget allocation and various queries, 
we propose the \advds algorithm that returns a weighted average of two unbiased estimators associated with two query vertices. 
We propose novel optimizations to adjust the privacy budgets of each round and the contribution of each estimator based on the query vertices. 
Experiments on $15$ real-world bipartite graphs validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed multiple round algorithms.
