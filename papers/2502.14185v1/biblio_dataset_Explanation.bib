author = {Correia, Filipa and Guerra, Carla and Mascarenhas, Samuel and Melo, Francisco S. and Paiva, Ana},
title = {Exploring the Impact of Fault Justification in Human-Robot Trust},
year = {2018},
abstract = {With the growing interest on human-robot collaboration, the development of robotic partners that we can trust has to consider the impact of error situations. In particular, human-robot trust has been pointed as mainly affected by the performance of the robot and as such, we believe that in a collaborative setting, trust towards a robotic partner may be compromised after a faulty behaviour. This paper contributes to a user study exploring how a technical failure of an autonomous social robot affects trust during a collaborative scenario, where participants play the Tangram game in turns with the robot. More precisely, in a 2x2 (plus control) experiment we investigated 2 different recovery strategies, justify the failure or ignore the failure, after 2 different consequences of the failure, compromising or not the collaborative task. Overall, the results indicate that a faulty robot is perceived significantly less trustworthy. However, the recovery strategy of justifying the failure was able to mitigate the negative impact of the failure when the consequence was less severe. We also found an interaction effect between the two factors considered. These findings raise new implications for the development of reliable and trustworthy robots in human-robot collaboration.},

abstract = {Abstract Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) systems aim to provide users with information to help them better understand computational models and reason about why outputs were generated. However, there are many different ways an XAI interface might present explanations, which makes designing an appropriate and effective interface an important and challenging task. Our work investigates how different types and amounts of explanatory information affect user ability to utilize explanations to understand system behavior and improve task performance. The presented research employs a system for detecting the truthfulness of news statements. In a controlled experiment, participants were tasked with using the system to assess news statements as well as to learn to predict the output of the AI. Our experiment compares various levels of explanatory information to contribute empirical data about how explanation detail can influence utility. The results show that more explanation information improves participant understanding of AI models, but the benefits come at the cost of time and attention needed to make sense of the explanation.},
