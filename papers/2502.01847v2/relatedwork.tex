In the literature, Fredrick Johnson (FJ) \cite{zhou2024friedkin, frasca2024opinion} and DeGroot \cite{wu2022mixed, zhou2020two, liu2022probabilistic} models have been used to analyze the evolution of beliefs in social networks. Adapting the Fredrick Johnson (FJ) model, the authors of \cite{kang2022coevolution, 10591448, lin2018opinion} study the evolution of opinion in signed networks, which can be used to assess collaborative and competitive behaviors in a society. The multidimensional opinion dynamics under the FJ model is studied in \cite{parsegov2016novel, zhou2022multidimensional} to analyze the evolution of multiple topics in a social network. The stability and convergence of the dynamics of evolution of opinion in random networks are studied in \cite{wang2024final, xing2024transient, xing2024concentration}. The authors investigate the impact of stubborn agents' opinions on polarization and disagreement within a social network in \cite{shirzadi2024stubborn}. Co-evolution of opinion and action has been studied in \cite{9303954, mo2022coevolution, wang2024co, 10168221}. Opinion evolution was formulated as a mean-field game in Ref. \cite{6760259}. In \cite{debuse2024study}, the authors study the evolution of opinions in a time-varying network, assuming that agents do not follow the most divergent points of view. The authors in \cite{sprenger2024control} apply the FJ model to learn about users' opinions and build a recommendation system for social networks.  

This paper applies containment control models to steer opinions in a social network. Containment control is  a well-received  leader-follower method in which group coordination is guided by a finite number of leaders and acquired by followers through local communication. Refs. \cite{cao2012distributed, ji2008containment} provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and convergence in the multi-agent containment coordination problem. Containment under fixed and switching inter-agent communications is investigated in Refs. \cite{cao2012distributed, notarstefano2011containment, li2015containment} Also,  multi-agent containment control in the presence of time-varying delays is analyzed in \cite{shen2016containment, liu2014containment}. Refs. \cite{wang2013distributed, liu2015distributed}  have studied finite-time containment control of a multi-agent system. Containment control has been defined as a decentralized affine transformation in \cite{rastgoftar2021scalable, rastgoftar2021safe, rastgoftar2022spatio}.
