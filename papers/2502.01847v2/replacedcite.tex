In the literature, Fredrick Johnson (FJ) ____ and DeGroot ____ models have been used to analyze the evolution of beliefs in social networks. Adapting the Fredrick Johnson (FJ) model, the authors of ____ study the evolution of opinion in signed networks, which can be used to assess collaborative and competitive behaviors in a society. The multidimensional opinion dynamics under the FJ model is studied in ____ to analyze the evolution of multiple topics in a social network. The stability and convergence of the dynamics of evolution of opinion in random networks are studied in ____. The authors investigate the impact of stubborn agents' opinions on polarization and disagreement within a social network in ____. Co-evolution of opinion and action has been studied in ____. Opinion evolution was formulated as a mean-field game in Ref. ____. In ____, the authors study the evolution of opinions in a time-varying network, assuming that agents do not follow the most divergent points of view. The authors in ____ apply the FJ model to learn about users' opinions and build a recommendation system for social networks.  

This paper applies containment control models to steer opinions in a social network. Containment control is  a well-received  leader-follower method in which group coordination is guided by a finite number of leaders and acquired by followers through local communication. Refs. ____ provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and convergence in the multi-agent containment coordination problem. Containment under fixed and switching inter-agent communications is investigated in Refs. ____ Also,  multi-agent containment control in the presence of time-varying delays is analyzed in ____. Refs. ____  have studied finite-time containment control of a multi-agent system. Containment control has been defined as a decentralized affine transformation in ____.
