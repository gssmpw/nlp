In the literature, Fredrick Johnson (FJ) **Johnson, "Model of Opinion Dynamics"** and DeGroot **DeGroot, "Reaching a Consensus"** models have been used to analyze the evolution of beliefs in social networks. Adapting the Fredrick Johnson (FJ) model, the authors of **Hegselmann et al., "Opinion Dynamics over Time"** study the evolution of opinion in signed networks, which can be used to assess collaborative and competitive behaviors in a society. The multidimensional opinion dynamics under the FJ model is studied in **Sanchez et al., "Evolution of Multiple Topics"** to analyze the evolution of multiple topics in a social network. The stability and convergence of the dynamics of evolution of opinion in random networks are studied in **Xu et al., "Random Network Dynamics"**. The authors investigate the impact of stubborn agents' opinions on polarization and disagreement within a social network in **Munz et al., "Stubborn Agents Impact"**. Co-evolution of opinion and action has been studied in **Watts, "Opinion Action Evolution"**. Opinion evolution was formulated as a mean-field game in Ref. **Feng et al., "Mean-Field Game Formulation"**. In **Borkovsky et al., "Time-Varying Network Opinions"**, the authors study the evolution of opinions in a time-varying network, assuming that agents do not follow the most divergent points of view. The authors in **Zhang et al., "FJ Model Application"** apply the FJ model to learn about users' opinions and build a recommendation system for social networks.

This paper applies containment control models to steer opinions in a social network. Containment control is  a well-received  leader-follower method in which group coordination is guided by a finite number of leaders and acquired by followers through local communication. Refs. **Hong et al., "Containment Control Stability"** provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and convergence in the multi-agent containment coordination problem. Containment under fixed and switching inter-agent communications is investigated in Refs. **Yang et al., "Fixed Switching Inter-Agent Communications"** Also,  multi-agent containment control in the presence of time-varying delays is analyzed in **Sun et al., "Time-Varying Delays Analysis"**. Refs. **Wu et al., "Finite-Time Containment Control"**  have studied finite-time containment control of a multi-agent system. Containment control has been defined as a decentralized affine transformation in **Duan et al., "Decentralized Affine Transformation"**
