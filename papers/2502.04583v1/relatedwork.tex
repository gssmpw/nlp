In this section, we overview previous attempts to address the fake solution problem in the Semi-dual Neural OT approaches. The fake solution problem refers to the problem where the solution of the max-min learning objective $\mathcal{L}_{V_{\phi}, T_{\theta}}$ of Semi-dual Neural OT fails to fully characterize the correct optimal transport map. \citet{otm, fanscalable} first identified this issue. They proved that while true optimal potential and transport map $(V^{\star}, T^{\star})$ are the solution to the max-min problem $\mathcal{L}_{V_{\phi}, T_{\theta}}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:otm}), the reverse does not hold. Furthermore, \citet{fanTMLR} proved that, when $\mu$ is atomless, the saddle point solution $(V_{sad}^{\dagger}, T_{sad}^{\dagger})$ (Eq. \ref{eq:saddle_def}) of $\mathcal{L}_{V_{\phi}, T_{\theta}}$ recovers the optimal transport map:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:saddle_def}
    % \begin{aligned}
        V_{sad}^{\dagger} \in \arg\max_{V} \mathcal{L} (V, T_{sad}^{\dagger}), \,\,
        T_{sad}^{\dagger} \in \arg\min_{T} \mathcal{L} (V_{sad}^{\dagger}, T).    
    % \end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
However, this does not hold for the max-min solution of $\mathcal{L}_{V_{\phi}, T_{\theta}}$. In this paper, we establish the sufficient condition under which the max-min solution recovers the optimal transport map (Thm. \ref{thm:uniqueness}). Furthermore, we suggest a method for learning the optimal transport plan $\pi^{\star}$, which is applicable even when the optimal transport map $T^{\star}$ does not exist (Sec \ref{sec:method}).

For the weak OT problem, \citet{not, knot} provided a theoretical analysis for fake solutions in semi-dual approaches. Note that \textit{these analyses were conducted for the $\gamma$-weak quadratic cost with $\gamma > 0$ and, therefore, do not cover the standard OT problem.} Additionally, \citet{knot} proposed an alternative approach that modifies the cost function by introducing a positive definite symmetric kernel. While this approach addresses the fake solution issue in the weak OT problem, it solves an inherently different problem due to the modified cost function. 
In contrast, our work is \textbf{the first attempt to analyze the conditions under which fake solutions occur in the standard OT problem} (Eq. \ref{eq:Kantorovich}).
