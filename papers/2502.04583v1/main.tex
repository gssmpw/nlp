\begin{abstract}
We address the convergence problem in learning the Optimal Transport (OT) map, where the OT Map refers to a map from one distribution to another while minimizing the transport cost. Semi-dual Neural OT, a widely used approach for learning OT Maps with neural networks, often generates fake solutions that fail to transfer one distribution to another accurately. We identify a sufficient condition under which the max-min solution of Semi-dual Neural OT recovers the true OT Map. Moreover, to address cases when this sufficient condition is not satisfied, we propose a novel method, OTP, which learns both the OT Map and the Optimal Transport Plan, representing the optimal coupling between two distributions. Under sharp assumptions on the distributions, we prove that our model eliminates the fake solution issue and correctly solves the OT problem. Our experiments show that the OTP model recovers the optimal transport map where existing methods fail and outperforms current OT-based models in image-to-image translation tasks. Notably, the OTP model can learn stochastic transport maps when deterministic OT Maps do not exist, such as one-to-many tasks like colorization.
