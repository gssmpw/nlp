    \caption{Overview of the reasoning process of part-prototype models (top) and selected challenges (bottom).
    Part-prototype models first find occurrences of learned prototypes (different types of birds' beaks, breasts and heads) in an input image (prototype matching) by calculating the similarity of input patches and each prototype. The decision layer is a simple scoring sheet, integrating these similarities and learned weights to classes. 
    There are multiple open challenges: It can be unclear why an image patch is matched to a certain prototype (a), the spatial alignment of the matching is not optimal (b), prototypes are learned, which have no meaning to humans (c) or should be irrelevant for the task (d). Additionally, the number of prototypes is too high (e) or redundant prototypes are learned (f). Further, there is a lack in clarity about what a prototype is in modalities other than images, e.g., for sensor data or text (g).
