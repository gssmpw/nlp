\section{Near-Total Orthogonality with Real Vectors}
\label{sec:kron-unit-vec-conentration}

In this section, we prove \Cref{lem:kron-unit-vec-conentration} and related concentrations and lemmas that characterize the near-total orthogonality of the Kronecker product of random unit vectors with respect to otehr Kronecker-structured vectors.
We conclude with a short lemma showing how conditioning relates to projections of Kronecker-structured vectors.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:log-beta-subexponential}
Let \(X\) be disitributed as the first entry of a uniformly random vector in \(\sqrt{n}\bbS^n\).
Let \(Y = \log \abs{X}\).
Then \(Y\) is subexponential with subexponential norm \(\norm{Y}_{\psi_1} \leq O(1)\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}



Recall that the $\beta(\frac12, \frac{n-1}{2})$ distribution has pdf given by
\[
\frac{\Gamma(n/2)}{\Gamma(1/2)\Gamma((n-1)/2)}x^{-1/2}(1-x)^{(n-3)/2} := f(x)
\]
on the interval $[0,1],$ and that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\abs{X}$ is distributed as the square root of a $\beta(1/2, \frac{n-1}{2})$ random variable.  

By the change of variables formula, the pdf of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\abs{X}$ is given by 
\[
f(x^2) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} x^2
= 2\frac{\Gamma(n/2)}{\Gamma(1/2)\Gamma((n-1)/2)} (1-x)^{(n-3)/2},
\]
which is is uniformly bounded by $C\sqrt{n}$ on $[0,1/2]$ for an absolute constant $C.$

 We then have that for $t \geq \log 2$ that,
 \[
 \Pr(Y \leq -t)
 = \Pr(\abs{X} \leq e^{-t})
 = \Pr(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \abs{X} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}e^{-t})
 \leq \frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}e^{-t} \sup_{x \in [0,1/2]} f_X(x)
 \leq 2Ce^{-t}.
 \]

 Also $X$ is subgaussian with constant subgaussian norm indedendent of $n$ (see for example Theorem 3.4.6 in \cite{vershynin2018high}.)  Thus $X$ is also subexponential with constant subexponential norm.  So for positive $t$, $X$ satisfies a right tail bound of the form 
 \[
 \Pr(X \geq t) \leq \exp(-ct).
 \]
 Since $Y \leq X,$ we obtain the same right tail bound for $Y$, and our claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{replemma}{lem:kron-unit-vec-conentration}
Let \(\vu = \vu_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vu_q\) where \(\vu_i\) is a uniformly random unit vector in \(\bbR^n\).
Then, for any kronecker-strucutred unit vector \(\vv = \vv_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vv_q\) we have that \(\tau \leq C_\tau^{-q}\) has
\[
	f(\tau)
	\defeq
    \Pr\left[\langle \vu, \vv \rangle^2 \geq \frac{\tau}{n^q} \right] \leq
    C_0^{-q}
\]
for some universal constants \(C_\tau, C_0 > 1\).
\end{replemma}
\begin{proof}
We start by letting \(X \defeq \langle \vu,\vv\rangle^2\), \(X_i \defeq \langle \vu_i, \vv_i\rangle^2\), and \(Y_i \defeq \ln(X_i)\), so that \(Y \defeq \ln(X) = \sum_{i=1}^q Y_i\) is a sum of iid terms.
We will argue the concentration of \(X\) via the concentration of \(Y\).
By \Cref{lem:log-beta-subexponential}, we know that \(\log|Z|\) has sub-exponential norm \(K\), where \(Z\) is the first entry of a random on the unit sphere of radius \(\sqrt n\).
Since the mean of \(\log|Z|\) is at most \(1.32+\frac1n \leq 1.4\) for \(n \geq 13\), we know that \(\log|Z| - \E[\log|Z|]\) has sub-exponential norm at most \(K+1.4\).
Then, by Bernstein's Inequality (as written in Proposition 4.2 of \cite{zhang2020concentration}),
\[
    \Pr\left[\sum_{i=1}^q \log|Z_i| \geq q\E[\log|Z_i|] + 2t\right] \leq e^{-\frac14 \min\{\frac{t^2}{8q(K+1.4)^2},\frac{t}{2(K+1.4)}\}}
\]
Since \(Y_i = 2\log|Z_i| - \log(n)\), we can equivalently take \(\mu \defeq \E[Y_i]\) and write
\[
    \Pr[\sum_{i=1}^q Y_i \geq q\mu + t] \leq e^{-\frac14 \min\{\frac{t^2}{8q(K+1.4)^2},\frac{t}{2(K+1.4)}\}}
\]
Recalling that \(X = e^{\sum_i Y_i}\) and that \(\mu \leq 0\),
\[
    \Pr\left[X \geq e^{t-q|\mu|}\right] \leq e^{-\frac14 \min\{\frac{t^2}{8q(K+1.4)^2},\frac{t}{2(K+1.4)}\}}
\]
Next we need to compute \(\mu = \E[Y_i] = \E[\log(X_i)]\).
Letting \(\psi\) denote the digamma function, we can write \(\E[\log(X_i)] = \psi(\alpha) - \psi(\alpha+\beta) = \psi(\frac12)-\psi(\frac n2)\), and therefore that
\[
    1.27 + \ln(n) - \frac2n \leq |\mu| \leq 1.271 + \ln(n)
\]
Then, we know that \(X \geq e^{t-q|\mu|}\) implies that \(X \geq e^{t - q(1.271+\ln(n))} = n^{-q} e^{t-1.271q}\).
So, we have
\[
    \Pr\left[X \geq \frac{e^{t-1.271q}}{n^q}\right] \leq e^{-\frac14 \min\{\frac{t^2}{8q(K+1.4)^2},\frac{t}{2(K+1.4)}\}}
\]
Taking \(t=16(K+1.4)^2(\sqrt{1+\frac{1.271}{8(K+1.4)^2}}-1)q\) then gives us
\[
    \Pr\left[X \geq \frac{e^{-\alpha q}}{n^q}\right] \leq e^{-\alpha q}
\]
where \(\alpha = 1.271 - 16(K+1.4)^2(\sqrt{1+\frac{1.271}{8(K+1.4)^2}}-1) \in (0,0.006)\).
From \Cref{lem:log-beta-subexponential}, we know that \(K = O(1)\), which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

We will also need the following result on the MGF of the inner product of Kronecker-structured vectors.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:kron-unit-vec-mgf}
Let \(\vu = \vu_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vu_q\) where \(\vu_i\) is a uniformly random unit vector in \(\bbR^n\).
Then, for any kronecker-strucutred unit vector \(\vv = \vv_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vv_q\) and \(\eta \in (0,1)\),
\[
	\E[e^{\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|}]
    \leq 1 + \frac{2\eta}{n^q}
    \leq e^{2\eta n^{-q}}.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We approach this bound via linearization.
Since \(\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle| \leq \eta \leq 1\), we know that \(e^{\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|} \leq 1+2\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|\).
So, we bound
\begin{align*}
    \E[e^{\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|}]
    &\leq 1+2\eta \E[|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|] \\
    &= 1+2\eta (\E[|\langle\vu_1,\vtheta_1\rangle|])^q
\end{align*}
Since \(\langle\vu_1,\vtheta_1\rangle\) is a distributed as a \(Beta(\frac12,\frac{n-1}{2})\) random variable, and since \(\langle\vu_1,\vtheta_1\rangle \geq 0\), we know that \(\E[|\langle\vu_1,\vtheta_1\rangle|] = \E[\langle\vu_1,\vtheta_1\rangle] = \frac1n\).
So,
\[
    \E[e^{\eta|\langle\vu,\vtheta\rangle|}] \leq 1 + \frac{2\eta}{n^q}
    \leq e^{2\eta n^{-q}}
\]
where the last inequality uses that \(1+x \leq e^{x}\) for \(x \leq 1\).
\end{proof}

Lastly, we show the following lemma that relates conditioning to the constants \(C_0\) and \(C_\tau\) from \Cref{lem:kron-unit-vec-conentration}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:conditioning-to-ortho-inner-prod}
Let \(\vv^{(1)},\cdots,\vv^{(t)} \in \bbR^{n^q}\) be unit vectors.
Suppose that \(\mV = [\vv^{(1)} ~ \cdots ~ \vv^{(t)}] \in \bbR^{n^q \times t}\) has condition number less than \(\kappa\).
Let \(\mX = [\vx^{(1)} ~ \cdots ~ \vx^{(t)}] \in \bbR^{n^q \times t}\) be an orthogonal matrix that spans \mV.
Then, for any unit vector \vu, we have
\[
	|\langle \vx^{(i)}, \vu\rangle|^2
	\leq \kappa^2 \norm{\mV^\intercal\vu}_2^2.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
There exists some invertible map \mR such that \(\mV = \mX\mR\) (for instance, if we built \(\mX\) as the Q factor of the QR of \mV).
Letting \(\mV=\mU\mSigma\mZ^\intercal\) be the SVD of \mV, notice that
\[
	\mR = \mX^\intercal\mV = (\mX^\intercal\mU)\mSigma\mZ^\intercal
\]
is also an SVD and therefore that \mR has the same singular values as \mV.
Since \(\vx^{(i)} = \mX\ve_i = \mV\mR^{-1}\ve_i\) where \(\ve_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) standard basis vector, we can bound
\[
	\langle \vu, \vx^{(i)}\rangle^2
    = (\vu^\intercal\mV\mR^{-1}\ve_i)^2
    \leq \norm{\vu^\intercal\mV}_2^2 \norm{\mR^{-1}}_2^2 \norm{\ve_i}_2^2
    = \frac{1}{(\sigma_{\min}(\mV))^2} \norm{\mV^\intercal\vu}_2^2
\]
where we use that \mR and \mV share singular values in the last equality.
Next, since \mV has unit vector columns, we know that \(\sigma_{\max}(\mV) \geq 1\).
So, \(\frac{1}{(\sigma_{\min}(\mV))^2} \leq \frac{(\sigma_{\max}(\mV))^2}{(\sigma_{\min}(\mV))^2} = \kappa^2\).
Therefore, we have
\[
	\langle \vu, \vx^{(i)}\rangle^2
	\leq \kappa^2 \norm{\mV^\intercal\vu}_2^2
\]
completing the lemma.
\end{proof}
