\section{Technical Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

In this section, we state our core technical results more precisely and discuss their context while delaying their proof details to later in the paper.
We start with the discussion of lower bounds against not ill-conditioned algorithms for trace estimation and spectral norm computation.
Then, we go into the discussion of zero testing and the insufficiency of subgaussianity to understand Kronecker matrix-vector complexity.
