\section{Related Work}
Tensors have a long history of study in the sketching literature, particularly for the problem of $\ell_2$ norm estimation \cite{ahle2020oblivious, ahle2019almost, pham2013fast}.
Previously \cite{ahle2019almost} observed that typical Kronecker-structured $\ell_2$ embeddings cannot work with fewer than exponential measurements in the number of modes.
This is why \cite{ahle2019almost} require a more complicated sketch to construct their embeddings for high-mode tensors.
However it does not appear to be known whether a  Kronecker-structured sketch could work for $\ell_2$ estimation, using a subexponential number of measurements, if one drops the requirement that the sketch be an embedding.
Our work partially resolves this by showing that any such sketching matrix must be extremely poorly conditioned.
There is also a large body of work on sketching Tucker, tensor train, tree networks, and general tensor networks, see, e.g., \cite{grasedyck2013literature,SWZ19,MWZ24} and the references therein.
Additionally, there is a large body of work on algorithms that (perhaps impicitly) operate in the Kroncker matrix-vector model \cite{bujanovic2021norm,bujanovic2024subspace,feldman2022entanglement,ahle2019almost,meyer2023hutchinson,avron2014subspace}.
