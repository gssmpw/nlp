\section{Conclusion}
We addressed several fundamental linear algebraic problems in the Kronecker matrix-vector query model.
A number of interesting questions remain.
Some of Our lower bounds have a dependence on the condition number of the measurement matrix.
Is this dependence necessary?
This is open even in the case of non-adaptive measurements.
Rigorously, we know that proving the following corollary would suffice to remove the conditioning assumption in both the non-adaptive and adaptive cases:
\begin{conjecture}
    \label{conj:kron-unit-concentration}
    Let \(\vu = \vu_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vu_q\) where each \(\vu_i\) is a uniformly random unit vector in \(\bbR^{n}\).
    Let \(\mV = [\vv^{(1)} ~ \cdots ~ \vv^{(t)}]\) where each \(\vv^{(i)}\) is an arbitrary (non-random) Kronecker-structured vector.
    Let \(\mP\) be the orthogonal projection onto the range of \mV.
    Then, so long as \(t \leq \poly(n,q)\), we have that
    \[
        \norm{\mP\vu}_2^2 \leq \frac{c_1^{-q}}{n^q}
        \hspace{1cm}
        \text{with probability at least }
        1-c_2^{-q}
    \]
    for some \(c_1,c_2 > 1\).
\end{conjecture}
The above conjecture is a direct generalization of \Cref{lem:kron-unit-vec-conentration}.
To see this, note that taking \(t=1\) in \Cref{conj:kron-unit-concentration} exactly recovers \Cref{lem:kron-unit-vec-conentration}.

In the case that \Cref{conj:kron-unit-concentration} does not hold, this suggests that a ill-conditioned might be efficient in the Kronecker matrix-vector model.
Namely, does there exist a Khatri-Rao sketching matrix that allows for $\ell_2$ norm estimation (and is extremely poorly conditioned)?
It would also be interesting to obtain tight bounds for trace estimation in the Kronecker matrix-vector model.
Lower bounds for Hutchinson-style estimators are known, but could there be better estimators, perhaps analogous to the Hutch++ \cite{meyer21hutchpp} algorithm?
