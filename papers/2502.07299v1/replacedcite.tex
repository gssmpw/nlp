\paragraph{DNA Foundation Models.}
Recent years have seen rapid progress in \textit{DNA} foundation models that leverage Transformer-like architectures. Early attempts such as DNABERT____ treated genomic sequences akin to linguistic tokens, enabling pre-trained contextual representations. Follow-up work DNABERT-2____ expanded this paradigm by introducing more efficient training protocols and supporting \textit{multi-species} data. In parallel, The Nucleotide Transformer____ demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up Transformer architectures for human genomics. Beyond Transformers, kernel-based or hierarchical approaches emergedâ€”\textit{e.g.}, HyenaDNA____, which reduces the quadratic complexity of attention for extremely long sequences. Meanwhile, alternative designs like Caduceus____ incorporate selective structural priors for long-range DNA modeling, and MxDNA____ explores adaptive tokenization schemes that automatically discover suitable patterns for genomic data.

\paragraph{Protein and RNA Advances.}
On the \textit{protein} side, AlphaFold series____ revolutionized structure prediction, catalyzing a surge in protein-based language models such as ESM-2____, which refines large-scale protein embeddings. Beyond proteins, RNA modeling also gained traction; for instance, ____ employed a language-model-based technique for accurate 3D structure prediction. These efforts underscore the trend toward specialized architectures for each biomolecule yet also highlight the desire for integrative multi-omics solutions.

\paragraph{Multi-Omics Modeling.}
Recent studies aim to bridge the gap between \textit{genomic} and \textit{protein} sequences, pushing beyond single-modality tasks. CD-GPT____ explicitly connects DNA, RNA, and proteins through the central dogma, while {BSM____ highlights the potential for small but effective models covering genes and proteins simultaneously. Evo____ similarly integrates molecular and genome-scale data with a generalized sequence-modeling approach. Closely related is LucaOne____, which advocates a unified nucleic acid and protein language for biological representation.
