\section{Conclusion}
We present \model that adapts latent diffusion models with cross-modal conditioning mechanism for time series forecasting by transforming temporal data into multi-view visual representations. Our method significantly outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and specialized forecasting models, providing a novel vision-enhanced perspective to address the key challenges of intrinsic temporal pattern extraction and uncertainty modeling. Future work will focus on exploring diffusion models' potential in broader time series applications and developing comprehensive benchmarks for diffusion-based methods.
