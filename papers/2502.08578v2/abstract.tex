The coordinate-wise median is a classic and most well-studied strategy-proof mechanism in social choice and facility location scenarios. Surprisingly, there is no systematic study of its approximation ratio in $d$-dimensional spaces. The best known approximation guarantee in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is $\sqrt{d}$ via a simple argument of  embedding $\mathbb{L}_1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ metric space, that only appeared in appendix of [Meir 2019].
This upper bound is known to be tight in dimension $d=2$, but there are no known super constant lower bounds. Still, it seems that the community's belief about coordinate-wise median is on the side of $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$. E.g., a few recent papers on mechanism design with predictions [Agrawal, Balkanski, Gkatzelis, Ou, Tan 2022], [Christodoulou, Sgouritsa, Vlachos 2024], and [Barak, Gupta, Talgam-Cohen 2024] directly rely on the $\sqrt{d}$-approximation result.

In this paper, we systematically study approximate efficiency of the coordinate-median in $\mathbb{L}_{q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spaces for any $\mathbb{L}_q$ norm with $q\in[1,\infty]$ and any dimension $d$. We derive a series of constant upper bounds $UB(q)$ independent of the dimension $d$. This series $UB(q)$ is growing with parameter $q$, but never exceeds the constant $UB(\infty)= 3$. Our bound $UB(2)=\sqrt{6\sqrt{3}-8}<1.55$ for $\mathbb{L}_2$ norm is only slightly worse than the tight approximation guarantee of $\sqrt{2}>1.41$ in dimension $d=2$. Furthermore, we show that our upper bounds are essentially tight
by giving almost matching lower bounds $LB(q,d)=UB(q)\cdot(1-O(1/d))$ for any dimension $d$ with $LB(q,d)=UB(q)$ when $d\to\infty$. We also extend our analysis to the generalized median mechanism used in [Agrawal, Balkanski, Gkatzelis, Ou, Tan 2022] for $\mathbb{L}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space to arbitrary dimensions $d$ with similar results for both robustness and consistency approximation guarantees.

% The coordinate-wise median is a classic and the most  commonly used strategy-proof mechanism for the facility location problem. 
% For $n$ agents residing in the $d$-dimensional space, it calculates the $i$-th 
% coordinate of the facility as the median point of the reported locations along the $i$-th coordinate. 
% The best known approximation guarantee of the mechanism in the Euclidean space ($L_2(\reals^d)$ norm) is due to [Meir 2019], who proved that it is not more than $\sqrt{d}$ -- the metric 
% distortion of embedding $L_2(\reals^d)$ into $L_1(\reals^d)$.  
% This upper bound was known to be tight only in dimension $d=2$ and there were no known examples showing $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ bound. 
% In this note, we study the approximation guarantees of the coordinate-wise median mechanism in 
% arbitrary $d$-dimensional space and for all possible $L_q$ norms. 
% We provide a series of upper bounds $UB(q)$ on the approximation factor independent of the dimension $d$, which is always smaller than a constant $UB(q)\le 3$. 
% We supplement these upper bounds with almost matching lower bounds $LB(q,d)=UB(q)\cdot(1-O(1/d))$.
