%%% Strategic facility location
The literature on strategic facility location is rather vast to overview it here (see two surveys on the topic from perspectives of  approximate mechanism design~\cite{chan2021mechanism} and social choice~\cite{barbera2011strategyproof}). We only mention a few directions explored in the computer science literature: various objectives on social cost like square of the $\lqnorm[2]$~\cite{FeldmanW13}, obnoxious facility~\cite{cheng2013strategy,mei2019}, dual preferences~\cite{FeigenbaumS15,zou15}, concave costs~\cite{FotakisT16}, distributed selection of multiple facility~\cite{filoratsikas2021}, false-name-proof mechanisms~\cite{todo11}. 

In the social choice literature, all characterization results assume certain form of single-picked preferences. They either formalize extensions of single-pick condition in $\reals^2$ from~\cite{moulin1980strategy} via axiomatic properties 
~\cite{barbera1993generalized,barbera1998strategy,schummer2002strategy,ching1997strategy}, or assume that preferences are given by $\lqnorm[2](\reals^d)$~\cite{kim1984nonmanipulability,peters1993range} (directly applies to strategic facility location), or work with the classes of separable quadratic preferences in $\reals^d$ space~\cite{border1983straightforward,peremans1997strategy}. The last type of preferences is described by weighted $\lqnorm[2]$ norm with potentially different weights on coordinates. While related to facility location setting in $\lqnorm[2](\reals^d)$, these classification results do not directly apply to strategic facility location, as the voters may have differently weighted quadratic preferences.

%%%
The facility location problem serves as an important case study for the new frameworks of mechanism design with predictions. Other examples, 
of learning-augmented mechanisms without payments 
include scheduling~\cite{XuL22,BalkanskiGT23,ChristodoulouSV24},  allocation of public goods~\cite{BanerjeeGHJM023}, and house allocations~\cite{ChristodoulouSV24}. There also non truthful rules for strategic facility locations with predictions that achieve good price of anarchy guarantees~\cite{ChenGI24}.
