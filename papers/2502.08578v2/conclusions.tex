In this work, we derived tight approximation ratios for the coordinate-wise median mechanism in $\lqnorm(\reals^d)$ for all $q\ge 1$ and unbounded dimension $d\to+\infty$.
We found that these approximation ratios are all constants never exceeding $3$, which in Euclidean space $\lqnorm[2]$ are only slightly larger than the respective approximation ratio in low-dimensional space ($1.55$ for $\lqnorm[2](\reals^d)$ versus $1.41$ for $\lqnorm[2](\reals^2)$). Hence, our work implies that there is no reason from the perspective of approximation guarantees to restrict attention to $\lqnorm[2](\reals^2)$ case in strategic facility location setting. On the other hand, there is still a lack of satisfying characterization of strategy-proof mechanism in higher-dimensions $d\ge 3$.


Namely, the existing characterizations that work for general $d$-dimensional spaces ~\cite{border1983straightforward,peremans1997strategy} allow agents to have different  quadratic separable preferences, which places more restriction on the space of possible strategy-proof mechanisms than in the strategic facility location setting, where agents' costs are defined by the same distance function. I.e., there could be other strategy-proof anonymous mechanisms than generalized median. Obtaining such  characterization for any space $\lqnorm(\reals^d)$ seems an interesting question.
