\vspace{-5pt}
This paper proposes a novel method \se that boosts LM's ability to utilize context with automatic contextual evidence highlighting.
It harnesses the inherent ability of specific attention layers within the LM to differentiate evidence within the context, enabling test-time auto-eliciting that is general, efficient and requires no additional training.
Comprehensive experiments on context based QA validate the effectiveness of \se, showing a performance improvement of 5.0\% to 11.7\% across multiple datasets and LMs. 
Compared to more costly generative evidence extraction, our method achieves better performance with far less additional computational overhead.
