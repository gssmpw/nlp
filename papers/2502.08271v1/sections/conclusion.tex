\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework MoLoRec. As the recommendation data for a specific domain is limited, MoLoRec is designed to combine domain-general recommendation knowledge and domain-specific recommendation knowledge. Specifically, MoLoRec first aligned LLM with the general recommendation task by fine-tuning LLM from a multi-domain instruction dataset, and then modeled domain-specific recommendation tasks by fine-tuning the domain-specific instruction dataset. After that, the combination is achieved by merging two fine-tuning model parameters. MoLoRec is generalizable as it injects recommendation general knowledge to any domain-specific recommendation tasks. Besides, MoLoRec is efficient not only because it chooses parameter-efficient fine-tuning, but also the plug-and-play nature of any domain-specific recommendation task and domain-general task. Extensive experimental results on four recommendation datasets under both the warm scenario and cold-start scenario show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. E.g., MoLoRec shows about 30\% average improvement on four datasets under cold-start scenarios. 
%In the future, we intend to adapt MoLoRec framework to the scenarios of multi-task and multi-domain recommendation. 

%the following aspects. On one hand, we would like to diversify instruction data with multiple related tasks for recommendation, such as  user profiling and review summarization. 


%To that end, in this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework. Our approach starts by parameter efficient tuning a domain-general module with general recommendation instruction data, such to align LLM with recommendation task. Then, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific instruction dataset and apply efficient fine-tuning to the pre-trained LLM. After that, we provide approaches to integrate the above domain-general parts and domain-specific parts with mixture of parameters from two parts. Please note that, our proposed framework is efficient with plug and play, as domain-general module is trained only once, and any domain-specific plug-in can be efficiently merged with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed framework. Our codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoLoRec}.
