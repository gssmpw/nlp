        \textbf{Impact of keyboard layout and typing errors.} \\
        The results presented are specific to MEG data processed using the Conv+Trans model.
        \textbf{A.} Keyboard Distance Effect. Confusion rate is analyzed against normalized keyboard distance. 
        \textbf{B.} Clustering Analysis. K-means clustering of the model embeddings with 2 (top) and 10 (bottom) clusters respectively. 
        \textbf{C.} Keypress Intervals Analysis. Comparison of keypress interval for correct keystrokes and typing errors, focusing on both preceding and subsequent characters. The sum of the two intervals is displayed. 
        \textbf{D.} Typing Mistakes Performance Differences. Performance comparison for correct characters versus typing errors using the Conv+Trans model (left) and the Conv model (right).
