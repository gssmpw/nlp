        \textbf{Analysis of character- and word-level performance.} \\
        The results presented are specific to MEG data processed using the Conv+Trans model.
        \textbf{A.} Character-error-rate (CER) is evaluated across different part-of-speech categories to evaluate how performance varies across adjectives (ADJ), nouns, verbs, determiners (DET), and prepositions (ADP). 
        \textbf{B.} CER as a function of word frequency. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) decoding is used to test whether Brain2Qwerty can decode words absent from the training set. 
        \textbf{C.} CER as a function of character frequency. 
        \textbf{D.} CER as a function of recording time included in the training set. \\
