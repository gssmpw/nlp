        \textbf{Decoding Performance across models.}
        \textbf{A.} Difference in EEG evoked responses between left vs right hand key presses. Each black line is the differential voltage of a sensor relative to key press.  
        \textbf{B.} Same as A but for MEG.
        \textbf{C.} Linear classifiers are trained, at each time sample, to predict the left vs right hand relative to each key press. The gray line represents chance level and the error bar is the standard error of the mean across participants. Significant decoding scores (p < 0.05) are marked with a star. 
        \textbf{D.} Same as C but for character classification. 
        \textbf{E-H.} Comparison of baselines (linear and EEGNet), and ablation of our three-step Brain2Qwerty model (Conv+Trans+Language Model), for both hand-error-rate (HER) and character-error-rate (CER). Each point represents the average score of a single participant. \\
        Statistical significance is denoted with p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***).
