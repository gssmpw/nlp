\section{Related Works}
There are several related works concerning covering maps over a real closed field. Delfs and Manfred discussed covering maps in the category of locally semi-algebraic spaces \cite[Section 5]{delfs1984introduction}, generalizing the notion of semi-algebraic spaces to study the topology of semi-algebraic sets, especially their homology and homotopy ____. Schwartz characterized a covering map $f$ of locally semi-algebraic spaces by the associated morphism of the corresponding real closed spaces being finite and flat ____. The theory of real closed spaces is introduced by Schwartz as a generalization of locally semi-algebraic spaces ____. Baro, Fernando and Gamboa studied the relationship between branched coverings of semi-algebraic sets and its induced map on the spectrum of the ring of continuous semi-algebraic functions in ____. A common feature of these works is the use of (various generalizations) of semi-algebraic space. Hence, the sheaf equipped is the sheaf of continuous semi-algebraic functions. As our purpose is to study the properties of (scheme-theoretic) real varieties morphisms that induce covering maps, we will be using the sheaf of regular functions instead. %

	In ____, Bernard et al.\ studied the algebraic condition for a morphism between reduced varieties over $R[\sqrt{-1}]$ to be a homeomorphism for the Zariski topology or the Euclidean topology. This is similar to our interests, as both papers investigate what kind of variety morphisms have specific topological properties (being a homeomorphism or covering, respectively).
