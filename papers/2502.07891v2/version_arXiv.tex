\begin{abstract}
	For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second.  
	Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. 
	We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. 
	We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of 
	four visible variables.
	Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities.   
	We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely  on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).

\section{Introduction}
\label{introductionsection}


One way to probe the causal influence of one variable on another is to intervene upon the first and see whether the distribution over the other changes.  Interventions are the basis of the randomized control trial. While such schemes yield strong causal conclusions, they can be prohibitively expensive (e.g., a drug trial), unethical (e.g., deciding whether smoking causes lung cancer), or simply impossible (e.g., in observational astronomy).  For this reason, it is useful to understand what causal conclusions can be drawn from purely observational data, that is, from the probability distribution over the visible variables. 




The problem of determining which causal structures are viable explanations of a given distribution over visible variables is referred to as the problem of {\em causal discovery}. The set of probability distributions over the visible variables that can be causally explained by a given causal structure generally satisfy nontrivial constraints.  We refer to these constraints as {\em causal-compatibility constraints}. 



An important class of causal inference problems concern causal structures wherein some of the variables may be latent (i.e., unobserved). 
In the special case where a causal structure does \emph{not} include latent variables, it will be called latent-free. While the causal-compatibility constraints of a latent-free causal structure always take the form of equalities, a causal structure that has latent variables can also exhibit causal-compatibility constraints in the form of inequalities. We will refer to these two types of constraints as \emph{equality constraints} and \emph{inequality constraints} respectively.  A complete solution of the causal discovery problem requires a characterization of all causal-compatibility constraints for each causal structure, which is a very difficult problem in general.   This is because the inequality constraints are hard to find.


A more straightforward project is to simply {\em classify} the causal structures. This task requires determining when a pair of such causal structures can realize the {\em same} set of distributions over the visible variables, in which case they are termed {\em observationally equivalent}, and when they are observationally {\em in}equivalent. We can then classify these causal structures into  \emph{observational equivalence classes}.  More generally, one wishes to know, for each pair of causal structures, whether the set of distributions realizable by one contains the set of distributions realizable by the other, in which case the first is said to {\em observationally dominate} the second.  This dominance relation defines a partial order among the observational equivalence classes of  causal structures, which we term the \emph{observational partial order}. The determination of the observational partial order is the main aim of this article.
 
Of course,  a determination of {\em all} of the causal-compatibility constraints for each causal structure would be {\em sufficient} for determining the observational partial order, but it is not {\em necessary}, and this is why the project of identifying the observational partial order is easier than the project of achieving a full characterization of the causal-compatibility constraints for each causal structure. The project of determining the observational partial order, however, has applications in causal discovery: given knowledge of when two causal structures are observationally equivalent,  if we find a causal-compatibility constraint for one of them, we know it applies also to the other. In particular, a classification into observational equivalence classes is helpful for attesting the absence or presence of inequality constraints: if a causal structure is known to be observationally equivalent to another one that is latent-free, then we know that it cannot present inequality constraints.

Characterizing the observational partial order is also significant for identifying the best causal explanations of observational data.
  It is standard to argue that if two causal structures can both realize a probability distribution, one should prefer the structure that is lower in the observational dominance order.  (This is sometimes motivated by the fact that this structure is more falsifiable.). Identifying the set of causal structures that provide the best explanation of a given distribution, therefore, requires identifying the lowest elements in the observational dominance order  that can realize the distribution.  The observational partial order is particularly significant when implementing causal discovery on finite-run data,  If a causal structure is found to 
   {\em underfit} the data, then so too will all the causal structures below it in the observational partial order. 
   Moreover, if a causal structure {\em overfits} the data relative to another, then so too will all the causal structures above it in the observational partial order.  In this way, a knowledge of the observational partial order permits a narrowing-down of the scope of possibilities for a good causal explanation of the data. 
   



This work focuses on rules for proving that two causal structures are observationally equivalent, inequivalent, or that one dominates the other. With these rules, we aim to determine the resulting observational partial order. Sec.~\ref{sec_proven_partitions} will explain the precise procedure that we follow to do so. 


We will use the convention adopted in the standard framework of causal inference, where a causal structure is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) whose nodes are associated to random variables and whose edges indicate direct causal influences. Here, we will refer to a DAG whose nodes are partitioned into two sets, one associated to latent variables and the other associated to visible variables, as a \emph{partitioned DAG} (pDAG). 
An example of observational equivalence is given by the pair of pDAGs depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_example_constraints}, where the nodes with white background ($a$, $b$ and $c$) are associated with visible variables, and the node with grey background ($\beta$) is associated with a latent variable.  For both of these causal structures, the only constraint on the realizable distributions is that the variable associated with node $a$, which we will call $X_a$, is independent of the variable associated with the node $c$, which we will call $X_c$, upon conditioning on the variable associated with the node $b$, which we will call $X_b$. In other words, in both cases $X_a$ and $X_c$ are conditionally independent given $X_b$.

	\label{fig_example_constraints}
\end{figure}



As mentioned, the organization into observational equivalence classes also contributes towards identifying pDAGs that present \emph{inequality} constraints among their set of causal-compatibility constraints. Such pDAGs will be called \emph{\nonalgebraic}, for reasons that we explain in Section~\ref{sec_causal_compatibility}. The study of inequality constraints is of particular importance for quantum physicists who are interested in causal inference,  because such constraints are analogues of Bell inequalities\cite{Bell_1964}, and it is only through their violation that one can witness the need for quantumness of a causal model~\cite{Fritz_2012, VanHimbeeck2019quantumviolationsin, Lauand_evans, Alanon_Shadow}. Motivated by this, there has been work on the problem of identifying when a causal structure will present inequality constraints~\cite{henson_theory-independent_2014, Pienaar_2017, Khanna_2023}. 

In the realm of classical causal inference, the most common constraint-based causal discovery algorithms (such as IC and PC)~\cite{Verma_Pearl_equivalence1990, Spirtes2000} leverage only conditional independence relations (which are \emph{equality} constraints) in trying to adjudicate between the different observational equivalence classes. 
 These algorithms can be supplemented by techniques for identifying the full set of equality constraints, including nested Markov constraints~\cite{behaviormetrika}. However, any algorithm that is restricted to using equality constraints necessarily lacks 
 discriminatory power relative to algorithms that appeal to inequality constraints. 
 
 
An important question is: how significant are causal discovery techniques that go beyond conditional independence constraints?  For every causal structure whose causal compatibility constraints are not simply conditional independence relations, it is known~\cite{Evans2023} that there are nontrivial inequality constraints.  Consequently, the first question one might ask is how \emph{rare} inequality constraints are; if they are too rare, one might conclude that not much is lost by leveraging only conditional independence relations in our causal discovery algorithms. Here, we show that this is \emph{not} the case for causal structures with four visible nodes.  The trend as one goes from two to three to four visible nodes suggests that the proportion of \nonalgebraic classes increases monotonically as one increases the number of visible nodes.

We advocate that the correct counting method to evaluate the prevalence of inequality constraints is not the fraction of \nonalgebraic \emph{causal structures}, but instead the fraction of \nonalgebraic \emph{observational equivalence classes of causal structures}.  When we look at observational data, the only opportunity for distinguishing two causal structures is if they each have a different set of realizable distributions. For example, there is no opportunity for observationally distinguishing within the large number of causal structures in the saturating class, which is the class of pDAGs that can realize \emph{every} distribution over the visible variables. What observational data can distinguish, therefore, are observational equivalence classes of causal structures rather than causal structures themselves.

For reasons  we give in Section~\ref{sec_temporal_order}, we will pursue this classification project   for a set of causal structures that is consistent with a fixed ordering of the visible nodes, i.e., a fixed 
 \emph{nodal ordering}. For example, we will \emph{not} compare the 2-node pDAGs $a\rightarrow b$ and  $a\leftarrow b$, because the former is only consistent with the nodal ordering $(a,b)$, while the latter is only consistent with the nodal ordering $(b,a)$. 
 
 We here consider the question of 
   what proportion of { observational equivalence classes} are \nonalgebraic for sets of causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that have two, three and four visible nodes.

For causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that have two nodes, there are only two observational equivalence classes, and both are \algebraic. For causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that have three nodes,  we find that there are fifteen observational equivalence classes, of which five are \nonalgebraic. Thus, the fraction of \nonalgebraic observational equivalence classes is $1/3$.
For causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that have four nodes, we find that this fraction is at least $0.852$  (the uncertainty about this number comes from the fact that we do not yet have a full classification of pDAGs with four visible variables into observational equivalence classes). 




The trend that is emerging is that the fraction of \nonalgebraic observational equivalence classes of pDAGs increases with the number of visible variables\footnote{Recent work by Evans~\cite{Evans2023} shows that DAGs that have nontrivial Nested Markov constraints always have nontrivial inequality constraints as well. That finding, however, is insufficient to establish the claim that the proportion of observational equivalence classes that have inequalities increases with the number of visible nodes.} 
. This suggests that as one increases the number of visible variables in a pDAG, inequality constraints become generic. 



Our result showing the abundance of \nonalgebraic observational equivalence classes is also of interest for quantum causality. All of the \nonalgebraic causal structures that we identify here were already identified as \nonalgebraic in Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023}, but here our counting is in terms of observational equivalence classes (and not in terms of individual causal structures) and this highlights how generic these inequality constraints are. This indicates that the potential for finding new scenarios that show quantum advantage is  significant, as it is present in the majority of observational equivalence classes of causal structures.

We return now to the question of the importance of going beyond conditional independence constraints in causal discovery. Even if \nonalgebraic equivalence classses 
  are common, it could still be the case that conditional independence relations are sufficient for distinguishing most classes
   from one another, which would imply that identifying the inequality constraints and the nested Markov constraints of a class are in general not necessary to single it out from every other class using observational data. Again, we here show that this is \emph{not} the case for causal structures with four visible nodes, and we provide evidence that this will continue to hold for higher numbers of visible nodes.

For 2-visible-node causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, all of the observational equivalence classes can be distinguished from one another from their conditional independence constraints. For 3-visible-node causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, out of the fifteen observational equivalence classes, ten can be singled out based on their  conditional independence constraints. For 4-visible-node causal structures consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, less than $10\%$ of the observational equivalence classes can be singled out based on their  conditional independence constraints.

Again, the trend that emerges is that, as one increases the number of visible nodes, the causal-compatibility constraints that are \emph{not} conditional independence relations (namely,  inequality constraints and the nested Markov constraints) become increasingly relevant.  In short,  our results prove that causal discovery algorithms that leverage only conditional independence constraints have a poor discriminatory power relative to algorithms that go beyond these for the case of four visible nodes, and this is likely to also be true for higher numbers of visible nodes.


The paper is structured as follows: after an exposition of the relevant background concepts in Section~\ref{sec_preliminary_notions}, we will present our objectives and our results for the case of three visible variables in Section~\ref{sec_objectives}. In particular, Section~\ref{sec_3_observed_nodes} presents and discusses the complete observational partial order of causal structures of three visible nodes consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. We will then present the known rules to show observational dominance and nondominance in Sections \ref{sec_show_equivalence} and \ref{sec_show_inequivalence} (including two new dominance-proving rules in Sections \ref{sec_face_splitting} and \ref{sec_simultaneous_splitting}). In light of that, Section~\ref{sec_back_to_3visible} will justify the results for causal structures with three visible nodes that were presented without justification in  Section~\ref{sec_3_observed_nodes}. Section~\ref{sec_4} then presents some partial results about the case of causal structures of four visible nodes consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, and we end the paper with concluding remarks in Section~\ref{sec_conclusion}.




\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec_preliminary_notions}

In this work, causal structures are represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), directed graphs that have no cycles.  DAGs are composed of nodes and directed edges, specified as ordered pairs of nodes. Here, we will denote the set of nodes of a DAG $\mathcal{G}$ as $\nodes(\mathcal{G})$. The set of edges of a DAG $\mathcal{G}$ will be denoted $\edges(\mathcal{G})$.

Below, we define some terminology about DAGs.


\begin{definition}[Children, Parents, Descendants, Ancestors]
	
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a DAG, and let $u,v,w\in\nodes(\mathcal{G})$.
	
	If $\mathcal{G}$ includes a directed edge $v\rightarrow w$, then $w$ is called a \underline{child} of $v$. Conversely, a node $u$ that has $v$ as a child is called a \underline{parent} of $v$. The set of all children of $v$ is denoted $\ch_{\mathcal{G}}(v)$, while the set of all parents of $v$ is denoted $\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(v)$.
	
	A node $w\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})$ is a \underline{descendant} of $v$ if it can be reached from $v$ by a sequence of nodes through directed edges pointing away from $v$. Conversely, a node $u\in\nodes(\mathcal{G})$ that has $v$ as a descendant is called an \underline{ancestor} of $v$. The set of all descendants of $v$ is denoted $\des_{\mathcal{G}}(v)$, and the set of all ancestors of $v$ is denoted $\an_{\mathcal{G}}(v)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Subgraph]
	\label{def_subgraph}
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ be DAGs. If $\nodes(\mathcal{G}')\subseteq \nodes(\mathcal{G})$ and $\edges(\mathcal{G}')\subseteq\edges(\mathcal{G})$, we say that $\mathcal{G'}$ is a subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$. 
	
	In particular, if we start from $\cal G$ and delete all of the nodes that are \emph{not} in a particular subset $S\in\nodes(\cal G)$ (hence also deleting their incoming and outgoing edges), the resulting induced subgraph will be denoted by $\mathcal{G}_S$. 
\end{definition}

As already noted in the introduction, the causal structures that we consider in this work have two types of nodes: visible nodes, associated with variables that are observed, and latent nodes, associated with variables that are not observed. In order to save the term ``DAG'' for the mathematical object composed of nodes and edges, we define a new object to represent a DAG with a partitioned set of nodes: 


\begin{definition}[Partitioned DAG]
	A \emph{partitioned DAG (pDAG)} $\mathcal{G}$ is a DAG together with a partition of its nodes into two subsets. The first subset is referred to as the set of
	\emph{visible} nodes, denoted $\vis(\cal G)\subseteq \nodes(\cal G)$, and the second subset is referred to as the set of
	\emph{latent} nodes, denoted $\lat(\cal G)\subseteq \nodes(\cal G)$.
\end{definition}

All of the notions defined above for DAGs also apply for pDAGs. In this paper, we denote visible nodes with white backgrounds and latent nodes with grey backgrounds (see, e.g.,  Fig.~\ref{fig_example_constraints}).  A pDAG that is composed only of visible nodes will be called a \emph{latent-free} pDAG. Whenever two visible nodes of a pDAG are children of the same latent node, we will refer to the latent node as a \emph{confounder} of the two children.

We now define one last preliminary notion, the notion of a set of pDAGs consistent with a fixed ordering of the visible nodes:

\begin{definition}[Set of pDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal Ordering]
	\label{def_nodal_ordering}
	
	Consider a set $S$ of pDAGs, all of which share the same set of visible nodes $\{v_1,...,v_n\}$. We say that $S$ is a \emph{set of pDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering} if there is an ordering of the nodes, $(v_{\Pi(1)},...,v_{\Pi(n)})$ for some permutation $\Pi$, such that every pDAG of $S$ is such that  $v_{\Pi(j)}$ is not an ancestor of $v_{\Pi(i)}$ for all $i,j$ such that $\Pi(i)<\Pi(j)$.
\end{definition}


\subsection{Explaining Observed Data with a Causal Structure}
\label{sec_causal_compatibility}

A natural experiment is one that that passively observes a set of variables over many runs. Such an experiment yields a statistical estimate of the probability distribution over the possible values of these variables. Determining which causal structures could have realized this distribution is the causal discovery problem.


To do so, one has to specify the \emph{semantics} of this causal model\footnote{A causal structure is analogous to syntax in linguistics, which is the structural form of a sentence, while the semantics of a causal model is the analogue of semantics in linguistics.  Semantics refers to a specific choice of objects that follow the structure defined by the syntax. In linguistics, semantics provides the meanings of the terms in a sentence.  In causal modelling, it provides the parameters of the model. 
	We thank Nick Ormrod for the suggestion of this terminology.}, a description of what type of entities are associated to the nodes, and what type of mechanism determines how each node depends causally on its parents in the DAG, and of how to parametrize statistical uncertainty.

In this work, we will only consider causal model semantics of the  \emph{classical} type, wherein the  entities that are associated with nodes are classical random variables. An alternative possibility, however, is the semantics used in quantum causal modelling. There, the entities that can be associated with nodes are quantum systems, each of which is described by a Hilbert space\footnote{The analogue of the cardinality of a random variable is the dimension of this Hilbert space.  The analogue of an error variable of a given cardinality is an ancillary quantum system of a given dimension, and the analogue of a distribution over the error variable is a quantum state of the ancillary system. Finally, the analogue of a functional dependence between classical random variables is a unitary channel between quantum systems.}. See Refs.~\cite{chaves_informationtheoretic_2015, elie_quantum_inflation, Smith_fullyquantuminf} for works on the causal discovery problem in causal models with quantum semantics.  


The variables associated with visible nodes will be called \emph{visible variables}, and the variables associated with latent nodes will be called \emph{latent variables}. For each $a\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})$, we denote the associated variable by $X_a$, and for a set $S$ of nodes, we denote the associated joint variable by $X_S$.  The set of all possible values of $X_a$, termed its \emph{state space}, is denoted $\mathcal{X}_a$. In this work, we will assume that each variable has a discrete and finite number of possible outcomes.
Under this assumption, 
the cardinality of each $\mathcal{X}_a$ is a natural number, so that the set of such cardinalities can be specified by a vector $\vec c\in \mathbb{N}^{|\nodes(\mathcal{G})|}$, where $|S|$ denotes the cardinality of a set $S$. The semantics of a causal model includes a specification of $\vec c$, the cardinality of the variables.  

 We also associate to each $a\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})$ a random variable $E_a$, called an error variable, whose state space is denoted by $\mathcal{E}_a$.  The variable $X_a$ is determined by its associated error variable $E_a$ and its causal parents $X_{\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(a)}$ via a function $f_a:\mathcal{X}_{\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(a)}\times \mathcal{E}_a\rightarrow \mathcal{X}_a$, that is, 
\begin{equation}
	X_a=f_a(X_{\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(a)},E_a) 
\end{equation}
Finally, to each error variable $E_a$, one associates a probability distribution $P(E_a)$ that stipulates how $E_a$  is sampled. Thus, the inclusion of the error variable $E_a$ allows for $X_a$ to respond probabilistically to $X_{\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(a)}$, even though $f_a$ is a deterministic function.

The cardinality of 
the visible, latent and error variables, the functions, and the error-variable distributions are jointly termed the {\em parameters} of the causal model:
\begin{equation}
	\param =  \{ (|\mathcal{X}_a|,|\mathcal{E}_a|,f_a , P(E_a)) : a\in\nodes (\mathcal{G})\} 
\end{equation}



The semantics of the causal model stipulates the scope of possibilities for $\param$.  For instance, the error variables could all be continuous, the functional dependences could all be linear, and the error-variable distributions could all be Gaussian. 
It could also be the case that the scope of possibilities for $\param$ is unrestricted. When this is the case,
we will say that the semantics is {\em classical unrestricted}.   Note that there are still different options of classical unrestricted semantics, corresponding to different choices of cardinalities of the visible, latent and error variables. 


In all of this work, we will be dealing only with classical unrestricted semantics. In general, one might be interested in the distributions over visible variables realizable by a pDAG for different types of classical unrestricted semantics; for example, when the latent nodes are associated with classical random variables that have specific fixed cardinalities. In the causal inference literature, the case of most common interest is when the latent nodes are allowed to take arbitrary cardinalities. We now turn to the notion of realizability of observational data under this type of model.






\begin{definition}[Set of probability distributions with cardinality vector $\vec c_\text{vis}$ realizable by a pDAG by a causal model with classical unrestricted semantics under arbitrary cardinality of the latent variables]
	\label{SEP_definition}
	
	
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG. Associate it to a causal model with classical unrestricted semantics where the visible variables $\{X_v:v\in \vis(\mathcal{G})\}$ have cardinalities given by the vector  $\vec c_\text{vis}\in \mathbb{N}^{|\vis(\mathcal{G})|}$, and the latent variables are allowed to take arbitrary cardinalities. 
	
	The set of  probability distributions on the visible variables that are realizable under passive observation by $\cal G$ for this causal semantics, denoted $\mathcal{M(G},\vec c_\text{vis})$, is the set of all probability distributions $P$ over $X_{\vis(\cal G)}$ that can be obtained as
	\begin{align}
		&P(X_{\vis(\mathcal{G})}) \nonumber\\
		&=\sum_{X_{\lat(\mathcal{G})}}\sum_{E_{\nodes(\mathcal{G})}}  
		\prod_{a\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})}  \delta_{X_a, f_a(X_{\pa_{\mathcal{G}}(a)},E_a) } P(E_a)
		\label{eq_realizability}
	\end{align}
	for some choice of parameters, i.e., for some choice of the set $\{(|\mathcal{X}_a|,|\mathcal{E}_a|, f_a, P(E_a)) : a\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})\}$.
\end{definition}



We will refer to a distribution that is realizable by a pDAG  under arbitrary cardinality of the latent variables simply as a distribution that is realizable by that pDAG. 

If a given probability distribution over visible variables is not realizable in 
a certain causal structure, then this causal structure is \emph{not} a valid causal explanation for the statistical data on these variables. Causal structures that can realize \emph{all} the probability distributions over the visible variables are called \emph{saturated}.


The set $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_{\text{vis}})$ for a pDAG $\cal G$ is defined with respect to a specific assignment of the cardinalities of the visible variables. It is useful to consider the tuple of possibilities for this assignment, and the corresponding tuple of probability distributions that are realizable for each possibility.  
Since this tuple contains all the information that can be extracted from the causal structure by passive observations, we call it the \emph{observational profile} of that structure:

\begin{definition}[Observational profile]
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG. The \emph{observational profile} of $\cal G$, denoted $\Mtower(\mathcal{G})$, is the tuple
	\begin{equation}
		\Mtower{(\mathcal{G})} \coloneqq \left\{ \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec{c}_\text{vis} ): \vec c_\text{vis} \in\mathbb{N}^{|\vis(\mathcal{G})|}\right\}, 
	\end{equation}
	that describes the set of realizable distributions over the visible variables of $\mathcal{G}$ for each choice $\vec c_\text{vis}$ of their cardinalities.
\end{definition}

The mathematical constraints on the set of realizable probability distributions of a given causal structure can be sorted into trivial and nontrivial types. The trivial type merely follows from positivity of probabilities and normalization.
The nontrivial types of constraint are those that are implied by the causal structure, and are termed \emph{causal-compatibility constraints}. Using the observational profile, as we will see now, it is possible to classify pDAGs based on the types of causal-compatibility constraints that they present.

The set $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_{\text{vis}})$ is subject to both trivial and nontrivial constraints. To focus on the latter, we define $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ as the set obeying \emph{only} the nontrivial constraints. Note  that, geometrically, $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ can be recovered from $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ simply by restricting the latter to the simplex defined by the positivity and normalization constraints. 
Out of the trivial constraints, normalization is a linear equality and positivity is a linear inequality.  In Ref.~\cite{Rosset_Bound}, it is proven that for classical causal models, all nontrivial causal-compatibility constraints also take the form of polynomial equalities or inequalities.  If all such constraints are equalities, then the set $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ is an {\em algebraic set} (also termed an algebraic variety), whereas if there are inequality constraints, then it is a {\em semi-algebraic set}.\footnote{Note that the set $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c)$, unlike $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{G},\vec c)$, is {\em always} a semi-algebraic set simply because the positivity constraints are inequality constraints. } 
It is convenient to use this distinction to define a dichotomy among pDAGs.


\begin{definition}[Algebraicness]
	A pDAG $\mathcal{G}$  will be said to be \algebraic if, for every element $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ of $\Mtower(\mathcal{G})$, all nontrivial causal-compatibility constraints are equality constraints, or, equivalently, if the set $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$ (wherein one has dropped the trivial constraints of positivity and normalization relative to  $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$) is an algebraic set.  Otherwise,  $\mathcal{G}$ is said to be \nonalgebraic.
\end{definition}

As established by Ref.~\cite{dsep_complete}, the only causal-compatibility constraints that are implied by a {\em latent-free} pDAG $\mathcal{G}$ are conditional independence relations, which are equality constraints that are valid regardless of the choice of cardinalities. Hence, all latent-free pDAGs are \algebraic. 
One example of a \nonalgebraic pDAG is the causal structure appearing
in Bell's theorem~\cite{Bell_1964}, because this structure implies causal-compatibility constraints that take the form of inequalities, namely, Bell inequalities~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens}. As we will see later on, the classification of pDAGs under observational equivalence and dominance is highly pertinent to the question of which pDAGs are \algebraic and which are \nonalgebraic. 

The terminology of \algebraic/\nonalgebraic causal structures was introduced in Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023}. Note, however, that we have here been more explicit than in Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023} about the fact that this distinction relies on the observational profile of a pDAG, that is, the tuple obtained by looking at all possible cardinalities of the visible variables. This emphasis on cardinality is important because the presence of certain inequality constraints might depend on the choice of cardinalities of the visible variables. For example, the Bonet inequalities~\cite{Bonet_Instrumental} for the instrumental scenario (first pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_pDAG}) are constraints on distributions where the instrumental variable (associated to node $a$ in Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_pDAG}) has cardinality at least $3$. On the other hand, Pearl's instrumental inequalities~\cite{Pearl_Instrumental} for the same pDAG have to be satisfied even when all variables have binary cardinalities.

Our definition of \algebraicness is such that a pDAG only needs to present inequality constraints for \emph{one} choice of cardinalities of the visible variables to be considered \nonalgebraic; as of now, however, we do not have any known example of a pDAG that is definitively \nonalgebraic while also being free of inequality constraints at binary cardinalities of the visible variables. In Section~\ref{sec_4}, we will present possible candidates for such an example: the causal structures of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(d) are known to present inequality constraints at cardinalities $\vec c_\text{vis}=(3,2,2,2)$, but we still do not know if they present inequality constraints at cardinalities $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$. 

Unlike inequality constraints, the validity of equality constraints imposed by causal structures is independent of the cardinality of the visible variables. Furthermore, it is much easier to obtain equality constraints than inequality constraints.  The simplest type of equality constraints, namely the conditional independence relations, can be obtained from a graphical criterion called the \emph{d-separation criterion}~\cite{verma_pearl, Geiger1988}.  Given a pDAG $\mathcal{G}$ and three disjoint sets of visible nodes $A,B,C\in \nodes(\mathcal{G})$, the criterion returns whether $A$ and $B$ are ``d-separated'' by $C$ or not. The affirmative case is denoted by $A\dsep B|C$. As shown in Ref.~\cite{verma_pearl} and reproduced in Theorem \ref{th:d-sep} below, a d-separation relation of a pDAG implies that the realizable distributions have to satisfy an associated conditonal independence relation. In a certain distribution $P$, the variable $X_A$ is said to be independent of the variable $X_B$ after conditioning on the variable $X_C$ if: 
\begin{equation}
	P(X_A X_B|X_C)=P(X_A|X_C)P(X_B|X_C).
\end{equation}
Such a conditional independence relation is denoted by $X_A \dbot X_B |X_C$.

\begin{theorem}[d-separation and conditional independence]
	\label{th:d-sep}
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG, and associate it to a classical unrestricted semantics under arbitrary cardinalities of the latent variables. Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be three disjoint subsets of the set of visible nodes, $\vis(\cal G)$. Then:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $P$ is a probability distribution over $X_{\vis(\mathcal{G})}$ realizable by $\mathcal{G}$, then $A\dsep B|C$ in $\mathcal{G}$ implies that $X_A \dbot X_B |X_C$ in $P$.
		\item If $X_A \dbot X_B |X_C$ for \underline{every} probability distribution over $X_{\vis(\mathcal{G})}$ that is realizable by $\mathcal{G}$, then $A\dsep B|C$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{theorem}


As an example, both pDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_constraints} present the d-separation relation $a\dsep c|b$, and thus Theorem \ref{th:d-sep} implies that any distribution realizable by these DAGs must satisfy the conditional independence constraint $X_a \dbot X_b |X_c$.





\subsection{Observational Equivalence and Dominance}

The central objective of this work is to determine the observational equivalence and dominance relations that hold between pDAGs, and so we turn now to defining these formally.


\begin{definition}[Observational dominance and equivalence of pDAGs]
	\label{def_obs_equivalence}
	Let $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ be latent-permitting pDAGs such that $\vis(\mathcal{G})=\vis(\mathcal{G}')$. We say that $\mathcal{G}$ \emph{observationally dominates} $\mathcal{G}'$ when the set of realizable distributions of  $\mathcal{G}$ includes the set of realizable distributions of  $\mathcal{G}'$, regardless of the  cardinalities of the visible variables. That is, when
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}',\vec c_\text{vis}) \subseteq   \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis}) \quad \forall \vec c_\text{vis} \in \mathbb{N}^{|\vis(\mathcal{G})|}
	\end{equation}
	or equivalently, when
	\begin{equation}
		\Mtower(\cal G')\subseteq_\text{ew}\Mtower(\cal G),
	\end{equation}
	where $\subseteq_\text{ew}$ denotes element-wise set inclusion.
	The observational dominance relation is denoted by $\mathcal{G}\succeq\mathcal{G}'$.
	
	We say that $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{observationally equivalent} to $\mathcal{G}'$ when
	
	\begin{equation}\label{obsequiv1}
		\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}',\vec c_\text{vis}) =  \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis}) \quad \forall \vec c_\text{vis} \in \mathbb{N}^{|\vis(\mathcal{G})|}
	\end{equation}
	or equivalently, when
	\begin{equation}\label{obsequiv2}
		\Mtower(\cal G')=_\text{ew}\Mtower(\cal G),
	\end{equation}
 The observational equivalence relation is denoted by $\mathcal{G}\cong\mathcal{G}'$. 
	
	If $\mathcal{G}\succeq\mathcal{G}'$ but $\mathcal{G}\not\cong\mathcal{G}'$,
	we say that $\mathcal{G}$ \emph{strictly dominates} $\mathcal{G}'$ and denote this relation as $\mathcal{G}\succ\mathcal{G}'$.
	If $\mathcal{G}\not\succeq\mathcal{G}'$ and $\mathcal{G}'\not\succeq\mathcal{G}$, we say that $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ are \emph{incomparable}.
\end{definition}

Note that to prove observational equivalence,  one must demonstrate  that Eq.~\eqref{obsequiv1} holds true, which requires demonstrating equality for all possible cardinalities of the visible nodes.
To prove observational {\em in}equivalence, on the other hand, it suffices to show that $\exists \vec c_\text{vis}\in \mathbb{N}^{\vis(\mathcal{G})} :\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})\ne \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}',\vec c_\text{vis})$, that is, it suffices to demonstrate inequality for just one particular assignment of cardinalities. 
An example of two pDAGs
that are observationally equivalent to each other was given in Fig.~\ref{fig_example_constraints}.  Another example, involving \nonalgebraic pDAGs, is given in Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_pDAG}; the observational equivalence of the three pDAGs there presented will be formally justified in Section~\ref{sec_back_to_3visible}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/instrumental_pDAG.pdf}
	\caption{An example of \nonalgebraic pDAGs that are observationally equivalent. The first of this triple is generally known as the \emph{instrumental scenario}.} 
	\label{fig_instrumental_pDAG} 
\end{figure}


Recall that if two pDAGs are observationally equivalent, they impose the same set of causal-compatibility constraints on the  
probability distributions over the visible variables. Therefore, it is clear that all of the pDAGs that are observationally equivalent to an \algebraic pDAG are also \algebraic, and all of the pDAGs that are observationally equivalent to a \nonalgebraic pDAG are also \nonalgebraic.


Note  that observational equivalence is \emph{not} the same as Markov equivalence~\cite{Verma_Pearl_equivalence1990,Ayesha_Markov}. Two pDAGs are Markov equivalent if their sets of conditional independence constraints are the same. For two pDAGs to be observationally equivalent, on the other hand, their entire set of causal-compatibility constraints (including conditional independence constraints, nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints) need to coincide.
 


\subsection{mDAGs}

In this section, we recall the notion of an mDAG, defined in Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}. For each mDAG, we can associate a set of pDAGs. The pDAGs in such a set are not only observationally equivalent, but equivalent under any interventional probing scheme~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}.
That is, if two pDAGs are associated with the same mDAG, then they cannot be distinguished even when there is access to data from observations and arbitrary interventions. Therefore, the mDAG is a fundamental object in the causal discovery problem with latent variables. Note, however, that observational equivalence does not imply equivalence of the mDAG structure: there are different mDAGs which are observationally equivalent. 

The definition of an mDAG is motivated by two graphical operations defined in Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, here referred to as \emph{exogenization of latent nodes} and \emph{removal of redundant latent nodes}. Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016} showed that these two graphical operations preserve the observational profile. That is, any two pDAGs related by such an operation are observationally equivalent. These operations are discussed separately from the rest of the rules for showing observational equivalence (which will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec_show_equivalence}) because they are more fundamental: as Ref.~\cite{ansanelli2024everything} showed, two pDAGs related by these operations are also indistinguishable under access to the strongest possible probing schemes on the visible variables, that is, the ones that include interventions and thus reveal the maximum amount of information about the causal structure and causal parameters. In this paper we are only concerned with observational data, and will not further discuss interventions.      


Before defining these two operations in full generality, we can get a sense of their content by analyzing Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}. In Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(a), we have a pDAG where the latent node $\alpha$ is \emph{endogenous}, since it has parents $\beta$ and $c$ in the pDAG.  It passes information from $\beta$ and $c$ to its children $a$ and $b$. In Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(b), the latent node $\alpha$ does not have parents anymore, but its children $a$ and $b$ now have direct access to the information about $\beta$ and $c$. The operation of transitioning from the pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(a) to that of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(b) is an instance of what we term ``exogenization of latent nodes. It consists in making the latent variables of a pDAG \emph{exogenous} (parentless) while connecting their parents directly to their children.

In Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(b), the latent node $\alpha$ establishes a common cause between $a$ and $b$. On the other hand, the latent node $\beta$ establishes a common cause between $a$, $b$ and $d$. Since we allow the cardinalities of latent variables to be arbitrary (Def.~\ref{SEP_definition}), the latent node $\alpha$ can be absorbed into $\beta$, thus leading to Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(c). The operation of transitioning from the pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(a) to that of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}(b) is an instance of what we term ``removal of redundant latent nodes''. It consists in deleting latent nodes such as $\alpha$, whose set of children is a subset of the set of children of another latent node. The fact that these nodes only establish a confounder between nodes that already had a confounder is what justifies referring to them as redundant.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/exog_removeredund.pdf}
	\caption{(a) A pDAG. (b) The pDAG obtained from (a) by exogenizing the latent node $\alpha$.
		(c) The pDAG obtained from that of (b) by removing the latent node $\alpha$, which is redundant to $\beta$ since the children of $\alpha$ are a subset of the children of $\beta$.
		By Lemmas \ref{lemma_exogenize_latents} and \ref{lemma_remove_redundant_latents}, these three pDAGs are observationally equivalent. The pDAG in (c) is {\tt RE}-reduced.}
\label{fig_example_lemmas} 
\end{figure*}


The proof that these two operations always preserve  observational equivalence was given in Lemmas 3.7 and 3.8 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, reproduced below:

\begin{lemma}[Exogenize Latent Nodes]
\label{lemma_exogenize_latents}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG, and let ${\tt EndoLNodes}(\mathcal{G})\subseteq\lat(\mathcal{G})$ be the set of latent nodes of $\mathcal{G}$ that are endogenous (i.e., they have one or more parents in $\cal G$).  Construct the pDAG ${\tt Exog}(\mathcal{G})$ as follows. For every $u\in {\tt EndoLNodes}(\mathcal{G})$, start from $\mathcal{G}$ and: (i) delete  all directed edges leading into $u$, (ii) add a directed edge from every parent of $u$ to every child of $u$. The pDAG ${\tt Exog}(\mathcal{G})$ so constructed is observationally equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$,  ${\tt Exog}(\mathcal{G})\cong  \mathcal{G}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Remove Redundant Latent Nodes]
\label{lemma_remove_redundant_latents}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG where all latent nodes are exogenous.
Let ${\tt RedundLnodes}(\mathcal{G})\subset\lat(\mathcal{G})$ be a maximal subset of latent nodes such that  their set of children is already common-cause-connected by another latent node. 
(Note that there is ambiguity in the choice, since when two latent nodes have the same set of children, one can take either to be the redundant one.) Formally, we define such a subset of latent nodes of $\cal G$, denoted ${\tt RedundLnodes}(\mathcal{G})$, by the following two conditions:
(i) For every $u \in {\tt RedundLnodes}(\mathcal{G})$ there exists some distinct latent node $v \in \lat(\mathcal{G})$ such that $\ch(u) \subseteq \ch(v)$. (ii) ${\tt RedundLnodes}(\mathcal{G})$ is not a strict subset of any other set of latent nodes that obeys (i).  Let ${\tt RemoveRedund}(\mathcal{G})$ be the pDAG constructed by removing from $\mathcal{G}$ every node in ${\tt RedundLnodes}(\mathcal{G})$. The pDAG ${\tt RemoveRedund}(\mathcal{G})$ so constructed is observationally equivalent to $\cal G$, i.e.,  
${\tt RemoveRedund}(\mathcal{G}) \cong \mathcal{G}$. 
\end{lemma}





For any pDAG $\mathcal{G}$, one can find another pDAG whose latent variables are all exogenous and non-redundant that is observationally equivalent to $\mathcal{G}$. Namely, it is the pDAG ${\tt RemoveRedund}\circ {\tt Exog}(\mathcal{G})$, which we will call the \emph{{\tt RE}-reduction} of $\cal G$. Accordingly, the map {\tt RE-reduce} is defined as:
\begin{align}\label{REreductionmap}
	{\tt RE{-}reduce} := {\tt RemoveRedund}\circ {\tt Exog}
\end{align}
It is easy to see that many different pDAGs have the same {\tt RE}-reduction. A pDAG which is invariant under the {\tt RE{-}reduce} map, i.e., such that $\mathcal{G}={\tt RE{-}reduce}(\cal G)$, will be called a \emph{{\tt RE}-reduced} pDAG.

As noted in~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, this justifies the introduction of a new structure for studying realizable distributions for pDAGs: the \emph{marginalized DAG} (mDAG). The notion of an mDAG makes use of the concept of a \emph{simplicial complex}: 
\begin{definition}[Simplicial complex]
A simplicial complex over a finite set $V$ is a set $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $V$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\{v\}\in \mathcal{B}$ for all $v\in V$;
	\item If $A\subseteq B\subseteq V$ and $B\in \mathcal{B}$, then $A\in \mathcal{B}$.
\end{itemize}
The elements of $\mathcal{B}$ are called faces. The inclusion-maximal elements of a simplicial complex (the faces that are maximal in the order over faces induced by subset inclusion) are called facets.
\end{definition}

An mDAG is a pair $\mathfrak{G}=(\cal D,B)$, where $\cal D$ is a DAG and $\cal B$ is a simplicial complex over the set of nodes of $\cal D$. The DAG $\mathcal{D}$ is called the \emph{directed structure} of $\mathfrak{G}$. The nodes of $\cal D$ will also be referred to as the nodes of $\mathfrak{G}$. The edges of $\cal D$ will be referred to as the directed edges of $\mathfrak{G}$ and denoted ${\tt DirectedEdges}(\mathfrak{G})$.  Here, we will use the font $\mathfrak{G}$ to denote mDAGs, while the font $\cal G$ will continue to be used to denote DAGs and pDAGs. 

With this notion in hand, we can introduce the map $\mdag$ that associates an mDAG to each pDAG:

\begin{definition}[Map $\mdag$ from pDAGs to mDAGs]
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a pDAG, and let  $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$ be the {\tt RE}-reduction of $\mathcal{G}$, i.e., 
$\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = {\tt RE-reduce}(\mathcal{G})$. Recall that $\vis(\tilde{\mathcal{G}})=\vis({\mathcal{G}})$.
The \emph{mDAG associated with $\mathcal{G}$}, denoted by $\mdag(\mathcal{G})$, is the pair $\mathcal{(D,B)}$ where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{D}$ is a DAG such that $\nodes(\mathcal{D})=\vis({\mathcal{G}})$ and whose edges correspond to the edges between the visible nodes of $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$.
	\item $\mathcal{B}$ is a simplicial complex over $\vis({\mathcal{G}})$.        The facets of $\mathcal{B}$ are the maximal subsets of $\vis({\mathcal{G}})$ that 
	are children of the same latent node in $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$, i.e., for each $u\in \lat(\tilde{\mathcal{G}})$, the set $\ch_{\tilde{\mathcal{G}}}(u)$ 
	is a facet of $\mathcal{B}$. 
\end{itemize}    


\end{definition}



The correspondence between a pDAG  and its associated mDAG is exemplified in  Fig.~\ref{fig_mDAG}: each latent node $u$ in the pDAG corresponds to a facet in the mDAG whose elements are the children of $u$ in the pDAG. 
One can conceptualize the mDAG as a hypergraph with two types of edges, namely, the directed edges and a set of undirected hyperedges, where the latter represent the facets of the simplicial complex and are depicted by red loops. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/ex_mDAG.pdf}
\caption{(a) A {\tt RE}-reduced pDAG. (b) The mDAG associated with (a). This mDAG has simplicial complex
	$\mathcal{B}=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{d\},\{a,b\},\{a,d\},\{b,d\},\{a,b,d\}\}$. This is the mDAG associated with all of the pDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_example_lemmas}. The inclusion-maximal element of $\mathcal{B}$ are indicated by the red loop on the mDAG.} 
\label{fig_mDAG}
\end{figure}


When the directed structure of $\mathfrak{G}$ is trivial in the sense of containing no edges, then $\mathfrak{G}$ is said to be \emph{directed-edge-free}. The mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_triangle} are examples of directed-edge-free mDAGs.
Similarly, when the simplicial complex of $\mathfrak{G}$ is trivial in the sense of all its facets being singleton sets,
then $\mathfrak{G}$ is said to be \emph{confounder-free}. Clearly, if the pDAG $\mathcal{G}$ is latent-free, then $\mdag(\cal G)$ is confounder-free.




We now define the notion of \emph{structural dominance} of one mDAG over another.

\begin{definition}[Structural Dominance of mDAGs]
\label{def_structural_dominance}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs with the same sets of nodes. $\mathfrak{G}$ is said to \emph{structurally dominate} $\mathfrak{G}'$ if the following pair of conditions hold: (i) the directed structure of $\mathfrak{G}'$ can be obtained from the directed structure of $\mathfrak{G}$ by dropping edges, ${\tt DirectedEdges}(\mathfrak{G}') \subseteq {\tt DirectedEdges}(\mathfrak{G})$, and  (ii) the simplicial complex of $\mathfrak{G}'$ can be obtained from the simplicial complex of $\mathfrak{G}$ by dropping faces, $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq \mathcal{B}$.  
\end{definition}


Note that the definition of structural dominance requires a subset inclusion relation for the {\em faces}, not the {\em facets} of the simplicial complexes. 
For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig_triangle}, the set of facets 
of the simplicial complex of the mDAG \ref{fig_triangle}(a) 
is not a subset of the set of facets of the simplicial complex  of \ref{fig_triangle}(b), but the set of {\em faces} do stand in a relation of subset inclusion to one another, so that mDAG \ref{fig_triangle}(b) structurally dominates mDAG \ref{fig_triangle}(a). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/Triangle_Saturated.pdf}
	\caption{(a) mDAG with trivial directed structure and with simplicial complex $\mathcal{B}=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\}\}$. (b)  mDAG with trivial directed structure and with simplicial complex $\mathcal{B'}=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}\}$.The facets (inclusion-maximal elements of $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B'}$) are indicated by red loops.} 
	\label{fig_triangle}
\end{figure}



It is well-known that structural dominance of mDAGs implies observational dominance (see, for example, Proposition 3.3(b) in Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016} or Theorem 26.1 in Ref.~\cite{henson_theory-independent_2014}):
\begin{lemma}[Structural dominance $\Rightarrow$ Observational dominance]
\label{prop_edge_dropping}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs with the same sets of nodes. If $\mathfrak{G}$ structurally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, then it also observationally dominates it, i.e.,  $\mathfrak{G}\succeq\mathfrak{G}')$.
\end{lemma}





It is convenient to define a map that takes an mDAG to the {\tt RE}-reduced pDAG that yields it. We will call this the \emph{canonical pDAG} associated with the mDAG:

\begin{definition}[Canonical pDAG]
Let $\mathfrak{G}=(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{B})$ be an mDAG. The map $\can$ is given by the following procedure: starting from $\cal D$, add one latent node $l$ for each \emph{facet} $A\in \cal B$ and add edges from $l$ to each element of $A$ so that $\ch(l)=A$. The resulting pDAG, $\can(\mathfrak{G})$, is the canonical pDAG associated with $\mathfrak{G}$.   
\end{definition}



Note that if $\mathfrak{G}'$ is structurally dominated by  $\mathfrak{G}$, then $\can(\mathfrak{G}')$
is a subgraph (in the sense of Definition \ref{def_subgraph}) of $\can(\mathfrak{G})$.


The results and definitions that we presented for pDAGs are extended to mDAGs through their associated canonical pDAG. For example, if the canonical pDAG of a certain mDAG is \algebraic, we say that the mDAG itself is \algebraic. A pair of mDAGs stands in a relationship of one being a subgraph of another if this relationship holds between their canonical pDAGs. The mDAG associated with the subgraph $\can{(\mathfrak{G})}_S$ for some subset $S\subseteq \nodes({\mathfrak{G}})$ is clearly a subgraph of $\frak G$. We will refer to it as the subgraph of $\frak G$ induced by $S$ and we will denote it by $\mathfrak{G}_S$. When there is a confounder between nodes $a$ and $b$ in the canonical pDAG, i.e., when the simplicial complex of the mDAG has at least one facet that includes nodes $a$ and $b$, then we say that there is a \emph{confounder} between $a$ and $b$ in the mDAG. Similarly, a distribution is realizable by an mDAG if it is realizable by its canonical pDAG, an mDAG observationally dominates another if the observational dominance relation holds for their canonical pDAGs, and so on. 

Lemmas \ref{lemma_exogenize_latents} and \ref{lemma_remove_redundant_latents} imply that whenever two latent-permitting pDAGs $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ are associated with the same mDAG, they are observationally equivalent.  
Note, however, that if two latent-permitting pDAGs $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ are associated to {\em distinct} mDAGs, they may or may not be observationally equivalent.  That is, a difference in the associated mDAGs is necessary but not sufficient for observational inequivalence of pDAGs.  


The set of mDAGs that have a fixed number of nodes can, therefore, be organized into equivalence classes under the observational equivalence relation. These classes are called \emph{observational equivalence classes}. In turn, the observational dominance relation defines a partial order among the observational equivalence classes, which we call the \emph{observational partial order}. Our goal in this work is to  characterize this partial order. 

As will be justified in Section~\ref{sec_temporal_order}, here we will only discuss the observational equivalence classes and the observational partial order that hold for a set of mDAGs that are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, in the sense of Def.~\ref{def_nodal_ordering}. The simplest example of an observational partial order of this type is the one for mDAGs with two nodes. There are four mDAGs of two nodes that are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. Three of these are saturating, i.e, the set of probability distributions over the visible variables that are realizable by them
is the set of \emph{all} such distributions. 
The remaining mDAG is the one where the two nodes are disconnected. 
For it, the set of realizable 
distributions is the set of all \emph{factorizing} distributions.
Therefore, the partial order is the one depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_2_node_classes}: the three mDAGs with connected nodes make up one observational equivalence class, 
termed the {\tt Saturated} class, while the mDAG with disconnected nodes defines the {\tt Factorizing} class, and the former observationally dominates the latter.

\section{Objectives and Methods}
\label{sec_objectives}


\subsection{Restriction of scope to sets of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering}
\label{sec_temporal_order}

In this work, we will take the nodal ordering of the visible variables to be fixed, and we will only compare candidate causal structures for which the visible nodes are consistent with this nodal ordering. There are several reasons why we restrict the set of causal structures appearing in our classification in this way. As we argued in Ref.~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}:

	Clearly, if the variables of interest are temporally localized (and we do not need to take into account relativity theory, such as the possibility of space-like separation), then they will necessarily be temporally ordered.  The reason typically given for why fixed nodal ordering should {\em not} be presumed~\cite[Section 7.5.1]{causality_pearl} is that the variables of interest may fail to be temporally localized, referring instead to properties that persist over time. An individual's health and their exercise regime provides a good example. However, whenever the variables of interest are of this type, they can have a mutual influence on one another, and consequently one cannot restrict attention to directed graphs that are {\em acyclic} when considering the possibilities for the causal structure holding between them. Thus, if one is contemplating a causal discovery algorithm that returns only acyclic graphs (as we are doing here), then one should not apply it to variables that fail to be temporally localized. 
\end{quote}

One could still argue that, although the visible variables are temporally localized, for some reason we do not know the temporal order in which they were probed. However, one needs to have some knowledge about the probing scheme to be confident that it consists purely of passive observations. Situations where this is the case but one remains ignorant of when each variable was probed are likely to be the exception rather than the rule.



\subsection{Special Cases: Confounder-free and Directed-edge-free mDAGs}
\label{sec_confounder_free_directededge_free}

In this section, we discuss two special cases whose observational partial order is completely solved for any number of visible nodes: the case of confounder-free mDAGs and the case of directed-edge-free mDAGs.

Most of the causal inference literature studying observational equivalence discusses only confounder-free mDAGs, or, equivalently, only latent-free pDAGs~\cite{Verma_Pearl_equivalence1990,Andersson, Chickering_greedy}. That literature, however, classifies the set of such mDAGs for \emph{all} nodal orderings of the visible nodes rather than a fixed one. When we restrict our attention to one nodal ordering of the visible nodes, the organization of confounder-free mDAGs into observational equivalence classes is trivial: for a given nodal ordering of the nodes, if two confounder-free mDAGs are different then they are observationally inequivalent. This fact seems to be well-known; it is noted, for instance, below Theorem 1.2.8 in Ref.~\cite{causality_pearl}. We also provided a proof of this fact in the Appendix C of our previous work~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}. Here, we adapt this proof to show something more, that finding the observational \emph{partial order} is also simple when one is restricted to the confounder-free mDAGs for a fixed nodal ordering of the nodes:
\begin{proposition}
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two confounder-free mDAGs that are consistent with the same nodal ordering. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$ if and only if it structurally dominates it.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	The ``if'' side follows from Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}. To prove the ``only if'' side, assume that $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} structurally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$. Since they are confounder-free, this implies that there is an arrow between two nodes that is present in $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not in $\mathfrak{G}$. In the  Appendix C of  Ref.~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}, we showed that this implies that there is a d-separation relation that is implied by  $\mathfrak{G}$ but not by  $\mathfrak{G}'$. By Theorem~\ref{th:d-sep}, this implies that there are probability distributions that are realizable by  $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not by  $\mathfrak{G}$, thus implying that  $\mathfrak{G}$  \emph{does not}  observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$. 
\end{proof}

Therefore, the observational partial order of the set of confounder-free mDAGs with a fixed nodal ordering is simply the partial order defined by structural dominance. The case of for 3-node and 4-node mDAGs of this type are shown in Figures 7.3(a) and 7.5 of Ref.~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}.

For the case of directed-edge-free mDAGs, the concept of nodal ordering is not relevant, since none of the visible nodes is an ancestor of any other visible node. In Proposition 6.8 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, it was shown that two different directed-edge-free mDAGs are always observationally inequivalent. Here, we extend this idea to show that observational dominance for directed-edge-free mDAGs is  determined by structural dominance:
\begin{restatable}{proposition}{OH}
		Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two directed-edge-free mDAGs. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$ if and only if it structurally dominates it.
	\label{directed_edge_free_dominance}
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
	The ``if'' side follows from Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}. To prove the ``only if'' side, assume that $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} structurally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$. Since they are directed-edge-free, this implies that there is a face that is present in the simplicial complex of $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not in the simplicial complex of $\mathfrak{G}$. That is, there is a set $S$ of visible nodes in $\can(\mathfrak{G}')$ that shares a latent common cause, while it does not share a latent common cause in $\can(\mathfrak{G})$. Since there are no arrows between visible nodes, this implies that the nodes in $S$ share a common ancestor in  $\can(\mathfrak{G}')$ but not in  $\can(\mathfrak{G})$.
	
	In Example 2 of Ref.~\cite{steudel_ay_2015}, it was shown that a distribution where all the variables $\{X_1,...,X_n\}$ are perfectly correlated, i.e., where the only points with nonzero weight are those where $X_1=X_2=...=X_n$, is only realizable by causal structures where all the nodes corresponding to such variables share a common ancestor. Therefore,  $\can(\mathfrak{G}')$ can explain perfect correlation between the variables of $X_S$, while  $\can(\mathfrak{G})$ cannot. Thus, $\mathfrak{G}$  \emph{does not}  observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$. 
\end{proof}

Therefore, the observational partial order of directed-edge-free mDAGs is the partial order defined by structural dominance. The case of for 3-node and 4-node mDAGs of this type are shown in Figures 7.3(b) and 7.6 of Ref.~\cite{ansanelli2024everything}.

\subsection{Full Solution of Observational Partial Order for 3-node mDAGs}
\label{sec_3_observed_nodes}


Now, let us turn to the problem of classifying the entire set of mDAGs with a given number of nodes and a fixed nodal ordering. As we will see, this problem is still open for a general number of nodes: we do not yet know the necessary and sufficient conditions for two mDAGs to be observationally equivalent or to observationally dominate each other in the case of an arbitrary number of nodes.


For mDAGs with two nodes, of course, this problem is completely solved but the solution is  rather trivial, as we saw in Fig.~\ref{fig_2_node_classes}.  For mDAGs with three nodes, the problem is also completely solved, but the solution is more interesting in this case. 
In this section, we will describe this order; the proofs of the ordering relations are postponed to Section~\ref{sec_back_to_3visible}.

There are 72 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering.
In Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, we group these into observational equivalence classes, and present the observational dominance relations that hold among the classes. In order to avoid having to explicitly label the nodes throughout the figure, we adopt a simplifying convention wherein the position of the node in a certain mDAG indicates its label: in each mDAG the bottom node is $a$, the top-left node is $b$ and the top-right node is $c$. All of the mDAGs of this figure follow the nodal ordering $(a,b,c)$. In this figure, the highest elements in the observational partial order appear at the top of the diagram and the lowest elements appear at the bottom, and if one class dominates another with no classes falling between them in the observational partial order, we draw a line from the former to the latter.

\subsection{Significance of observational partial order for causal discovery}\label{significanceforcausaldiscovery}

\subsubsection{Model selection for probability distributions}

We recall the problem of causal discovery:
the input data is a sample from a probability distribution over visible variables obtained from passive observations, and the objective is to determine the causal structures that can provide an  
explanation of this data.  We here explain how knowing the observational partial order is useful for this problem. 

We begin with a limiting case of the causal discovery problem, namely, wherein the sample is infinite-run rather than finite-run.  Only in this case 
do the relative frequencies computed from the input data reflect the true probability distribution, whereas in the case of finite-run data, the relative frequencies merely yield an {\em estimate} of the true probability distribution.  In other words, we begin by considering the version of the causal discovery problem wherein the input is the true probability distribution.

The most basic respect in which the observational partial order is relevant to this problem is the following. If one determines that a distribution is not realizable by a particular mDAG $\frak G$, then one can conclude that it is also not realizable by any of the mDAGs that are {\em below} $\frak G$ in the observational partial order.
  Similarly, if one determines that a given distribution {\em is} realizable by a particular mDAG $\frak G'$, then one can conclude that it is also realizable by any of the mDAGs that are {\em above} $\frak G'$ in the observational partial order.

It is useful here to make use of the notions of {\em upward closure} and {\em downward closure} of a set of elements in a partial order. 
If $S$ denotes a set of elements of a partial order, then the upward closure of $S$, denoted ${\rm UC}(S)$, includes every $x$ such that $x\succeq y$ for some $y\in S$. 
 Similarly, the downward closure of $S$, denoted ${\rm DC}(S)$,  includes every $x$ such that $x\preceq y$ for some $y\in S$. 

Using these notions, if a distribution is known to be realizable by all of the mDAGs of a set $S$, then one can infer that it is also realizable by all of the mDAGs of ${\rm UC}(S)$. 
Similarly, if a distribution is known to {\em not} be realizable by any mDAG in a set $S'$, then one can infer that it is also not realizable by any mDAG in ${\rm DC}(S')$. 
 If the union of ${\rm UC}(S)$ and ${\rm DC}(S')$ is not the full set of mDAGs, then the remaining mDAGs are those for which one remains uncertain whether they can realize the distribution or not.  Note that to specify what one knows about realizability, it suffices to specify the least elements of ${\rm UC}(S)$ and the greatest elements of ${\rm DC}(S')$.  In general, each of these will be a set of incomparable elements.
 
The observational partial order of 3-node mDAGs, depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, helps to illustrate the idea. For instance,  it could be known that a probability distribution over three variables is realizable by {\tt Collider C} but not by {\tt Instrumental CAB} or {\tt Instrumental ABC}.
 In this case, one can infer that it is realizable by the upward closure of {\tt Collider C}, namely, {\tt Collider C}, {\tt Triangle} and {\tt Saturated}, and one can infer that it is not realizable by the downward closure of  {\tt Instrumental CAB} or {\tt Instrumental ABC}.  Meanwhile it will remain unknown whether it is realizable by any mDAG that is in neither of these sets, namely, {\tt Instrumental ABC} and {\tt Evans}. 


Among all of the mDAGs that are compatible with a distribution, one might wonder whether any one of them provides as good of a causal explanation as any other.  It is generally thought that this is not the case and that one should prefer causal structures that are lower in the observational partial order.


For instance, in Pearl's textbook on causality~\cite{causality_pearl}, he argues for this on the grounds that such causal models are 
more falsifiable.\footnote{For instance, on p.~46 of Ref.~\cite{causality_pearl}, he states: 
``such theories are more constraining and thus more falsifiable; they provide the scientist with less opportunities to overfit the data `hindsightedly' and therefore command greater credibility if a fit is found.''}
Indeed, Pearl does not introduce any language for referring to observational dominance besides the language of preference.  (Pearl's order relation of preference is opposite to the order relation of observational dominance in the sense that $\mathfrak{G}$ is preferred to $\mathfrak{G}'$ just in case $\mathfrak{G}'$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$.)


According to this proposal, the causal structures providing the best explanation of the distribution are the  {\em least elements} in the upward-closed set of classes that can realize it.  
This is referred to as the principle of {\em minimality} in Ref.~\cite{causality_pearl}  (see Definition 2.3.4).

It is worth noting that preferring causal models that satisfy the principle of {\em faithfulness}~\cite{spirtes2001causation} (referred to as {\em stability} in Ref.~\cite{causality_pearl} and {\em no fine-tuning} in Ref.~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens}) is an instance of preferring classes lower in the observational partial order.  





\subsubsection{Model selection for finite-run samples of probability distributions}

We now turn to the problem of causal discovery based on finite-run data. 
To adjudicate between different hypotheses about the causal structure, it is useful to use a standard technique of statistical model selection: 
apply a train-and-test methodology to determine which hypothesis has the most predictive power, which is to say the lowest test error.  Note that a structure $\mathfrak{G}'$ can have a higher test error than $\mathfrak{G}$
because it underfits the data while $\mathfrak{G}$ does not, but it may also have a higher test error because it \emph{overfits} the data relative to $\mathfrak{G}$.


In the train-and-test methodology, the ensemble of observational data is divided into two sets, the first one being the \emph{training set} and the second one being the \emph{test set}. 
For each of the candidate causal structures, we find the parameters 
 that provide the best fit to the training set. 
 One then compares the predictions of this best-fit model to the data in the test set to compute the test error. 
One can then compare the test error of different causal structures to compare their predictive power. 
Consider a comparison of two causal structures, $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$.  If $\mathfrak{G}'$ has a higher test error than $\mathfrak{G}$ but a lower training error, then this suggests that $\mathfrak{G}'$ \emph{overfits} the data relative to $\mathfrak{G}$.  
 The causal model associated to $\mathfrak{G}'$ is likely mistaking statistical fluctuations in the training data  for real features while $\mathfrak{G}$ is not. Fitting to these fluctuations leads to a lower training error for $\mathfrak{G}'$, but  given that the test data has different fluctuations from the training data, $\mathfrak{G}'$ is led to make worse predictions for the test data.\footnote{ This is similar to the way in which the error of a polynomial fit to training data can be made to decrease by increasing the order of the polynomial, but because this low error is achieved by treating statistical fluctuations as real features, the fit will tend to have a large error for the test data.}. This train-and-test methodology was applied in Ref.~\cite{daley_experimentally} to adjudicate between different causal explanations of finite-run data in a quantum experiment that violated Bell inequalities. 



We now turn to the significance of the observational partial order for such a train-and-test methodology.

If a causal structure $\mathfrak{G}$ {\em underfits} the finite-run data, i.e., if both the train and the test errors are large, 
 then so too will all the causal structures that are  below it in the observational partial order. The reason is as follows.  For  $\mathfrak{G}$ to {\em underfit} the finite-run data means that the finite-run data is improbable relative to all of the probability distributions realizable by $\mathfrak{G}$, i.e., it is unlikely that the finite-run data came from sampling from one of the  probability distributions realizable by $\mathfrak{G}$.  
 But for all of the causal structures  below $\mathfrak{G}$ in the observational partial order, the set of probability distributions that they can realize is a {\em strict subset} of those that can be realized by $\mathfrak{G}$, and therefore the finite-run data must be improbable relative to all these distributions as well.  
 
 An analogous result holds for overfitting.  Suppose $\mathfrak{G}'$ is  above $\mathfrak{G}$ is the observational partial order. If $\mathfrak{G}'$ overfits the data relative to $\mathfrak{G}$, then everything {\em above} $\mathfrak{G}'$ in the order {\em also} overfits the data relative to $\mathfrak{G}$.  The reason is that the extra expressive power of $\mathfrak{G}'$ relative to $\mathfrak{G}$ (i..e., the additional probability distributions realizable by $\mathfrak{G}'$) is what must 
 lead $\mathfrak{G}'$ to mistake statistical fluctuations for real features. But this extra expressive power is also present in all the structures  above $\mathfrak{G}'$ in the observational partial order, and so these must be led to make the same mistake.




Note that if $\mathfrak{G}$ fits the finite-run data, and $\mathfrak{G}'$ is a causal structure higher in the observational order, then $\mathfrak{G}'$ {\em  does not necessarily} overfit the data relative to $\mathfrak{G}$ simply by virtue of having additional expressive power.   This is because the extra expressive power may be of a type that does not lead $\mathfrak{G}'$ to mistake statistical fluctuations for real features.  In this case,  $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ will have roughly {\em equal} test errors. 
This point was emphasized in Ref.~\cite{daley2024reply}, in response to an article claiming the contrary (that one model being  more expressive than another generically {\em did} cause the first to overfit the data relative to relative to the second.)
Nonetheless, it is worth considering the question of the circumstances in which one causal structure {\em does} tend to overfit the data relative to a causal structure that is directly below it in the observational partial order.  


One such circumstance is if the lower causal structure implies an equality constraint on the realizable distributions that does not hold in the higher causal structure.  Suppose that data is generated from  the lower causal structure.  Because it is finite-run, the equality constraint will generically not be satisfied exactly---there will be statistical fluctuations away from its exact satisfaction.  Because the higher causal structure can realize distributions that violate the equality constraint, it can fall into the trap of mistaking such fluctuations for real features. 

Consider, for example, the pair of observational equivalence classes {\tt Collider C} and {\tt Triangle}. 
The class  {\tt Collider C}  presents the d-separation relation $a\perp_{d} b$, so the set of  distributions on three variables that are realizable by causal structures in that class satisfy 
$X_a \dbot X_b$, that is, the equality constraint $P(X_a X_b) = P(X_a)P(X_b)$.  This describes an algebraic variety in the space of probability distribution that has a smaller dimension than the full space.  The set of distributions realizable by the class {\tt Triangle}, on the other hand, is \emph{not} confined to this variety. Now suppose finite-run data is generated by a causal structure in the class {\tt Collider C}, and that due to statistical fluctuation, the relative frequencies describe a point slightly outside of this variety.  A causal structure in the {\tt Triangle} class can fit this finite-run data to a probability distribution that is outside of this variety, and thereby  interpret the statistical fluctuation as a real feature. 
 Clearly, the {\tt Saturated} class is \emph{also} prone to such overfitting, given that the set of distributions realizable by it are also not confined to this variety. 
 An example of this type, but involving a pair of 4-node mDAGs,
 is discussed in Ref.~\cite{daley_experimentally} where such a train-and-test methodology is implemented on  data from a quantum experiment. 

A second circumstance in which one causal structure may overfit finite-run data relative to a causal structure that is directly below it in the observational partial order is when the two are distinguished by an inequality constraint.  An inequality constraint does not lower the dimension of the space of realizable distributions, but it creates a boundary below which the distribution is realizable, and above which it is not. In this case, overfitting can arise when the causal structure generating the data implies an inequality constraint, but statistical fluctuations are taking the finite-run relative frequencies outside the boundary.

Suppose, for instance, that the {\tt Instrumental BAC} class fits the data well, while the {\tt Evans} class overfits it relative to {\tt Instrumental BAC}. Because {\tt Instrumental BAC} only has inequality constraints, it must be that statistical fluctuations away from their satisfaction in the finite-run data are being mistaken by  {\tt Evans}  for genuine features, and leading to a high test error. 

Of course, the data generated must be very close to the boundary described by the inequality constraint in order for statistical fluctuations to lead to a violation of this constraint in the finite-run relative frequencies.  Consequently, we do not expect this circumstance to arise for generic parameter values (most of which lead to distributions that lie far from the boundary).
The possibility of this type of overfitting is discussed further in Appendix A.2 of Ref.~\cite{daley2024reply}.



\subsubsection{Attesting to the presence of inequality constraints}
\label{sec_attesting_algebraic}

Another reason that classifying mDAGs into observational equivalence classes is useful is to identify which ones are \nonalgebraic. In Ref.~\cite{Evans_2022} it was proven that an mDAG is \algebraic \emph{if and only if} it is observationally equivalent to some confounder-free mDAG. Note that this result does not require the confounder-free mDAG in question to be in the set of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that we have been considering in our observational partial order. In Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, for example, the classes {\tt Collider A} and {\tt Collider B} do not include any confounder-free mDAG, but nevertheless their mDAGs are \algebraic.  This is so because each one of them is equivalent to a confounder-free mDAG that is not shown in this figure because it is not consistent with the stipulated nodal ordering.

However, it is possible to find a criterion for \algebraicness based on observational equivalences within the  set of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. In the example of {\tt Collider A} and {\tt Collider B}, note that for each mDAG $\mathfrak{G}$ in one of those classes there is an mDAG  $\mathfrak{G}'$ in {\tt Collider C} that is related to  $\mathfrak{G}$ by a permutation of the nodes. The class  {\tt Collider C} includes one confounder-free mDAG, so we know that $\mathfrak{G}'$ must be \algebraic. This implies that $\mathfrak{G}$ is also \algebraic. As it turns out, every instance where an mDAG is \algebraic can be identified in this way:
\begin{proposition}
	Consider a set $S$ that includes all mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, and let $\mathfrak{G}=(\cal D,B) \in S$ be an mDAG of that set. The mDAG $\mathfrak{G}$  is \algebraic if and only if the set $S$ contains mDAGs $\mathfrak{G}' \in S$ and $\mathfrak{H}' \in S$ such that  $\mathfrak{H}'$ is confounder-free and $\mathfrak{G}'$  is related to $\mathfrak{G}$ by a permutation of the nodes and is observationally equivalent to $\mathfrak{H}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'\cong\mathfrak{H}'$.
	\label{prop_temporal_algebraic}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	If the set $S$ contains mDAGs $\mathfrak{G}'$ and $\mathfrak{H}'$ as described, then it is clear that $\mathfrak{G}'$ is \algebraic, because it is observationally equivalent to a confounder-free mDAG, which implies that $\mathfrak{G}$  is \algebraic, because it is obtained from a permutation of the nodes of $\mathfrak{G}'$.
	
	If the mDAG $\mathfrak{G}$  is \algebraic, then by Ref.~\cite{Evans_2022} it must be observationally equivalent to a confounder-free mDAG  $\mathfrak{H}$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\cong \mathfrak{H}$. The problem is that $\mathfrak{H}$ might not be an element of $S$, because it might not be consistent with the same nodal ordering as the other mDAGs of $S$.
	
	Let $\cal H$ be the latent-free canonical pDAG associated with the confounder-free mDAG $\mathfrak{H}$. The fact that $\mathfrak{G}\cong \mathfrak{H}$ implies that $\cal D$, the directed structure of $\mathfrak{G}$, is observationally dominated by $\cal H$, i.e., $\cal D \preceq H$. From Lemma 2 and Theorem 4 of Ref~\cite{Chickering_greedy}, we learn that whenever there is a relationship of dominance  $\cal D \preceq H$ between two DAGs (i.e., latent-free pDAGs), it is possible to find another latent-free pDAG  $\tilde{\cal H}$ that is observationally equivalent to $\cal H$ and that \emph{structurally} dominates $\cal D$, that is, $\cal H \cong \tilde{\cal H}$ and the set of edges of $\tilde{\cal H}$ is a superset of the set of edges of $\cal D$. 
	
	Let $\Pi$ be a permutation of the nodes that takes $\tilde{\cal H}$ to a DAG $\Pi(\tilde{\cal H})$ that is consistent with the stipulated nodal ordering of the set $S$.  Here, the application of $\Pi$ to  $\tilde{\cal H}$ means that every edge $a\rightarrow b$ in $\tilde{\cal H}$ is mapped to the edge $\Pi(a)\rightarrow\Pi(b)$. If $\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ is defined as the confounder-free mDAG with   $\tilde{\cal H}$ as its directed structure and a trivial simplicial complex, then it is clear that the expressions $\mathfrak{G}\cong \mathfrak{H}$ and  $\cal H \cong \tilde{\cal H}$ together imply $\Pi(\tilde{\mathfrak{H}})\cong \Pi(\mathfrak{G})$. By the definition of $\Pi$, $\Pi(\tilde{\mathfrak{H}})$ is consistent with the stipulated nodal ordering of set $S$. Since the set of edges of $\cal D$ is a subset of the set of edges of $\tilde{\cal H}$, we know that $\Pi(\mathfrak{G})$ is also consistent with the stipulated nodal ordering of set $S$. Therefore, $\Pi(\mathfrak{G})$ and $\Pi(\tilde{\mathfrak{H}})$ satisfy the requirements for $\mathfrak{G}'$ and $\mathfrak{H}'$ of the statement.  
\end{proof}

From Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes} together with Proposition~\ref{prop_temporal_algebraic}, we can see that the only \nonalgebraic equivalence classes of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering are {\tt Triangle}, {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC}, {\tt Instrumental CAB} and {\tt Instrumental ABC}.  Indeed, the \nonalgebraicness of all of these mDAGs was already known~\cite{Fritz_2012,Pearl_Instrumental,evans_graphs_2016}.





\subsection{How to Express Partial Information about the Observational Equivalence Partition}
\label{sec_proven_partitions}



In Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, we presented the complete observational partial order of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. This was only possible because, as will be made explicit in Section~\ref{sec_back_to_3visible}, the set of rules to show observational dominance and nondominance that are currently known happen to be sufficient to completely determine the observational partial order in this case. However, in general there is not yet a set of rules that is proven to be necessary and sufficient. As we will see, there are sets of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering whose observational equivalence remains uncertain. 

The first step towards obtaining an observational partial order is to find the observational equivalence classes. These classes establish a partition of the set of all n-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, which we will call the \emph{observational equivalence partition}.  An element of a partition is called a \emph{block}. This section will give the means to express partial information about the observational equivalence partition partition, for cases where we cannot present its full characterization.


Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn} illustrates how we express partial information about the observational equivalence partition. In this figure, the set of red points represent the set of n-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, and the green dashed loops represent the observational equivalence partition. Partial information about the observational equivalence partition can be given in the form of  two other partitions, which we term the \emph{proven-equivalence partition}, where two mDAGs belong to \emph{the same} block of the partition when they are proven to be equivalent, and the \emph{proven-inequivalence partition}, where two mDAGs belong to \emph{different} blocks of the partition when they are proven to be inequivalent. Examples are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn} by the pink and gray loops respectively. 

\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/Veinn_proven_partitions.pdf}
\caption{The proven-equivalence partition (pink loops) is found by applying the equivalence rules of Section \ref{sec_show_equivalence}. The proven-inequivalence partition (gray loops) is found by the inequivalence rules of Section \ref{sec_show_inequivalence}. The final goal is to find the observational equivalence partition (green dashed loops).}
\label{fig_veinn}
\end{figure*}





Each of the latter partitions can be built up in a step-wise fashion. For the proven-equivalence partition, one begins with a full partition of the mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering into singleton sets. When one proves that two mDAGs are observationally equivalent, one can merge the two blocks containing these mDAGs into a single block. The successive application of different rules for proving observational dominance (which will be presented in Section~\ref{sec_show_equivalence})  reveals more and more observational equivalences, thereby merging blocks of the proven-equivalence partition and lowering the total number of such blocks. This number is an upper bound on the number of observational equivalence classes. For a given set r of dominance-proving rules, the proven-equivalence partition one can obtain from this set is referred to as the proven-equivalence partition \emph{induced by R}. 

For the proven-inequivalence partition, one begins with a partition having all mDAGs in a single block. When one proves that two mDAGs are observationally inequivalent, one proves that they must be in different blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition. In fact, one thereby proves that the blocks of the proven-equivalence partition to which each of these mDAGs belong are observationally inequivalent. In other words, the blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition are always coarse-grainings of the blocks of the proven-equivalence partition. 

Successive application of different rules for proving observational nondominance (which will be presented in Section~\ref{sec_show_inequivalence}) reveals more and more observational inequivalences, thus splitting blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition and raising the total number of such blocks. This number is a lower bound on the number of observational equivalence classes. For a given set r of nondominance-proving rules, the proven-inequivalence partition one can obtain from this set is referred to as the proven-inequivalence partition \emph{induced by R}.


As we will see, the comparison of the set of d-separation relations of each mDAG is a nondominance-proving rule. The blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by the comparison of d-separation relations are what are conventionally referred to as the Markov equivalence classes~\cite{Ayesha_Markov}. 

If a given set of mDAGs is a block of \emph{both} the proven-equivalence partition and the proven-inequivalence partition, then it is a block of the observational equivalence partition. The leftmost block of Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn} illustrates this circumstance. 
This is the method we use to characterize what we can prove about the observational equivalence classes of 3-node and 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. 


To obtain the proven-equivalence partition from a set of dominance-proving rules, we start by constructing a partially ordered set of mDAGs with the partial order induced by such rules. This will be called the \emph{proven-dominance partial order}. The proven-equivalence partition is then determined by taking pairs of mDAGs such that one dominates the other in the proven-dominance partial order to be part of the same block.




\section{Rules for Establishing Observational Dominance}
\label{sec_show_equivalence}

In this section, we will present the known rules that provide conditions under which one mDAG is known to observationally dominate another. 
In Fig.~\ref{Dominance_Rules} presents a diagram with all of the dominance-proving rules that we will use here. The rules that are indicated in thick green rectangles are our original theoretical results, namely, two generalizations of a rule presented in Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}.  

The first dominance-proving rule was already given in Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}: structural dominance implies observational dominance.

\subsection{HLP Edge-Adding  Rule}

The dominance-proving rule we present in this section is Theorem 26.4 of the work of Henson, Lal and Pusey\cite{henson_theory-independent_2014}, that we are going to call the \emph{HLP Edge-Adding  Rule}:

\begin{proposition}[HLP Edge-Adding  Rule (HLP)]
\label{HLP}
Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG, and let $x$ and $y$ be two of its nodes. Let $\mathfrak{G}'$ be the mDAG obtained from $\mathfrak{G}$ by adding a directed edge $x\rightarrow y$. 

Suppose that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(x)\subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(y)$,
	\item Whenever $x\in B$ for a facet $B\in\mathcal{B}$, then also $y\in B$.
\end{enumerate}

In this case, $\mathfrak{G}$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.

Note that, since $\mathfrak{G}'$ structurally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, by Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping} we know  that $\mathfrak{G}'$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'\succeq \mathfrak{G}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}$ are observationally equivalent, i.e., $\mathfrak{G} \cong \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}

For example, from the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule it follows that the two mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_HLP} are observationally equivalent. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{images/HLP_example.pdf}
\caption{Two mDAGs that can be proven to be observationally equivalent by the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule~\cite{henson_theory-independent_2014}.}
\label{fig_HLP}
\end{figure}

Note that this dominance-proving rule establishes observational \emph{equivalence}, because the conditions for its applicability already imply observational dominance in the other direction. This will be also the case for the next dominance-proving rules.




\subsection{Facet-Merging Rules}

In this section, we will present three more dominance-proving rules. As we will explain, the first rule is obtained from a result of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, and the second and third rules are generalizations of the first.

\subsubsection{Weak Facet-Merging}

\begin{proposition}[Weak Facet-Merging (Weak FM)]
\label{prop_weakFS}
Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG whose simplicial complex $\cal B$ contains two disjoint facets $C$ and $D$. Let $\mathfrak{G}'$ be the mDAG obtained by starting from $\mathfrak{G}$ and adding a facet $B=C \cup D$ and all of the faces contained in $B$ to its simplicial complex. 

Suppose that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(C)\cup C\subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(d)$ for each $d \in D$,
	\item 
	For every $c\in C$, $C$ is the only facet that contains $c$.
\end{enumerate}

In this case, $\mathfrak{G}$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$. 

Note that, since $\mathfrak{G}'$ structurally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, by Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping} we know  that $\mathfrak{G}'$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'\succeq \mathfrak{G}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ are observationally equivalent, i.e., $\mathfrak{G} \cong \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}

Note that the facets $C$ and $D$ have been ``merged'' into facet $B$. This is the reason why this rule is termed ``facet merging''. We call it ``weak'' because this rule will be generalized in the next two sections.

 As an example, the Weak Facet-Merging Rule implies that the two mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_WeakFM} are observationally equivalent. An intuition for the validity of this rule is discussed in Section~\ref{section_3nodes_observationalequivalences}.


The Weak Facet-Merging Rule is a special case of Proposition 6.1 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, that we are going to call ``Evans' Rule''. We paraphrase it below.

\begin{proposition}[Evans' Rule]
	\label{Evans}
	Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG whose simplicial complex $\cal B$ contains two disjoint facets $C$ and $D$. Further suppose that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(C)\cup C \subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(d)$ for each $d \in D$.
		\item For every $c\in C$, $C$ is the only facet that contains $c$.
	\end{enumerate}

	 Let $\mathfrak{G}'$ be the mDAG obtained by  starting from $\mathfrak{G}$, adding a facet $B=C \cup D$ to its simplicial complex and deleting all of the directed edges $c\rightarrow d$ for every $c\in C$, $d\in D$. In this case,   $\mathfrak{G}$ is observationally equivalent to $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e.,  $\mathfrak{G} \cong \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/WeakFM.pdf}
	\caption{Two mDAGs that can be proven observationally equivalent by the Weak Facet-Merging rule. Here, the sets $B$, $C$ and $D$ from the statement of Proposition~\ref{prop_weakFS} are respectively $B=\{a,b,d,e\}$, $C=\{a,b\}$ and $D=\{d,e\}$.}
	\label{fig_WeakFM}
\end{figure}


It is easy to see that the Weak Facet-Merging Rule (Proposition~\ref{prop_weakFS}) is a special case of Evans' Rule (Proposition~\ref{Evans}): in  Weak Facet-Merging we only merge the facets, we do not delete the directed edges $c\rightarrow d$. However, as we will see below, the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule can be applied together with Weak Facet-Merging to obtain Evans' Rule. An example of this is given in Fig.~\ref{fig_HLPandFS}.


\begin{figure*}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/HLP_and_FM.pdf}
	\caption{The first and third mDAG of this figure can be shown observationally equivalent  by Evans' rule, as well as by the HLP Edge-Adding rule together with the Weak Facet-Merging rule. This exemplifies Lemma~\ref{lemma_WeakFS_and_HLP_Evans}.}
	\label{fig_HLPandFS}
\end{figure*}



\begin{lemma}[Weak FM $\land$ HLP$\Rightarrow$Evans]
\label{lemma_WeakFS_and_HLP_Evans}
The application of Weak Facet-Merging (Proposition  \ref{prop_weakFS}) together with the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule (Proposition~\ref{HLP}) subsumes Evans's Rule (Proposition~\ref{Evans}).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	
Let  $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG that satisfies the conditions of Propositions~\ref{prop_weakFS} and~\ref{Evans}. By Weak Facet-Merging (Proposition~\ref{prop_weakFS}), we know that  $\mathfrak{G}$ is observationally equivalent to an mDAG $\mathfrak{G}'$ where the facets $C$ and $D$ are merged into one facet $B$. This mDAG $\mathfrak{G}'$ is such that, for each $c\in C$ and $d\in D$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(c)\subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(d)$.
	\item The only facet that includes $c$ is $B$. This facet also includes $d$.
\end{enumerate}

That is, the conditions of the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule are satisfied. This rule implies that the mDAG $\mathfrak{G}''$ obtained by starting with $\mathfrak{G}'$ and removing all of the arrows $c\rightarrow d$ for $c\in C$ and $d\in D$ is observationally equivalent to $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'' \cong \mathfrak{G}'$. 

This mDAG $\mathfrak{G}''$ is the one that is obtained directly from $\mathfrak{G}$ by application of Evans's Rule. Therefore, the joint application of the Weak Facet-Merging Rule and the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule can subsume Evans's Rule.
\end{proof}



Hence, we can separate the part of Evans's Rule that merges the facets, that is included in the Weak Facet-Merging Rule, from the part that removes the directed edges $c\rightarrow d$, that is taken care of by the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule. Here, we will use HLP and Weak FM in proving dominances. Lemma~\ref{lemma_WeakFS_and_HLP_Evans} implies  that doing so, we obtain any conclusions that could have been obtained by applying Evans' Rule. 




\subsubsection{Moderate Facet-Merging}
\label{sec_face_splitting}

Our first supplement to existing dominance-proving rules is an extension of Weak Facet-Merging, wherein condition 2 is relaxed. We will call it \emph{Moderate Facet-Merging} rule. Fig.~\ref{fig_splitting} presents an observational equivalence that can be shown by Moderate Facet-Merging but not by Weak Facet-Merging.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/Moderate_facet_merging.pdf}
	\caption{Two mDAGs that can be proven observationally equivalent by Moderate Facet-Merging, but not by Weak Facet-Merging. Here, the sets $B$, $C$ and $D$ from the statement of Proposition~\ref{prop_weakFS} are respectively $B=\{a,b,d,e\}$, $C=\{a,b\}$ and $D=\{d,e\}$.} 
	\label{fig_splitting} 
\end{figure}

\begin{proposition}[Moderate Facet-Merging (Moderate FM)]
\label{prop_moderateFS}
Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG whose simplicial complex $\cal B$ contains two disjoint facets $C$ and $D$. Let $\mathfrak{G}'$ be the mDAG obtained by starting from $\mathfrak{G}$ and adding a facet $B=C \cup D$ and all of the faces contained in $B$ to its simplicial complex. 

Suppose that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(C)\cup C\subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(d)$ for each $d \in D$,
	\item If for a face $B'\in \cal B$ such that $B' \not \subseteq C$ we have $c\in B'$ for some $c\in C$, then $D\subset B'$.
\end{enumerate}

In this case, $\mathfrak{G}$  observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.

Note that, since $\mathfrak{G}'$ structurally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, by Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping} we know  that $\mathfrak{G}'$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'\succeq \mathfrak{G}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ are observationally equivalent, i.e., $\mathfrak{G} \cong \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Take $\can(\mathfrak{G})$ and treat all of its latent nodes as if they were visible, apart from the ones associated with the facets $C$ and $D$. We can do that because measuring the latent variables without changing any of their other properties should not change the marginal probability distributions over the variables that were already visible. Now, $C$ is the only facet that includes each $c\in C$, and  all the parents of each $c\in C$ are parents of every $d\in D$. Therefore, we can apply Weak Facet-Merging and obtain the final result. 
\end{proof}

Note the difference in condition 2 for this proposition and for Propositions \ref{Evans} and \ref{prop_weakFS}: here, nodes of the set $C$ are allowed to belong to other facets, as long as these facets also include the entire set $D$. 









\subsubsection{Strong Facet-Merging}
\label{sec_simultaneous_splitting}

In Fig.~\ref{fig_double_splitting}, we have two mDAGs that cannot be shown equivalent by the combination of the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule and the Moderate Facet-Merging Rule.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/strong_facet_merging.pdf}
\caption{Two mDAGs that can be shown observationally equivalent by the Strong Facet-Merging rule.} 
\label{fig_double_splitting} 
\end{figure}

As it turns out, however, these mDAGs \emph{are} observationally equivalent. This can be shown by the following proposition, which is our second supplement to existing dominance-proving rules:


\begin{restatable}[Strong Facet-Merging (Strong FM)]{proposition}{StrongFS}
\label{Simultaneous_Splitting_Prop}
Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG whose simplicial complex contains a sequence of  facets $C_i\in \cal B$ for $i=1,...,n$, that do not need to be disjoint, and the facet $D\in \cal B$, that is disjoint to every $C_i$,  $i=1,...,n$. Let $\mathfrak{G}'$ be the mDAG obtained by starting from $\mathfrak{G}$ and adding the sequence of facets $B_i=C_i \cup D$,  $i=1,...,n$, together with all of the faces they contain, to its simplicial complex.

Suppose that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\pa_{\mathcal{D}}(C_i)\cup C_i\subseteq \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(d)$ for each $d \in D$, $i=1,...,n$.
	\item If for a  face $B'\in \cal B$  such that $B' \not \subseteq \cup_{i=1,...,n} C_i$  we have $c\in B'$ for some $c\in \cup_{i=1,...,n} C_i$, then $D\subseteq B'$.
\end{enumerate}
In this case, $\mathfrak{G}$  observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.

Note that, since $\mathfrak{G}'$ structurally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, by Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping} we know  that $\mathfrak{G}'$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}'\succeq \mathfrak{G}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ are observationally equivalent, i.e., $\mathfrak{G} \cong \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{restatable}


The proof of this proposition is presented in Appendix \ref{appendix_facesplitting}. The general intuition is given in Section~\ref{section_3nodes_observationalequivalences}, in the discussion of the observational equivalence between the second and third mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}.


This result shows conditions under which multiple facets can be merged simultaneously. In the example of Fig.~\ref{fig_double_splitting}, we have $D=\{1,2\}$, $C_1=\{3,4\}$, $C_2=\{4,5\}$, $B_1=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B_2=\{1,2,4,5\}$.

The Structural Dominance Rule (Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}), the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule and the Strong Facet-Merging Rule are together the strongest set of dominance-proving rules currently known.



As we saw, when combined with Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}, all of the dominance-proving rules that we presented in this section establish {observational} \emph{dominance}. That is, every time that one of these rules can be used to show that an mDAG $\frak G$ observationally dominates another mDAG $\frak G'$, the conditions for applicability of the rule imply that  $\frak G'$ structurally dominates $\frak G$.

Therefore, our only dominance-proving rule that can potentially establish a strict observational dominance (i.e., observational dominance without observational equivalence) is Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}. This leads us to a conjecture: if an mDAG $\mathfrak{G}_1$ strictly dominates an mDAG $\mathfrak{G}_2$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}_1\succ \mathfrak{G}_2$, then there exist mDAGs $\mathfrak{G}'_1$ and $\mathfrak{G}'_2$ that are observationally equivalent to $\mathfrak{G}_1$ and $\mathfrak{G}_2$ respectively, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}_1\cong\mathfrak{G'}_1$ and $\mathfrak{G}_2\cong\mathfrak{G'}_2$, such that $\mathfrak{G'}_1$ \emph{structurally} dominates  $\mathfrak{G'}_2$. While this is true for the case of 3-node mDAGs, it is still not known whether this is true in general.

\section{Rules for Establishing Observational Nondominance}
\label{sec_show_inequivalence}

In this section, we are going to present all the known rules for establishing that one mDAG does \emph{not} observationally dominate another. In particular, observational nondominance implies observational inequivalence, so the successive application a set of nondominance-proving rules will give us a proven-inequivalence partition induced by that set of rules (gray loops of Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn}). 

In Fig.~\ref{Inequivalence_Rules}, we present a diagram with all the nondominance-proving rules that will be presented in this section. One rule may be subsumed by another if all of the nondominances that can be shown by the first can also be shown by the second. We represent this in Fig.~\ref{Inequivalence_Rules} as arrows from the stronger to the weaker rule. However, it is still of value to discuss the weaker rules, as they are in general computationally cheaper to apply.

We believe that the comparison of the sets of nested Markov constraints~\cite{behaviormetrika} presented by each mDAG constitutes a rule for establishing observational nondominance. However, the literature still does not present an explicit construction of a distribution that is realizable by one mDAG but not by the other when their sets of nested Markov constraints differ.\footnote{According to private communication with Robin Evans, however, such a distribution exists and is to appear in future work.} In any case, we believe that it is unlikely that this comparison would show observational nondominances that our other rules do not already show. Therefore, we have opted to not include this rule here.

\subsection{Graphical Rules}
\label{sec_graphical}

We will organize our discussion of the nondominance-proving rules starting from the computationally cheaper ones (i.e., we proceed bottom-up in the diagram of Fig.~\ref{Inequivalence_Rules}). 

\subsubsection{Skeletons}
\label{sec_skeletons}

The first nondominance rule is the comparison of skeletons of mDAGs, that was introduced in Refs.~\cite{Evans2012GraphicalMF, evans_graphs_2016}. For that, we first define the \emph{skeleton} of an mDAG, which is exemplified in Fig.~\ref{fig_skeleton}.

\begin{definition}[Skeleton]
Let $\mathfrak{G}=(\cal D,B)$ be an mDAG. We define the \emph{skeleton} of $\mathfrak{G}$ by the undirected graph with the same nodes as $\cal D$ and with an edge between nodes $u$ and $w$ whenever there is a directed edge between them in $\cal D$ or when $u,w\in B$ for some $B\in \mathcal{B}$.
\end{definition}


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{images/skeleton.png}
\caption{(a) An mDAG; and (b) Its skeleton.} 
\label{fig_skeleton} 
\end{figure}

Below, we present a corollary of Theorem 4.2 of Ref.~\cite{Evans2012GraphicalMF}, which is a generalization of Proposition 6.5 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}:

\begin{proposition}(Comparison of skeletons)
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$  be two mDAGs such that $\nodes(\mathfrak{G})=\nodes(\mathfrak{G}')$.  
If there exist nodes $x,y\in \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$ such that the undirected edge between $x$ and $y$ is present in the skeleton of $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not in the skeleton of $\mathfrak{G}$, then $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\not\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}

As a special case of this rule, we know that two mDAGs are observationally inequivalent whenever their skeletons are different.

\subsubsection{d-separation relations}
\label{section_dsep}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec_causal_compatibility}, all the conditional independence constraints that an mDAG imposes on its compatible probability distributions can be obtained from the d-separation relations of that mDAG. We can compare the sets of d-separation relations among the visible variables as a way to show observational nondominance between two causal structures:

\begin{proposition}[Comparison of d-separation relations]
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that $\nodes(\mathfrak{G})=\nodes(\mathfrak{G}')$. If there is a d-separation relation that is presented by  $\mathfrak{G}$ but not by $\mathfrak{G}'$, then $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\not\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We will make a proof by contradiction. Assume that $\mathfrak{G}$ observationally dominates $\mathfrak{G}'$, but there is a d-separation relation $x\dsep y|z$ for $x,y,z \in \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$ that is presented by $\mathfrak{G}$ but not by $\mathfrak{G}'$. 

By the first point of Theorem \ref{th:d-sep}, if a probability distribution $P$ is realizable by $\mathfrak{G}$, then $P$ is such that $X_x \dbot X_y |X_z$ in $P$. Because of the assumed observational dominance, \emph{every} distribution realizable by $\mathfrak{G}'$ is also realizable by $\mathfrak{G}$, and thus has to satisfy $X_x \dbot X_y |X_z$. By the second point of Theorem \ref{th:d-sep}, this would imply that $x\dsep y|z$ in $\mathfrak{G}'$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof} 

Therefore, we can use the comparison of d-separation relations to classify the mDAGs into another proven-inequivalence partition. 


As it turns out, the comparison of skeletons rule and the comparison of d-separation relations rule are \emph{not} redundant to each other as rules to show observational nondominance. This can already be seen by looking at 3-node mDAGs; Figs.~\ref{fig_same_skeleton_different_dsep} and~\ref{fig_same_dsep_different_skeleton} show explicit examples.

\label{fig_same_dsep_different_skeleton}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{e-separation relations}
\label{sec_esep}

In Ref.~\cite{Evans2012GraphicalMF}, an extension of d-separation was introduced, called \emph{e-separation}. While the d-separation method yields all of the conditional independence constraints that a causal structure implies, the e-separation method gives \emph{some} of the inequality constraints that it implies. These are made explicit in Ref.~\cite{Finkelstein2021EntropicIC} (note that \emph{not all} inequality constraints can be obtained from e-separation).

\begin{definition}[e-separation]
\label{def_esep}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ be an mDAG, and let $A,B,C,D\subseteq \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$ be four sets of nodes of $\mathfrak{G}$. We say that $A$ and $B$ are e-separated by $C$ after deletion of $D$, denoted $A\esep B|C\neg D$, if $A\dsep B|C$ in $\mathfrak{G}_{\nodes(\mathfrak{G})\setminus D}$, the subgraph of $\mathfrak{G}$ obtained by deleting the nodes in the set $D$.
\end{definition}

Clearly, d-separation is a special case of e-separation, where the set of nodes being deleted is the empty set, i.e., $D=\emptyset$. 

\begin{proposition}[Comparison of e-separation relations]
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that $\nodes(\mathfrak{G})=\nodes(\mathfrak{G}')$. If there is an e-separation relation that is presented by  $\mathfrak{G}$ but not by $\mathfrak{G}'$, then $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\not\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	As mentioned, Ref.~\cite{Finkelstein2021EntropicIC} shows that the e-separation relation yields an inequality constraint implied by $\mathfrak{G}$. In Proposition 12 of Ref.~\cite{Finkelstein2021EntropicIC}, it is shown that if $\mathfrak{G}'$ \emph{does not} present the e-separation relation in question, then \emph{there exists} some probability distribution realizable by $\mathfrak{G}'$ that violates the associated inequality (in the case where the nodes in $D$ are each associated to a discrete state space). Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ does not observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proof}


The comparison of e-separation relations shows itself to be a better nondominance-proving rule than either comparison of skeletons or comparison of d-separation relations. This is made explicit by Lemmas \ref{lemma_esep_dsep} and \ref{lemma_esep_skeleton}.


\begin{lemma}[The comparison of e-separation relations subsumes The comparison of d-separation relations]
\label{lemma_esep_dsep}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that  $\mathfrak{G}$ can be shown to \emph{not} observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of d-separation relations. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ can also be shown to not observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of e-separation relations.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This follows trivially from the fact that d-separation is a special case of e-separation (when $D=\emptyset$ in Definition \ref{def_esep}).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[The comparison of e-separation relations subsumes the comparison of skeletons]
\label{lemma_esep_skeleton}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that  $\mathfrak{G}$ can be shown to \emph{not} observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of skeletons. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ can also be shown to not observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of e-separation relations.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that the nodes $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge in the skeleton of $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not in the skeleton of $\mathfrak{G}$. This means that, in $\mathfrak{G}$, there is neither a directed edge nor a confounder between $u$ and $v$. It is then clear that, if we delete all other nodes of $\mathfrak{G}$, $u$ and $v$ are going to be d-separated by the empty set.
In $\mathfrak{G}'$, on the other hand, $u$ and $v$ are either connected by a directed edge or are part of the same facet. Thus, if we delete all the other nodes, $u$ and $v$ are not going to be d-separated by the empty set.
Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}$ has the e-separation relation $u\esep v | \neg (\nodes(\mathfrak{G})\setminus\{u,v\})$, while $\mathfrak{G}'$ \emph{does not} have it. Thus, the comparison of e-separation relations can show that $\mathfrak{G}$ that does not observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Pairs of Densely Connected Nodes}
\label{sec_dense_connected}

In this section, we show a rule for observational nondominance derived from the main result of Ref.~\cite{evans_dependency}. This rule is based on the concept of \emph{densely connected nodes}, first defined in Ref.~\cite{SEMs}. This concept makes use of the preliminary definitions of \emph{districts} of an mDAG and the \emph{closure} of a set of nodes. The concept of districts, first introduced in Ref.~\cite{TianandPearl}, is reproduced below.

\begin{definition}[Districts]
\label{def_districts}
Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG. Let $D$ be a set of nodes of $\mathfrak{G}$ that are connected to each other through a set of facets of $\mathcal{B}$; i.e., if $v,w\in D$, then there is a sequence of nodes $(u_0,u_1,u_2,...,u_{n-1},u_n)$ with $u_0=v$ and $u_n=w$ such that for all $i$, $\{u_i, u_{i+1}\}\subseteq B_i \in \mathcal{B}$. If $D$ is inclusion-maximal, we say that it is a \emph{district}.

If $v$ is a node of $\mathfrak{G}$, we are going to denote the district of $\mathfrak{G}$ to which $v$ belongs by $\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}}(v)$. Similarly, for a set of nodes $S$, we have  $\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}}(S)=\cup_{v\in S} \text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}}(v)$.
\end{definition}

In the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}, for example, we have three districts: $\{a,b,c,h\}$, $\{d\}$ and $\{e,f,g\}$. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/def_districts_example.pdf}
\caption{The districts of this mDAG are $\{a,b,c,h\}$, $\{d\}$ and $\{e,f,g\}$.} 
\label{fig_def_districts_example} 
\end{figure}

The second preliminary definition we need is the \emph{closure} of a set of nodes, first introduced in Ref.~\cite{SEMs}.

\begin{definition}[Closure of a set of nodes]

Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D,B\}$ be an mDAG, and let $A\subseteq \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$. Set $A^{(0)}\equiv \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$ and construct a sequence of sets of nodes by applying alternately the following rules:
\begin{align*}
	&A^{(i+1)}=\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(i)}}}(A) \quad \text{,} &A^{(i+2)}=\an_{\mathcal{D}_{A^{(i+1)}}}(A)
\end{align*}
Where $\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}}(S)$ is the district of $S$ in $\mathfrak{G}$, and $\an_{\mathcal{D}}(S)$ is the set of ancestors of the nodes of $S$ in the directed structure (which includes the nodes of $S$ themselves). As usual, $\mathfrak{G}_S$ is the sub-mDAG of  $\mathfrak{G}$ over nodes $S$, and $\mathcal{D}_S$ is the subgraph of  $\cal D$ over nodes $S$. Each one of these operations removes nodes from the set $A^{(i)}$ or keeps it the same, the case which indicates the termination of the process. When the process terminates, we call the resulting set the closure of $A$ and denote it $\langle A \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}$.
\end{definition}

Let us go through an example of this definition. Say that we want to know what is the closure of the set $A=\{b,c,g\}$ in the mDAG $\mathfrak{G}$ of Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}. The set $A^{(0)}$ is the entire set of nodes of the mDAG, so we have that $\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(0)}}=\mathfrak{G}$. This mDAG is reproduced in Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}(a). It implies:
\begin{equation*}
	A^{(1)}=\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}}(A)=\{a,b,c,e,f,g\}.
\end{equation*}

Therefore, $\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(1)}}$ is the sub-mDAG of $\mathfrak{G}$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}(b). This in turn gives us
\begin{equation*}
	A^{(2)}=\an_{\mathcal{D}_{A^{(1)}}}(A)=\{a,b,c,e,g\},
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{D}_{A^{(1)}}$ is the directed structure of $\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(1)}}$. This implies that  $\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(2)}}$ is the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}(c), which gives:
\begin{equation*}
	A^{(3)}=\text{dis}_{\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(2)}}}(A)=\{a,b,c,g\}.
\end{equation*}
Then, $\mathfrak{G}_{A^{(3)}}$ is the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example}(d). Therefore:
\begin{equation*}
	A^{(4)}=\an_{\mathcal{D}_{A^{(3)}}}(A)=\{a,b,c,g\}.
\end{equation*}

The sets $A^{(3)}$ and $A^{(4)}$ are equal, which indicates the termination of the process. Therefore, in this example $\langle A \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}=\{a,b,c,g\}$.

	\label{fig_example_closure}
\end{figure}

Now we can finally present the definition of dense connectedness between nodes, taken from Ref.~\cite{SEMs}: 

\begin{definition}[Densely Connected Nodes]
	Let $\mathfrak{G}=\{\cal D, B\}$ be an mDAG. A pair of nodes $v\neq w \in \nodes(\mathfrak{G})$ is said to be \emph{densely connected} if any of the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $v\in \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(\langle w \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}})$.
	\item $w\in \pa_{\mathcal{D}}(\langle v \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}})$.
	\item $\langle \{v,w\} \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}$ is a bidirected-connected set.
\end{itemize}
where we say that a set of nodes $S$ is bidirected-connected if it forms a district of the mDAG $\mathfrak{G}_S$, the mDAG obtained by deleting all of the nodes of $\frak G$ that are not in $S$. In other words, the set $S$ is bidirected-connected if  every vertex of $S$ can be reached from every other using a path of nodes, all in $S$, that are connected by facets of $\cal B$.
\end{definition}

For example, one can check that the nodes $b$ and $h$ in the mDAG $\mathfrak{G}$ of Fig.~\ref{fig_def_districts_example} are densely connected in $\frak G$, because $\langle \{b,h\} \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}=\{a,b,h\}$, which is a bidirected-connected set in $\mathfrak{G}$. On the other hand, $b$ and $g$ are not densely connected, because $b$ is not a parent of $\langle \{g\} \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}=\{g\}$, $g$ is not a parent of $\langle \{b\} \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}=\{a,b\}$ and $\langle \{b,g\} \rangle_{\mathfrak{G}}=\{a,b,g\}$ is not bidirected-connected.

Due to the main result of Ref.~\cite{evans_dependency}, we have that the comparison of pairs of densely connected nodes is a nondominance-proving rule: 

\begin{proposition}[Comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes]
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that $\nodes(\mathfrak{G})=\nodes(\mathfrak{G}')$. If there is an pair of nodes $v,w \in \nodes(\frak G)$ that is densely connected in $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not in $\mathfrak{G}$, then $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\not\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Ref.~\cite{evans_dependency} showed that the specific probability distribution where $X_v$ and $X_w$ are perfectly correlated and independent of all other visible variables (which are uniformly distributed) is realizable by a causal structure \emph{if and only if} the nodes $v$ and $w$ are densely connected in that causal structure. Therefore, this distribution is realizable by $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not by $\mathfrak{G}$, which implies that $\mathfrak{G}$ {does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proof}



The comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes is {not} redundant to the comparison of e-separation relations; both techniques can show observational inequivalences that the other one cannot. Examples of mDAGs that can be shown to be observationally inequivalent by comparison of e-separation relations but not by pairs of densely connected nodes are found already in the three-node case; an explicit example is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_collider_chain_comparison}. On the other hand, there are no three-node mDAGs that can be shown observationally inequivalent by comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes but not by comparison of e-separation relations. Among four-node mDAGs, however, such examples appear. One such example is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/collider_chain.pdf}
	\caption{Example of a pair of mDAGs that have the same pairs of densely connected nodes, but different sets of e-separation relations (which in this case are simply d-separation relations).

Meanwhile, the pair of nodes $(a,d)$ is densely connected in (b) but not in (a).}

\end{figure}







\subsubsection{Directed-edge-free rule}
\label{sec_only_hypergraphs}

In this section, we discuss a rule for showing observational nondominance that is based on Proposition~\ref{directed_edge_free_dominance}:

\begin{proposition}[Directed-edge-free Rule]
	Let $\frak G$ and $\frak G'$ be two mDAGs. Suppose $\frak G$  is observationally equivalent to the directed-edge-free mDAG $\tilde{\frak G}$ and  $\frak G'$  is observationally equivalent to the directed-edge-free mDAG $\tilde{\frak G'}$. Then, $\frak G$ observationally dominates $\frak G'$ if and only if $\tilde{\frak G}$ structurally dominates $\tilde{\frak G'}$.
	\label{corr_DEF}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	This is a straightforward corollary of Proposition~\ref{directed_edge_free_dominance}.
\end{proof}

 Note that this rule has a difference from the other graphical rules shown in this section: not all pairs of mDAGs are comparable by the rule articulated in Corollary~\ref{corr_DEF}. For example, every mDAG has a skeleton that can be compared to the skeleton of any other mDAG.  Corollary~\ref{corr_DEF}, on the other hand, only establishes comparisons between mDAGs that are equivalent to a directed-edge-free mDAG. This makes the implications of this rule for the proven-inequivalence partition a bit more subtle than before.

This is explained in Fig.~\ref{fig_hypergraph_only}. There, we \emph{can} split the proven-inequivalence block (gray loop) on the left into four, because all the blocks of the proven-equivalence partition (pink loops) inside it contain a directed-edge-free mDAG, so Proposition~\ref{directed_edge_free_dominance} implies that they are all observationally inequivalent. The proven-inequivalence block on the right, on the other hand, contains a distinguished proven-equivalence block that does not contain a directed-edge-free mDAG. Therefore, the proven-inequivalence block on the right still \emph{cannot} be split, because the distinguished proven-equivalence block inside it cannot be compared to the others by Proposition~\ref{directed_edge_free_dominance}. 


\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/veinn_directed_edge_free.pdf}
\caption{The directed-edge-free mDAGs are represented by blue dots, while the other mDAGs are red dots. Suppose that nondominance-proving rules other than the directed-edge-free rule have been used to obtain the proven-inequivalence partition depicted. The directed-edge-free rule says that the proven-inequivalence block on the left should split into the four proven-equivalence blocks that live inside it. On the other hand, the proven-inequivalence block on the right includes one distinguished proven-equivalence block that does not contain any directed-edge-free mDAG. Therefore, the directed-edge-free rule cannot be used to split the proven-inequivalence block on the right.} 
\label{fig_hypergraph_only} 
\end{figure*}





The directed-edge-free rule is \emph{not} redundant to the comparison of e-separation relations nor to the comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes; it can show nondominances that the other two rules cannot, and vice versa.  
The fact that the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_triangle}(a) does not observationally dominate the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_triangle}(b) can be shown by the directed-edge-free rule, but not by the comparison of e-separation relations or the comparison of densely connected pairs. The fact that the mDAGs of  Fig.~\ref{fig_collider_chain_comparison} do not observationally dominate each other (i.e., they are incomparable) can be shown by comparison of e-separation relations, but not by  the directed-edge-free rule (nor by the  comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes, as we have seen). The directed-edge-free rule cannot be applied here because, as we can see from Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_collider_chain_comparison}(b) is not observationally equivalent to any directed-edge-free mDAG. The fact that the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison}(a) does not observationally dominate the mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison}(b) can be shown by the comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes, but not by  the directed-edge-free rule (nor by the comparison of e-separation relations, as we have seen). The directed-edge-free rule cannot be applied here because those two mDAGs are not equivalent to any directed-edge-free mDAG. To prove this we note that, as shown in Example 2 of Ref.~\cite{steudel_ay_2015}, perfect correlation between a set of nodes is realizable if and only if these nodes share a common ancestor in the causal structure (that can be visible or latent). This implies that both mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison} are able to realize perfect correlation between the variables $X_a$, $X_b$, $X_c$ and $X_d$. Therefore, if Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison}(b) were observationally equivalent to a directed-edge-free mDAG, it should be the saturated mDAG, where all four nodes are in the same facet (and thus all four nodes share a common ancestor in the corresponding canonical pDAG). This cannot be the case, however, since Fig.~\ref{fig_DC_comparison}(b) is \emph{not} saturated (this is easy to see, for example, by noting that nodes $a$ and $d$ are not connected in its skeleton).

\subsection{Comparison of unrealizable supports}
\label{sec_unrealizable_supports}

In this section, we will present a rule to establish observational nondominance based on the work of Fraser~\cite{Fraser_Combinatorial_Solution}. This rule deals with the problem of \emph{possibilistic causal realizability}, which we will define shortly.

An important \emph{caveat} on this method is that it can only be applied when the visible variables have {finite cardinalities}. As already stated, this is not a problem for our purposes: to show observational inequivalence, it suffices to show that there is a difference in the set of realizable distributions for one specific assignment of cardinalities. 

The problem that motivates the work of this paper is the problem of probabilistic causal realizability (Definition \ref{SEP_definition}), which asks whether a probability distribution is realizable by a causal structure or not. In this section, we turn our attention to a different, strictly weaker, question: the \emph{possibilistic} causal realizability problem. To define it, let us first define the support of a probability distribution:

\begin{definition}[Support] Let $P:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow [0,1]$ be a probability distribution. The elements of $\mathcal{X}$ are called ``events''. The \underline{support} of $P$ is the set of events that are deemed to be possible, in the sense of having nonzero probability:
\begin{equation*}
	\text{\em Supp}(P)=\{\omega\in\mathcal{X} | P(\omega)>0\}
\end{equation*}

\end{definition}


A set of events $S$ is said to be a realizable support of the pDAG $\cal G$ if there is \emph{some} distribution $P$ that is realizable by $\cal G$ such that $\text{Supp}(P)=S$. Let  $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G},\vec{c}_\text{vis} )$ denote the set of all sets of events that are realizable by the pDAG $\cal G$ for cardinalities of the visible variables given by $\vec{c}_\text{vis}$. Ref.~\cite{Fraser_Combinatorial_Solution} presented an algorithm to find the set $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis})$. We refer to it here as \emph{Fraser's algorithm}. This algorithm is explained in Appendix \ref{appendix_supports}.

 Just as we defined the observational profile $\Mtower(\cal G)$ of a pDAG $\cal G$, we can define $\cal G$'s \emph{possibilistic observational profile} by:
\begin{equation}
\Stower(\mathcal{G})\coloneqq\left\{\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G},\vec{c}_\text{vis} ): \vec c_\text{vis} \in\mathbb{N}^{|\vis(\mathcal{G})|}\right\}.
\end{equation}



If the support of a probability distribution $P$ is \emph{not} realizable by $\cal G$, then clearly $P$ is not realizable by $\cal G$. Thus, if there is some assignment of cardinalities for which a pDAG $\cal G$ cannot realize a support that is realizable by another pDAG $\cal G'$, then $\cal G$ cannot observationally dominate $\cal G'$. In other words, for some assignment of cardinalities of the visible variables, we have:
\begin{gather}
	\Stower(\mathcal{G}) \not\subseteq_\text{ew} \Stower(\mathcal{G}') \nonumber \\ \Rightarrow 
	\label{eq_possibilistic_open_question} \\ \Mtower(\mathcal{G})\not\subseteq_\text{ew}\Mtower(\mathcal{G}') \nonumber
\end{gather}
where $\not\subseteq_\text{ew}$ denotes the failure of element-wise inclusion. From this implication, we know that the comparison of unrealizable supports gives us a nondominance-proving rule:
\begin{proposition}[Comparison of unrealizable supports]
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that $\nodes(\mathfrak{G})=\nodes(\mathfrak{G}')$. If there is a support that is realizable by $\mathfrak{G}'$ but not by $\mathfrak{G}$, then $\mathfrak{G}$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate $\mathfrak{G}'$, i.e., $\mathfrak{G}\not\succeq \mathfrak{G}'$.
\end{proposition}

Note that it is unclear whether the converse implication to that of \eqref{eq_possibilistic_open_question} holds. We will discuss potential prospects to tackle this open question in Section \ref{sec_every_support}.





\subsubsection{Subsumption of other nondominance-proving rules}

In Lemmas~\ref{lemma_esep_dsep} and~\ref{lemma_esep_skeleton}, we showed that the comparison of e-separation relations subsumes the comparison of skeletons and d-separation relations as rules  to show observational nondominance. In this section, we discuss how the comparison of unrealizable supports subsumes other rules.

Since Fraser's algorithm for unrealizable supports is a brute force search, one wants to apply as many of the weaker but computationally cheaper rules as possible before implementing the comparison of unrealizable supports. However, it is possible to show that all of the cheaper rules --- comparison of e-separation relations,  comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes, and the directed-edge-free rule --- are subsumed by the comparison of unrealizable supports. In fact, to subsume the cheaper rules it is sufficient to look at supports at the level of binary visible variables; that is, whenever a nondominance can be shown by one of the cheaper rules, one can find a support with $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$ that also shows said nondominance.  

\begin{restatable}[The comparison of unrealizable supports subsumes the comparison of e-separation relations]{lemma}{esep}
\label{lemma_sup_esep}
Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs that have different sets of e-separation relations. Then, it is possible to find a support which is realizable by one of these mDAGs but not by the other. In fact, it is possible to do find such a support even when all of the visible variables are binary, i.e., $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$.
\end{restatable}

The proof is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix_proofs_subsume}. The idea behind this proof is that the set of e-separation relations of a given mDAG might already imply that some supports are unrealizable. As an example of this, imagine a causal structure that presents the d-separation relation $a\dsep b$. Suppose that $S$ is a support over binary variables $X_a$ and $X_b$ that does not contain any events involving $\{X_a=0, X_b=1\}$ or $\{X_a=1,X_b=0\}$. This implies that in any probability distribution $P$ that has the support $S$, i.e., where $\text{Supp}(P)=S$, the variables $X_a$ and $X_b$ are correlated. This is incompatible with  $a\dsep b$, thus the support $S$ is ruled out by $a\dsep b$. To save time in the computation, we only apply Fraser's algorithm for supports that are not already ruled out by the e-separation relations of the mDAG in question.


\begin{restatable}[The comparison of unrealizable supports subsumes the comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes]{lemma}{DC}
	\label{lemma_sup_DC}
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that  $\mathfrak{G}$ can be shown to \emph{not} observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of densely connected pairs of nodes. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ can also be shown to not observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of  unrealizable supports. In fact, it is possible to do so even when we are only comparing unrealizable supports where all of the visible variables are binary, i.e., $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$.
\end{restatable}


The proof of this lemma is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix_proofs_subsume}.


\begin{restatable}[The comparison of unrealizable supports subsumes the directed-edge-free rule]{lemma}{DEF}
\label{lemma_sup_OH}
	Let $\mathfrak{G}$ and $\mathfrak{G}'$ be two mDAGs such that  $\mathfrak{G}$ can be shown to \emph{not} observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by the directed-edge-free rule. Then, $\mathfrak{G}$ can also be shown to not observationally dominate  $\mathfrak{G}'$ by comparison of unrealizable supports. In fact, it is possible to do so even when we are only comparing unrealizable supports where all of the visible variables are binary, i.e., $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$, and the supports are constituted by only two events.
\end{restatable}


The proof of this lemma is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix_proofs_subsume}.


\section{Deriving the Observational Partial Order for 3-node mDAGs}
\label{sec_back_to_3visible}

Now that we presented our rules for proving observational dominance and nondominance between mDAGs, we will go back to the results for 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, presented in Section \ref{sec_3_observed_nodes}, and explain how they are derived.


\subsection{Observational Dominances}
\label{section_3nodes_observationalequivalences}

Take, for example, the mDAGs in the {\tt Instrumental ABC} class of Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}, that are reproduced in Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}. As we will see now, the rules discussed in Section \ref{sec_show_equivalence} establish that these three mDAGs are observationally equivalent to each other. Here, we will discuss the intuition behind those rules for the specific case at hand.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/instrumental_class.pdf}
\caption{Three observationally equivalent mDAGs, that lie in the {\tt Instrumental ABC} class.} 
\label{fig_instrumental_class} 
\end{figure}

In the first mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}, the node $b$ already has access to all of the parents of $a$. Since the local randomness of $a$ can also be absorbed by the latent parent that it shares with $b$, the node $b$ already has access to all information about $a$. Therefore, this mDAG is just as powerful as another one where an edge between $a$ and $b$ is added, namely the second mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}. This is the application of the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule (Proposition~\ref{HLP}) to show the observational equivalence between the two first mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}.

It is clear that the second mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class} observationally dominates the third mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}, because it structurally dominates it (Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}). Therefore, we only need to show dominance in the other way to prove equivalence; this proof will be explained using the pDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes}. Note that the first pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes} corresponds to the second mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}, and the third pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes} corresponds to the third mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}. So, we need to show that the first pDAG is observationally dominated by the third pDAG in Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes}. 

In the first pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes}, the node $a$ is influenced by the latent common cause $\beta$ that it shares with the node $b$. As such, learning the value of $X_a$ teaches us something about the latent common cause $\beta$ via Bayesian updating. As will be formalized in Lemma~\ref{lemma_dominance_bayesian_updating} of Appendix~\ref{appendix_facesplitting}, this is at most as powerful as a situation where $a$ acts as a setting for $\beta$. This implies that the first pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes} is observationally dominated by the second pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes}.

Via exogenization of latent nodes, the second pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes} is observationally equivalent to the third pDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_interm_proof_sec_3nodes}. Thus, we conclude that the third mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class} observationally dominates the second mDAG of Fig.~\ref{fig_instrumental_class}, which shows that they are observationally equivalent. This is the implementation of Weak Facet-Merging (Proposition~\ref{prop_weakFS}) to show the observational equivalence of these two mDAGs.

 \end{figure}
 

In the same fashion, the Structural Dominance rule, the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule and the Weak Facet-Merging rule can be used to show that the partition of the 72 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering into the 15 blocks that are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes} is a proven-equivalence partition, that is, all of the mDAGs inside the same set are observationally equivalent to each other. Moreover, these rules can show that all of the lines that connect one set to another are proven observational dominances. 

It is worth noting that even the Evans' Proposition (Proposition~\ref{Evans}), which is subsumed by HLP+Weak Facet-Merging (Lemma \ref{lemma_WeakFS_and_HLP_Evans}), is sufficient to show all of the observational equivalences and dominances of Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}.

What is left to be justified is that no observational dominance between 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is missing from Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}\footnote{In Figure 13 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016}, representatives of 8 blocks of a proven-equivalence partition of 3-node mDAGs obtained by Evans's Rule were shown. That proven-equivalence partition is different than the one we present here for two reasons: first, the organization of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016} is not focused only on mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. Second, that organization only counts mDAGs up to permutation of nodes.}. 
 


\subsection{Observational Nondominances}


As we will show now, for the case of 3-node mDAGs the proven-dominance partial order established in the previous section corresponds to the observational partial order. That is, every time that one 3-node mDAG $\frak G$ cannot be shown to observationally dominate another 3-node mDAG $\frak G'$ by the conjunction of the Structural Dominance rule, the HLP Edge-Adding  Rule and the Weak Facet-Merging rule, then it is possible to prove that  $\frak G$ \emph{does not} observationally dominate  $\frak G'$.  


We will do so by applying the nondominance-proving rules of Fig.~\ref{Inequivalence_Rules} starting from the computationally cheaper rules and progressing to more expensive ones. Therefore, the first rule we apply is the comparison of skeletons. 

The blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by the comparison of skeletons rule are depicted by the loops of Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_skeletons}. Each cut arrow ($\nrightarrow$) between two blocks indicates a proven nondominance relation between the mDAGs of those blocks. For example, because the skeleton of {\tt Factorizing AC|B} is a subgraph of the skeleton of {\tt Collider C},the former cannot observationally dominate the latter. The skeleton of {\tt Factorizing AC|B} is also a subgraph of the skeleton that is common to {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC}, {\tt Instrumental CAB}, {\tt Collider A}, and {\tt Fork}. This implies observational nondominances {\tt Factorizing AC|B} over each of these. In  Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_skeletons} we represent all of these proven nondominances by one single cut arrow from {\tt Factorizing AC|B} to the block of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by comparison of skeletons that contains {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC}, {\tt Instrumental CAB}, {\tt Collider A}, and {\tt Fork}. Because nondominance is not a transitive property, we must explicitly represent \emph{all} of the proven nondominances in Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_skeletons}. For example, there is a cut arrow into the {\tt Saturated} block from every other block of the proven-inequivalence partition.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/3node_skeleton_nondominances.pdf}
	\caption{Representation of the information obtained by applying the comparison of skeletons to the proven-equivalence partition of 3-node mDAGs. In this figure, the loops represent blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition and the cut arrows ($\nrightarrow$) represent proven nondominances. Double-headed cut arrows mean that there is proven nondominance in both directions, i.e., proven incomparability. Compare this to the set of observational \emph{dominances} proven by Structural Dominance, the HLP Edge-Adding  rule and Weak Facet-Merging, reproduced in the miniature on the top right.}
	\label{fig_3node_skeletons}
\end{figure*}

As we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_skeletons}, the comparison of skeletons is sufficient to show that the following blocks of the proven-equivalence partition are observational equivalence classes: {\tt Factorizing}, {\tt Factorizing AC|B}, {\tt Factorizing AB|C}, {\tt Factorizing B|CA} and {\tt Collider C}. Furthermore, it shows that in all of the instances where an observational dominance involving one of these five classes could not be proven by the conjunction of the structural dominance rule, the HLP Edge-Adding rule and the Weak Facet-Merging rule, then there is a proven observational nondominance. Therefore, the part of the observational partial order concerning these five classes is solved by the comparison of skeletons. 

Next, we proceed to applying the comparison of d-separation relations to the remaining mDAGs. The proven-equivalence blocks {\tt Saturated}, {\tt Triangle}, {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC}, {\tt Instrumental CAB} and {\tt Instrumental ABC} do not present any d-separation relations. On the other hand, {\tt Collider A} presents the d-separation relation $b\dsep c$, {\tt Collider B} presents the d-separation relation $a\dsep c$, {\tt Fork} presents the d-separation relation $b\dsep c|a$ and {\tt Chain} presents the d-separation relation $a\dsep c|b$.

From this, we are able to show more nondominances, and in particular split some of the blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by comparison of skeletons. When we present the resulting nondominances in Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_dsep}, to make it easier to visualize we do not include the classes that were already completely classified with the comparison of skeletons alone (i.e.,  {\tt Factorizing}, {\tt Factorizing AC|B}, {\tt Factorizing AB|C}, {\tt Factorizing B|CA} and {\tt Collider C}). 


\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/3node_dsep_nondominances.pdf}
	\caption{Representation of the information obtained by applying the comparison of skeletons and the comparison of d-separation relations to the proven-equivalence partition of 3-node mDAGs. Here, we only show the blocks of the proven-equivalence partition that were not already shown to be observational equivalence classes by the comparison of skeletons alone. The loops represent blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition and the cut arrows ($\nrightarrow$) represent proven nondominances. Double-headed cut arrows mean that there is proven nondominance on both directions, i.e., proven incomparability. Compare this to the set of observational \emph{dominances} among these mDAGs proven by Structural Dominance, the HLP Edge-Adding  rule and Weak Facet-Merging, reproduced in the miniature on the top right.}
	\label{fig_3node_dsep}
\end{figure*}

As we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig_3node_dsep}, by applying the comparison of d-separation relations to the blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by the comparison of skeletons, we further learn that {\tt Instrumental ABC}, {\tt Collider A}, {\tt Collider B}, {\tt Fork} and {\tt Chain} are observational equivalence classes. Furthermore, we learn that in all of the instances where an observational dominance involving one of these five classes could not be proven by the conjunction of the structural dominance rule, the HLP Edge-Adding rule and the Weak Facet-Merging rule, then there is a proven observational nondominance. Therefore, the part of the observational partial order concerning these five classes is solved by comparison of skeletons together with comparison of d-separation relations.

Next, we attempt to apply the comparison of e-separation relations and the comparison of densely connected pairs to the remaining mDAGs. This, however, does not show any nondominance that was not already known. Therefore, we move to applying the directed-edge-free rule, and this shows one extra nondominance: {\tt Triangle} does not dominate {\tt Saturated}. With this, we learn that the dominances involving {\tt Triangle} that can be proven using Structural Dominance,  HLP Edge-Adding  and Weak Facet-Merging are indeed all of the observational dominance relations involving {\tt Triangle}. Hence,  {\tt Triangle} is an observational equivalence class.

At this point, we have the proven-inequivalence partition induced by all nondominance rules except for comparison of unrealizable supports. It is this last rule that establishes that the block that includes {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC} and {\tt Instrumental CAB} can be split.


Applying the comparison of unrealized supports on binary variables constituted of two events does not show any new nondominance relation. When we apply  the comparison of unrealized supports on binary variables constituted of \emph{three} events, on the other hand, we can show new nondominances. Let $S$ be the set constituted by the events 
	\begin{align*}
	& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=0\}, \\
	&\{X_a=0,X_b=1,X_c=1\}, \\
	& \{X_a=1,X_b=0,X_c=0\}.
\end{align*}

The set $S$ is a support realizable by {\tt Evans}, but unrealizable by  {\tt Instrumental BAC} and {\tt Instrumental CAB}. This was found by Fraser's algorithm, but here we give a direct proof. First, an explicit choice of parameters can show that there are distributions with support $S$ that are realizable by {\tt Evans}. Say that the common cause between $a$ and $c$ is $\lambda$, and the common cause between $a$ and $b$ is $\gamma$. Take each of $X_\lambda$ and $X_\gamma$ to be binary and take the distribution over them to be full support. Then, let $X_a = X_\lambda \oplus X_\gamma$, where $\oplus$ means sum modulus 2. Furthermore, let $X_b=X_\lambda \cdot(X_a\oplus 1)$ and $X_c=X_\gamma \cdot(X_a\oplus 1)$. From these functions, we have:
\begin{align*}
	&(X_\lambda, X_\gamma)=(0,0) \Rightarrow X_a=0, X_b=0, X_c=0 \\
	&(X_\lambda, X_\gamma)=(1,1) \Rightarrow X_a=0, X_b=1, X_c=1 \\
	&(X_\lambda, X_\gamma)=(0,1) \Rightarrow X_a=1, X_b=0, X_c=0 \\
	& (X_\lambda, X_\gamma)=(1,0) \Rightarrow X_a=1, X_b=0, X_c=0 .
\end{align*}

That is, choices of parameters of this type give rise to distributions that have support $S$. 


Note that this construction is possible because in {\tt Evans} both $b$ and $c$ have direct access to $a$: they need to know when to copy the hidden variable and when to set their value to $0$. Therefore, this specific construction is not possible in {\tt Instrumental BAC} or {\tt Instrumental CAB}. More than that, any distribution with support $S$ violates the two versions of Pearl's instrumental inequalities \cite{Pearl_Instrumental} that are respectively associated with {\tt Instrumental BAC} and {\tt Instrumental CAB}, and thus is not realizable by these mDAGs. Therefore, this explicitly shows us that {\tt Instrumental BAC} and {\tt Instrumental CAB} do not dominate {\tt Evans}. We infern that {\tt Evans} is an observational equivalence class.

Finally, we apply  the comparison of unrealized supports on binary variables constituted of four events. Let $S'$ be the set constituted by the events
\begin{align*}
	& \{X_a=1,X_b=0,X_c=0\}, \\
	&\{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=1\}, \\
	& \{X_a=0,X_b=1,X_c=1\}, \\
	& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=0\}.
\end{align*}

The set $S'$ is a support realizable by {\tt Instrumental CAB}, but unrealizable by  {\tt Instrumental BAC}. This was found by Fraser's algorithm, but here we give a direct proof. First, an explicit choice of parameters can show that there are distributions with support $S'$ that are realizable by {\tt Instrumental CAB}. Let the common cause between $a$ and $b$ be $\lambda$, and the common cause between $a$ and $c$ be $\gamma$. Take each of $X_\lambda$ and $X_\gamma$ to be binary and take the distribution over them to be full support. Then, let $X_a=X_\lambda \cdot X_\gamma$, $X_b=X_\lambda \cdot (X_a \oplus 1)$ and  $X_c= X_\gamma$. Choices of parameters of this type give rise to distributions that have support $S'$. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that the any distribution with support $S'$ violates the version of Pearl's instrumental inequalities~\cite{Pearl_Instrumental} that are associated with {\tt Instrumental BAC}. To find a support that is realizable by  {\tt Instrumental BAC} but unrealizable by  {\tt Instrumental CAB}, we only need to invert $b$ and $c$ in $S'$. 

Together, all of the arguments presented above close the problem of finding the observational partial order of observational equivalence classes of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, showing that it is indeed the one shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}.

Tables~\ref{table_3vis_equivs} and~\ref{table_3node_inequivalences} give a selective summary of the steps shown in this section: Table~\ref{table_3vis_equivs} presents the number of elements of the proven-equivalence partition of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering induced by different combinations of the dominance-proving rules, and Table~\ref{table_3node_inequivalences} presents the number of elements of the proven-inequivalence partition of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering induced by different combinations of the nondominance-proving rules.

\section{Partial Solution of Observational Partial Order for 4-node mDAGs}
\label{sec_4}


Based on the case of three visible nodes, one might wonder whether Structural Dominance, HLP Edge-Adding  and Weak Facet-Merging, that is, the dominance-proving rules that were known prior to this work, are sufficient to find the observational partial order for any number of visible nodes. However, the case of four visible nodes shows that this expectation is not borne out: Table \ref{table_4vis_equivs} shows that the number of elements of the proven-equivalence partition, which is an upper bound on the number of observational equivalence classes, gets smaller upon successive applications of the equivalence rules of Section~\ref{sec_show_equivalence}. Thus, our two extensions (Moderate and Strong Facet-Merging) are indeed necessary to establish certain dominances and equivalences.

\begin{table*}[]

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{table_supports} shows the number of elements of the proven-inequivalence partition that is obtained after applying each one of the nondominance-proving rules of Section~\ref{sec_show_inequivalence} to mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. In other words, Table~\ref{table_supports} is the analogue of Table~\ref{table_3node_inequivalences} for the case of four visible nodes. As we can see, we have not solved all ambiguity about the observational equivalence partition for 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering: the best upper bound on the number of observational equivalence classes that we have obtained is 1444, while the best lower bound is 1256.

All the support comparison applied assumed all the visible variables to be binary, i.e., $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$.}
\label{table_supports}
\end{table*}


It is still possible that the reason  we did not solve the problem is that we did not use the full power of the comparison of unrealizable supports: we only compared supports for binary variables and only up to 8 events. In Section \ref{sec_every_support}, we will study one specific block of the proven-inequivalence partition, and show that there are still cases where whether observational equivalence holds or not is unknown even after making all of the possible comparisons of unrealizable supports while assuming that all visible variables are binary, i.e., for $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$. We will then discuss the possibility of comparing unrealizable supports under the assumption that one or more of the visible variables have higher cardinality, even though this becomes increasingly impractical and computationally expensive.

Before doing so, we will look into the set of observational equivalence classes that were completely characterized by our analysis.




\subsection{Completely Identified Classes}
\label{sec_completely_solved}

When a block of the proven-equivalence partition is also a block of the proven-inequivalence partition (a pink loop coincides with a gray loop in Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn}), we infer that it is a block of the observational equivalence partition (green dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig_veinn}). In that case, we say that the observational equivalence class is ``identified''. 

For the case of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, as discussed, \emph{all} of the classes are identified when we apply the graphical rules of Section~\ref{sec_graphical} together with the comparison of unrealizable supports assuming visible variables that are all binary and up to 4 events. For the case of four visible nodes, on the other hand, even the comparison of unrealizable supports for binary variables up to 8 events cannot identify all classes. However, some equivalence classes \emph{can} be identified. Table \ref{table_solved} presents the number of  classes that are identified by various combinations of nondominance-proving rules.

\end{table*}


In particular, with this analysis we reproduced one of the results of Ref.~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens}: the observational equivalence class of the Bell mDAG (Fig.~\ref{fig_Bell_and_Square}(a)) consists of the 9 mDAGs whose associated pDAGs are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering depicted in Figure 24 of Ref.~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens}. The Bell equivalence class is identified by d-separation alone, meaning that the particular pattern of d-separation relations presented by this observational equivalence class is not presented by any other class. In other words, there is \emph{no} mDAG that possesses the same pattern of d-separation relations as the Bell mDAG while being inequivalent to it.

The main point of Ref.~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens} is that if one has a probability distribution that violates Bell inequalities (which are the inequality constraints imposed by the Bell mDAG) but satisfies the no-signalling relations (which are the conditional independence constraints imposed by the Bell mDAG), then it is only possible to find a causal explanation for this distribution in the framework of \emph{classical} causal models if one allows for \emph{fine-tuning}. Fine-tuning, which is another name for the notion of \emph{unfaithfulness}~\cite{Spirtes2000}, is the property that a probability distribution exhibits conditional independence relations that are not entailed by the d-separation relations of the causal structure that realized this distribution. Those extra conditional independence relations arise due to the specific choice of parameters that is used to realize the distribution in question, and not due to the structure of the DAG. As it turns out, the conclusion that was drawn in  Ref.~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens} for the Bell causal structure can be extended to any observational equivalence class of causal structures that is \nonalgebraic and is identified by d-separation alone. For such a class of causal structures, any distribution that satisfies all and only the conditional independence relations implied by the set of d-separation relations of that class, but that violates the inequality constraints of the class necessarily cannot be explained within the framework of classical causal models without fine-tuning.

Fig.~\ref{fig_Bell_and_Square}(b) shows an example of a causal structure (distinct from the Bell causal structure) whose equivalence class is identified by d-separation alone: the {\tt Square} mDAG. The argument above says that any distribution whose set of conditional independence relations is exactly $X_a \dbot X_c$ and $X_d \dbot X_b$ but that violates the inequality constraints implied by the {\tt Square} mDAG does not admit of any non-fine-tuned causal explanation in the framework of classical causal models.

Now, we go back to one of our motivations discussed in the \hyperref[introductionsection]{Introduction}: the question of the significance of analyzing inequality constraints for causal discovery.

\subsection{Importance of Inequality Constraints for Causal Discovery}

\subsubsection{Nonalgebraicness is Ubiquitous}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec_3_observed_nodes}, in the set of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, there are 15 observational equivalence classes and 5 of them are \nonalgebraic. Therefore, for the case of three visible variables, the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes among all classes of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is $1/3$. As we will see in this section, the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes gets much bigger in the case of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering.

Since we still have not obtained a complete characterization of the observational equivalence partition of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, the best we can do is to find a lower bound on the fraction of \nonalgebraic equivalence classes. We will explain two methods for obtaining such a lower bound. We then pick the best lower bound out of the two results. Method 1 consists in obtaining a \emph{lower bound on the number of \nonalgebraic classes}, and dividing it by our best \emph{upper bound} on the total number of observational equivalence classes (which is currently 1444). The resulting number $f_1$ is a lower bound on the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes. Method 2 consists in obtaining an \emph{upper bound on the number of \algebraic classes}, and dividing it by our best \emph{lower bound} on the total number of observational equivalence classes (which is 1253). The resulting number $f_2$ is such that $1-f_2$ is a lower bound on the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes.

We first implement method 1. An observational equivalence class of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is identified as \nonalgebraic, according to Proposition~\ref{prop_temporal_algebraic}, when there is \emph{no} other equivalence class of mDAGs consistent with the same fixed nodal ordering that simultaneously includes a confounder-free mDAG and an mDAG that can be obtained from one of the mDAGs of the class of interest by a permutation of the nodes. To obtain a lower bound on the number of \nonalgebraic classes, we look at the proven-inequivalence partition and find all of the blocks thereof whose mDAGs are \emph{not} related by permutation to any other mDAG lying in a proven-inequivalence block that includes a confounder-free mDAG. By Proposition~\ref{prop_temporal_algebraic}, all of the mDAGs in this special class of blocks of the proven-inequivalence partition are \nonalgebraic. The number of blocks of this type is a lower bound on the number of \nonalgebraic observational equivalence classes. Applying this method on the proven-inequivalence partition induced by all of the graphical rules of Section~\ref{sec_graphical} together with comparison of unrealizable supports up to 8 events, we obtain the lower bound of 1137 on the number of \nonalgebraic observational equivalence classes. Therefore, the lower bound on the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes obtained by method 1 is $f_1=1137/1444\approx 78.7\%$.




Now we implement method 2, where we want to find an \emph{upper bound} on the number of \algebraic classes. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec_attesting_algebraic}, Ref.~\cite{Evans_2022} proved that an mDAG $\frak G$ is \algebraic if and only if it is observationally equivalent to a confounder-free mDAG $\frak H$. Recall that if we are considering a set of mDAGs that are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, and $\frak G$ is in that set, then $\frak H$ need not be in that set. Thus, $\frak H$ need not appear in the observational partial order of mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that we have constructed. Previously discussed examples include the classes {\tt Collider A} and {\tt Collider B} of Fig.~\ref{fig_temporally_ordered_3_nodes}: they are \algebraic, but the confounder-free mDAGs that are observationally equivalent to them do not follow the nodal ordering $(a,b,c)$, and thus do not appear in the figure. For example, the mDAGs in the class {\tt Collider B} are observationally equivalent to the confounder-free mDAG $a\rightarrow b \leftarrow c$, which is only consistent with the nodal orderings $(a,c,b)$ and $(c,a,b)$. In general, we have:

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma_temporal_sec7}
	Let $\frak G$ be an \algebraic mDAG, and suppose that $\nodes( \mathfrak{G})=\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$. Let our nodal ordering of interest be $(a_1,...,a_n)$, and assume that $\frak G$  is consistent with this ordering. Then, there exists a permutation $\Pi$ of the nodes of $\frak G$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  $\frak G$  is \emph{also} consistent with the nodal ordering $\Pi(a_1,...,a_n)$, and 
		\item There exists a confounder-free mDAG $\frak H$  consistent with the nodal ordering $\Pi(a_1,...,a_n)$ which is observationally equivalent to  $\frak G$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	This is a corollary of Proposition~\ref{prop_temporal_algebraic}. Let $\frak G$, $\frak G'$ and  $\frak H'$ be as in Proposition~\ref{prop_temporal_algebraic}.  By definition, all of them are consistent with the nodal ordering $(a_1,...,a_n)$. Let $\tilde\Pi$ be the permutation of nodes such that $\mathfrak{G}'=\tilde\Pi(\mathfrak{G})$, where the application of $\tilde\Pi$ to  $\mathfrak{G}$ means that every edge $a\rightarrow b$ in $\mathfrak{G}$ is mapped to the edge $\tilde\Pi(a)\rightarrow\tilde\Pi(b)$. Since $\frak G'$ is consistent with the nodal ordering  $(a_1,...,a_n)$ and  $\mathfrak{G}=\tilde\Pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{G}')$, then $\frak G$ is necessarily consistent with the nodal ordering $\tilde\Pi^{-1}(a_1,...,a_n)$.
	
	Let $\frak H$ be the confounder-free mDAG obtained by applying the permutation $\tilde\Pi^{-1}$ to  $\frak H'$, that is, $\mathfrak{H}=\tilde\Pi^{-1}(\frak H')$. Since $\frak H'$ is consistent with the nodal ordering  $(a_1,...,a_n)$, then $\frak H$ is consistent with the nodal ordering  $\tilde\Pi^{-1}(a_1,...,a_n)$. Furthermore, since $\frak G'$ is observationally equivalent to  $\frak H'$ and $\mathfrak{G}=\tilde\Pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{G}')$, it follows that  $\frak G$ is observationally equivalent to  $\frak H$. Therefore, $\tilde\Pi^{-1}$ plays the role of the permutation $\Pi$ in the lemma and we finish the proof.
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{lemma_temporal_sec7} implies that, even in the cases where the observational partial order of mDAGs consistent with the nodal ordering  $(a_1,...,a_n)$ is such that there is no confounder-free mDAG in the same observational equivalence class as $\frak G$ (such as in the classes {\tt Collider A} and {\tt Collider B}), if $\frak G$ is \algebraic then it is possible to find another nodal ordering $\Pi(a_1,...,a_n)$ such that the corresponding observational partial order includes an equivalence class where $\frak G$ appears together with a confounder-free mDAG. 

Therefore, two \algebraic mDAGs $\frak G$ and $\frak G'$ that are consistent with the same nodal ordering can only be observationally inequivalent if there is a pair of observationally inequivalent confounder-free mDAGs to which they are respectively observationally equivalent. This implies that the \emph{total number} of observationally inequivalent confounder-free mDAGs (not restricting to a set that is consistent with a fixed nodal ordering) gives us an upper bound on the number of \algebraic observational equivalence classes in the set of mDAGs that are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering. It is easy to find this number, since the observational profile of confounder-free mDAGs is completely characterized by d-separation. Doing this, we find that the number of \algebraic classes of 4-node mDAGs in the set of mDAGs that are consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is \emph{at most} $185$. To obtain the maximum fraction of \algebraic mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, we divide this number by our best lower bound on the total number of equivalence classes, thus obtaining $f_2=185/1253 \approx 14.8\%$. Therefore, the lower bound on the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes obtained by method 2 is $1-f_2\approx 85.2\%$. The lower bound obtained by method 1 is worse than the lower bound obtained by method 2, so we will use the latter. 


To conclude, the rate of incidence of inequality constraints among observational equivalence classes of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is \emph{at least} $85.2\%$. This high rate and the fact that it increases with the number of nodes suggests that inequality constraints are not rare; on the contrary, they seem to be generic.


\subsubsection{Conditional Independence relations are not enough to single out most Observational Equivalence Classes}

Even if inequality constraints are generic, it could still be the case that algorithms for constraint-based causal discovery that leverage only conditional independence constraints are capable of distinguishing most of the observational equivalence classes. That is, it could be the case that most equivalence classes can be singled out by their set of conditional independence constraints alone, even if they also present nested Markov constraints or inequality constraints. However, our analysis shows that this is \emph{not} the case for 4-node mDAGs, and the comparison of the 3-node and 4-node cases leads us to believe that this is likely not the case for higher numbers of visible nodes either.



If one only analyses the conditional independence constraints satisfied by a set of data (and one does not investigate nested Markov constraints nor inequality constraints), it is possible to single out the correct observational equivalence class for this data \emph{only if} the equivalence class 
has a unique set of conditional independence relations. When this happens, using the language of Section~\ref{sec_completely_solved}, the observational equivalence class is identified by the comparison of d-separation relations rule. We will say that such classes are \emph{identified by conditional independence relations alone}.
 If the conditional independence relations of the set of data do not correspond to those of any equivalence class that is identified by conditional independence relations alone,
  then there is remaining ambiguity about the observational equivalence class that explains the data.

For the case of 2-node mDAGs there are no inequality constraints, so every observational equivalence class can be identified by conditional independence relations alone,
 For the case of 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, there are 10 equivalence classes that can be identified by d-separation alone. The remaining classes, namely,
  {\tt Triangle}, {\tt Evans}, {\tt Instrumental BAC}, {\tt Instrumental CAB} and {\tt Saturated}, are all devoid of nontrivial d-separation relations.  Therefore, for this case the fraction of causal structures that can be singled out by the analysis of conditional independence constraints alone is $2/3$. For the case of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, Table \ref{table_solved} shows that only 114 equivalence classes are identified by conditional independence relations alone. 
  This is less than 10\% of our best lower bound on the total number of equivalence classes. Therefore, in most cases it will \emph{not} be possible to discriminate between observationally inequivalent classes of causal structures if one only avails oneself of conditional independence relations.


Therefore, our analysis shows that, as well as the fraction of \nonalgebraic classes increasing
 with the number of nodes for the cases of 2, 3 and 4 nodes, the fraction of all observational equivalence classes that can be singled out by analysis of conditional independence relations alone drastically decreases with the number of nodes for the cases of 2, 3 and 4 nodes.






\subsection{mDAGs that can Realize Every Support on Binary Variables}
\label{sec_every_support}

In this section, we will discuss a particular set of 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering: those that have no unrealizable supports on binary variables, that is, no unrealizable supports when $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$. In other words, an mDAG $\frak G$ of this set, whose canonical pDAG is $\cal G$, is such that $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G},\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2))$ includes all possible sets of events over four binary variables. This set of mDAGs includes all of the mDAGs that are proved to be saturated (i.e., the saturated proven-equivalence block), which consists of 2134 mDAGs, together with the extra 7 mDAGs depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}. Each one of these 7 mDAGs belongs to a different block of the proven-equivalence partition, and each of these blocks includes just one mDAG.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/fig_compatible_with_any_support.pdf}
	\caption{Seven mDAGs that do not appear in the same block as the saturated mDAGs in the proven-equivalence partition induced by the rules described in Section~\ref{sec_show_equivalence}, but that nevertheless can realize any support on binary variables. mDAGs (a)-(d) are shown to \emph{not} be saturated via analysis of supports on variables of higher cardinality. It is still unknown whether mDAGs (e)-(g) are observationally inequivalent to the saturated mDAGs.}
	\label{fig_compatible_any_support}
\end{figure}



As it turns out, this set of mDAGs is a block of the proven-inequivalence partition induced by the graphical rules of Section~\ref{sec_graphical} together with the comparison of unrealizable supports on $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$ that have up to 4 events. As one can check, comparing unrealizable supports on  $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$ that have larger numbers of events does not help, as these mDAGs do not have any unrealizable supports on  $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$  even up to the maximum number of $2^{4}=16$ events.





If we go beyond $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$, we can show that the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(d) are \emph{not} saturated. Specifically, for $\vec c_\text{vis}=(3,2,2,2)$ they cannot realize the support constituted by the following events: 
\begin{align*}
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=1,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=1,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=1,X_b=0,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=1,X_b=1,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=2,X_b=0,X_c=0,X_d=1\}, \\
		& \{X_a=2,X_b=1,X_c=1,X_d=0\}. 
\end{align*}


This was already noted in Eq. (18) of Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023}. In fact, the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(d) correspond to Table II of Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023}.

It follows that the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(d) are not saturated. Furthermore, by the comparison of unrealizable supports, we can also see that the support on  $\vec c_\text{vis}=(3,2,2,2)$ constituted by the following events  cannot be realized by Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(c) and Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(d), but can be realized by Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(b):
\begin{align*}
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=0,X_c=1,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=0,X_b=1,X_c=0,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=1,X_b=0,X_c=0,X_d=1\}, \\
		& \{X_a=1,X_b=1,X_c=1,X_d=0\}, \\
		& \{X_a=2,X_b=0,X_c=1,X_d=1\}, \\
		& \{X_a=2,X_b=1,X_c=1,X_d=1\}. 
\end{align*}

Therefore, we learn that the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(b) are inequivalent to the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(c)-(d), which gives us the proven-inequivalence blocks depicted in Fig.~\ref{veinn_big_class}.  This is the most we can learn about inequivalences between these mDAGs by checking supports on $\vec c_\text{vis}=(3,2,2,2)$ up to 7 events.

The letters (a)-(g) in this diagram refer to the corresponding mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}.}
	\label{veinn_big_class}
\end{figure*}


Regarding mDAGs \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(e)-\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(g), there are three possibilities. The first one is that, if we go to even higher cardinality of the visible variables, we can prove inequivalence by comparison of unrealizable supports. This option would only use theoretical tools that we already have at hand, but it would require significant computational power. The second option is that these mDAGs are actually saturated for all cardinalities of the visible variables, even if the dominance-proving rules that we have at hand cannot prove this. In this case, we would potentially be guided to new dominance-proving rules. The third possibility is that these mDAGs are \emph{not} saturated, potentially even for binary cardinalities of the visible variables, but that this cannot be deduced from the comparison of unrealizable supports. That is, it could be the case that they have unrealizable \emph{distributions} over binary variables, even if there is no unrealizable \emph{support} over binary variables. If we find out that this is the case, then we would have found an example of pDAGs $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ such that $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}_1,\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2))\neq \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{G}_2,\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2))$, while $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G}_1,\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2))= \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{G}_2,\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2))$. This would imply that the converse implication to that of Eq.~\eqref{eq_possibilistic_open_question} \emph{does not} hold.


Note that this third case could also happen with mDAGs \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-\ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(d): since they can realize any support on on  $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$, if we find that they are not saturated on  $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$ we would answer the open question of the converse of Eq.~\eqref{eq_possibilistic_open_question} negatively. It is worth noting that, by Lemma~\ref{prop_edge_dropping}, the mDAG \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a) is dominated by \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(b) and \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(e)-(g), while the mDAG \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(c) is dominated by \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(d) and \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(e)-(g). Therefore, if \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a) and \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(c) are saturated for $\vec c_\text{vis}=(2,2,2,2)$, all of the others are as well.







\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}


In this work, we have gathered all the currently known techniques to prove observational dominance or nondominance between causal structures, extended the scope of these techniques, proved logical implications among them, and applied them to causal structures with three and four visible nodes.  

For the case of three visible variables, Fig. 13 of Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016} had already presented representatives of blocks of a proven-equivalence partition. However, in Ref.~\cite{evans_graphs_2016} it was not explicitly shown that all of these were observational equivalence classes (i.e., that they were all observationally inequivalent), and the observational partial order was not studied. Here,  we were able to deduce the observational equivalence classes and observational partial order for 3-node mDAGs.


For the case of four visible variables, we showed that the total number of observational equivalence classes for 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering is between $1253$ and $1444$. Furthermore, $1156$ observational equivalence classes are already identified.

Classifying the classical causal structures into observational equivalence classes and establishing the observational partial order among these classes is important for several reasons. For one, it drastically lowers the number of possible causal explanations to be considered for a set of data relative to the total number of mDAGs. For another, the dominance order can be used to simplify the task of model selection (as discussed in Section \ref{significanceforcausaldiscovery}).
  It also helps in assessing how many classes present non-trivial inequality constraints.

Inequality constraints seem to be generic in the sense of the number of observational equivalence classes having inequality constraints growing
with the number of visible variables: it is $1/3$ for 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, and at least $85.2\%$ for 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering.  We also argued against relying only on conditional independence relations
 for causal discovery on the basis that these constraints have a poor distinguishing power for observational equivalence classes: for 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, $2/3$ of the observational equivalence classes can be identified by conditional independence relations 
  alone; for 3-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering, however, this fraction drops to less than $10\%$. These arguments highlight the importance 
   of inequality constraints and nested Markov constraints for the task of classical causal discovery.

From the point of view of quantum causality,  this result is also relevant because only the causal structures that exhibit inequality constraints  have the potential of presenting quantum-classical gaps, that is, of being such that 
 the distributions realizable by quantum semantics are a superset of the distributions realizable by classical semantics.  All of the \nonalgebraic mDAGs that we identified here were already identified in Ref.~\cite{Khanna_2023}, but our classification shows that the \emph{majority} of observational equivalence classes have the potential of presenting quantum-classical gaps. This shows that the property of exhibiting a quantum-classical gap might not be the exception, but rather the norm.

Another result from this work that is relevant to quantum physicists who are interested in causal inference is an identification of the set of all 4-node mDAGs consistent with a fixed nodal ordering that admit a fine-tuning theorem similar to the one that holds for Bell's causal structure~\cite{Wood_and_Spekkens}. That is, if the set of conditional independence relations of an observed distribution matches exactly the set of d-separation relations of the mDAG but the distribution \emph{violates} one of the inequality constraints of the mDAG, then this distribution \emph{does not} admit any non-fine-tuned causal explanation in the classical framework for causal modelling. The mDAGs for which such an argument can be made are the ones that belong to observational equivalence classes identified by d-separation alone, one example being the {\tt Square} structure of Fig.~\ref{fig_Bell_and_Square}(b). This result is of interest for quantum physicists, because many times quantum theory predicts such violations.

To finish the classification of structures with four visible nodes, there are two options: (i) we continue the comparison of unrealizable supports (Section \ref{sec_unrealizable_supports}) but with higher cardinalities of the visible variables, that might complete the classification but will be computationally expensive. (ii) we find new dominance-proving or nondominance-proving rules that help us finish the classification. Note that these two options are not mutually exclusive: we might find a new nondominance-proving rule that helps us complete the classification, at the same time that a comparison of unrealizable supports at high enough cardinality would in principle also solve it.

Another open problem that this work has generated is the question of whether possibilistic equivalence implies probabilistic equivalence. In other words, if two causal structures have the same set of unrealizable supports for a certain assignment of cardinalities of the visible variables, does this mean that they have the same set of realizable distributions for those cardinalities? This problem was not solved here, but a possible route of investigation was outlined: all the mDAGs of Fig.~\ref{fig_compatible_any_support} can realize every support on binary variables, even if there is currently no rule that shows that \ref{fig_compatible_any_support}(a)-(g) are observationally equivalent to the saturated class for binary variables. Therefore, if one can show that any of these mDAGs \emph{cannot} realize every probability distribution on binary variables, one has found a counter-example to the conjecture that possibilistic equivalence implies probabilistic equivalence.
