\section{Alignment of Robust Vision Encoders with CLIP}
\label{app:clip_align}

We align multiple robust classification models to \textbf{CLIP ViT-L/14} by training a \textbf{fully connected affine transformation} that maps their feature space to CLIP’s vision space. Similar to \cite{moayeri2023text}, the fully connected layer is optimized using \textbf{Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)} with a learning rate of \textbf{0.01}, momentum of \textbf{0.9}, and weight decay of \textbf{5e-4}, while a \textbf{cosine annealing scheduler} with \(\text{T}_{\max} = 200\) adjusts the learning rate over \textbf{six epochs}. Once trained, this alignment enables direct comparison between an image processed by the given model and \textbf{CLIP-derived text embeddings} using \textbf{cosine similarity} to evaluate zero-shot performance across several classification benchmarks. To evaluate the robust multimodal alignment of different vision encoders, we generate adversarial examples to assess their adversarial zero-shot performance. These adversarial examples are crafted by minimizing the cosine similarity between the image features extracted by the vision model and the CLIP text features corresponding to the image prompt, following the approach in \cite{mao2022understanding}.

We expand upon the results presented in the main paper by analyzing the alignment between various vision encoders and the \clip vision encoder. Our analysis includes additional architectures such as adversarially trained ConvNext-L and WideResNet-50 models. As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:robust_accuracy_clip_alignment_app}, models trained on large-scale adversarial datasets exhibit superior zero-shot robustness compared to other robust vision models. This enhanced robustness, particularly evident in models like ViT-G and ViT-H, can be attributed to two key factors: (\textbf{1}) extensive adversarial training on large-scale datasets, and (\textbf{2}) the use of a frozen \clip text encoder as a zero-shot classifier during the pretraining phase. The latter enables effective adversarial training on image-text pairs, leading to robust multi-modal alignment between the vision and text modalities.

%In Figure \ref{fig:robust_accuracy_clip_alignment_app}, we extend the results reported in the main paper by evaluating the alignment of various vision encoders with the \clip vision encoder, including adversarially trained ConvNext-L and WideResNet-50 models. As shown in Figure \ref{alg:alignment} of the main paper, models trained on large-scale adversarial datasets demonstrate significantly enhanced zero-shot robustness compared to other robust vision models. This robust multi-modal alignment, observed in models such as ViT-G and ViT-H, can be attributed to their large-scale adversarial training, as well as the use of the frozen \clip text encoder as a zero-shot classifier during pretraining stage to do large-scale adversarial training on image-text dataset.

\section{Robustness Against White-Box Untargetted Attacks}
\label{app:wb_untargetted}
In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of different vision encoders integrated within the LLaVA framework for White-box untargetted adversarial attacks. Our analysis focuses on both robust and standard ImageNet-trained models, examining their performance after pretraining and finetuning stages. Table \ref{tab:imagent_robust_encoders} summarizes these results.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We analyze two models: (\textbf{1}) ViT-B/16, which undergoes adversarial training on ImageNet-1K, and (\textbf{2}) ViT-L/14, which is pretrained on the larger ImageNet-21K dataset before being fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K. Our findings reveal distinct performance characteristics for each model. While ViT-B/16 demonstrates moderate robustness against adversarial attacks, its overall performance falls notably short of \oursgiant. Conversely, ViT-L/14 achieves superior performance on clean data compared to ViT-B/16 but shows minimal resistance to adversarial attacks. This performance gain for clean data can be attributed to ViT-L/14's exposure to a substantially larger pretraining dataset, enabling better generalization capabilities.
For qualitative validation, we provide extensive visual examples across different tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Captioning}: Figures \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_1}--\ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_4} demonstrate adversarial attacks on the COCO dataset
    \item \textbf{Visual Question Answering}: Figures \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack} and \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack_2} showcase attacks on the VQAv2 dataset
\end{itemize}
These qualitative examples clearly demonstrate the strong robustness of \oursgiant compared to competing robust models \farefour and \simclipfour.



%In Table \ref{tab:imagent_robust_encoders}, we evaluate the integration of robust and standard ImageNet-trained models within the LLaVA framework, incorporating these vision encoders during both the pretraining and finetuning stages. The ViT-B model is adversarially trained on ImageNet-1K, while the ViT-L/14 model is pretrained on the larger ImageNet-21K dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K. The results indicate that ViT-B demonstrates some degree of robustness against adversarial attacks; however, its overall performance is significantly lower than that of \oursgiant. In contrast, ViT-L/14 exhibits no effective robustness against adversarial attacks but achieves superior performance on clean data compared to ViT-B. This performance gain can be attributed to the substantially larger dataset used during ViT-L/14's pretraining, enabling better generalization and clean data performance.
%For qualitative examples, refer to Figures \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_1}, \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_2}, \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_3}, and \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_4} for adversarial attacks on the COCO image captioning task. Similarly, for adversarial attacks on the VQAv2 visual question answering task, see Figures \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack} and \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack_2}. From the qualitative examples we can clearly see the strong robustness achieved by \oursgiant compared to its robust counterparts \farefour and \simclipfour.

\section{Transferability of Adversarial Examples}
\label{app:bb_untargetted}



In this section, we analyze the transferability of adversarial examples across different robust vision encoders integrated into the LLaVA framework for untargetted attacks. We conduct our analysis through two complementary approaches: direct transferability evaluation and ensemble-based attacks.

\subsection{Direct Transferability Analysis}

Table \ref{tab:transferability-attack_app} presents our evaluation of various robust vision encoders against adversarial example transfers. Following the setup in Table \ref{tab:untargetdown} of the main paper, we craft untargeted adversarial examples for both COCO image captioning and VQAv2 visual question answering tasks. Our findings reveal that adversarial transferability is primarily determined by the choice of vision encoder:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \clip-based models exhibit high intra-group transferability
    \item \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate strong transferability within their architectural family
    \item Limited cross-group transferability is observed, despite shared LLM components
\end{itemize}

\textit{Notably, while all models utilize the same large language model during adversarial attack generation, this shared component does not facilitate cross-model transferability.}

%Table \ref{tab:transferability-attack_app} presents the robustness evaluation of various robust vision encoders integrated into the LLaVA framework against the transferability of adversarial examples. In this experiment, adversarial examples were crafted in an untargeted manner on different robust \llava models for the tasks of captioning (COCO) and visual question answering (VQAv2), following a setup similar to that in Table \ref{tab:untargetdown} from the main paper. The results indicate that the transferability of adversarial examples is primarily constrained by the vision encoder used in the framework. For instance, \clip-based models exhibit high transferability among themselves, while \oursgiant and \ourshuge also show strong transferability of adversarial examples within their group. However, transferability between these groups is limited. It is noteworthy that although all models share the same large language model (LLM) utilized during the crafting of adversarial attacks, this does not facilitate the transferability of adversarial examples across models. The key determinant for transferability lies in the similarity between the vision encoders employed in the framework.

\subsection{Ensemble-based Transfer Attacks}

We further evaluate MLLM robustness using the \texttt{MultiTrust} benchmarking framework~\cite{zhang2024benchmarking}, which employs ensemble-based SSA-CWA attacks for generating highly transferable adversarial examples. Our ensemble includes diverse models: ViT-L/14, ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, ViT-G/14, ConvNext-L, and SigLIP. Adversarial examples (\(x_{\text{adv}}\)) are generated by adding imperceptible perturbations (\(\epsilon = 16/255\)) to input images (\(x\)) to mislead models from recognizing the ground-truth label (\(y\)). The attack uses 50 iterations with a step size of \(1/255\), and robustness is tested by prompting MLLMs to describe adversarial images using the template: 
\begin{quote}
\textbf{\textit{``Please provide a detailed description of the image."}}
\end{quote}


%Following a recent benchmarking framework \texttt{MultiTrust}, we evaluate the robustness of MLLMs against adversarial examples crafted using an ensemble of surrogate models with the SSA-CWA as the attack method, which ensures high transferability to unknown MLLMs. The surrogate models include ViT-L/14, ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, ViT-G/14, ConvNext-L, and SigLIP. Adversarial examples (\(x_{\text{adv}}\)) are generated by adding imperceptible perturbations (\(\epsilon = 16/255\)) to input images (\(x\)) to mislead models from recognizing the ground-truth label (\(y\)). The attack uses 50 iterations with a step size of \(1/255\), and robustness is tested by prompting MLLMs to describe adversarial images using the template: 
%\begin{quote}
%\textit{``Please provide a detailed description of the image.''}
%\end{quote}

For evaluation, we use 100 manually relabeled images from the NIPS17 dataset, focusing on commonly understood categories. Model performance is assessed using GPT-4 to determine whether the main object is correctly described in the MLLM outputs. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:robust_accuracy_transfer_ensemble_attack}, both \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate significant robustness improvements, achieving 10-12\% higher accuracy compared to their closest robust counterparts. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach against sophisticated ensemble-based transfer attacks.

%Evaluations use a subset of 100 manually relabeled images from the NIPS17 dataset to align with commonly understood categories. GPT-4 determines the accuracy by assessing whether the main object is correctly described in MLLM outputs. The ensemble-based attack ensures diverse and transferable adversarial examples, with attack success contingent on the adversarial examples being perceptually realistic and of high quality. In Figure \ref{fig:robust_accuracy_transfer_ensemble_attack}, we plot the clean and robust accuracy of MLLLMs incorporating various robust vision encoders. Notably, both \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate substantial improvements in robustness, achieving an increase of approximately 10–12\% compared to their closest robust counterparts.

\section{Robustness Against White-Box Targeted Attacks}
\label{app:wb_targetted}
% In this section, we present a detailed analysis of white-box targeted attacks against various \llava-base MLLM models. Our evaluation extends the results presented in Table \ref{tab:targeted-attack} of the main paper.
We implement targeted attacks following the methodology proposed by \cite{schlarmann2024robust}, employing the APGD attack framework with 10,000 iterations. Table \ref{tab:prompts_target-app} provides a comprehensive list of target captions used in crafting these attacks. These carefully selected captions serve as adversarial targets, designed to evaluate the models' resilience against directed manipulation attempts.
Figure \ref{fig:viz_targetted_attack_1} demonstrates qualitative examples of targeted adversarial attacks on the COCO image captioning task. These examples illustrate the varying degrees of model susceptibility to targeted manipulations and highlight the effectiveness of different defensive strategies.



%Table \ref{tab:prompts_target-app} lists the target captions used to craft targeted attacks on various \llava-base MLLM models. These targeted attacks correspond to the evaluation presented in Table \ref{tab:targeted-attack} of the main paper. For the targeted attack setup, we adopt the approach outlined in \cite{schlarmann2024robust}, utilizing the APGD attack and running it for 10,000 iterations. For qualitative examples, refer to Figure \ref{fig:viz_targetted_attack_1} for targetted adversarial attacks on the COCO image captioning task.

\section{Robustness Against White-Box Jailbreak Attacks} \label{app:wb_jailbreak}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In this section, we present an extensive evaluation of model robustness against white-box VisualAdv jailbreak attacks across multiple perturbation levels. Our analysis examines adversarial images generated with three distinct perturbation budgets: \(\epsilon \in \{ \frac{16}{255}, \frac{64}{255}, \frac{128}{255} \}\).
The \textbf{evaluation protocol} combines adversarially perturbed images with harmful prompts from the RealToxicityPrompts dataset \cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts}. This dataset comprises approximately 1,200 toxic instructions specifically designed to elicit harmful responses from language models. To quantify response toxicity, we employ the Detoxify classifier \cite{Detoxify}, which assigns scores on a scale of 0 (non-toxic) to 1 (highly toxic). A response is classified as toxic if its score exceeds a threshold of 0.5.


Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app} presents our comprehensive ablation study results. The findings demonstrate that both \ourshuge and \oursgiant maintain robust defense mechanisms against generating toxic content, consistently outperforming baseline models across all perturbation budgets. This superior performance persists even under increasingly aggressive perturbation levels, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining safe and appropriate model behavior under adversarial conditions.

%Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app} presents an ablation study across varying perturbation budgets for the white-box VisualAdv jailbreak attack. We expand our analysis to include white-box jailbreak attacks where adversarial images are generated with perturbation levels of \(\epsilon = \{ \frac{16}{255}, \frac{64}{255}, \frac{128}{255} \}\). These adversarial images are then paired with harmful prompts sourced from the RealToxicityPrompts~\cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts} dataset, which contains approximately 1,200 toxic instructions designed to provoke harmful responses from the models. To evaluate the model outputs, we use the Detoxify classifier~\cite{Detoxify}, which assigns a toxicity score ranging from 0 (least toxic) to 1 (most toxic). We then compute the number of outputs that exceed a toxicity threshold of 0.5. As shown in Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app}, both \ourshuge and \oursgiant demonstrate superior robustness against generating toxic attributes in their responses, even under varying perturbation budgets. 
% Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app} reports ablation across varying perturbation budgets on the white-box VisualAdv attack.
% In Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app}, we expand our analysis on white-box jailbreak attacks at varying perturbation budgets. We generate adversarail images with a pertunbation budget of  \(\epsilon = \{ \frac{16}{255}, \frac{64}{255}, \frac{128}{255} \}\).  We then pair the adversarial images with harmful prompts from the RealToxicityPrompts~\cite{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts} dataset, which contains approximately 1,200 toxic instructions designed to elicit harmful content from the models. The model responses are assessed using the Detoxify classifier~\cite{Detoxify}, which assigns toxicity scores ranging from 0 (least toxic) to 1 (most toxic). Finally, we calculate the proportion of outputs that exceed a toxicity threshold of 0.5. As can seen from the Table \ref{tab:lvms-visual-adv-evaluation-app} across varying perturbation budgets, both \ourshuge and \oursgiant show better robustness against generation of toxic attributes in the generated output.

\section{Robustness Against Black-Box Jailbreak Attacks} \label{app:bb_jailbreak}
\vspace{-0.5em}

In this section, we evaluate model robustness against black-box jailbreak attacks where adversaries operate without access to model parameters or gradients. Our analysis utilizes the HADES benchmark~\cite{li2024images} in a black-box setting, encompassing harmful instructions across four distinct categories: \textit{Violence}, \textit{Financial}, \textit{Privacy}, and \textit{Animal}.

%To evaluate the robustness of models against black-box jailbreak attacks, we analyze scenarios where adversaries operate without access to model parameters or gradients. This evaluation leverages the HADES benchmark in black-box setting, which comprises of harmful instructions across differnt distinct categories, such as \textit{Violence}, \textit{Financial}, \textit{Privacy}, and \textit{Animal}. These attacks exploit the weaker visual alignment of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) through a sophisticated two-stage process.

The attack exploits MLLMs' visual-text alignment vulnerabilities through a two-stage process:

\noindent  \underline{\textbf{Stage 1: Text-to-Visual Translation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Harmful keywords are extracted from input text
    \item Keywords are converted to typographical representations
    \item Harmful content is replaced with generic image-related placeholders
    \item This transformation shifts adversarial cues from textual to visual domain
\end{itemize}

\noindent \underline{\textbf{Stage 2: Harmful Image Generation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Harmful images are generated using publicly available diffusion models
    \item Prompts are iteratively optimized using \texttt{GPT-4-0613} as the adversarial LLM attacker
    \item Final input combines typographically modified text with harmful images
\end{itemize}

%In the first stage, harmful keywords present in the input text are extracted and converted into typographical representations, replacing the harmful content with generic image-related placeholders. This stage shifts adversarial cues from the textual domain to the visual domain, making it harder for models to detect the attack. In the second stage, a harmful image is generated using publicly available diffusion models, with prompts optimized iteratively using LLMs. The final input consists of a typographically modified textual instruction paired with a visually harmful image, creating a composite adversarial input. This setup represents a highly practical and realistic threat as it relies solely on publicly accessible tools, requiring no internal knowledge of the model under attack. The prompts for image generation are optimized iteratively using the \texttt{GPT-4-0613} model, which serves as the adversarial LLM attacker. 
Our \textbf{evaluation protocol} employs a comprehensive dataset of 600 harmful instructions spanning four distinct categories: \textit{Violence}, \textit{Financial}, \textit{Privacy}, and \textit{Animal}. To assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we utilize Beaver-7B \cite{ji2024beavertails}, a specialized model designed for content safety evaluation. Beaver-7B assigns toxicity scores to model outputs, enabling us to determine whether attacks successfully bypass the model's safety mechanisms. The quantitative results, presented as Attack Success Rates (ASR) in Table {\color{red}\ref{tab:hades}} of the main paper, provide a detailed assessment of model vulnerability to these sophisticated attacks.

%Subsequently, 600 harmful instructions spanning four scenarios—\textit{Violence}, \textit{Financial}, \textit{Privacy}, and \textit{Animal}—are paired with corresponding harmful images and presented to the model. The harmfulness of the model's responses to these adversarial inputs is evaluated using Beaver-7B~\cite{ji2024beavertails}, a model designed specifically to assess content safety. Beaver-7B assigns a toxicity score to the model’s outputs, which determines whether the attack successfully bypassed the model’s safety mechanisms. 

%This analysis addresses critical security concerns in real-world MLLM deployments by focusing on practical attack scenarios that require no internal model knowledge. The significance of our evaluation lies in its reliance on publicly accessible tools and its exploitation of fundamental weaknesses in visual-text alignment. By examining these practical adversarial scenarios, we provide insights into model vulnerabilities and defensive capabilities against sophisticated black-box jailbreak attacks. %The comprehensive results in Table~\ref{tab:hades} serve as a crucial benchmark for understanding and improving MLLM robustness against these emerging security threats.

%This analysis highlights the practical challenges posed by black-box adversarial attacks, where adversaries exploit the model’s weak alignment between textual and visual modalities. By reporting ASR under these settings in Table \ref{tab:hades} of main paper, we provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of the robustness of multi-modal models against highly realistic adversarial jailbreak threats.


\section{Robustness of Vision Encoders Ensembles}
\label{app:ensemble_vision}

In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of vision encoder ensembles within the MLLM framework, extending the results from Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_ensemble} of the main paper.
We expand our analysis of vision encoder ensembles with \oursgiant beyond the original tasks, incorporating additional benchmarks including Visual Question Answering (VQAv2), VizWiz, and OKVQA. The results, presented in Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_apgd_ensemble_app}, consistently demonstrate that MLLM robustness is fundamentally limited by the weakest vision encoder in the ensemble.
Our investigation further explores two additional ensemble configurations. First, Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_apgd_app2} presents a detailed analysis of model ensembling with \ourshuge as the base architecture. Second, in Table \ref{tab:untarget_ensemble_attack_app}, we compare the performance of our most robust ensemble configurations against single-model robust baselines under the more challenging APGD-Ensemble attack.

The findings across all configurations reinforce our key observation: \textit{\textbf{the overall robustness of an ensemble system is inherently bounded by its least robust component model}}. This principle holds true even under more sophisticated attack strategies, highlighting the critical importance of individual model robustness in ensemble configurations.


%In Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_apgd_ensemble_app}, we extend the results presented in Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_ensemble} of the main paper, where different vision encoders were ensembled with \oursgiant. This expanded analysis includes additional tasks such as VQAv2, VizWiz, and OKVQA, providing a broader evaluation of the model's robustness across various benchmarks. Consistent with the trends observed in the main paper, we find that the robustness of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) is constrained by the robustness of the weakest vision encoder within the framework. 
%Additionally, in Table \ref{tab:untargetdown_apgd_app2}, we further expand this analysis to report model ensembling results with \ourshuge. Finally, in Table \ref{tab:untarget_ensemble_attack_app}, we compare the most robust ensembled models with uni-model robust models under the stronger APGD-Ensemble attack. These results clearly demonstrate that the overall robustness of an ensemble is constrained by the robustness of its weakest constituent model.

\caption{\textbf{Robustness of MLLMs with an Ensemble of Vision Encoders under APGD-Ensemble Attack.}
This table presents the robust performance of LLaVA across two tasks: image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). For VQA tasks (TextVQA, VQAv2, VizWiz, OKVQA), VQA accuracy is reported, while for captioning tasks (COCO, Flickr30k), the CIDEr score is provided. Additionally, the most robust ensemble models, \oursgiant + \farefour and \oursgiant + \ourshuge, are evaluated against the strong APGD-Ensemble attack.

\label{app:common_corruptions}

In this section, we present an extensive evaluation of MLLM robustness against common image corruptions, expanding upon the results reported in the main paper. Our analysis encompasses three tasks, with results presented in Table \ref{tab:corruptions-coco-app} for COCO image captioning, Table \ref{tab:corruptions-vqa-app} for VQAv2 visual question answering, and Table \ref{tab:corruptions-okv-app} for OKVQA knowledge-based visual reasoning.
For each corruption type, we assess model performance across five severity levels. The impact of corruptions is quantified using an average performance drop metric:
\[
\text{Average Drop (\%)} = \frac{S_{1} - S_{5}}{S_{1}} \times 100,
\]
where $S_1$ and $S_5$ represent model performance at the lowest and highest severity levels, respectively.

Our comprehensive analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The qualitative results are presented through two sets of visualizations. Figures \ref{fig:all_corruptions} and \ref{fig:all_corruptions_2} demonstrate MLLM performance across different corruption types, while Figures \ref{fig:corruption_levels_1}, \ref{fig:corruption_levels_2}, and \ref{fig:corruption_levels_3} illustrate the progressive impact of increasing corruption severity. The results consistently demonstrate that both \oursgiant and \ourshuge achieve superior robustness against common corruptions compared to robust baseline models. This enhanced resilience is evident across all corruption types and severity levels, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining reliable performance under varying image degradation conditions.





%In Tables \ref{tab:corruptions-coco-app}, \ref{tab:corruptions-vqa-app}, and \ref{tab:corruptions-okv-app}, we expand upon the results reported in the main paper by presenting the performance of MLLMs on the tasks of COCO, VQAv2, and OKVQA under various common image corruptions. We assess the impact of each corruption type by evaluating the average performance drop across increasing severity levels. Since each corruption type includes five severity levels, the percentage performance drop is calculated as: 
%\[
%\text{Average Drop (\%)} = \frac{S_{1} - S_{5}}{S_{1}} \times 100
%\]

%Figures \ref{fig:all_corruptions} and \ref{fig:all_corruptions_2} present qualitative results showcasing the performance of MLLMs under different corruption types. Meanwhile, Figures \ref{fig:corruption_levels_1}, \ref{fig:corruption_levels_2}, and \ref{fig:corruption_levels_3} illustrate the robustness of MLLMs as the severity level of corruption in the images increases. From both the quantitative and qualitative results, we observe that \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate significantly greater robustness against common corruptions compared to their robust baseline counterparts.




\section{Prompt Formatting at Inference}
\label{app:prompt_formatting}

In this section, we examine the impact of prompt modifications on model robustness during inference. Table~\ref{tab:prompts-app} presents our suite of modified prompts designed for the COCO captioning task, specifically crafted to enhance model resilience against adversarial examples during inference.
We extend our analysis beyond the initial results presented in Table \ref{tab:prompt-formatting_2} of the main paper by evaluating the performance of robust model ensembles within the LLaVA framework. The comprehensive results, detailed in Table \ref{tab:prompt-formatting-app}, demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness through strategic prompt modifications at inference time.

However, it is important to note that while this approach shows promise, it is not inherently secure against adaptive attacks. Adversaries with knowledge of the modified prompts can potentially exploit this information to craft more sophisticated adversarial examples that circumvent these defensive measures.


%Table \ref{tab:prompts-app} outlines the modified prompts employed for the COCO captioning task to enhance robustness against adversarial examples during inference. Additionally, we extend the results presented in Table \ref{tab:prompt-formatting_2} of the main paper by showcasing the performance of robust model ensembles within the LLaVA framework in Table \ref{tab:prompt-formatting-app}. We observe a consistent gain in robustness by modifying the prompts at inference time. However, this approach is not inherently safe against adaptive attacks, where an attacker can also exploit knowledge of the modified prompts to craft adversarial examples.

\section{Hallucinations}
\label{app:hallucinations}
In this section, we present an expanded analysis of model hallucination behavior, building upon the results reported in Table \ref{tab:pope-f1} of the main paper. Our evaluation utilizes the POPE dataset, a benchmark specifically designed for assessing hallucination tendencies. The comprehensive results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:pope-f1-app} for F1-Scores and Table~\ref{tab:pope-acc-app} for accuracy metrics.
Our analysis reveals that ensembling robust models with \clip yields improved performance in hallucination mitigation. However, this improvement pattern does not extend to ensembles incorporating the adversarially fine-tuned \clip variant, \farefour. This discrepancy highlights a key limitation: \textit{the fine-tuning process employed in \farefour appears to compromise the model's generalization capabilities. }
Notably, among the robust model variants, both \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate substantially better performance in controlling object hallucination compared to \farefour. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining reliable object recognition while preserving model robustness.




%In Tables \ref{tab:pope-f1-app} and \ref{tab:pope-acc-app}, we report the F1-Score and accuracy on the POPE dataset, a benchmark for hallucination evaluation. These tables extend the results presented in Table \ref{tab:pope-f1} of the main paper by including the performance of ensembled models. We observe that ensembling robust models with \clip leads to improved performance. However, this trend does not hold when aligning with the adversarially fine-tuned \clip model, \farefour. This highlights the degradation in generalizability of the \clip model caused by the fine-tuning process employed in \farefour. Among the robust models, \oursgiant and \ourshuge demonstrate significant improvements in mitigating object hallucination compared to \farefour.


%\section{Qualitative Results}
%\label{app:qualitative_results}
%In this section, we provide qualitative examples to showcase the performance of various robust MLLMs under different adversarial attacks and image corruptions. Figures \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_1}, \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_2}, \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_3}, and \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_4} illustrate the impact of adversarial attacks on the COCO image captioning task. Similarly, Figures \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack} and \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack_2} demonstrate the effects of adversarial attacks on the VQAv2 visual question answering task. Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:viz_targetted_attack_1} highlights the performance under targeted adversarial attacks on the COCO image captioning task.

%Figures \ref{fig:all_corruptions} and \ref{fig:all_corruptions_2} present qualitative results showcasing the performance of MLLMs under different corruption types. Meanwhile, Figures \ref{fig:corruption_levels_1}, \ref{fig:corruption_levels_2}, and \ref{fig:corruption_levels_3} illustrate the robustness of MLLMs as the severity level of corruption in the images increases.

\section{Qualitative Results}
\label{app:qualitative_results}

In this section, we present comprehensive qualitative examples demonstrating the performance of various robust MLLMs under different adversarial scenarios and image corruptions. Our visual analysis spans multiple tasks and evaluation settings.

For the COCO image captioning task, we provide extensive examples of model behavior under adversarial attacks in Figures~\ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_1} through \ref{fig:untargetted_figures_app_4}. These examples illustrate how different models respond to untargeted adversarial perturbations. We further explore targeted adversarial attacks on the same task in Figure~\ref{fig:viz_targetted_attack_1}, highlighting the specific challenges posed by directed adversarial manipulations.
For visual question answering, Figures~\ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack} and \ref{fig:vqa_untargetted_attack_2} demonstrate model performance on the VQAv2 dataset under adversarial conditions. These examples showcase how adversarial attacks can affect the model's reasoning capabilities across different question types.
Regarding image corruption robustness, we present two complementary sets of results. Figures~\ref{fig:all_corruptions} and \ref{fig:all_corruptions_2} demonstrate model performance across various corruption types, while Figures \ref{fig:corruption_levels_1}, \ref{fig:corruption_levels_2}, and \ref{fig:corruption_levels_3} provide a detailed examination of model behavior under increasing corruption severity levels. These visualizations help understand how different models maintain performance as image quality degrades.

These qualitative results complement our quantitative findings, providing concrete examples of how our robust training approach enhances model reliability across diverse challenging scenarios. The examples consistently demonstrate that \oursgiant and \ourshuge maintain more reliable and semantically appropriate outputs compared to baseline methods, even under severe adversarial perturbations or image corruptions.
