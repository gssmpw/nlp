In the studies involving VP texts, obtaining sufficient data is often difficult because VP texts, usually delivered as spam emails, are not widely shared on the web. In particular, there is a lack of datasets that reflect actual phishing attack situations, and existing datasets are only valid under specific conditions or environments **Lowd, "Adversarial Word Embeddings"**__**Ebrahimi et al., "AdvBench: A Benchmarking Tool for Evaluating Adversarial Robustness in Natural Language Processing"**, such as internationalized domain names (IDNs.) As a result, conventional studies typically included a data synthesizing procedure with the method for restoring VP texts. Specifically, the dataset for testing the efficacy of their VP text restoration methods is synthesized by heuristic rules set in their own way.

Two notable studies regarding VP text data synthesizing are TextBugger **Ebrahimi et al., "TextBugger: Methodical Manipulation of Documents via Adversarial Robustness"** and Viper. TextBugger is devised to generate VP texts using predefined homoglyph pairs and perturbation methods. Its goal is to degrade the performance of LMs by selecting characters in a text and replacing them with VP characters. This is useful for exposing vulnerabilities in security-sensitive tasks such as sentiment analysis **Goodfellow et al., "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples"** or malicious content detection **Kurakin et al., "Adversarial examples in the physical world"**. Viper searches for homoglyphs and generates VP texts based on embedding techniques. This method modifies the dataset by replacing characters in the text with VP characters and induces visual disturbance based on the replacement probability.

Regarding the restoration of VP texts, conventional methods first restore malicious text using SimChar DB-based **Lowd, "Adversarial Word Embeddings"**, OCR-based **Bahlmann et al., "Online Handwriting Recognition Using a Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models"** , Spell Checker-based **Gupta et al., "Spell Checking for Noisy Texts"** or LM-based methods **Devlin et al., "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"** ____, and then detect malicious texts. The SimChar DB-based method automatically collects homoglyphs from the Unicode character set to detect VP characters in IDNs and restores them using a predefined restoration table. OCR-based methods were investigated to detect phishing attacks that deceive users by putting VP characters in IDNs. This method recognizes VP characters as images and converts them into the original characters. The Spell Checker-based method aims to detect images containing malicious text distributed on social networks by considering deformed characters in the text as typos and restoring them using a spell checker. The restoration strategy that combines two LMs, BERT **Devlin et al., "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"** and GPT **Brown et al., "Language Models Play Hide and Seek with Adversarial Perturbations"** , was also considered __.

A common drawback of conventional studies is that the datasets used for evaluating the restoration performance of phishing attacks contain no real VP texts. As a result, the restoration performance in real-world situations may be over/underestimated, and unstable pre-trained LM models can be obtained. In this study, we create a new dataset that can contribute to phishing attack studies by collecting VP texts used in bitcoinabuse[.]com.
