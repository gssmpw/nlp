\paragraph{Persona Modeling} 
Persona modeling in personalized applications captures user preferences and behaviors from behavioral data or dialogue history, with advancements driven by LLMs \cite{li2021survey, tan2023user, tseng2024two}. Most studies focus on one-time persona generation from static user behavior or profile data \cite{ji2023chatgpt, wang2023zero, zhou2024language, wu2024rlpf, wang2024incharacter, xu2024character, lyu2023llm, salemi2023lamp}. To address real-world challenges, dynamic persona modeling using streaming user data has emerged \cite{lian2022incremental, wang2020incremental, yin2023heterogeneous, qin2024enhancing}. Departing from regeneration- and extension-based approaches, our method refines personas by integrating user behaviors and model predictions for more accurate and effective updates.

\paragraph{LLM for Recommendation and Behavior Prediction}
LLMs are increasingly applied in personalized systems like recommendation engines \cite{wang2023recmind,wu_surveylargelanguagemodels_2024,zhang2023recommendation}. Some studies integrate LLMs into traditional frameworks to enhance user modeling and contextual understanding \cite{liu2024once,zhang2024generative,li2023ctrl, li2023exploring}, while others employ LLMs directly for generating recommendations or predicting future behaviors, leveraging their persona modeling capabilities for greater adaptability and precision \cite{liu2023chatgpt, lyu2023llm, gao2023chat,dai2023uncovering}. This work leverages LLMs for dynamic persona modeling and behavior prediction to capture usersâ€™ evolving preferences.
