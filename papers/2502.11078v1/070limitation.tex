First, this study focuses on dynamic persona modeling using discrete, quantifiable user behaviors, such as ratings, as \method relies on prediction discrepancies for updates and reward computation. Other data forms, such as natural language interactions, are beyond its scope. Second, due to data availability constraints, we validate \method using user rating prediction tasks, which are widely applicable and provide ample real-world sequential behavior data across domains. Nevertheless, the \method framework is adaptable to broader user interaction scenarios. Finally, the insights derived from the book domain are specific to the dataset and model used, and their generalizability to other datasets and models remains uncertain.
