\paragraph{Risks} First, the datasets used in this work are publicly available and anonymized. However, we acknowledge that user behavior data, even in aggregate form, may raise privacy concerns if not handled properly. Second, our model relies on datasets that may not fully represent all user groups or domains, leading to potential biases in persona refinement and prediction. The proposed method could potentially be misused for excessive user behavior tracking or manipulative personalization. Developers and practitioners should ensure ethical use in line with user privacy regulations.
