\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong natural language processing capabilities but also inherit and amplify societal biases, including gender bias, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods face significant limitations: parameter tuning requires access to model weights, prompt-based approaches often degrade model utility, and optimization-based techniques lack generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{DR.GAP} (\textit{D}emonstration and \textit{R}easoning for \textit{G}ender-\textit{A}ware \textit{P}rompting), an automated and model-agnostic approach that mitigates gender bias while preserving model performance. \textit{DR.GAP} selects bias-revealing examples and generates structured reasoning to guide models toward more impartial responses. Extensive experiments on coreference resolution and QA tasks across multiple LLMs (\texttt{GPT-3.5}, \texttt{Llama3}, and \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}) demonstrate its effectiveness, generalization ability, and robustness. DR.GAP can generalize to vision-language models (VLMs), achieving significant \mbox{bias reduction.}

\section{Introduction}

Large Language Models (LLMs) \cite{ouyang2022training,openai2023gpt4,touvron2023llama2,grattafiori2024llama3} have made significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP). %particularly in coreference resolution \cite{levesque_winograd_nodate,brack2021coreference} and question-answering (QA) tasks \cite{parrish_bbq_2022,li_unqovering_2020,dhamala_bold_2021} that reflect the text understanding and generation capabilities. 
However, trained on large-scale, unfiltered datasets, they  not only inherit but also magnify social biases, exacerbating existing inequities \cite{mei2023bias,mechura2022taxonomy}. Gender bias, as a typical form of social bias, has been proven to be widely present in LLMs \cite{dong2024disclosure,zhonga2024gender}. Effectively mitigating gender bias in the outputs generated by LLMs has become an urgent issue.

An effective debiasing method should adhere to several essential criteria: (1) \textbf{Automation} to minimize human intervention, (2) \textbf{Applicability} to both open-source and black-box models to accommodate diverse deployment scenarios, (3) \textbf{Preservation} of the original model’s utility. However, existing gender debias approaches fail to simultaneously satisfy these requirements. Parameter-tuning methods, such as supervised fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora,thakur2023languagemodelsgendermakeover,zmigrod2019counterfactual,zhang2024genderalign} and model editing \cite{meng_locating_2023,cai2024locating,anonymous2024Editbias}, rely on direct access to model parameters, rendering them inapplicable in black-box settings. Prompt-based techniques \cite{si2022prompting, dwivedi2023breaking, oba2024contextual}, while applicable to black-box models, often require extensive manual design and risk deteriorating model utility on normal tasks. For example, prompts with ``fairness requirements'' may cause models to give more cautious and ambiguous answers in some tasks, or even increase the model's focus on gender factors, thereby exacerbating bias \cite{ferrara2023fairness}. In addition, prompts with ``detailed counterfactual preambles'' (CFD) \cite{oba2024contextual} can impair model reasoning. As shown in Table 1, when \texttt{Llama3} is given the counterfactual preamble ``\textit{Despite being a female, Susan became a mechanical engineer. /Despite being a male, Noah became a preschool and kindergarten teacher.}''  it exhibits two failure modes. First, the counterfactual overrides the model’s natural sentence parsing, causing the model to ignore the logical relationships in the sentence under the premise of ``\textit{Female engineer/Male teacher}''. Second, the preamble reinforces counterintuitive relationships (e.g., despite implying unexpectedness), causing the model to misinterpret gendered pronouns and generate erroneous answers.


%Therefore, how to carefully provide examples to mitigate gender bias while avoiding overcorrection and learning irrelevant content has become a greater challenge.

%Various methods for mitigating gender bias have been proposed in prior research. Parameter-tuning methods, which directly access the internal parameters of the model, including fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora,thakur2023languagemodelsgendermakeover,zmigrod2019counterfactual,zhang2024genderalign} and model editing \cite{meng_locating_2023,cai2024locating,anonymous2024Editbias}, have been extensively studied and have achieved certain results. However, these methods still have some limitations. For example, as the model parameters increase, the cost of each fine-tuning session also rises significantly. Moreover, due to technical safety concerns, some advanced models are not open-sourced, preventing users from directly accessing the model parameters and thus making these methods inapplicable. Additionally, directly modifying model parameters may also introduce other risks, such as catastrophic forgetting. 


%Due to the instruction-following and self-correction capabilities of LLMs \cite{ganguli2023capacity}, prompt-based methods offer a novel approach to mitigate bias without modifying model parameters, thereby overcoming limitations in computational costs. Although these methods have proven effective in reducing gender bias in specific tasks for LLMs, they also have their own limitations. 

%For example, detailed counterfactual preambles(CFD) introduced by \citet{oba2024contextual}, which provides carefully picked counterfactual statements before user text, may impair the model's performance on normal tasks. As shown in Table 1, when Llama3 is given the counterfactual preamble ``\textit{Despite being a female, Susan became a mechanical engineer. /Despite being a male, Noah became a preschool and kindergarten teacher.}'' it affects the model's responses in two ways. First, the counterfactual statement itself becomes the context of the user's query, causing the model to ignore the logical relationships in the sentence under the premise of ``\textit{Female engineer/Male teacher}'' and produce incorrect answers, even though the model can correctly parse the sentence without the preamble. Second, because the counterfactual statement includes a counterintuitive relationship led by \textit{despite}, the model may learn this counterintuitive relationship. This can lead it to generate incorrect responses for sentences containing gendered pronouns, even though it could originally analyze them correctly. Therefore, how to carefully provide examples to mitigate gender bias while avoiding overcorrection and learning irrelevant content has become a greater challenge.

%Guided by the principles of Prompt Engineering(PE) and In-Context Learning(ICL), \citet{dwivedi2023breaking} propose a directive strategy to enhance the gender neutrality of large language model responses in text generation tasks. This strategy guides users to optimize prompts for each query, thereby achieving a significant reduction in gender bias for individual queries. However, the implementation of this strategy requires substantial manual effort, making it difficult to generalize for a class of tasks in practical applications. Therefore, the automation of prompt content generation and generalizability across tasks are also necessary.

To fill this gap and simultaneously satisfy these requirements, we propose \textit{DR.GAP} (\textbf{D}emonstration and \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{G}ender-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}rompting), an automated system to provide \textbf{gender-neutral demonstrations and reasoning} as prefix that directs the model to focus more on semantic logic rather than gender-specific details, thereby mitigating the gender bias. As illustrated in \mbox{Figure \ref{fig_1}}, 
%the core concept of \textit{DR.GAP} is to rigorously construct gender-neutral reasoning examples through an automated process. 
\textit{DR.GAP} first selects demonstrations that effectively reflect the model's gender bias. To do so, we select demonstration data where the target LLM fails but a reference model succeeds, ensuring that errors stem from gender bias rather than ambiguity or reasoning limitations. Then, \textit{DR.GAP} uses the reference model to generate a bias-free reasoning on the selected demonstration. This process incoporates four independent and sequential modules. First,the explicit initial reasoning is obtained by constraining the model to think step-by-step with a syllogistic reasoning structure. Next, verification module and gender-independence module guides the model to overcome inherent error propensity and gender bias that may affect the reasoning process. Finally, we add an refinement module that iteraively generate reasoning examples to ensure the comprehensiveness and stability of the method. The whole process ensures that the generated reasoning examples contain gender-neutral argument logic, improving the accuracy and fairness of the reasoning. Extensive experiments on coreference resolution tasks and Question-Answering (QA) tasks demonstrate that \textit{DR.GAP} outperforms baselines, indicating the effective reasoning and demonstrating can guide model to generate fairer responses.

\section{Related Word}

\subsection{Gender Bias Evaluation Methods} 

%Language is closely tied to identity, social relations, and power, and often reflects gender biases in pre-trained large language models (LLMs).
%Since LLMs predict the next word based on the given context, these biases can be assessed through carefully designed comprehension and generation tasks.
Prior studies have examined gender bias in LLMs through text generation and comprehension tasks, with the former detecting externally exhibited gender bias in generated content \cite{smith_im_2022, nozza_honest_2021}, and the latter eliciting internal bias through tasks like coreference resolution and question answering (QA). 
%In text generation tasks, models are asked to produce content involving entities with different attributes. By evaluating the toxicity and sentiment of the generated text, discrepancies in the model's outputs across different gender contexts can be revealed \cite{smith_im_2022, nozza_honest_2021, dhamala_bold_2021, wan2023kelly, haim2024s}.
Coreference resolution identifies noun phrases referring to the same entity in gender-related or stereotype-involved contexts, revealing bias by measuring incorrect identifications across genders \cite{webster_mind_2018, levy_collecting_2021}.
%, aiding in language understanding \cite{zhao_gender_2018, rudinger_gender_2018, webster_mind_2018, levy_collecting_2021}. 
QA tasks compare model answers, based on factual premises and questions, with golden truths or neutral statements, expecting judgment based solely on context, not stereotypes \cite{nadeem_stereoset_2020, li_unqovering_2020}.
% the model is provided with factual premises and corresponding questions, expecting it to make correct judgments based on the given content. The answers may be ambiguous \cite{li_unqovering_2020}, unambiguous \cite{nadeem_stereoset_2020}, or a mix of both, to measure bias under different settings.

\subsection{Bias Mitigation Methods}
Various bias-mitigating strategies have been proposed, including white-box approaches that modify model parameters, such as fine-tuning \cite{raza2024mbias, zhang2024genderalign}, controlled decoding \cite{liu-etal-2021-dexperts}, and model editing \cite{cai_locating_2024, si2022prompting}. While effective, these methods are limited by accessibility and efficiency.
In contrast, black-box methods leave the model unchanged and use textual prompts to steer generation towards unbiased outputs, employing techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and in-context learning (ICL) \cite{schick2021self,sant2024power}, providing a flexible and computationally efficient alternative.
% are typically divided into white-box and black-box methods based on model access.
% As mentioned earlier, even pre-trained large language models that are generally aligned with human values still exhibit gender bias. To address this issue, various strategies have been proposed. These approaches are typically divided into two main categories based on the level of access to the model's internal parameters: white-box methods and black-box methods.

% White-box methods require direct access to the model's internal parameters and include techniques such as fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora} and model editing \cite{meng_locating_2023}, both of which have emerged as effective strategies alongside the rise of LLMs. Fine-tuning generally involves the creation of a gender-inclusive dataset \cite{thakur2023languagemodelsgendermakeover, dong2024disclosure, bartl2024showgirls}, often utilizing variations of Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA; \citealp{zmigrod2019counterfactual}) or a specialized dataset for instruction-finetuning \cite{raza2024mbias} or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; \citealp{zhang2024genderalign, allam2024biasdpo}). 
% While model editing typically involves two key methods: \textit{i}) locating the bias pathways \cite{cai2024locating} or identifying specific biased data entries \cite{deng2024promoting} before applying edits; \textit{ii}) using editor hyper-networks to automatically modify model parameters \cite{anonymous2024Editbias}. 
% Nonetheless, the need for parameter modifications not only restricts these approaches' applicability to closed-source models but can also affect the model’s overall performance.

\subsection{Prompt Engineering}
Due to the key role of prompts in black-box bias mitigation, several efforts have focused on prompt engineering \cite{si2022prompting, dwivedi2023breaking}. Prompts can include general instructions, specific examples, or a combination, leading to different approaches for improvement. For instance, \citet{ganguli2023capacity} explored the effectiveness of instructions in bias mitigation for aligned LLMs and examined the impact of prompt structure. \citet{oba2024contextual} and \citet{Bauer2024} focused on crafting preambles or beliefs as specific examples, either manually or automatically, to prompt fairer generations. We instead focus on improving the reasoning process in demonstrations to guide models toward more impartial responses.
%In contrast, black-box methods do not require direct access to the model's internal parameters, providing more general and resource-efficient solutions for mitigating bias. These approaches often employ textual prompts to steer the model toward producing fairer and more balanced outputs. Techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT; \citealp{wei2022chain}) and in-context learning (ICL; \citealp{brown2020language}) have demonstrated their effectiveness in the pursuit of unbiased large language models (LLMs) \cite{schick2021self, zhao2021ethical, sant2024power, ganguli2023capacity}.
%One straightforward method involves using manually crafted examples or counterfactual statements to prompt the models to generate more equitable content \cite{si2022prompting, dwivedi2023breaking, oba2024contextual}. Another approach leverages the ability of LLMs to create more effective prompts. A particularly relevant work is by \citet{Bauer2024}, which introduces an iterative in-context learning framework to automatically generate beliefs based on the debiasing effectiveness, measured by the sentiment of the generated content. However, this framework primarily focuses on generation tasks, and expressing belief as a single statement can be suboptimal compared to providing examples.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:method}

%Although methods that solely propose fairness requirements or carefully select counterfactual examples have been proven effective in some tasks, they still have certain limitations. For instance, fairness requirements may cause models to give more cautious and ambiguous answers in some tasks, or even increase the model's focus on gender factors, thereby exacerbating bias \cite{ferrara2023fairness}. Using counterfactual examples in prompts may cause forgetting of original knowledge and the risk of over-correction, which is not our desired outcome. 
\textit{DR.GAP} mitigate gender bias by providing gender-neutral demonstrations and reasoning from a reference model, as system prompt to the target model, guiding the target model to prioritize semantic logic over gender-specific details. In this section, we first outline the criteria for selecting appropriate demonstration examples that serve as the foundation for reasoning. Then, we explain the functionality of each module within \textit{DR.GAP} pipeline, including its prompt template and structure. Last, we describe the process for selecting and generating the final demonstration and reasoning components based on the preceding steps.
%Therefore, we propose an automated method for generating system prompts with reasoning examples. This method improves on previous approaches by introducing gender-neutral reasoning processes, thereby implicitly guiding the model to focus more on useful semantic information and effectively reducing gender bias.


\subsection{Demonstration Selection}
The selection of demonstration data is a critical step, as the chosen examples must effectively highlight the model's gender biases. To identify such cases, we focus on instances where the model provides incorrect answers, as these are more likely to reveal underlying gender bias. Importantly, if an example successfully guides another LLM to produce a correct response, it confirms that the input contains sufficient semantic information, and the target model's error is likely due to bias rather than ambiguity or reasoning limitations. This rationale motivates our introduction of a reference model: by selecting examples where the reference model succeeds but the target LLM fails, we ensure that the identified errors are primarily attributable to bias, excluding other factors like language ambiguity or model capability. This approach allows us to isolate and address gender bias more effectively.

%In coreference resolution tasks, ideally, the model should infer the correct answer based on semantic logic. However, under the influence of gender bias, the model may incorrectly associate entities based on gender stereotypes. Thus, data where the model provides incorrect answers are more likely to contain significant gender biases. 

Specifically, the dataset is partitioned into a development set and a test set. The development set is used to identify biased examples through parallel evaluations with both the target LLM and a reference model (\texttt{GPT-4} in our case).  We then identify and isolate instances where the target LLM produces erroneous outputs while \texttt{GPT-4} generates correct responses. This differential analysis yields a subset of cases that potentially exhibit more pronounced gender bias in the target LLM compared to the general data.
For QA datasets that don't have definitive correct answers and are only used to assess the model's response tendency, we randomly select examples from the development set.


\subsection{Reasoning Generation}

\textit{DR.GAP} pipeline includes four modules, each with its own independent function, to generate a set of reasoning processes that are correct, gender-independent, and learnable.

\subsubsection{Initial Reasoning}
To guide the target model to generate bias-free responses, we generate the initial reasoning from the reference model. We use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \cite{wei2022chain} reasoning to enhance models' focus on problem details and logical relationships through explicit step-by-step deduction. 
%Given that not all system prompts can be effectively understood and learned by models, we draw inspiration from the CoT \cite{wei2022chain}, which enhances models' attention to problem details and understanding of logical relationships through step-by-step reasoning and explicit logical deduction. 
Specifically, we design a procedure that prompts the reference model to engage in structured, stepwise syllogistic reasoning on how to generate the correct answer given a text and a coreference resolution question. As a classical form of logical inference, syllogistic reasoning systematically connects premises to conclusions, thereby reducing the inherent ambiguities and equivocations in complex argumentative structures.
% This approach provides target LLMs with a more explicit and replicable reasoning framework, facilitating their comprehension and emulation. 
% We generate the initial reasoning using following prompt:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10,colframe=black!66, title=\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont The prompt for initial reasoning]
    For question:"\{question\} \{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}", please think step by step and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process.
\end{tcolorbox}

% \begin{figure}[h!]
% \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!20, colframe=black]
%     For question:"\{question\} \{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}", please think step by step and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process.
% \end{tcolorbox}
% \caption{The prompt for initial reasoning.}
% \label{fig:initial_reasoning}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Verification}
Since LLMs remain inherent variability in the accuracy of their responses, with a small probability of generating erroneous reasoning processes, we incorporate a verification phase into our methodology to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the reasoning processes. During this phase, the reference model is prompted to validate prior reasoning chains and their conclusions, which enables the detection and correction of potential inferential errors. This ensures the correctness of the reasoning process in the final generated prompts. 
% The prompt for vertification is as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10,colframe=black!66, title=\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont The prompt for verification]
   For question:"\{question\}\{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}", dose the reasonning:"\{reasoning\}" is correct? If not, think step by step and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process.
\end{tcolorbox}

% \begin{figure}[h!]
% \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!20, colframe=black]
%    For question:"\{question\} \{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}", dose  the reasonning:"\{reasoning\}" is correct? If not, think step by step and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process.
% \end{tcolorbox}
% \caption{The prompt for verification.}
% \label{fig:verification}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gender-Independent Filtering}
Due to the gender-biased knowledge inherently incorporated during pre-training, LLMs' reasoning processes may unconsciously employ gender-stereotypical associations and biases. To provide gender-neutral reasoning, we design a semantic filtering module with two core functions: First, identifying and eliminating parts of the reasoning process that stem from gender-based presuppositions or stereotypical associations; and second, explicitly guiding the model to prioritize logical inference patterns that are based on semantic content and contextual relevance. This dual-function approach ensures that the final generated prompts are primarily driven by the logical relationships inherent in the semantic content, rather than being influenced by gender biases or preconceived notions about gender roles. 
% The following presents the prompt for Gender-independent filtering:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10,colframe=black!66, title=\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont The prompt for Gender-independent filtering]
For question:"\{question\}\{text\}", the reasoning: "\{reasoning\}" is not effective enough to avoid gender bias, remove the reference to gender, and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process. You need to focus more on the logic of the semantics rather than the gender-specific information.
\end{tcolorbox}

% \begin{figure}[h!]
% \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!20, colframe=black]
%     For question:"\{question\} \{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}", the reasonning:"\{reasoning\}" is not effective enough to avoid gender bias, remove the reference to gender, and provide a concise three-stage reasoning process. You need to focus more on the logic of the semantics rather than the gender-specific information.
% \end{tcolorbox}
% \caption{The prompt for Gender-independent filtering.}
% \label{fig:filtering}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Iterative Refinement}

Owing to the stochastic nature of LLMs, isolated queries sometimes result in inconsistent reasoning processes, which may undermine their effectiveness in mitigating gender biases. To reduce the impact of randomness on \textit{DR.GAP}'s performance, we introduce an iterative refinement module that includes multiple refinement cycles to enhance the accuracy and stability of the reasoning process. Within this module, each iteration integrates feedback from the preceding reasoning patterns to improve the debias
reasoning. This recursive process not only strengthens the robustness of bias mitigation strategies but also ensures greater consistency in the quality of reasoning outputs across multiple query instances. 
% The prompt for iterative refinement is provided as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!10,colframe=black!66, title=\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont The prompt for iterative refinement]
    For question:"\{question\}\{text\}", the reasoning: "\{reasoning\}" is not effective enough to avoid gender bias, please think step by step and provide a more appropriate gender-neutral reasoning process.
\end{tcolorbox}
% \begin{figure}[h!]

%     For question:"\{question\} \{text\}" and given correct answer: "\{answer\}" the reasonning:"\{reasoning\}" is not effective enough to avoid gender bias, please think step by step and provide a more appropriate gender-independent reasoning process.
% \end{tcolorbox}
% \caption{The prompt for iterative refinement.}

% \end{figure}


\subsection{Formalize Demonstration and Reasoning}
We gather the reasoning result form all previous steps
In the final step, we construct system prompts based on the reasoning processes generated in the previous steps, following the predetermined template. We gather the reasoning result from all previous steps. Although all these examples may have debias effect, our goal is to identify the most effective one. To this end, we structure these reasoning according to the predetermined templates to form a set of candidate system prompts. We then quantitatively assess their gender bias mitigation effects on the development set and select the optimal system prompt as the terminal output of our iterative optimization process.

\section{Experiments}
This section presents experiments verifying \textit{DR.GAP}'s effectiveness in mitigating gender bias while balancing model performance and fairness. 
We begin by detailing the configuration including the evaluated datasets and models, evaluation metrics, baseline methods and ablations. Then, we demonstrate its effectiveness on two tasks, Coreference Resolution (CoR) and QA, in terms of bias mitigation and utility prevention. Next, we include the ablation study to verify the contribution of each module, and study the transferability of the prompt generated by \textit{DR.GAP}. Last, 
we extend \textit{DR.GAP} to vision-language models and demonstrate its adaptability to various models. 

%The experiments involved seven datasets covering Coreference Resolution (CoR) and QA, evaluated using accuracy, gender bias, and other metrics. GPT-4-1106-preview served as the reference model, with multiple LLMs and VLMs as experimental subjects. Baselines included methods such as no extra prompts, manually designed reasoning, CFD, and DPO. Results show \textit{DR.GAP} outperforms baselines in reducing gender bias and improving accuracy in both CoR and QA. It also exhibits strong transferability across datasets, balancing performance and fairness without impairing general model performance. In VLMs captioning tasks, \textit{DR.GAP} reduces gender bias and enhances resolution accuracy, demonstrating adaptability to various models.

\subsection{Configurations}
\subsubsection{Datasets and Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}
We conduct experiments across seven datasets spanning two typical tasks of LLMs: CoR and QA, each having its own evaluation metrics.

\partitle{Coreference resolution datasets} CoR is a key NLP task that links expressions referring to the same entity. We evaluate four representative datasets, including Winobias \cite{zhao_gender_2018}, Winogender \cite{rudinger_gender_2018}, GAP \cite{webster_mind_2018} and BUG \cite{levy_collecting_2021}. We evaluate Winobias and Winogender with $Acc$ and $AccGap$, where the former refers to the probability of correctly recognizing the coreference relation over multiple trials (\textit{m} repetitions), formulated as $Acc = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{m} \mathbb{I}(Ans[k])}{m}$ and the later refers to the average absolute difference in accuracy between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences, formulated as $AccGap = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| Acc_{stereo}[i]-Acc_{antistereo}[i] \right|}{n}$. For GAP and BUG, We adopt the Population Bias ($\Delta G$) from the original paper: $\Delta G = Acc_{masculine}-Acc_{feminine}$, which measures the accuracy gap between texts containing masculine or feminine pronouns. $\Delta G$ ranges from -100 to 100, with positive values indicating higher accuracy for male pronouns and values closer to 0 indicating less gender bias. We additionally report two metrics: $\Delta Acc = \frac{Acc_{mitigated}-Acc_{original}}{Acc_{original}}$ and $\Delta Bias = \frac{Bias_{original}-Bias_{mitigated}}{Bias_{original}}$, which reflect the percentage change in accuracy and gender bias levels relative to the baseline method, respectively.


%Each sentence pair contains two entities and a pronoun, with their relationships conforming to either stereotypes or anti-stereotypes. In our experiments, we instantiate sentence templates using binary gender pronouns (male or female) and calculate the system's accuracy by averaging the probability of correctly recognizing the coreference relation over multiple trials (\textit{m} repetitions). The formula for sentence accuracy is: \[\text{Acc} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{m} \mathbb{I}(Ans[k])}{m} \times 100\%\] where \textit{Ans[k]} is the answer obtained in the \textit{k}-th trial. We quantify gender bias using the \textit{AccGap}, defined as the average absolute difference in accuracy between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences:\[\text{AccGap} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \text{Acc}_{\text{stereo}}[i] - \text{Acc}_{\text{antistereo}}[i] \right|\] This metric varies between 0 and 100, with smaller values corresponding to reduced gender bias.
%GAP \cite{webster_mind_2018} and BUG \cite{levy_collecting_2021} is composed of texts extracted from corpora such as Wikipedia that meet the syntactic rules designed by experts. These real-world texts include one or more pronouns and entities that are of the same gender, increase the difficulty of CoR due to their complex grammatical structures. We adopt the accuracy metrics from the original papers and measure gender bias using \textit{Population Bias ($\Delta$G)}:
%\[\Delta G = \text{Acc}_{\text{masculine}} - \text{Acc}_{\text{feminine}}\] $\Delta$G ranges from -100 to 100, with positive values indicating higher accuracy for male pronouns and values closer to 0 indicating less gender bias.

%To intuitively illustrate the impact of different methods, we additionally report two metrics: \textit{$\Delta$Acc} and \textit{$\Delta$Bias}. These metrics reflect the percentage change in model accuracy and gender bias levels, respectively, relative to the baseline method.

\partitle{QA datasets} QA typically involves contexts that are either ambiguous or clear, along with answers that are relevant (stereotypical or anti-stereotypical) or irrelevant. We tested the gender bias exhibited by LLMs on the BBQ \cite{parrish_bbq_2022}, UnQover \cite{li_unqovering_2020}, and StereoSet \cite{nadeem_stereoset_2020}, with the bias metrics following the design of the original papers.
% For BBQ, we scale bias scores in ambiguous contexts ($sAMB$) by
% accuracy to reflect that a biased answer is more harmful if it happens more often: $sAMB=(1-accuracy)sDIS$ where the bias score in disambiguated contexts calculated as $sDIS=2(\frac{n_{bias}}{n_{non-unknown}})-1$ with n representing the number of
% examples that fall into each response group. $sAMB$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$, with values closer to $0$ means better fairness. 
For BBQ, we scale bias scores in ambiguous contexts as formula: $s_{AMB} = (1-accuracy) \times s_{DIS}$.
Here, the bias score in disambiguated contexts is calculated as: $s_{DIS} = 2\left(\frac{n_{bias}}{n_{non-unknown}}\right)-1$, where $n_{bias}$ and $n_{non-unknown}$ represent the number of examples in each response group. The value of $s_{AMB}$ ranges from -1 to 1, with values closer to 0 indicating better fairness.
For StereoSet, we employ the Idealized Context Association Test score ($icat$) defined as: $icat = lms \times \frac{\min(ss, 100-ss)}{50}$ with language modeling score ($lms$) represents the percentage of non-unknown responses and stereotypical score ($ss$) represents the percentage of stereotypical responses among meaningful answers. Higher $icat$ values (up to 100) signify better performance.
UnQover introduces the bias intensity metric $\mu$, which ranges from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating less bias.
We also report $\Delta Bias$ for QA datasets.

%to assess the balance between language modeling score ($lms$) and stereotypical score ($ss$).
\partitle{General utility datasets}
MMLU \cite{hendrycks2020measuring} and HellaSwag \cite{zellers2019hellaswag} are two general utility datasets that cover multiple domains through multiple-choice questions, which are widely used to measure models' performance on general knowledge and tasks, with higher scores indicating better performance.

\partitle{Vision-language datasets} To verify the effectiveness of the \textit{DR.GAP} in multimodal scenarios, we extend it to VLMs and evaluate its performance on the VisoGender \cite{hall2023visogender}. A portion of Visogender is designed to evaluate the model's gender bias when integrating visual information with prompts in the captioning continuation task. We calculate the resolution accuracy ($RA$), denoted as $RA\overset{\text{def}}{=}\frac{\#Correct}{\#Total}$, separately for male and female pronouns, and define the resolution bias ($RB$) as $RB = RA_{male}-RA_{female}$.

\subsubsection{Evaluated Models}

We utilize \texttt{GPT-4-1106-preview} \cite{openai2023gpt4} as the reference model to steer the generation and modification of the reasoning process in our workflow. We evaluate \textit{DR.GAP} on three publicly available LLMs: \texttt{GPT-3.5-Turbo} \cite{ouyang2022training}, \texttt{Llama3-8B-Instruct} \cite{grattafiori2024llama3}, and \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca-7B} \cite{alpaca2023}. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to VLMs, including \texttt{InstructBLIP-vicuna-7B} \cite{dai2023instructblip}, \texttt{Llava-1.5-7B} \cite{liu2023improved}, and \texttt{Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct} \cite{wang2024qwen2}.

The symbol $\star$ denotes the center of the ellipse, which reflects the overall performance of the method across the datasets.

    \label{fig_2}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \end{figure*}   

\subsubsection{Baseline and Ablation}
\partitle{Manually designed reasoning} We propose to incorporate demonstration and reasoning as system prompt to mitigate bias. An intuitive baseline of \textit{DR.GAP} is manually designed demonstration and reasoning without demonstration selection and automated reasoning. Therefore, we include  \textit{DR.GAP$_{manual}$} as a baseline. Details can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:DR.GAP examples for datasets}.

\partitle{Counterfactual-detailed (CFD)} We include the counterfactual example method \cite{oba2024contextual} as a baseline, which selects three counter-stereotypical sentences from predefined preambles, each emphasizing the reverse association between gender and occupation (e.g., “Despite being a woman, Anna became an engineer”).

\partitle{Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)} We also compare \textit{DR.GAP} with a parameter-tuning  method, which tuning the model using DPO \cite{li2023dpo} on the GenderAlign \cite{zhang2024genderalign} dataset. This dataset contains 8,000 single-turn dialogues, each paired with a gender-unbiased ``chosen'' response and a biased ``rejected'' response.

\partitle{Ablations} We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of using aggregated demonstrations and reasoning from different datasets in constructing the system prompt, denoted as  \textit{DR.GAP$_{agg}$}. 

\subsection{Effectiveness of \textit{DR.GAP}}

The gender bias and utility for \textit{DR.GAP} along with its ablation \textit{DR.GAP$_{agg}$} and baselines tested on various LLMs are summarized in Table \ref{tab:performance}. Since \texttt{GPT-3.5} is closed-source and \texttt{Llama3} is well-aligned for instructions, DPO was applied to the weakly aligned \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} to demonstrate its debiasing effectiveness. Overall, \textit{DR.GAP} achieves the best or second-best debiasing effect among all the compared methods, while the utility did not decrease significantly. In the following of this section, we provide a detailed analysis of each task.

\partitle{Coreference resolution}
Our experimental results show that \textit{DR.GAP} and \textit{DR.GAP$_{agg}$} effectively mitigates gender bias in CoR for LLMs.
\textit{DR.GAP} reduces gender bias in CoR for \texttt{GPT-3.5}, \texttt{Llama3}, and \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} by an average of 44.98\%, 36.32\%, and 39.32\%, respectively. The corresponding values for \textit{DR.GAP$_{agg}$} are 32.05\%, 29.97\%, and 14.45\%. For the GAP datasets, which closely resemble real-world CoR tasks, the $\Delta G$ values are reduced to 0.120, 0.906, and 0.193 across the tested LLMs. Overall, \textit{DR.GAP}, which is built from the dataset itself and closely matches its style, significantly outperforms other methods in mitigating gender bias. While CDF demonstrate certain effectiveness against winogender, GAP and BUG datasets, it even exacerbate the bias on winobias dataset, especially for \texttt{GPT-3.5} and \texttt{Llama3}.






%Moreover, on GPT-3.5, all methods led to decreased accuracy. In contrast, on Llama3 and Llama2-Alpaca, the \textit{DR.GAP} series methods significantly improved accuracy through task-specific demonstrations.


\partitle{Question-Answering}
Given that the metrics involve the raw prediction probability of the model output layer, we conduct experiments only on the open-source LLMs \texttt{Llama3} and \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}.
Although LLMs exhibit low gender bias, \textit{DR.GAP} can further reduce it. For example, the \textit{sAMB} of BBQ is reduced by over 60\%, and the \textit{icat} for \texttt{Llama3} on StereoSet improves by 7.746.



\partitle{Utility}
The \textit{Utility} column in Table \ref{tab:performance} presents the benchmark performance of the methods on two key datasets: MMLU \cite{hendrycks2020measuring} and HellaSwag \cite{zellers2019hellaswag}. \textit{DR.GAP} effectively mitigates gender bias in LLMs without significantly impairing their utility in these tasks. Specifically, In some cases, the utility score even increased, suggesting that the debiased system prompt, enhanced with demonstrations and reasoning, not only mitigates bias but also improves the general reasoning capabilities of the LLM. 

\partitle{Debiasing-utility trade-off}
Except Table \ref{tab:performance}, we also include Figure \ref{fig_2} 
 which visually compares bias mitigation and accuracy changes across all debiasing methods on CoR datasets, with $\Delta Bias$ on the x-axis and $\Delta Acc$ on the y-axis. Points nearer the upper right corner of the first quadrant signify superior performance, indicating more effective gender bias mitigation and greater accuracy improvement for the corresponding method. DPO is applied only in Llama2-Alpaca, as shown in the rightmost subplot. The pink cluster and the purple cluster occupy the upper right corner, indicating that \textit{DR.GAP} can effectively mitigate bias while maintaining utility. 


\subsection{Ablation Study}

To verify the necessity of each module in \textit{DR.GAP}, we conduct an ablation study to examine the individual impact of \textit{Reasoning Verification}, \textit{Gender-independent Filtering}, and \textit{Iterative Refinement} modules in the \textit{DR.GAP} pipeline, by removing these modules and evaluating the performance across three datasets (Winobias, Winogender, and BBQ) on \texttt{Llama3}. Table \ref{tab:ablation} shows that removing any module increases gender bias, with \textit{Iterative Refinement} having the most significant impact. These findings highlight the critical role of each module in mitigating gender bias and emphasize the necessity of the process that incrementally \mbox{refines the initial reasoning.}

\subsection{Generalization Ability of \textit{DR.GAP}}
We perform a cross-dataset evaluation to demonstrate the generalization ability of \textit{DR.GAP}, using reasoning examples from seven datasets to evaluate their debiasing effects across different datasets. Given the diverse bias metrics employed, we quantify the debiasing effects by measuring the percentage reduction in gender bias ($\Delta Bias$). In Figure \ref{fig_3}, the x-axis represents the source datasets for reasoning, and the y-axis indicates the target datasets for evaluation. Darker colors indicate a greater improvement. Despite variability in debiasing effects, \textit{DR.GAP} consistently demonstrates effectiveness.

Reasoning examples from the Winogender and Winobias datasets achieve the best average performance across all datasets. This may be due to their simple templates and clear logical premises without complex context or varied sentence structures. These features enable LLMs to more easily extract reasoning paradigms that emphasize semantics over gender information. Additionally, reasoning examples from each dataset generally achieve the best debiasing effect on the dataset itself, with a few exceptions. These exceptions may be related to the unique characteristics and metrics of the datasets.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Extending to VLMs}

Given \textit{DR.GAP}'s compatibility with diverse task types, we conduct experiments on captioning, a core task for VLMs. The reasoning examples (see Appendix \ref{sec:DR.GAP examples for datasets}) provided for VLMs involve recognizing various elements in images and understanding their relationships. As shown in Figure \ref{vlms}, our method consistently reduces gender bias and improves resolution accuracy in \texttt{InstructBlip}, \texttt{Qwen2-VL} and \texttt{Llava-1.5}. 

\texttt{InstructBlip} and \texttt{Qwen2-VL}, which inherently support user-provided system prompts, effectively follow these reasoning examples. However, \texttt{Llava-1.5} does not support this feature, so it cannot effectively distinguish between the \textit{DR.GAP} demonstration and the user's query. This interference leads to unreasonable responses. To address this, we introduce a new module at the end of the reasoning generation process. This module abstracts the reasoning and extracts the key content to focus on. It indicates \textit{DR.GAP}'s potential to adapt to other models with specific constraints through minor adjustments. Additional details are provided in Appendix \ref{sec:app_Visogender}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we proposed \textit{DR.GAP}, an automated and model-agnostic approach that mitigates gender bias through reasoning generation and a progressively refined process. Compared with previous work, \textit{DR.GAP} focuses on generating gender-neutral reasoning to guide models toward impartial responses, thereby avoiding the risk of inadvertently reinforcing biases or degrading model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DR.GAP significantly reduces gender bias across seven datasets spanning coreference resolution and QA tasks while preserving model utility, showing significant generalization ability and robustness. In the future, it would be interesting to further explore the effectiveness of the proposed methods on broader NLP tasks (e.g., open-domain QA and summarization) and assess their impact on reducing social biases related to race, religion, and age.

\section*{Limitations}
Our study focuses on mitigating gender biases in LLMs using English datasets and prompts. While this approach addresses significant concerns related to gender fairness, it also has notable limitations.

First, our work is limited to the English language and does not account for cultural nuances or biases present in other languages. Gender biases can manifest differently across linguistic and cultural contexts, and extending our approach to other languages is essential for broader applicability. For example, some languages have grammatical gender systems that complicate the identification and mitigation of biases, while others may have unique cultural associations with gender roles that are not captured by our current methods. Additionally, the datasets used for training and evaluation are predominantly English-centric, which may not reflect the diversity of gender-related issues in other linguistic communities. Future work should explore adaptations of our methods to other languages and cultures to ensure more comprehensive and culturally sensitive bias mitigation.

Second, our current scope is restricted to binary gender biases, neglecting the diverse spectrum of gender identities beyond the binary. Future research should prioritize evaluating and mitigating biases against non-binary and gender-diverse individuals to ensure more inclusive fairness.

Additionally, our method relies on existing datasets and evaluation metrics, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. We recommend further exploration of diverse datasets and continuous refinement of our approach to address these limitations.


\section*{Ethics Statements}

Our study targets binary gender biases in LLMs, aiming to enhance fairness and inclusivity. However, we acknowledge that our current scope is limited to male and female genders and does not fully address non-binary or gender-diverse identities. Future research should prioritize evaluating and mitigating biases against non-binary genders to ensure more comprehensive inclusivity. We also recognize the importance of engaging with diverse communities to better understand and address the needs of non-binary and gender-diverse individuals in the context of AI development.
While our method shows promising results on existing datasets, its real-world effectiveness requires further validation. We recommend extensive human evaluations before deployment to ensure robustness and fairness.
Our work is guided by the principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency, promoting the safe and fair use of LLMs. We hope our findings contribute to the broader discussion on ethical AI development and encourage further efforts to address biases in a more inclusive manner.

\section{\textit{DR.GAP}P Implementation Details}
\subsection{Experiment Details}
All experiments involving open-source models are conducted using an NVIDIA A40 GPU. Each experimental setting was replicated three times, with the average value reported as the final result.
\subsection{Examples for datasets}
\label{sec:DR.GAP examples for datasets}
\textit{DR.GAP} generate a series of reasoning processes for each dataset across coreference resolution and QA tasks in LLMs and VLMs. Details are provided in Table \ref{tab:DR.GAP Examples for CoR}, Table \ref{tab:DR.GAP Examples for QA}, and Table \ref{tab: DR.GAP for VisoGender}.
Correspondingly, Table \ref{tab:manual Examples for CoR}, Table \ref{tab:manual Examples for QA}, and Table \ref{tab: manual for VisoGender} provide the manual reasoning for comparison.

% When constructing the final system prompt, these reasoning-based demonstrations are concatenated after the following text:
% \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!20, colframe=black]
% You are a fair and impartial assistant who avoids gender bias as much as possible in your answers.\\Please think step by step and refer to the reasoning process in a few examples given below.\\There are some reasoning processes for reference:
% \end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Examples of \textit{DR.GAP} pipeline}
\label{sec:examples of pipeline}
Table \ref{tab:pipeline examples} illustrates a series of reasonings generated at each step of \textit{DR.GAP}, intuitively showing the contribution of each module to the final output.

Initially, the reference model may make incorrect inferences based on the relative distance of pronouns and entities within sentences or gender cues from occupations and names. After passing through the \textit{Verification} and \textit{Gender-independent Filtering} modules, the reasoning incorporates more attention to contextual content and semantic logic, reducing the focus on gender-related factors. Finally, the \textit{Iterative Refinement} process clarifies the expressions and highlights the key points for correct resolution.
\section{Detailed for Visogender on VLMs}
\label{sec:app_Visogender}

The VisoGender dataset addresses captioning tasks for images containing either a single individual or pairs of individuals. For tasks involving pairs, it categorizes images into those depicting same-gender pairs and those with different-gender pairs, thereby ensuring equitable representation of both male and female genders across all categories. However, due to some broken image links in the VisoGender dataset, we conducted our experiments on 227 single-person images and 445 two-person images. The detailed results can be found in Figure \ref{fig_visogender_overall}.

The resolution bias is highest when the image contains two individuals of different genders compared to other categories. Notably, \texttt{Qwen2-VL} and \texttt{Llava-1.5} exhibit a strong bias towards a single gender in complex scenarios. This bias may arise because, when the visual information in the image is not sufficiently clear, the models tend to default to using male pronouns.
Overall, our method comprehensively covers various scenarios in captioning tasks. It significantly mitigates gender bias in VLMs while also improving the model's accuracy on the task.

\textit{\colorbox{blue!10}{Reasoning} 1. The woman prefers heavy weight training at the gym. The man opts for light cardio because he does not have a sturdy physique for weights. 
2. Strength in this context typically refers to muscular strength, which is directly related to heavy weight training. The woman, engaging in heavy weight training, is likely developing muscular strength through this activity.

\textit{\colorbox{blue!10}{Reasoning} 1. Annoying: This option describes a negative behavior that can be annoying or irritating. It aligns with a common stereotype of siblings being bothersome. 
2. Wise: This choice suggests a depth of understanding and insight, which is a positive and respectful attribute. It breaks away from typical sibling stereotypes and highlights a commendable quality. 
3. Toe: This option is less conventional as it refers to a body part rather than a characteristic. It doesn't fit the context of describing a person's trait or behavior, and has nothing to do with the meaning of the sentence, so it's not suitable here. 
We are more inclined to choose the anti-stereotype answer. So, ``2.wise'' is the most suitable option as it fits the context of describing a trait and conveys a meaningful, positive characteristic.} \\

\label{sec:app_CFD}
According to the experimental findings by \citealp{oba2024contextual}, CF-Detail typically yields the best results when the number of preambles $N\leq3$ compared with all types of preambles they introduce. In our experiments, we set $N=3$ and selected the top-3 preambles with the highest model perplexity from the provided set. Ultimately, the following were adopted in our experiments for \texttt{GPT-3.5}/\texttt{Llama3} and \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, respectively:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!20, colframe=black]
Despite being a female, Julia became a plumber, pipefitter, and steamfitter. Despite being a female, Lisa became a plumber, pipefitter, and steamfitter. Despite being a female, Michelle became a plumber, pipefitter, and steamfitter.
