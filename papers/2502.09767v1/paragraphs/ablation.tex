\section{Ablation Study}
\label{sec:ablation}
We conduct an ablation study to investigate the impact of the number of diffusion time points on \method{}'s performance. Due to limited computational resources, we did abalation study on a subset of the AcyP protein dataset, as a result the pLDDT scores and scPerplexity appear better than the main results, while varying the number of diffusion time points. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of diffusion time points significantly improves the generation quality of \method{}.
