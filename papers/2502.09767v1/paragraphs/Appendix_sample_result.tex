A higher pLDDT score indicates greater confidence in the structure prediction by the folding model.}

\textbf{title} : were they afraid of newborns?

\textbf{content} : this book was terrible. it did not address the issues at all regarding newborns, which i assume are destined to inconsequential every so often. there was no postiveness in the middle of the book, and most of it was rushed to press. whoever wrote the previous review should have gotten an apologia as their final printer of the book. this writer did so only in the first few pages, it was as if she just taped pages and put one in her books and taped it - to - more than - in ...

\textbf{title} : blechhhhh content

\textbf{content} : wow, isn't it nice to see such juvenile drivel such toole so popular on the net. the editor in the back of the book notes : " to preserve reynolds, an imaginary london child having sex with another high - school girl ( p. s. ) you don't know what kind of busted ethan padar worried, or would mentor a house floor fort chemist who sullys ceilings with zero light. the whole novel is lame, poorly written and awfully mediocre. the " plot " is transparent from the first page ...

\textbf{title} : pile of 1 \% crap

\textbf{content} : this movie was disaster. i think the director wanted cheap hair and vaginal characters, scaring everyone on the back of the face of the audience with pointless bigs or even no, uncreative dialouge. the ruined 30 minutes most of this movie, rushes in and out of the movie. i'm a huge fan of slasher flicks, even makes huge claims to hard work on hair. the only funny part in this movie is when the killer begins stalking all the exaggerated body - climbing and challengers, and the two - dimensional ...

\textbf{title} : \textcolor{purple}{what an insult to music lovers!}

\textbf{content} : the true diva that deserves the wide spread islam and the lies of the young musicians who make this music allows for such glittery displays and excuses. she never needs to spend our high time singing this " exquisite in its gem ". the artist is just a shadow of her most famous but she has no talent. where she excels is the terribile and exquisite expression of native american descent that will make dog earpin jams easy to count. she has a good voice but she hasn't mastered it. oh, she needs to go ...

\textbf{title} : \textcolor{purple}{miserable album content}

\textbf{content} : i owned this album and when it came out i loved it. unlike the last albums her voice was able to make coheed and connie told a cool gentle sigh. i figured the first few tracks could have been strengthened by absolutely no more stale vocals, but they are crafted to off the page. this person writes her songs so she has more power and intonation than true instincts. i like to listen to the song that she was destined to write. get the single years that are runaways. " only excuse me on the radio " is sweetly sung by anyone, ...

\textbf{title} : one for the head bob fans!

\textbf{content} : i've won stadium since the mid 70's. this double lp has all of the greatest hits on it! so why not split their support. this has soul in the covers ( not on the cover ). a hercules and a freddie and theatrics contribution is true, and paul petrie and leslie heralbull rock at the same time. even the stevie ray \& carole or even stevie ray drivel adds some new comparatively to the cole porter music. a truly unique collection of a performers work, and the cd succeeds ...

\textbf{title} : a great story and excellent special effects and overall worth the film

\textbf{content} : trust me, this is much better than the original. set up for heaven's gate and the framer though works well - it becomes predictable and starts going nowhere. the story becomes more developed later and really makes a good place for truman if you enter into the dsi world you're never supposed to forget. it's almost as engaging with this surprisingly heavy drama that's subtle why nothing happens after you have watched this one to get that your expectations and expectations sading down. i recommend definitely seeing this ...

\textbf{title} : \textcolor{purple}{a surprise!}

\textbf{content} : this box is a prelude to the first golden age of horror crooning ( which correctly apes de croes as he tends to say a wayans juveniles below us ). and these are individual breakfast of murders. the writers of these crime / mysteries / new orleans exhibit that encompasses the catholic church in their b \& w documents. best blurb of all those who would read about the errors they witness and don't believe. an interesting twist ending to the loose ends. hercule poirot is cast as a smart cop undercover. the two big funny g ...
