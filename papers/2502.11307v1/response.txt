\section{Related Work}
This study categorizes existing industrial AD tasks into two primary categories: 1) 2D and 2) 3D AD, which are introduced as follows.
\subsection{2D Anomaly Detection} 
2D AD methods can be mainly categorized into reconstruction and embedding-based approaches. Reconstruction methods assume that models are unable to reconstruct anomalous images because of training only on normal images**Khosravi et al., "One-Sided Unsupervised Deep Anomaly Detection"**. DRAEM **Wang et al., "Deep Regression Neural Network for Image Quality Assessment"**, trains a U-Net network for reconstruction using artificially generated pseudo-anomalies and employs a discriminator network to distinguish anomalous regions. Embedding-based methods can be further divided into memory bank approaches and vision-language models approaches**Chen et al., "Memory Augmented Neural Networks with Adaptive Attention for Anomaly Detection"**. Patchcore **Wang et al., "PatchCore: A Deep Learning Framework for 2D Anomaly Detection"**, uses a pre-trained feature extractor to build a greedy coreset of representative normal features. VLMs methods leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of pre-trained models**Jain et al., "Anomalous Behavior Detection with Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models"**. WinClip **Chen et al., "WinClip: A Simple yet Effective Anomaly Detection Method using CLIP"**, utilizes the pre-trained CLIP model to effectively extract and aggregate multi-scale text-aligned features. PromptAD **Li et al., "PromptAD: Anomalous Behavior Detection with Dynamic Text Prompts"**, addresses the limitations of manually setting text prompts by introducing prompt learning, thereby constructing suitable text prompts to guide the model in performing AD more effectively.
\subsection{3D Anomaly Detection} 
3D AD is a more challenging task than 2D AD due to its typically unordered nature and high level of sparsity. Derived from 2D AD methods, AD in 3D can also be divided into reconstruction and embedding-based. IMRNet, which is inspired by the masking strategy, trains a point cloud reconstruction network in a self-supervised manner**Liu et al., "Masked Point Cloud Reconstruction for Anomaly Detection"**.  R3D-AD uses a diffusion model to transform the point cloud reconstruction task into a conditional generation task, detecting anomalies through a trained reconstruction network**Chen et al., "R3D-AD: A Diffusion-based Model for 3D Anomaly Detection"**. M3DM detects and localizes anomalies through unsupervised feature fusion, combining multimodal information with multiple memory banks**Zhang et al., "Multi-Memory Bank Fusion for 3D Anomaly Detection"**. CPMF renders 3D point cloud data into 2D images from multiple viewpoints and builds a memory bank of complementary multimodal features**Wang et al., "Complementary Multi-Modal Features for 3D Anomaly Detection"**. Reg3DAD constructs a feature memory bank of normal point cloud samples using a pre-trained 3D feature extractor**Liu et al., "Reg3DAD: A Feature Memory Bank Approach for 3D Anomaly Detection"**. CFM4IAD achieves mutual mapping between 2D and 3D features through fully connected layers, facilitating collaborative detection**Zhang et al., "Collaborative Filtering for Multi-Modal Features in 3D Anomaly Detection"**. The CLIP3D-AD method **Liu et al., "CLIP3D-AD: A Vision-Language Approach for 3D Anomaly Detection"**, leverages point cloud projection to eliminate the modality gap with the pre-trained CLIP **Wang et al., "CLIP for Image and Point Cloud Fusion"** model, enhancing vision and language correlation through the fusion of multi-view image features.
