\section{Zero-shot models}
In order to obtain context attributions with the instruction tuned LLM \cite{Jiang2023Mistral7, Dubey2024TheL3}, we use the following prompts:

\begin{prompt}
\textbf{SYSTEM PROMPT}

You are an AI assistant that identifies the sentence(s) in a provided context document most relevant for answering a specific question. Your task is to select only the sentence(s) containing the explicit information needed to answer the question accurately, without adding extra context.
\end{prompt}

\begin{prompt}
\textbf{USER PROMPT}

Context Document:

[numbered sentences from the context]

Question: [query text]

Answer: [answer text]

Based on the context document, identify the sentence number(s) from the following choices: [list of numbers]. Select only the sentence(s) that contain explicit information needed to answer the question directly.

Answer only with the corresponding number(s) in parentheses, without additional explanation.
\end{prompt}
