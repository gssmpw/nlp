    \caption{An example of the attribution scenario evaluated in our user study. Both the answer and the context attributions are highlighted to help the user verify the correctness of the answer. In the absence of highlights, the user is instructed to read the entire context. This example showcases a practical application of context attribution in real world interactions with LLM generated content.}
