\section{Ethics Considerations}

This research addresses temporal drift in Android malware detection and introduces a framework named TIF to enhance robustness against such a phenomenon. The apps used in this work are from publicly availablea and anonymized datasets with no personally identifiable information, ensuring compliance with ethical and institutional guidelines. 

All methods are designed solely for academic and security purposes, with no potential for misuse or harm to users. Efforts were made to minimize risks, such as false positives and negatives, and to focus on improving detection stability across evolving malware distributions. The findings are framed strictly to enhance cybersecurity, adhering to principles of beneficence and respect for persons, and contributing positively to public safety and the research community.
