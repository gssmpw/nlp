\section{Conclusion}
Android malware detectors suffer performance degradation due to natural distribution changes caused by malware evolution. We identify learnable invariant patterns among malware samples with similar intent, enabling a drift-stable feature space. To address this, we propose a temporal invariant training framework that organizes samples chronologically and integrates multi-proxy contrastive learning with invariant gradient alignment. Experiments demonstrate improved robustness across feature spaces and drifting scenarios, promoting stable and discriminative representations.

% Our findings reveal the existence of learnable invariant patterns among malware samples with similar intent, contributing to the creation of a drift-stable feature space. We propose a temporal invariant training framework that helps arbitrary detectors learn invariants across time in unbalanced and multifamily fused malware samples by organizing the samples into multiple subsets in a chronological order and integrating well-designed multi-proxy contrastive learning with invariant gradient alignment modules. Experiments show that the framework enhances robustness across different feature spaces and drifting scenarios, encouraging the model to learn stable and discriminative representations.
