 & [...] The report concludes by noting that 
   \hl{finding a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection 
   may be key to maintaining trust in the digital environment and advancing international trade.} 
   The report suggests that 
   Congress may consider \hl{comprehensive privacy legislation} and examine the potential
   challenges and implications of building \hl{a system of interoperability between different national 
   privacy regimes.} [...]
