  abstract = 	 {Understanding when and how much a model gradient leaks information about the training sample is an important question in privacy. In this paper, we present a surprising result: Even without training or memorizing the data, we can fully reconstruct the training samples from a single gradient query at a randomly chosen parameter value. We prove the identifiability of the training data under mild assumptions: with shallow or deep neural networks and wide range of activation functions. We also present a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm based on tensor decomposition to reconstruct the training data. As a provable attack that reveals sensitive training data, our findings suggest potential  severe threats to privacy, especially in federated learning.}

abstract = {Inversion answers the question of which input patterns to a trained multilayer neural network approximate a given output target. This method is a tool for visualization of the information processing capability of a network stored in its weights. This knowledge about the network enables one to make informed decisions on the improvement of the training task and the choice of training sets. An inversion algorithm for multilayer perceptrons is derived from the backpropagation scheme. We apply inversion to networks for digit recognition. We observe that the multilayer perceptrons perform well with respect to generalization, i.e. correct classification of untrained digits. They are however bad on rejection of counterexamples, i.e. random patterns. Inversion gives an explanation for this drawback. We suggest an improved training scheme, and we show that a tradeoff exists between generalization and rejection of counterexamples.}

  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

A survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks. Knowledge-Based Systems, 8, 373–389]. This paper starts with a survey of algorithms which attempt to explain the ANN output. We then present HYPINV,11HYPINV stands for an algorithm which extracts HYPerplanes using INVersion. a new explanation algorithm which relies on network inversion; i.e.calculating the ANN input which produces a desired output. HYPINV is a pedagogical algorithm, that extracts rules, in the form of hyperplanes. It is able to generate rules with arbitrarily desired fidelity, maintaining a fidelity–complexity tradeoff. To our knowledge, HYPINV is the only pedagogical rule extraction method, which extracts hyperplane rules from continuous or binary attribute neural networks. Different network inversion techniques, involving gradient descent as well as an evolutionary algorithm, are presented. An information theoretic treatment of rule extraction is presented. HYPINV is applied to example synthetic problems, to a real aerospace problem, and compared with similar algorithms using benchmark problems.}

abstract = {The wide application of deep learning technique has raised new security concerns about the training data and test data. In this work, we investigate the model inversion problem under adversarial settings, where the adversary aims at inferring information about the target model's training data and test data from the model's prediction values. We develop a solution to train a second neural network that acts as the inverse of the target model to perform the inversion. The inversion model can be trained with black-box accesses to the target model. We propose two main techniques towards training the inversion model in the adversarial settings. First, we leverage the adversary's background knowledge to compose an auxiliary set to train the inversion model, which does not require access to the original training data. Second, we design a truncation-based technique to align the inversion model to enable effective inversion of the target model from partial predictions that the adversary obtains on victim user's data. We systematically evaluate our approach in various machine learning tasks and model architectures on multiple image datasets. We also confirm our results on Amazon Rekognition, a commercial prediction API that offers "machine learning as a service". We show that even with partial knowledge about the black-box model's training data, and with only partial prediction values, our inversion approach is still able to perform accurate inversion of the target model, and outperform previous approaches.},

However, existing semantic guarantees for DP focus on membership inference, which may overestimate the adversary’s capabilities and is not applicable when membership status itself is non-sensitive. In this paper, we derive the first semantic guarantees for DP mechanisms against training data reconstruction attacks under a formal threat model. We show that two distinct privacy accounting methods—Renyi differential privacy and Fisher information leakage—both offer strong semantic protection against data reconstruction attacks.}
