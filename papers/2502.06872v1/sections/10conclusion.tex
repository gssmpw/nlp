In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of RAG systems through the lens of trustworthiness, focusing on six critical aspects: reliability, privacy, safety, fairness, explainability, and accountability. This work addresses the pressing need for a unified perspective in the field, bridging the gap in understanding and systematically categorizing the challenges and solutions in developing trustworthy RAG systems.
For each trustworthiness aspect, we introduce definitions and key concepts to establish an understanding of the topics. We also offer a structured taxonomy to help researchers navigate the diverse approaches in the specific trustworthy aspect. Beyond methodological summary, we highlight the evaluation protocols commonly used for trustworthy RAG systems, including the specific datasets and metrics. By including these discussions, we aim to facilitate the development of benchmarks tailored to trustworthiness challenges. 

Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of future research directions for each aspect of trustworthiness, including promising directions within individual aspects and potential synergies across multiple areas. By addressing these directions, we hope to inspire innovative approaches that enhance the overall trustworthiness of RAG systems and drive their broader adoption in critical applications. This survey not only serves as a comprehensive roadmap for researchers aiming to advance trustworthy RAG systems but also underscores the importance of addressing these challenges to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI technologies.
