\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

This paper presented a set of fast techniques for hierarchical clustering based on a novel derivation of optimal center-based clustering in ultrametrics. We showed that, after fitting an ultrametric to the data, one has access to a multitude of clustering hierarchies simultaneously. We note that our results also highlight the efficacy of the dc-dist for uncovering a dataset's structure in an unsupervised way: almost any clustering technique seems to be effective over this ultrametric. 
In future work, we aim to connect our results to hierarchies based on
specific hierarchical objective functions \citep{dasgupta_objective, Cohen_hierarchical_2019}. 
Similarly, while ultrametrics and spectral clustering have been connected \citep{pathbasedSC, beer2023connecting}, their relation to our framework is left for future work.
