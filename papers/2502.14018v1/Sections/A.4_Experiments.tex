\section{Implementations of the used HSTs}
\label{app:experiments}

We build KD trees, Cover trees using the C++ library \emph{mlpack4} \citep{mlpack}, and build HST-DPO trees using the C++ code from \url{https://github.com/yzengal/ICDE21-HST}.


\section{Used Datasets}
Table \ref{tbl:dataset_overview} lists the datasets on which we validated and compared the proposed framework SHIP to other competitors.

\section{Tables -- Runtimes, ARI, and NMI}
Table \ref{tbl:runtimes_full} shows the runtimes, Table \ref{tbl:ari_full} the ARI values, and Table \ref{tbl:nmi_full} the NMI values for all datasets.

\begin{largetable}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption{
        Runtimes of various parts of our clustering framework SHIP over ten runs, compared with standard clustering methods. 
        Time is given in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds [min:sec.ms]. 
        The first four columns (``build'') refer to the computation time of the different ultrametric trees. The next two columns state the runtimes of computing one hierarchy ($k$-means) on the DC tree. The second column here shows the timing for the heuristic from Section \ref{app:ties_heuristic}.
        Note that these runtimes are not correlated to the chosen ultrametric.
        The subsequent three columns state the runtimes of different partitioning methods, i.e., `Stability', `Median of Elbows (MoE)', and the `Elbow' method on various hierarchies.
