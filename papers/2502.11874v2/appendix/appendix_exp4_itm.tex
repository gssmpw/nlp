% \paragraph{Image-Text Match Scores}
% Given that BLIP-2 has some additional training objectives to fuse the text and vision modalities, we can also extract image-text match (ITM) scores for this model. We do so by extracting scores for prompts of the form ``An image of \verb|QUANT| \verb|OBJECTS|''. While we follow \citet{li2023-blip2} in using descriptive statements of the form ``An image of \dots'', we acknowledge that this prompt template can be rather rigid in that it assumes saliency of the object targeted. As such, we run an additional experiment with statements of the form ``There are \verb|QUANT| \verb|OBJECT| in the image.''

% \paragraph{Image-Text Similarity}
% Finally, we extract image-text similarity scores from CLIP. Analogous to the procedure for obtaining ITM scores for BLIP-2, we run experiments with both ``An image of \verb|QUANT| \verb|OBJECTS|'' and ``There are \verb|QUANT| \verb|OBJECT| in the image.''
