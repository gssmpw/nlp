\section{Data from Human Participants}

\subsection{Instructions and Consent}
Below we include the information given to the participants in our human experiment.

\textit{Thank you for taking part in this experiment. This survey should take approximately 20 minutes to complete. You will be presented with 100 questions. Each question consists of an image and a corresponding statement. Your task is to rate, using a slider, how accurate you find the statement in relation to the image.}

\textit{Please be assured that all responses will be kept strictly confidential and anonymous. The data that we collect will be processed in such a way that they cannot be linked to you in any way. Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. If at any point you wish to exit the survey without finishing the survey, you can close this form and we will delete your responses. You do not have to specify your reason.}

\textit{Should you wish to withdraw consent after you have participated, please send an email to \textup{\textbf{AUTHORS}} at \textup{\textbf{EMAIL}}. Note that if you withdraw consent after completing the survey, we are not required to undo the processing of your data that has taken place up until that time.

\subsection{Demographics}
In \S\ref{sec:dataset_humans}, we mentioned that we recruited 203 participants through Prolific.
As reported in the Ethical Considerations, we did not collect data that allows anyone to trace the responses back to an individual.
All participants were native and primary speakers of English.
Besides that fact, we have the following information about the distribution of demographic information.

\begin{description}
    \item[Age] 25-34 years (31.5\%), 35-44 (25.6\%), 18-24  (17.2\%), 45-54 (15.3\%), 55-64 (6.9\%), 65-74 (2.5\%) and 75-84 (0.5\%). 0.5\% of the participants prefer not to disclose their age.

    \item[Gender] female (52.5\%), male (45.8\%), other (0.5\%). 1.5\% of the participants prefer not to say.
