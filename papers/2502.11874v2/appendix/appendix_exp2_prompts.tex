\subsection{Prompts for Score Generation}\label{appendix:exp2_prompts}
Below we list the 10 prompts that we have tested for Experiment~2. The prompt listed in boldface is discussed in \S\ref{sec:model_judgments}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``On a scale of 0 (completely inaccurate) to 100 (completely accurate), how accurate is the following statement for the image? Please only respond with a number between 0 and 100.\\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``Question: How accurate is the following statement for the image? Respond only with a rating between 0 (completely inaccurate) and 100 (completely accurate).\\
    Statement: \verb|[Statement]| \\
    Answer: ''

    \item ``On a scale of 0 (completely inaccurate) to 100 (completely accurate), how accurate is the following statement for the image? Respond only with a number. Decimals are allowed. \\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``How accurate is the statement for the image? Please only respond with a number between 0 and 100, where 0 is `completely inaccurate' and 100 `completely accurate'.\\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``\textbf{On a scale of 0 (completely inaccurate) to 100 (completely accurate), how accurate is the following statement for the image? \\ Please respond with one of the following options: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100.}\\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``How likely is the following caption given the image? Please respond with a number between 0 and 100, where\\- 0 is `not likely at all'\\- 100 is `highly likely'. \\
    Caption: \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``What is the probability that the following sentence matches the image?\\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``What is the probability that the following sentence matches the image?\\
    Sentence: \verb|[Statement]| \\
    Answer: ''

    \item ``What is the probability that the following sentence matches the image? Please only respond with a number between 0 and 100. \\
    \verb|[Statement]|''

    \item ``What is the probability that the following sentence matches the image? Please only respond with a number between 0 and 1. \\
    Sentence: \verb|[Statement]| \\
    Answer: ''

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distribution of Generated Scores}
Figure~\ref{fig:app_exp2_distribution} shows density plots displaying the distributions of human ratings in \dataset, as well as scores generated by VLMs as a response to prompt 5 in Appendix~\ref{appendix:exp2_prompts}, discussed in \S\ref{sec:model_judgments}. Note that for LLaVA-NeXT, LLaVA-OneVision and Molmo, the scores tend towards the extremes. However, in the human distribution, this is only the case for the unquantified control statement (as expected).
