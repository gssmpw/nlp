\section{Conclusion}


In this paper, we analyze adaptation as minimum entropy problem. 
We demonstrate that the problem decomposes into the combination of minimum set cover problems, 
which reveals minimum entropy problem ignores the relationships between disentangled representations. 
In this context, we introduce URECA, a clustering algorithm to leverage relationships between disentangled representations. 
Then, we design new auxiliary loss based on the result of URECA to lead the model to reflect on the relationships 
between disentangled representations. 
Our experiments show that URECA achieves SoTA for CoSQA and consistent performance gains across programming languages of CSN. 
These results necessitate to leverage relationships of disentangled representation for robust adaptation, 
paving the way for code retrieval and large-scale RAG systems.
