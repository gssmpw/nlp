% 单查询问题
Finding $k$ disjoint paths ($k$DP) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis. 
    For vertices $s$ and $t$, paths from $s$ to $t$ are said to be \textit{disjoint} 
        if any two of them share no common vertex except $s$ and $t$. 
In practice, disjoint paths are widely applied in network routing and transportation.
% 多查询问题
In these scenarios, \textit{multiple} $k$DP queries are often issued simultaneously, 
    necessitating efficient batch processing.
This motivates the study of \textit{batch} $k$DP query processing (\texttt{batch-$k$DP}).
% 批量路径枚举方法+disjoint 
A straightforward approach to \texttt{batch-$k$DP} extends batch simple-path enumeration with disjointness checks.
    But this suffers from factorial computational complexity. 
% 可以不用这么高复杂度
An alternative approach leverages single-query algorithms that avoid this by 
    replacing the graph with a converted version. 
% 共享空间
However, handling each query independently misses opportunities for shared computation.
% can lead to redundant computations and storage needs.
% 我们的方法
To overcome these limitations, we propose \texttt{ShareDP}, an algorithm for \texttt{batch-$k$DP} 
    that \texttt{share}s the computation and storage across $k$\texttt{DP}s. 
    % that \texttt{share}s these redundancies across $k$\texttt{DP}s. 
\texttt{ShareDP} merges converted graphs into a shared structure, then shares the traversals and operations from different queries within this structure. 
Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets confirm the superiority of \texttt{ShareDP} over comparative approaches.
