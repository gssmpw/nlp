\section{Conclusion}

% In this work, we introduce \tripcraft, a high-fidelity, spatially consistent travel planning dataset that surpasses prior benchmarks in realism and comprehensiveness. By leveraging up-to-date real-world data, \tripcraft \;mitigates geographic inconsistencies and ensures that generated itineraries adhere to spatiotemporal coherence. Our dataset integrates fine-grained attraction classifications, persona-conditioned preferences, event typologies, and transit schedules, enabling a substantially more detailed and customized travel planning framework.

% Beyond dataset enhancements, we advance itinerary generation by augmenting spatiotemporal resolution, producing logically structured and contextually coherent sequences of Points of Interest (PoIs) that align with real-world travel dynamics. To rigorously assess LLM-generated plans, we introduce probabilistic and mathematical scoring paradigms that provide quantitative insights into itinerary fidelity, complementing conventional constraint-based validation methods.

% Through \tripcraft \;and our novel evaluation criteria, we establish a new standard for LLM-driven travel itinerary synthesis, paving the way for more adaptive, personalized, and viable AI-assisted trip planning.
