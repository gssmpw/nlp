\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in probing Large Language Models (LLMs) have explored their latent potential as personalized travel planning agents, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in real-world applicability. Existing datasets, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, suffer from semi-synthetic data reliance, spatial inconsistencies, and a lack of key travel constraints, making them inadequate for practical itinerary generation.
%rely on semi-synthetic data as well as ignoring several key components of travel planning, limiting their real-world applicability. 
To address these gaps, we introduce \textbf{\tripcraft},  
a spatio-temporally coherent travel planning  dataset that integrates real-world constraints, including public transit schedules, event availability, diverse attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization.
%incorporating real-world constraints, including public transit schedules, public events, varied attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. Our dataset enables more detailed trip itinerary generation (including duration spent at each point of interest based on users' persona, transit between two points of interest, etc.) while ensuring spatio-temporal consistency. 
%TripCraft enables the generation of more structured and contextually rich itineraries by ensuring spatial and temporal alignment, and persona-aware activity selection.
%Further, we propose novel evaluation metrics (temporal meal score, attraction score, spatial score, ordering score, and persona score) to assess LLM-generated plans across temporal, spatial, sequential, and personal dimensions, overcoming the limitations of existing commonsense and hard constraint metrics.
To evaluate LLM-generated plans beyond existing binary validation methods, we propose five continuous evaluation metrics, namely Temporal Meal Score, Temporal Attraction Score, Spatial Score, Ordering Score, and Persona Scoreâ€”which assess itinerary quality across multiple dimensions.
Our parameter-informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving the Temporal Meal Score from 61\% to 80\% in a 7-day scenario.
%Interestingly, our parameter-informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving performance from \textit{61\% to 80\% in the 7-day scenario- as quantified by a 19\% gain in our temporal meal score}. 
\tripcraft \footnote{Dataset and Codebase will be made publicly available upon acceptance.} establishes a new benchmark for LLM-driven personalized travel planning, offering a more realistic, constraint-aware framework for itinerary generation.

\section*{Limitations}
While \tripcraft \;significantly enhances the realism and coherence of travel planning datasets, certain limitations remain. One key constraint is the exclusion of events from the core Point of Interest (PoI) list due to the lack of structured temporal information. If such data becomes available, it can be incorporated into our dataset, enabling LLMs to explicitly factor in event timings, ultimately leading to more mature and contextually aware itineraries.

Our dataset is currently designed for U.S. cities, but the construction pipeline can be extended to other geographical regions if the necessary data is available. Expanding to a global scale would require accounting for region-specific differences in travel preferences, transportation infrastructure, and cultural factors, which remain open challenges for future research.

Additionally, our primary objective is not to propose a novel travel planning methodology but to establish a robust dataset, enhanced itinerary generation, and fine-grained evaluation metrics. While \tripcraft \;provides a strong benchmark for assessing LLM-driven travel planning, future research may explore diverse methodologies on this dataset, further advancing personalized AI-driven itinerary synthesis.


\section*{Ethics Statement}
Our study utilizes publicly available web data, which we have carefully scraped to construct our databases while ensuring compliance with relevant terms of use and ethical considerations. To safeguard privacy, we have fully anonymized sensitive personal details. However, with annotators' consent, aggregate demographic statistics are provided in the Appendix. We are committed to transparency and reproducibility in research; therefore, upon acceptance, we will release both the datasets and code to facilitate further exploration by the scientific community.
