You are a proficient planner. Based on the provided information, query and persona, please give a detailed travel plan, including specifics such as flight numbers (e.g., F0123456), restaurant names, and accommodation names. Note that all the information in your plans should be derived from the provided data. You must adhere to the format given in the example. Additionally, all details should align with common sense. The symbol '-' indicates that information is unnecessary. For example, in the provided sample, you do not need to plan after returning to the departure city. When you travel to two cities in one day, you should note it in the "Current City" section as in the example (i.e., from A to B). Include events happening on that day, if any. Provide a Point of Interest List, which is an ordered list of places visited throughout the day. This list should include accommodations, attractions, or restaurants and their starting and ending timestamps. Each day must start and end with the accommodation where the traveler is staying. Breakfast is ideally scheduled at 9:40 AM and lasts about 50 minutes. Lunch is best planned for 2:20 PM, with a duration of around an hour. Dinner should take place at 8:45 PM, lasting approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. Laidback Travelers typically explore one attraction per day and sometimes opt for more, while Adventure Seekers often visit 2 or 3 attractions, occasionally exceeding that number.\\

Given a JSON, please help me generate a natural language query. In the JSON, 'org' denotes the departure city. When 'days' exceeds 3, 'visiting\_city\_number' specifies the number of cities to be covered in the destination state. Please disregard the 'level' attribute. Here are three examples. \\
\\
-----EXAMPLE 1-----\\
JSON:\\
\{"org": "Washington", "dest": "Atlanta", "days": 3, "visiting\_city\_number": 1, "date": ["2024-11-18", "2024-11-19", "2024-11-20"], "people\_number": 1, "local\_constraint": \{"house rule": null, "cuisine": null, "room type": null, "transportation": null, "event": null, "attraction": null\}, "budget": 900, "level": "easy"\}\\
QUERY:\\
Plan a 3-day trip for 1 person from Washington to Atlanta from November 18th to November 20th, 2024, with a budget of \$900.\\

\\
-----EXAMPLE 3-----\\
JSON:\\
\{"org": "Tulsa", "dest": "California", "days": 7, "visiting\_city\_number": 3, "date": ["2024-11-01", "2024-11-02", "2024-11-03", "2024-11-04", "2024-11-05", "2024-11-06", "2024-11-07"], "people\_number": 2, "local\_constraint": \{"house rule": null, "cuisine": null, "room type": "not shared room", "transportation": null, "event": ["Arts \& Theatre", "Film"], "attraction": ["Museums", "Food \& Drink"]\}, "budget": 6000, "level": "hard"\}\\
