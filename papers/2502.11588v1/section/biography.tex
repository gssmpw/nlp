% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
%  needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
%  the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
%  $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
%  your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
%  simpler here.)

% Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiography\}}} and then for the 1st argument use $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} to declare and link the author photo.
% Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
