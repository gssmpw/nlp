The integration of artificial intelligence into automated penetration testing (AutoPT) has highlighted the necessity of simulation modeling for the training of intelligent agents, due to its cost-efficiency and swift feedback capabilities. Despite the proliferation of AutoPT research, there is a recognized gap in the availability of a unified framework for simulation modeling methods. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of existing techniques, introducing \modelcla~to categorize studies based on literature objectives, network simulation complexity, dependency of technical and tactical operations, and scenario feedback and variation. To bridge the gap in unified method for multi-dimensional and multi-level simulation modeling, dynamic environment modeling, and the scarcity of public datasets, we introduce \modelsim, a novel modeling framework that based on policy automation and encompasses the combination of all sub dimensions. 
\modelsim~offers a comprehensive approach to modeling network environments, attackers, and defenders, transcending the constraints of static modeling and accommodating networks of diverse scales. We publicly release a generated standard network environment dataset and the code of Network Generator. By integrating publicly available datasets flexibly, support is offered for various simulation modeling levels focused on policy automation in \modelcla~and the network generator help researchers output customized target network data by adjusting parameters or fine-tuning the network generator.


% As artificial intelligence advances in automated penetration testing (AutoPT), simulation modeling has become crucial for training intelligent agents due to its low cost and quick feedback. Despite the increase in AutoPT research, 仿真建模方法 remain fragmented and lack a unified framework.

% We also release the source code of a network generator and simulated network dataset \wyf{add link later}. It supports various simulation modeling levels focused on strategy generation automation by integrating publicly available dataset flexibly. The network generator enables researchers to output customized network by adjusting parameters or fine-tuning.
