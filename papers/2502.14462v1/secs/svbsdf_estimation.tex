\subsection{\textbf{SVBSDF Estimation}}
\label{sec:svbsdf_estimation}

To estimate the rest of the SVBSDF, we build upon the training methodology described in~\cite{rodriguezpardo2023UMat}. First, we expand their model to enable the estimation of opacity and transmittance maps, thus introducing two additional decoders to their attention-guided U-Net network, and expanding the loss function and discriminator architecture accordingly. 

We further introduce additional minor changes to improve the estimation. Most notably, we parameterize the normal map so as to estimate $\theta, \phi$ angles instead of full cartesian coordinates $xyz$, and following~\cite{garces2023towards} adopt~\emph{elliptical grid mapping}~\cite{fong2015analytical} for additional performance gains. %
Finally, we use AdamW~\cite{loshchilov2017decoupled} and $256\times256$ crops for training, and perform minor hyperparameter changes, which are fully described in the supplementary material.
