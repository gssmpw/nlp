\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce the OJN-Pass-EPV benchmark of game state pairs with relative EPVs, which allows to quantitatively evaluate pass EPV models and provides a template to evaluate overall EPV models and all their components. We also introduce the OJN-EPV model, which has improved performance by incorporating the z-axis of the ball, demonstrates robust performance across a new dataset, and enables a more granular interpretation of passes by dividing the pass value model into reward and risk components. Incorporating ball height and risk-reward decomposition delivers more accurate and insightful evaluations of passing decisions, ultimately fostering a more data-driven and strategic approach to the game.
