  abstract  = {The expected possession value (EPV) of a soccer possession represents the likelihood of a team scoring or conceding the next goal at any time instance. In this work, we develop a comprehensive analysis framework for the EPV, providing soccer practitioners with the ability to evaluate the impact of observed and potential actions, both visually and analytically. The EPV expression is decomposed into a series of subcomponents that model the influence of passes, ball drives and shot actions on the expected outcome of a possession. We show we can learn from spatiotemporal tracking data and obtain calibrated models for all the components of the EPV. For the components related with passes, we produce visually-interpretable probability surfaces from a series of deep neural network architectures built on top of flexible representations of game states. Additionally, we present a series of novel practical applications providing coaches with an enriched interpretation of specific game situations. This is, to our knowledge, the first EPV approach in soccer that uses this decomposition and incorporates the dynamics of the 22 players and the ball through tracking data.},

  abstract  = {In soccer, the most frequent event that occurs is a pass. For a trained eye, there are a myriad of adjectives which could describe this event (e.g., "majestic pass", "conservative" to "poor-ball"). However, as these events are needed to be coded live and in real-time (most often by human annotators), the current method of grading passes is restricted to the binary labels 0 (unsuccessful) or 1 (successful). Obviously, this is sub-optimal because the quality of a pass needs to be measured on a continuous spectrum (i.e., 0 to 10\%) and not a binary value. Additionally, a pass can be measured across multiple dimensions, namely: i) risk -- the likelihood of executing a pass in a given situation, and ii) reward -- the likelihood of a pass creating a chance. In this paper, we show how we estimate both the risk and reward of a pass across two seasons of tracking data captured from a recent professional soccer league with state-of-the-art performance, then showcase various use cases of our deployed passing system.},

  abstract  = {Abstract As science becomes increasingly cross-disciplinary and scientific models become increasingly cross-coupled, standardized practices of model evaluation are more important than ever. For normally distributed data, mean squared error (MSE) is ideal as an objective measure of model performance, but it gives little insight into what aspects of model performance are “good” or “bad.” This apparent weakness has led to a myriad of specialized error metrics, which are sometimes aggregated to form a composite score. Such scores are inherently subjective, however, and while their components may be interpretable, the composite itself is not. We contend that, a better approach to model benchmarking and interpretation is to decompose MSE into interpretable components. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we outline some fundamental types of decomposition and apply them to predictions at 1,021 streamgages across the conterminous United States from three streamflow models. Through this demonstration, we hope to show that each component in a decomposition represents a distinct concept, like “season” or “variability,” and that simple decompositions can be combined to represent more complex concepts, like “seasonal variability,” creating an expressive language through which to interrogate models and data.},
