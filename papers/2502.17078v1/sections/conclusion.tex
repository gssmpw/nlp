\putsec{conclusion}{Conclusion}

Gaussian splatting is becoming one of the key techniques in graphics rendering,
yet its performance implication on the hardware graphics pipeline has remained
unexplored thus far.
%
Through hardware graphics rendering and software optimization using a standard
graphics API, we show that hardware-based volume rendering can match or surpass
the performance of software-based rendering that relies solely on shader cores.
%
Nonetheless, we also observe that there is potential for \emph{native} hardware
support for volume rendering workloads in graphics hardware.
%
Based on the analysis on modern graphics hardware, we introduce \name{}, which
integrates hardware-based early termination and multi-granular bins with quad
merging into the special-purpose units in GPUs. These features greatly
improve the performance of rendering scenes via volume rendering such as
Gaussian splatting. 
%
We anticipate that these features will also benefit graphics and game engines
that traditionally run on graphics-specific hardware.
