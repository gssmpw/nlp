%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Avatar is a critical medium for identity representation in social virtual reality (VR). However, options for disability expression are highly limited on current avatar interfaces. Improperly designed disability features may even perpetuate misconceptions about people with disabilities (PWD). As more PWD use social VR, there is an emerging need for comprehensive design standards that guide developers and designers to create inclusive avatars. Our work aim to advance the avatar design practices by delivering a set of centralized, comprehensive, and validated design guidelines that are easy to adopt, disseminate, and update. Through a systematic literature review and interview with 60 participants with various disabilities, we derived 20 initial design guidelines that cover diverse disability expression methods through five aspects, including avatar appearance, body dynamics, assistive technology design, peripherals around avatars, and customization control. We further evaluated the guidelines via a heuristic evaluation study with 10 VR practitioners, validating the guideline coverage, applicability, and actionability. Our evaluation resulted in a final set of 17 design guidelines with recommendation levels.%The evaluation confirmed that our guidelines are comprehensive, applicable, and actionable.

%Avatar is a critical medium for identity representation in the embodied social virtual reality (VR). With the growing presence of people with disabilities (PWD) in social VR, the demand for avatars that can represent disability identity is increasing significantly. However, options for avatar-based disability representations are almost completely missing on mainstream social VR platforms, and it is unclear how to design and develop inclusive avatars that can properly represent PWD. To fill this gap, we presented 20 design guidelines to support disability representations in social VR. Our study had two phases. We first created the guidelines by interviewing 60 PWD with various disabilities to understand their self-representation preferences. We then conducted heuristic evaluations with 10 VR experts to validate the guidelines’ applicability and actionability. This resulted in a comprehensive set of guidelines, covering a wide range of disability representations through multiple aspects of embodied avatars (e.g., appearance, body motion, posture, and interaction). Experts verified the guidelines were highly actionable with concrete avatar examples and comprehensive in including diverse disabilities and avatar designs. Based on the evaluation results, we believe the guidelines can serve as a source to industry practitioners working on the avatar development and design.
