\subsection{Study I: Interview with PWD} \label{protocol_pwd}
\subsubsection{Introduction Phase}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What’s your age?
    \item How do you identify your gender? 
    \item What’s your ethnicity? 
    \item What disability do you have?
    \item Do you have any episodic disabilities, where the type or severity of symptoms fluctuate and cause a variation of abilities?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If so, in what ways?
        \end{itemize}
    \item What social VR platforms have you used?
    \item In general, what aspects of your identities would you like to convey through avatar? (prompt: Do you want to reveal gender through avatars? Disability? Race? Age?)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (Go through each of the mentioned identities:) Why? 
            \item How do you want to represent the disability? 
            \item (for disability, if not:) why not?
        \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Avatar Design Phase}
In the following, we will focus on understanding your preferences for presenting disability identities on avatars. We will delve into each aspect of avatars and ask how you would like to design your ideal avatars. We will go through from a higher level of general avatar types to the details of each component of an avatar. Please think through with me, imagine me as a design agent, and we will discuss the avatar aspects step by step. Let’s start with the general types of avatars.

\textbf{Body Appearance:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What types of avatar do you want?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why?
            \item How does it relate to your disability identity representation, if at all? 
        \end{itemize}
    \item What body parts do you want your avatar to have? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why?
            \item How does this physical composition of your avatar reflect your disability, if at all?
        \end{itemize}
    \item What’s the desired skin color of your avatar? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Does the skin color relate to your disability identity or its intersection with other identities? If so, how do you think it could relate? 
        \end{itemize}
    \item How tall do you want your avatar to be? 
        \begin{itemize}

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Do you have any body parts that you want to highlight/distinguish in comparison to other parts? OR: Do you want to customize any body parts? 
                    \item Why?
                \end{itemize}
            \item How does the choice of body shape, body size, and body proportion reflect your disability, if at all?
