\caption{Our \change{\textit{initial}} 20 design guidelines for inclusive avatars. }
\Description{The table titled "Table 5. Our original 20 design guidelines for inclusive avatars" presents 20 guidelines grouped into five categories: Avatar Body Appearance, Avatar Dynamics, Assistive Technology Design, Peripherals, and Interface. Each guideline labeled with identifiers (e.g., G1.1, G2.2). The "Examples" column illustrates each guideline with practical implementations, such as using full-body avatars to represent prosthetic limbs or allowing customization of assistive technology components. Each row corresponds to a specific guideline, presenting a structured layout that aligns guidelines with illustrative use cases for creating inclusive avatars.}
