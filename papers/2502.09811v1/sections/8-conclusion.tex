\section{Conclusion}

We presented a centralized, comprehensive, and validated set of 17 design guidelines for inclusive avatar design. Through a systematic literature review and interview with 60 PWD, the guidelines covered comprehensive disability expression methods through five design aspects of social VR avatars. With the emerging XR technology, we see the guidelines' potentials in shaping design standards and providing implementation insights for a more inclusive and diverse social VR.
