\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have presented an exhaustive comparison of different approaches to neural BRDF modeling. The results show that while purely neural approaches have advantages for materials with complex reflective patterns, the performance of methods based on parametric models on real-world data with less complex reflection patterns is comparable.
We found signs that purely neural methods cannot learn reciprocity and energy conservation from data, particularly for real-world images, and we have analyzed approaches to ensure reciprocity, including a newly proposed input mapping that ensures reciprocity by construction.
Finally, we have presented an extension to models based on additive splits that aims to capture the physical behavior better and shows improvements for existing approaches.
