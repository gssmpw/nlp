This supplementary material gives additional information on several aspects of our work. In \cref{sec:supp:add_details_models}, we present more details on the neural BRDF modeling, including a discussion of the angles and an overview of the parametric models. In \cref{sec:supp:training_and_eval}, we share more insight on the training and the evaluation, including additional details on the loss formulation and the regularizers for the additive enhancement. Finally, we present several additional experiments in \cref{sec:supp:add_experimental_results}, among them additional renderings of the objects and an analysis of the angle parametrization.
