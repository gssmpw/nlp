\caption{
    Qualitative BRDF reconstruction for the cow object from the  DiLiGenT-MV dataset \cite{Li2020DiLiGentMVDataset} for the additive separate architecture with a scalar specular term (as suggested in NeRFactor \cite{Zhang2021NeRFactor}). The results show, that a scalar specular term is unable to reconstruct the reflectance of this object and creates a spurious glow. This indicates that for some materials, a specular term with 3 channels is necessary to yield high-quality reconstructions.
