Finetuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is crucial for generating results towards specific objectives.
This research delves into the realm of drug optimization and {introduce} a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to finetune a drug {optimization} {LLM-based generative} model, enhancing the original drug across 
target objectives, while {retains the beneficial chemical properties of the original drug.}
This work is comprised of two primary components: {
(1) \fwname: A framework tailored for improving robustness and efficiency in drug optimization. It includes a LLM designed for drug optimization and a novel Structured Policy Optimization (\algname) algorithm, which is theoretically grounded. This algorithm offers a unique perspective for fine-tuning the LLM-based generative model by aligning the improvement of the generated molecule with the input molecule under desired objectives.
} 
(2) A dataset of 1 million compounds, each with OEDOCK docking scores 
on 5 human proteins associated with cancer cells
and {24 binding sites from SARS-CoV-2 virus}.
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of \algname 
and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the original drug across target properties. 
Our code and dataset will be publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/DrugImproverGPT}.
