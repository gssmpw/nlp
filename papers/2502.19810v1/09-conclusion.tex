\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \rarust{}, an AARA-style type-based automatic resource analysis of Rust programs.
%
Our design of \rarust{} exploits the memory-safety guarantees provided by Rust's borrow mechanisms.
%
Especially, we propose shared potentials and novel prophecy potentials to deal with shared and mutable borrows in a sound and compositional manner.
%
We formulate a resource-aware dynamic semantics for \rarust{} and use that to prove the soundness of the type system.
%
Our prototype implementation of \rarust{} automatically infers linear resource bounds for well-typed and well-borrowed Rust programs.
%
In the future, we plan to extend \rarust{} to support unsafe code, higher-order functions, and non-linear resource bounds.

% In this paper, we have presented a formalization of Resource Aware Borrow Calculus and its resource aware type inference system. We first point out the properties of Rust program checked by the Rust borrow checker. Under such properties, we have proved the soundness of our type system. With confidence in soundness theorem, we adopt \textsc{Charon}\cite{Aeneas} as a front-end of Rust, and have implemented a prototype resource analyzer for Rust, \textsc{RaRust}. We evaluated \textsc{RaRust} with benchmark examples, some adapted from \textsc{RaML}\cite{RaML}, turning out expected analysis result.
