\hline
agent & An agent is an entity participating in a competition (i.e multiple games), characterized by properties such as its persona and its method of analyzing feedback from each round of a game. In our simulation, we focus on a specific class of LLM-based agents.  \\

player & A player is a specific instance of an agent participating in a particular game. \\
\hline
rank & The position of a document within a set of documents submitted by a group of players during a round of a game. \\
