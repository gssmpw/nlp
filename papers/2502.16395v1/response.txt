\section{Related Work}
Recent advancements in LLM code generation have garnered significant attention, exemplified by tools like GitHub Copilot **Vig, "GitHub Copilot"** and CodeGeeX ____ which leverage code LLMs to streamline software development. 
%As modern data analysis relies heavily on code, 
These advancements have spurred growing interests in LLM-driven code generation for data tasks ____ driving progress in automating data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis ____.

While prior work examines both general-purpose models (e.g., GPT-4 **Brown et al., "GPT-4"** , Llama 3 ____ Claude 3 ____), empirical evaluations in data analysis code generation remain dominated by studies of general-purpose models, particularly the GPT family ____.

\subsection{Methodologies and Frameworks}

Recent work has explored a number of techniques to enhance LLM capabilities for data science tasks. For example, several works **Hao et al., "Chain-of-Thought Prompting"**  and **Weston et al., "Self-Reflection"** test existing general-purpose prompting frameworks like chain-of-thought ____ and self-reflection ____. %Several works 
Some propose more complex, data-science-specific paradigms --- for example a hierarchical graph modeling framework ____ and a multi-agent framework for iterative revisions ____ --- which are also implemented via prompting. Performance effects of fine-tuning LLMs on data science questions have also been benchmarked ____.

\subsection{LLM-Assisted Data Science} 
As LLM-generated data analyses are increasingly integrated into real-world pipelines, recent research has focused on understanding their practical use, particularly how human analysts engage with the LLM assistants.
TalkToEBM **Wallace et al., "TalkToEBM"** investigates how LLMs can provide interpretable model summarization and graph explanation, while CliniDSBench ____ 
presents an interactive LLM-based platform to streamline medical data analysis coding. ____ evaluates popular interfaced LLM coding tools as data science programming tools.
____ performs a systematic study of commercially available LLM coding tools used in real-world research for 
data analysis and visualization, finding that some tools had wrong and misleading analysis results due to difficulty picking up important details. 

\subsection{Datasets and Benchmarks}
Several benchmarks have been introduced to assess LLM performance on data science and data reasoning tasks. DS-1000 ____ and ExeDS ____ explore generation of code for building statistical models and making visualizations, 
while additional benchmarks assess LLM data understanding without extensive code generation (e.g. tabular data understanding) ____.
More recently, DiscoveryBench, StatQA, DAEval, and QRData, ____ build on prior works by targeting modelsâ€™ abilities to code multi-step, data-driven workflows using appropriate statistical reasoning and knowledge.

\subsection{Reproducibility in LLMs}

Existing research on the reproducibility of LLM outputs focuses on quantifying their consistency as evaluators ____ and question-answering tools ____.
Additionally, concerns about the reproducibility of studies investigating LLMs have emerged due to their opacity and experimental design standardization____. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed reproducibility of LLM-generated data analyses. Thus, our work fills a critical gap by ensuring scientific rigor of LLM-assisted data analysis, which is becoming an integral part of modern research.
