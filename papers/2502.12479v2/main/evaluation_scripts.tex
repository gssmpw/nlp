Evaluation scripts implementing the benchmark are provided at \url{https://github.com/blt2114/MotifBench} along with detailed instructions for formatting the inputs, i.e. the scaffold pdb-files and metadata.
We here briefly discuss compute requirements and other software upon which our benchmark implementation is built.

\paragraph{Compute requirements:}
Due to the heavy use of neural network methods,
evaluation of the full benchmark benefits significantly from GPU acceleration.
The benchmark takes roughly 36 hours on one Nvidia A4000 GPU.
For fast debugging purposes, we recommend running for a single problem;
for example on problem 6 (6E6R with 75 residue scaffold) evaluation requires only a few minutes.

\paragraph{Code sources:}
Beyond the tools used for evaluation already mentioned, this projects adapts code from several other open-source projects.  These include Scaffold-Lab \citep{zheng2024scaffold}, FrameDiff \citep{yim2023se},
the RigidTransform3D \citep{nghiaho12_rigid_transform_3D} implementation of the Kabsch algorithm \citep{kabsch1976solution,arun1987least}, and Openfold \citep{ahdritz2024openfold}.
