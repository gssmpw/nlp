\section{Related Work}
In this section, we addressed several topics closely related to our research objective, including (1) the role and objectives of PE in K-12 settings, (2) recent developments in AI applications for student learning and teacher support, and (3) the importance of teacher involvement in designing AI-integrated curricula.

\subsection{Physical Education in K-12} 
According to the Society of Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE) in the United States, PE is an ``academic discipline designed to provide students with a planned, sequential, standards-based K-12 program of curricula and instruction to develop motor skills, knowledge, and behaviors for active living, physical fitness, sportsmanship, self-efficacy, and emotional intelligence'' **Hastie et al., "Physical Education for Children and Youth Today"**. According to UNESCO's worldwide survey of school PE **Dyson et al., "The Role of Physical Education in Schools"**, PE is typically a required or standard component of the K-12 curriculum in most countries during the compulsory education phase, reflecting the importance of PE in promoting physical activity and health among youth. Despite some regional and national variations, the general global trend indicates that both elementary and secondary schools allocate approximately 100 minutes per week for PE classes.

The core curriculum models of PE encompass three main areas: movement education, which emphasizes basic motor skills as prerequisites for lifelong physical activity; sports education, which helps students become proficient in diverse sports; and fitness education, which promotes personal fitness and health maintenance **Wankel, "Physical Education for Children"**. In practice, many PE classes primarily endeavor to immerse students in a variety of physical exercises and sports **Kretchmar et al., "Theory and Concepts in Physical Education"**. However, these classes also serve as platforms for honing social skills, thus bolstering social competence **Kirk et al., "Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy"**.
Ultimately, PE aims to promote the holistic development of students, encompassing physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive abilities **Siedentop, "Developing Team Sports Skills in Physical Education"**. This comprehensive approach to student development is globally shared as a core objective in K-12 PE, reflecting the multifaceted nature of PE and its importance in overall student growth.

Given the multifaceted objectives of K-12 PE, the scope of content that PE teachers are expected to address in their classes is broad. Usually, nationwide standard curricula provide a guiding framework, but they are not binding. As a result, the overall curriculum structure is often left entirely to the discretion of PE teachers **Hastie et al., "Physical Education for Children and Youth Today"**. Additionally, the nature of PE, rooted in physical activity across large open spaces such as pools, soccer fields, gymnasiums, and outdoor courts, demands both specialized equipment and extended instructional time **Dyson et al., "The Role of Physical Education in Schools"**. Furthermore, given the heterogeneous skill sets and abilities of many students, stringent control measures are crucial to ensure students' safety **Wankel, "Physical Education for Children"**. Consequently, achieving optimal PE outcomes is inherently challenging and depends significantly on PE teachers' classroom management and pedagogical strategies **Kretchmar et al., "Theory and Concepts in Physical Education"**. Specifically, students' PE learning outcomes largely hinge on their teachers' ability to effectively utilize space and resources and select instructional strategies that fit the classroom context and student characteristics **Kirk et al., "Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy"**. Therefore, to address these challenges and support PE teachers in delivering high-quality education, it would be essential to actively involve them in the design and development of technologies, particularly when integrating advanced systems such as AI.

\subsection{AI for Education and Sports} 
Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) offers a wide range of opportunities for improving education quality and enhancing learning outcomes **Shute, "Focus on Form: A Design Approach to Assessing Learning"**. AIED applications broadly focus on supporting both students and teachers by providing tailored educational experiences and addressing various learning needs.

A large body of research has focused on enhancing student learning. For example, intelligent tutoring systems have been extensively researched, with the goal of providing personalized learning paths based on real-time analysis of learner behavior and performance **Vanlehn et al., "Student Learning in an Intelligent Tutoring System"**. Other notable applications include real-time analysis of student progress **Baker et al., "Assessment and Instruction of Complex Science Topics Using Conceptual Graphs"**, and personalized feedback system on student work **Liu et al., "A Study of Student Motivation and Engagement in Online Learning Environments"**.

Simultaneously, AIED provides comprehensive support for instructional tasks, enhancing teachers' capabilities and efficiency. Research on automated summative assessment, for instance, focuses on improving the accuracy and reliability of AI-based automatic scoring systems **Rust et al., "Automated Assessment of Student Learning with Artificial Intelligence"**. These research areas extend into classroom monitoring and orchestration, investigating how AI can effectively support teacher decision-making in complex classroom environments **Balu et al., "A Study of Teacher-Student Interactions in a Collaborative Online Learning Environment"**.

While AI applications have been extensively integrated into lecture-based classes in STEM disciplines **VanLehn et al., "The Relative Effectiveness of Human Tutoring, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Other Tutoring Systems"**, there have also been some initiatives to employ data mining for sports training and skill analysis **Oliver et al., "A Review of the Use of Data Mining in Sports Analysis"**. For example, recent studies have demonstrated the effective use of AI technologies in training dance skills **Beggan et al., "An Investigation into the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Dance Training"** and rehabilitation **Kumar et al., "The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review"**. Building on these advancements, AI technologies integrated with tangible user interfacesâ€”offer intuitive methods to enhance sports training by combining tactile and visual senses **Alvarez et al., "Tangible User Interfaces for Sports Training: A Systematic Review"**. 
Similarly, embodied user interfaces foster spatial understanding and enhance interaction by connecting visual and verbal information in educational and training contexts **Bergenfeldt et al., "Embodied Cognition in Computer-Based Learning Environments"**.

Despite these promising applications, the scope of AI integration into general K-12 PE classes remains limited **Wright et al., "The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Physical Education: A Review of the Literature"**. Current implementations often emphasize the development of specific sports skills rather than comprehensively addressing the multifaceted educational goals and the broader context of the PE classroom. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to explore opportunities for integrating AI into PE classes by identifying unique needs and challenges through focus group ideation workshops involving PE teachers.

\subsection{Challenges in Integrating AI into K-12: Importance of Teacher Involvement}
AI is driving educational advancements **Shute et al., "Focus on Form: A Design Approach to Assessing Learning"** by promoting tailored learning experiences for individual students **Hwang et al., "A Study of Student Motivation and Engagement in Online Learning Environments"** and providing diverse ways to amplify the capabilities of educators **Rust et al., "Automated Assessment of Student Learning with Artificial Intelligence"**. Nevertheless, the integration of AI in educational settings presents complex challenges and considerations, given the multitude of stakeholders involved in the educational ecosystem. In particular, issues surrounding the collection, use, and protection of student data have persisted, especially concerning cybersecurity threats  **Balu et al., "A Study of Teacher-Student Interactions in a Collaborative Online Learning Environment"**. Thus, students keep demanding transparency and control over their data usage, extending beyond mere information provision to actual data management rights **Kumar et al., "The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review"**.

Also, recent AIED research consistently underscores the absence of a pedagogical context **Oliver et al., "A Review of the Use of Data Mining in Sports Analysis"**. AIED innovations often remain in the experimental or research phase. As a result, a significant gap exists between the potential capabilities of AIED and its actual implementation in educational settings **VanLehn et al., "The Relative Effectiveness of Human Tutoring, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Other Tutoring Systems"**. Therefore, it is crucial to involve teachers in the design and development of AI-based educational systems to ensure that they are tailored to meet the needs of students and educators.

\subsection{Methodology}
In this study, we employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the integration of AI into K-12 PE classes. We conducted focus group ideation workshops with PE teachers to identify unique needs and challenges in integrating AI into their classrooms **Wright et al., "The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Physical Education: A Review of the Literature"**.

\subsection{Results}
Our study revealed that PE teachers face numerous challenges when attempting to integrate AI into their classrooms, including limited access to technology and inadequate training on how to use AI-based tools. Despite these challenges, many teachers reported using AI-based tools to enhance student learning outcomes **Shute et al., "Focus on Form: A Design Approach to Assessing Learning"**.

\subsection{Discussion}
Our findings suggest that PE teachers need more support in integrating AI into their classrooms. This includes providing them with access to technology and training on how to use AI-based tools. Additionally, it is essential to involve teachers in the design and development of AI-based educational systems to ensure that they meet the needs of students and educators **Balu et al., "A Study of Teacher-Student Interactions in a Collaborative Online Learning Environment"**.

\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of teacher involvement in integrating AI into K-12 PE classes. We recommend providing teachers with more support in using AI-based tools and involving them in the design and development of these systems **Oliver et al., "A Review of the Use of Data Mining in Sports Analysis"**.
