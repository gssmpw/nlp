 \caption{Illustration of REGen evaluation framework. \textbf{\textit{Left:}} Example showing getting role-specific arguments from documents using generative models. \textbf{\textit{Middle:}} Evaluation process at different levels: Exact Match, Relaxed Match, and Complex Match. \textbf{\textit{Right:}} Judgment Aligned Match (JAM) score calculation process on a specific dataset, where E1, E2, and E3 represent the deviation rates from human judgments at different matching levels. Typically, E1 equals zero for a dataset, as an exact match indicates a perfect agreement with humans. \textit{P, R,} and \textit{F1} denote Precision, Recall, and F1-score, respectively. JAM score ensures that reported scores are reliable and not inflated due to misjudgments.}
