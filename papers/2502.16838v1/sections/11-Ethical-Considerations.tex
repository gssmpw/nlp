\section*{Ethical Considerations}

\paragraph{Intended Use:} We will release our judge and alignment datasets upon the acceptance of the paper to facilitate future research on generative argument extraction evaluation.

\paragraph{Annotation:} Judge and alignment data annotation were conducted by trained NLP researchers. All annotators were compensated as per the standard paying rate of the author's institution. Key characteristics of our annotators include: (a) graduate students, (b) 3-6 years of research experience, and (c) a mix of native and non-native English speakers. We provided annotators detailed annotation guidelines, including argument extraction, semantical similarity, and the type of information we wanted to compare to mitigate potential biases. 

\paragraph{Reproducibility} Details on models and dataset processing are provided in Appendices \ref{appendix: data-info} and \ref{appendix: models}. The evaluation framework, code, and processed datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/omar-sharif03/EAE-Eval}{https://github.com/omar-sharif03/EAE-Eval}.

%will be released upon the acceptance of the paper.
