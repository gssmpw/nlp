\subsection{Practical Implications for Feedforward Prompting}

Of course, prompting an LLM continuously before the user submits their prompt is significantly most costly over submitting the prompt just once, once the user is ready.

% But user might not be ready, and the cognitive costs is pretty heavy.


\subsection{}


% Does this work well with Chain of Thought actually?
% Maybe this approach will actually incentivize self-prompt-chaining???
% What are the implications of this?


% A benefit of this is certainly more transparency in the LLM
% LLM is so flexible that adding this kind of structure is still okay for the LLM



% What's more costly, entering a prompt, then responding and saying, no i want this, or typing a prompt, and tuning the prompt/expected output to reduce message exchanges?

% Learning to become a better prompter. One is by trial and error experience. Perhaps another is through this feedforward that tells you what you might be able to anticipate.
