% \section{Critique Through the Lens of Feedforward}
\label{section:critique}

In order to understand a wider range of needs and use cases for feedforward in GenAI, we must reflect and critique past and current GenAI systems and explore how we may improve on them.
We use a critical lens \cite{MBL2021generativetheoriesinteraction} with our perspective that GenAI systems need sufficient feedforward to assess and critique three GenAI systems the first author contributed to designing and implementing: Sensecape \cite{sensecape}, Luminate \cite{luminate}, and Malleable Overview-Detail Interfaces \cite{malleableODI}.

\paragraph{Sensecape}
% Describe what the system is and what it's for. Then describe key features.
% Then, go into several of those features and say, however, the user may not know X or Y.
% Leads them to wonder, what will this be?
