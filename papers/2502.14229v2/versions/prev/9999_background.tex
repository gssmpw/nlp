\subsection{Bridging the Gulf of Envisioning in LLM Interaction}
% Bridging the gulf of envisioning
% Why johnny can't prompt
% Grounded abstraction matching
% ...

% What are various proposed solutions in this.. gap?
% List the possible things in Hari's paper
% Grounded abstraction matching
% Piryan's IUI(?) paper
% ...
% Our approach: We take the perspective that the challenges that users have with anticipating what the LLM will provide as a response is an interface design limitation. Our core focus is to explore how we can help users expect what the LLM will respond by exploring interface solutions.


% There's also a huge world of literature surroudning AI agents + AI planning. This is sort of... anticipating what the AI is going to do. 


\subsection{Supporting Feedforward in Interactive Systems}
% Feedforward is a thing that describes an interface solution that helps users what they can expect from an interaction.
% For instance, ...
% This is often complementary to "feedback" where feedback is about telling users what happened after they performed an action, whereas "feedforward" is about tellings users what will, might, and can happen before they perform the action.
