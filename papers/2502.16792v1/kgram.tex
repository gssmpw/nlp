\paragraph{Simple example: $k$-gram retrieval.}  %
\arxiv{An example of a distribution ensemble satisfying \cref{def:sparse-planted} is the distribution of tokens in the \emph{$k$-gram retrieval task}, of outputting the token following a certain $k$-gram in a given sequence $\bX$.}
Suppose that $\MV = [N]$ for some $N \in \BN$, and we want to model the ``$k$-gram retrieval'' task of outputting the token following a certain $k$-gram in the sequence $\bX$, which is closely related to the notion of \emph{induction heads} \cite{jelassi_repeat_2024,olsson_incontext_2022}. Formally, for a fixed length $\ell$, the tuple $(\bX, \bY) \in (\MV^\ell, \MY)$ is drawn as follows: first, we draw $\bX_1, \ldots, \bX_{\ell-k} \sim \Unif(\MV)^{\ell-k}$ independently, then choose a random $\ell' \sim \Unif([\ell-2k-1])$, and set $\bX_{\ell-k+1:\ell} := \bX_{\ell'+1:\ell'+k}$, and  $\bY := \phi(\bX_{\ell'+k+1})$ where $\phi : \MV \to \MY$ is some embedding function. In particular, the tokens $\bX_{\ell-k+1:\ell}$ specify the particular $k$-gram we want to query. This distribution falls into the framework of \cref{def:sparse-planted} by letting $\mu = \Unif(\MV)$, letting $S^\st$ be uniform over length-$(2k+1)$ sequences $(\ell'+1, \ldots, \ell'+k+1, \ell-k+1, \ldots, \ell)$ where $\ell' \sim \Unif([\ell-2k-1])$, and $\Qvoc$ be uniform over sequences $(\bZ_1, \ldots, \bZ_k, \bZ_{k+1}, \bZ_1, \ldots, \bZ_k)$ where $\bZ_1, \ldots, \bZ_{k+1} \sim \Unif(\MV)$. Finally, $g^\st(\bZ_1, \ldots, \bZ_{2k+1}) = \phi(\bZ_{k+1})$.
