abstract = {Oriented object detection in aerial images has received extensive attention due to its wide range of application scenarios. Although great success has been achieved, current methods still suffer from inferior high-precision detection performance. Firstly, the classification scores cannot truly represent the localization accuracy of the predictions. Secondly, the orientation prediction in these detectors is not accurate enough for high-precision object detection. In this paper, we propose a Task Interleaving and Orientation Estimation Detector (TIOE-Det) for high-quality oriented object detection in aerial images. Specifically, a posterior hierarchical alignment (PHA) label is proposed to optimize the detection pipeline. TIOE-Det adopts PHA label to integrate fine-grained posterior localization guidance into classification task to address the misalignment between classification and localization subtasks. Then, a balanced alignment loss is developed to solve the imbalance localization loss contribution in PHA prediction. Moreover, we propose a progressive orientation estimation (POE) strategy to approximate the orientation of objects with n-ary codes. On this basis, an angular deviation weighting strategy is proposed to achieve accurate evaluation of angle deviation in POE strategy. TIOE-Det achieves significant gains on high-precision detection performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets prove the superiority of our approach. Codes are available at https://github.com/ming71/TIOE.}

ABSTRACT = {Typical representations for arbitrary-oriented object detection tasks include the oriented bounding box (OBB), the quadrilateral bounding box (QBB), and the point set (PointSet). Each representation encounters problems that correspond to its characteristics, such as boundary discontinuity, square-like problems, representation ambiguity, and isolated points, which lead to inaccurate detection. Although many effective strategies have been proposed for various representations, there is still no unified solution. Current detection methods based on Gaussian modeling have demonstrated the possibility of resolving this dilemma; however, they remain limited to OBB. To go further, in this paper, we propose a unified Gaussian representation called G-Rep to construct Gaussian distributions for OBB, QBB, and PointSet, which achieves a unified solution to various representations and problems. Specifically, PointSet- or QBB-based object representations are converted into Gaussian distributions and their parameters are optimized using the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm. Then, three optional Gaussian metrics are explored to optimize the regression loss of the detector because of their excellent parameter optimization mechanisms. Furthermore, we also use Gaussian metrics for sampling to align label assignment and regression loss. Experimental results obtained on several publicly available datasets, such as DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD, and ICDAR2015, show the excellent performance of the proposed method for arbitrary-oriented object detection.},
