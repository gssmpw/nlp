\caption{SFBD performance on CIFAR-10 under various conditions. Unless specified, the clean image ratio is $0.04$ and the noise level $\sigma_\zeta$ is $0.59$. In (a) and (b), FID at iteration 0 corresponds to the pretrained model. In (c), models are pretrained on clean images from the ``truck'' class, with FID at iteration 0 measuring the distance between these clean images and those used for fine-tuning. For the w/o pretraining setting, models are trained on the full CIFAR-10 dataset with $\sigma_\zeta = 0.59$.}
