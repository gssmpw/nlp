\begin{abstract}
Recent diffusion-based generative models achieve remarkable results by training on massive datasets, yet this practice raises concerns about memorization and copyright infringement. A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain an FID of $6.31$ on CIFAR-10 with just $4\%$ clean images (and $3.58$ with $10\%$). Theoretically, we prove that SFBD guides the model to learn the true data distribution. The result also highlights the importance of pretraining on limited but clean data or the alternative from similar datasets.  Empirical studies further support these findings and offer additional insights.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper introduces SFBD, a framework for effectively training diffusion models primarily using noisy samples. Our approach enables data sharing for generative model training while safeguarding sensitive information.

For organizations utilizing personal or copyrighted data to train their models, SFBD offers a practical solution to mitigate copyright concerns, as the model never directly accesses the original samples. This mathematically guaranteed framework can promote data-sharing by providing a secure and privacy-preserving training method.

However, improper implementation poses a risk of sensitive information leakage. A false sense of security could further exacerbate this issue, underscoring the importance of rigorous validation and responsible deployment.
