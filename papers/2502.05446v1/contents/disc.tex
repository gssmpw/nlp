In this paper, we presented SFBD, a new deconvolution method based on diffusion models. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically showed that our method could guide diffusion models to learn the true data distribution through training on noisy samples. The empirical study corroborates our claims and shows that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in some benchmark tasks.
