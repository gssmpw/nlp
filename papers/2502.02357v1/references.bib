This paper presents a flexible blackstart service to restore a smart distribution system alongside an impaired ICT system. We formulate the problem of power grid restoration as a distributed optimization problem, taking into account distributed energy resources and remote-controllable switches as optimization variables and employ a multi-agent system to deliver an optimal island configuration. We define an integrated architecture for the interdependent power and ICT system and test our methodology on a realistic distribution system scenario with varying impaired ICT. The results show that the efficiency of the restoration is highly sensitive to the placement of emergency power supply and the coverage of ICT nodes.},

	abstract = {Information flow is a fundamental concept underlying the security of a system. Confidentiality of information in a system can be breached through unrestricted information flow. Physical components added to a cyber system considerably increase the difficulty of determining information flow and the difficulty of mitigating the corresponding confidentiality problem. Fundamentally, physical actions inherently divulge information through simple observation. This work applies classical models of non-deducibility and noninference to cyber–physical systems (CPSs) to determine information flow in the coupled cyber and physical worlds. The results demonstrate that the combined physical and cyber properties of a CPS can both protect and divulge information. The key to formalizing this analysis is to find a uniform semantic representation of the cyber and physical components, their interaction, and the physics of the system, and to devise a formal modeling technique for determining information flow.},

This has led to growth in the use of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with existing infrastructure. However, coupling physical and cyber processes leaves CPSs vulnerable to security attacks. A threat-vulnerability based risk model is developed through a detailed analysis of CPS security attack structures and threats. The Stuxnet malware attack is used to test the viability of the proposed model. An analysis of the Natanz system shows that, with an actual case security-risk score at Mitigation level 5, the infested facilities barely avoided a situation worse than the one which occurred. The paper concludes with a discussion on the need for risk analysis as part of CPS security and highlights the future work of modelling and comparing existing security solutions using the proposed model so to identify the sectors where CPS security is still lacking.},

To assess the performance of possible solutions, simulation tools offer a cost effective and safe approach. In this paper we will provide a comprehensive overview of various tools and their characteristics, applicable in smart grid research: we will cover both the communication and associated ICT infrastructure, on top of the power grid. First, we discuss the motivation for the development of smart grid simulators, as well as their associated research questions and design challenges. Next, we discuss three types of simulators in the smart grid area: power system simulators, communication network simulators, and combined power and communication simulators. To summarize the ﬁndings from this survey, we classify the different simulators according to targeted use cases, simulation model level of detail, and architecture. To conclude, we discuss the use of standards and multi-agent based modeling in smart grid simulation.},

This warrants both, day-ahead planning of larger schedules for power plants, as well as short-term contracting to counter forecast deviations or to accommodate dynamics of the intra-day markets. In addition, the geographic distribution of renewable energy sources forces scheduling algorithms with a hugely different communication link qualities. In this paper, we present an extension to the Lightweight Power Exchange Protocol (LPEP), dubbed LPEP++. It draws on the strength of the LPEP to find the optimal solution of the combinatorial power demand-supply problem with string guarantees in acceptable time and extends it with facilities for long-term planning, parallel negotiations and reduces its memory footprint. We furthermore show its robustness towards volatile communication link quality.},

Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents. CCS Concepts: • Networks → Network simulations.},

Understanding the involved risks, the interplay of communication and physical assets, and the effects of cyberattacks are paramount for the uninterrupted operation of this critical infrastructure. However, as the impact of cyberattacks cannot be researched in real-world power grids, current efforts tend to focus on analyzing isolated aspects at small scales, often covering only either physical or communication assets. To fill this gap, we present WATTSON, a comprehensive research environment that facilitates reproducing, implementing, and analyzing cyberattacks against power grids and, in particular, their impact on both communication and physical processes. We validate WATTSON's accuracy against a physical testbed and show its scalability to realistic power grid sizes. We then perform authentic cyberattacks, such as Industroyer, within the environment and study their impact on the power grid's energy and communication side. Besides known vulnerabilities, our results reveal the ripple effects of susceptible communication on complex cyber-physical processes and thus lay the foundation for effective countermeasures.},

In this paper, we analyze the communication infrastructure of power grids to derive resulting fundamental challenges of power grids with respect to cybersecurity. Based on these challenges, we identify a broad set of resulting attack vectors and attack scenarios that threaten the security of power grids. To address these challenges, we propose to rely on a defense-in-depth strategy, which encompasses measures for (i) device and application security, (ii) network security, and (iii) physical security, as well as (iv) policies, procedures, and awareness. For each of these categories, we distill and discuss a comprehensive set of state-of-the art approaches, as well as identify further opportunities to strengthen cybersecurity in interconnected power grids.},

	abstract = {2023-03-26 RELEASE 6.3.2 fix: {\textless}code{\textgreater}ROUND{\textless}/code{\textgreater}, {\textless}code{\textgreater}ENCODE\_FOR\_URI{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and {\textless}code{\textgreater}SECONDS{\textless}/code{\textgreater} SPARQL functions (\#2314) Commit af17916, closes \#2314. {\textless}code{\textgreater}ROUND{\textless}/code{\textgreater} was not correctly rounding negative numbers towards positive infinity, {\textless}code{\textgreater}ENCODE\_FOR\_URI{\textless}/code{\textgreater} incorrectly treated {\textless}code{\textgreater}/{\textless}/code{\textgreater} as safe, and {\textless}code{\textgreater}SECONDS{\textless}/code{\textgreater} did not include fractional seconds. This change corrects these issues. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2151. fix: add {\textless}code{\textgreater}\_\_hash\_\_{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and {\textless}code{\textgreater}\_\_eq\_\_{\textless}/code{\textgreater} back to {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.paths.Path{\textless}/code{\textgreater} (\#2292) Commit fe1a8f8, closes \#2292. These methods were removed when {\textless}code{\textgreater}@total\_ordering{\textless}/code{\textgreater} was added, but {\textless}code{\textgreater}@total\_ordering{\textless}/code{\textgreater} does not add them, so removing them essentially removes functionality. This change adds the methods back and adds tests to ensure they work correctly. All path related tests are also moved into one file. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2281. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2242. fix: Add {\textless}code{\textgreater}to\_dict{\textless}/code{\textgreater} method to the JSON-LD {\textless}code{\textgreater}Context{\textless}/code{\textgreater} class. (\#2310) Commit d7883eb, closes \#2310. {\textless}code{\textgreater}Context.to\_dict{\textless}/code{\textgreater} is used in JSON-LD serialization, but it was not implemented. This change adds the method. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2138. fix: add the {\textless}code{\textgreater}wgs{\textless}/code{\textgreater} namespace binding back (\#2294) Commit adf8eb2, closes \#2294. https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/1686 inadvertently removed the {\textless}code{\textgreater}wgs{\textless}/code{\textgreater} prefix. This change adds it back. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2196. fix: change the prefix for {\textless}code{\textgreater}https://schema.org/{\textless}/code{\textgreater} back to {\textless}code{\textgreater}schema{\textless}/code{\textgreater} (\#2312) Commit 3faa01b, closes \#2312. The default prefix for {\textless}code{\textgreater}https://schema.org/{\textless}/code{\textgreater} registered with {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.namespace.NamespaceManager{\textless}/code{\textgreater} was inadvertently changed to {\textless}code{\textgreater}sdo{\textless}/code{\textgreater} in 6.2.0, this however constitutes a breaking change, as code that was using the {\textless}code{\textgreater}schema{\textless}/code{\textgreater} prefix would no longer have the same behaviour. This change changes the prefix back to {\textless}code{\textgreater}schema{\textless}/code{\textgreater}. fix: include docs and examples in the sdist tarball (\#2289) Commit 394fb50, closes \#2289. The sdists generated by setuptools included the {\textless}code{\textgreater}docs{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and {\textless}code{\textgreater}examples{\textless}/code{\textgreater} directories, and they are needed for building docs and running tests using the sdist. This change includes these directories in the sdist tarball. A {\textless}code{\textgreater}test:sdist{\textless}/code{\textgreater} task is also added to {\textless}code{\textgreater}Taskfile.yml{\textless}/code{\textgreater} which uses the sdists to run pytest and build docs. fix: IRI to URI conversion (\#2304) Commit dfa4054, closes \#2304. The URI to IRI conversion was percentage-quoting characters that should not have been quoted, like equals in the query string. It was also not quoting things that should have been quoted, like the username and password components of a URI. This change improves the conversion by only quoting characters that are not allowed in specific parts of the URI and quoting previously unquoted components. The safe characters for each segment are taken from RFC3986. The new behavior is heavily inspired by {\textless}code{\textgreater}werkzeug.urls.iri\_to\_uri{\textless}/code{\textgreater} though there are some differences. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2120. fix: JSON-LD context construction from a {\textless}code{\textgreater}dict{\textless}/code{\textgreater} (\#2306) Commit 832e693, closes \#2306. A variable was only being initialized for string-valued inputs, but if a {\textless}code{\textgreater}dict{\textless}/code{\textgreater} input was passed the variable would still be accessed, resulting in a {\textless}code{\textgreater}UnboundLocalError{\textless}/code{\textgreater}. This change initializes the variable always, instead of only when string-valued input is used to construct a JSON-LD context. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2303. fix: reference to global inside {\textless}code{\textgreater}get\_target\_namespace\_elements{\textless}/code{\textgreater} (\#2311) Commit 4da67f9, closes \#2311. {\textless}code{\textgreater}get\_target\_namespace\_elements{\textless}/code{\textgreater} references the {\textless}code{\textgreater}args{\textless}/code{\textgreater} global, which is not defined if the function is called from outside the module. This commit fixes that instead referencing the argument passed to the function. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2072. fix: restore the 6.1.1 default bound namespaces (\#2313) Commit 57bb428, closes \#2313. The namespaces bound by default by {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.graph.Graph{\textless}/code{\textgreater} and {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.namespace.NamespaceManager{\textless}/code{\textgreater} was reduced in version 6.2.0 of RDFLib, however, this also would cause code that worked with 6.1.1 to break, so this constituted a breaking change. This change restores the previous behaviour, binding the same namespaces as was bound in 6.1.1. To bind a reduced set of namespaces, the {\textless}code{\textgreater}bind\_namespaces{\textless}/code{\textgreater} parameter of {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.graph.Graph{\textless}/code{\textgreater} or {\textless}code{\textgreater}rdflib.namespace.NamespaceManager{\textless}/code{\textgreater} can be used. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2103. test: add {\textless}code{\textgreater}webtest{\textless}/code{\textgreater} marker to tests that use the internet (\#2295) Commit cfe6e37, closes \#2295. This is being done so that it is easier for downstream packagers to run the test suite without requiring internet access. To run only tests that does not use the internet, run {\textless}code{\textgreater}pytest -m "not webtest"{\textless}/code{\textgreater}. The validation workflow validates that test run without internet access by running the tests inside {\textless}code{\textgreater}firejail --net=none{\textless}/code{\textgreater}. Closes https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2293. chore: Update CONTRIBUTORS from commit history (\#2305) Commit 1ab4fc0, closes \#2305. This ensures contributors are credited. Also added .mailmap to fix early misattributed contributions. docs: fix typo in NamespaceManager documentation (\#2291) Commit 7a05c15, closes \#2291. Changed {\textless}code{\textgreater}cdterms{\textless}/code{\textgreater} to {\textless}code{\textgreater}dcterms{\textless}/code{\textgreater}, see https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/2196 for more info.},

	volume = {39},
	issn = {0294-1260},
	abstract = {After a delay of several years, endoscopic surgery was introduced into cosmetic surgery of the face in 1992. Initially, its indications were very limited as they only concerned resection of corrugator muscles for the treatment of wrinkles between the eyebrows. Today, it has a new lease of life, with the ambition of replacing classical forehead facelift, by constituting a surgical approach. It replaces the bicoronal incision by means of 5 small incisions which allow detachment and resection of the depressor supercilii muscles similar to that obtained via a bicoronal incision. The skin or scalp excess is absorbed by various techniques. However, endoscopy now has other ambitions: functional fronto-orbital surgery. It tries to achieve a new muscular equilibrium by resection of the depressor supercilii muscles and release of the levators: occipitofrontal muscle. In this way, this new technique achieves an entirely natural repositioning of the eyebrow. The authors describe all of the technical possibilities by endoscopy, median frontal endoscopy, endoscopic frontal facelift, endoscopic extraperiosteal masklift and endoscopic subperiosteal masklift, in the case of the forehead. A special technique has been developed: temporomalar facelift. Lastly, although cervicofacial dissection is technically possible using videoendoscopy, there nevertheless remains a major stumbling block: the excess skin. Based on an experience of more than a hundred cases over a period of more than 18 months, this technique provides extremely encouraging results leading the authors to adopt this technique definitively.},

Different domain-speciﬁc simulation tools and modeling approaches are used to simulate all or parts of the system.

This paper identiﬁes the limitations of MOSAIK 2 for simulating systems that combine continuous and discrete behavior, and introduces the new version MOSAIK 3.0 with improved event capabilities to efﬁciently combine timestepped and discrete event simulation. Here it is explained how these extensions and new features of MOSAIK can be applied and implemented for extended co-simulation scenarios.},

With the new FERC 2222 order, DER aggregations are allowed to participate in energy market. To enable market participation, these virtual power plants need to provide their generation cost curves. This paper proposes efficient optimization formulations and solution approaches for the characterization of hourly as well as multi-time-step generation cost curves for a distribution system with high penetration of DERs. Network and DER constraints are taken into account when deriving these cost curves, and they enable active distribution systems to bid into the electricity market. The problems of deriving linear and quadratic cost curves are formulated as robust optimization problems and tractable reformulation/solution algorithm are developed to facilitate efficient calculations. The proposed formulations and solution algorithm are validated on a realistic test feeder with high penetration of flexible resources.},

However, high investment costs are a considerable barrier to BESS deployment, and few proﬁtable application scenarios exist at present. Here, we show that by tapping into multiple revenue streams using the dynamic stacking of applications, proﬁtable operation is viable under current regulatory conditions. We develop a multi-use optimization framework which distinguishes between behind-the-meter and in-front-of-the-meter applications and considers how power capacity is allotted in addition to energy capacity allocation. The algorithm uses a rolling horizon optimization with an integrated degradation model and is fed with real-world data from a stationary lithium-ion battery in Germany. When combining peak shaving with frequency containment reserve, a net present value per Euro invested of 1.00 is achieved, and 1.24 with the addition of arbitrage trading on the intraday continuous market.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The transformation of power grids into intelligent cyber-physical systems brings numerous benefits, but also significantly increases the surface for cyber-attacks, demanding appropriate countermeasures. However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication flows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner.},

The growing digitalization and networking in power grids combined with insufficient protection against cyberattacks further exacerbate this trend. Hence, security engineers and researchers must counter these new risks by continuously improving security measures. Data sets of real network traffic during cyberattacks play a decisive role in analyzing and understanding such attacks. Therefore, this paper presents PowerDuck, a publicly available security data set containing network traces of GOOSE communication in a physical substation testbed. The data set includes recordings of various scenarios with and without the presence of attacks. Furthermore, all network packets originating from the attacker are clearly labeled to facilitate their identification. We thus envision PowerDuck improving and complementing existing data sets of substations, which are often generated synthetically, thus enhancing the security of power grids.},

	abstract = {With the increasing number of catastrophic weather events and resulting disruption in the energy supply to essential loads, the distribution grid operators’ focus has shifted from reliability to resiliency against high impact, low-frequency events. Given the enhanced automation to enable the smarter grid, there are several assets/resources at the disposal of electric utilities to enhances resiliency. However, with a lack of comprehensive resilience tools for informed operational decisions and planning, utilities face a challenge in investing and prioritizing operational control actions for resiliency. The distribution system resilience is also highly dependent on system attributes, including network, control, generating resources, location of loads and resources, as well as the progression of an extreme event. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage resilience measure called the Anticipate-Withstand-Recover (AWR) metrics. The AWR metrics are based on integrating relevant ‘system characteristics based factors’, before, during, and after the extreme event. The developed methodology utilizes a pragmatic and ﬂexible approach by adopting concepts from the national emergency preparedness paradigm, proactive and reactive controls of grid assets, graph theory with system and component constraints, and multi-criteria decision-making process. The proposed metrics are applied to provide decision support for a) the operational resilience and b) planning investments, and validated for a real system in Alaska during the entirety of the event progression.},

As a result, SimBench, a comprehensive dataset for the low, medium, high and extra-high voltage level, is presented.

In this way, SimBench is applicable for many use cases and simplifies reproducing study results.

When engineering and integrating the multitude of systems into even more complex systems-of-systems for e-mobility, interoperability and complexity handling are vital. Model-based system architectures support the engineering process of information systems with the concepts of abstraction, reduction and separation of concerns. In this paper, we contribute to the research body, by extracting requirements for managing complexity and interoperability of these systems. Further, a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art in existing architecture models and frameworks for e-mobility is conducted. Based on the identified gaps in existing research, we propose the E-Mobility Systems Architecture (EMSA) Model, a three-dimensional systems architecture model for the e-mobility sector. Its structure originates from the well-established Smart Grid Architecture Model. We further allocate all relevant entities from the e-mobility sector to the EMSA dimensions, including a harmonized role model, functional reference architecture, component and systems allocation, as well as a mapping of data standards and communication protocols. The model then is validated qualitatively and quantitatively against the requirements with a case study approach. Our evaluation shows that the EMSA Model fulfills all requirements regarding the management of complexity and ensuring interoperability. From the case study, we further identify gaps in current data model standardization for e-mobility.},

	abstract = {Electric power grids are among the largest human-made control structures and are considered as critical infrastructure due to their importance for daily life. When operating a power grid, providers have to continuously maintain a balance between supply (i.e., production in power plants) and demand (i.e., power consumption) to keep the power grid’s nominal frequency of 50 Hz or alternatively 60 Hz. Power consumption is forecast by elaborated models including multiple parameters like weather, season, and time of the day; they are based on the premise of many small consumers averaging out their energy consumption spikes.},

	abstract = {Dynamic load altering attacks (D-LAAs) are introduced as a new class of cyber-physical attacks against smart grid demand response programs. The fundamental characteristics of D-LAAs are explained. Accordingly, D-LAAs are classiﬁed in terms of open-loop versus closed-loop attacks, single-point versus multi-point attacks, the type of feedback, and the type of attack controller. A speciﬁc closed-loop D-LAA against power system stability is formulated and analyzed, where the attacker controls the changes in the victim load based on a feedback from the power system frequency. A protection system is designed against D-LAAs by formulating and solving a non-convex pole-placement optimization problem. Uncertainty with respect to attack sensor location is addressed. Case studies are presented to assess system vulnerabilities, impacts of single-point and multi-point attacks, and optimal load protection in an IEEE 39 bus test system.},

            Smart grids (SG) draw the attention of cyber attackers due to their vulnerabilities, which are caused by the usage of heterogeneous communication technologies and their distributed nature. While preventing or detecting cyber attacks is a well-studied field of research, making SG more resilient against such threats is a challenging task. This paper provides a classification of the proposed cyber resilience methods against cyber attacks for SG. This classification includes a set of studies that propose cyber-resilient approaches to protect SG and related cyber-physical systems against unforeseen anomalies or deliberate attacks. Each study is briefly analyzed and is associated with the proper cyber resilience technique which is given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Special Publication 800-160. These techniques are also linked to the different states of the typical resilience curve. Consequently, this paper highlights the most critical challenges for achieving cyber resilience, reveals significant cyber resilience aspects that have not been sufficiently considered yet and, finally, proposes scientific areas that should be further researched in order to enhance the cyber resilience of SG.},
