\begin{abstract}
Behind-the-Meter assets are getting more interconnected to realise new applications like flexible tariffs. Cyber-attacks on the resulting control infrastructure may impact a large number of devices, which can result in severe impact on the power system.
To analyse the possible impact of such attacks we developed a graph model of the cyber-physical energy system, representing interdependencies between the control infrastructure and the power system. This model is than used for an impact analysis of cyber-attacks with different attack vectors.

\section{Introduction}
The energy transition has led to two developments that increase the significance of \ac{BTM} infrastructure. On the one hand, electrification of the heating and mobility sectors, and on the other, decentralised energy production through \ac{PV} systems. Additionally, storage systems are increasingly integrated to enable economically optimal combined utilisation of production and consumption. These \ac{BTM} installations are interconnected through \ac{ICT} infrastructure often via the internet, due to the requirements from various stakeholders.
The applications that necessitate this connectivity are highly diverse.
The simplest example is the customer's need to remotely control activities such as charging their own \ac{EV} or heating their house.
However, more complex applications such as dynamic electricity tariffs, which control \ac{BTM} devices based on market prices, are already a reality.
From the perspective of network operators, due to the new challenges for the electricity grid, it is crucial that \ac{BTM} installations can be controlled in a  grid-serving manner to ensure the safe operation of the electricity grid at all times.
These applications are either implemented directly via the customer's internet connection using \ac{HEMS} or through a dedicated advanced metering infrastructure.
The interconnection of the installations is imperative to implement these applications.
However, the networking of many small assets via a common \ac{ICT} infrastructure or a common software stack carries the risk that in the event of a cyber-attack, a large number of assets may be simultaneously affected, which could cumulatively have a significant impact on the power system.
Therefore, we propose a method to quantitatively assess this impact for various attack scenarios.

\subsection{Related Work}
\label{subsec:furtherwork}
The goal of this paper is to use approaches from the \ac{SW} to build the graph model, therefore the related work section focuses on  
\ac{SW} technologies are being explored in many areas for data modelling and describing semantic relationships between entities and attributes. Much research has also focused on how this technology can be connected to smart grid research areas.

Several approaches exist to build ontologies for power systems using \ac{RDF}.
For instance, \cite{devanand_ontopowsys_2020} focuses on multi-domain energy systems, while \cite{chun_knowledge_2018} concentrates on micro-grid communities and on the service side of the system.
Both use \ac{SW} technologies, but not with the purpose of bridging different domains and enable cyber resilience research.
The proposed models do not consider a holistic framework for describing smart grid use cases with all associated layers in both cases. In particular, they lack the connection to the \ac{SGAM}, which brings the concept in line with a widely used way to describe use cases, making the models much more accessible for researchers.
\cite{sandbergdeliverable} uses the \ac{SGAM} as basis for an ontology designed for threat modelling.
Although this work involves modelling cross-domain inter-dependencies of cyber-physical systems, it does not utilise SHACL, which allows validation through rules.
In contrast to the work presented, our paper proposes an approach that provides a holistic picture that presents a complete framework and shows how \ac{SW} technologies can be useful in all steps of definition, description, validation, and evaluation.
One of these additional aspects is a rule-based augmentation for transforming power systems in \ac{CPES}.
\cite{klaer_sg3_2020} presents an approach of graph-based modelling for \ac{CPES} and emphasises the need for an automated augmentation process. However, the work focuses only on a specific \ac{SCADA} use case and does not utilise \ac{SW} technologies.
