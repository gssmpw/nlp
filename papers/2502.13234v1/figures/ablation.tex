  \caption{\textbf{Qualitative results for ablation study.} Without utilizing cross-attention maps $\mca$ in motion features, the model fails to capture all the fish in the video, whereas in the absence of temporal self-attention maps $\mtsa$, the model struggles to accurately replicate the fine-grained motion details. In contrast, our method successfully preserves both the scene composition and the inter-frame dynamics of the reference video.}
