  \caption{{\bf Example of cross-attention maps.} We visualize the cross-attention map $\mca$, computed between the activations in T2V diffusion models and the text prompt $y$. Here we obtain the CA map by adding noise to the video and using the pre-trained diffusion model as a feature extractor. The extracted CA maps reveal the placement and shot sizes of the object associated with the word ``car'' in each video frame.}
