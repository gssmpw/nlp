  \caption{{\bf Motion Retrieval.} Compared to DDPM~\cite{ddpm} (using latent values) and VMC~\cite{vmc} (using frame differences), using the proposed motion features to perform motion retrieval shows preferable results. Note that the nearest neighbor in the motion feature space is retrieved by matching the motion features of the query video with those of the video dataset.}
