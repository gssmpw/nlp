  \caption{{\bf Example of temporal self-attention maps.} We visualize the temporal self-attention map $\mca$, computed between two different frames. Here we obtain the TSA map by adding noise to the video and using the pre-trained diffusion model as a feature extractor. The extracted TSA maps describe the dynamics of the video in detail.}
