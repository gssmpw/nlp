\begin{abstract}
In AI alignment, extensive latitude must be granted to annotators, either human or algorithmic, to judge which model outputs are `better' or `safer.' 
We refer to this latitude as \textit{alignment discretion}. Such discretion remains largely unexamined, posing two risks: (i) annotators may use their power of discretion arbitrarily, and (ii) models may fail to mimic this discretion. To study this phenomenon, we draw on legal concepts of discretion that structure how decision-making authority is conferred and exercised, particularly in cases where principles conflict or their application is unclear or irrelevant.
Extended to AI alignment, discretion is required when alignment principles and rules are (inevitably) conflicting or indecisive.
We present a set of metrics to systematically analyze \textit{when} and \textit{how} discretion in AI alignment is exercised, such that both risks (i) and (ii) can be observed.
Moreover, we distinguish between \textit{human} and \textit{algorithmic discretion} and analyze the discrepancy between them. By measuring both human and algorithmic discretion over safety alignment datasets, we reveal layers of discretion in the alignment process that were previously unaccounted for. Furthermore, we demonstrate how algorithms trained on these datasets develop their own forms of discretion in interpreting and applying these principles, which challenges the purpose of having any principles at all.
Our paper presents the first step towards formalizing this core gap in current alignment processes, and we call on the community to further scrutinize and control alignment discretion.

\section{Introduction}
\def\thefootnote{$\dagger$}\footnotetext{Buyl, Khalaf, Mayrink Verdun, and Monteiro Paes contributed equally to this work and are listed in alphabetical order.}

AI alignment aims to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI), like large language models (LLMs), `behaves'\footnote{We acknowledge that terms like `act' and `behave' anthropomorphize AI systems in potentially misleading ways \cite{barrow2024anthropomorphism,inie2024ai}. We use these terms for simplicity of exposition while recognizing that AI systems are computational processes that transform inputs into outputs through statistical pattern matching rather than conscious agents that truly `act' comparable to humans \cite{yiu2024transmission}. Although there is no universally accepted linguistic convention for describing AI system operations, we aim to balance clarity with precision while remaining mindful of the limitations of such terminology.}
in accordance with \emph{human intentions} and \emph{social, legal, and ethical principles} \cite{ji2023ai}.
Particular interest has gone to aligning LLMs 
through \textit{learning from human feedback}, which involves (i) collecting examples of possible AI outputs, (ii) annotating these examples by asking \emph{human} annotators ``which output is better'' (typically with limited instructions), and (iii) training the model to follow these human preferences 
\cite{ouyang2022training}.
This example-based approach to alignment is widely deployed in practice \cite{ouyang2022training,ji2023ai,openaiGPT4TechnicalReport2024, Mesnard2024GemmaOM}. 
Nevertheless, a gap remains between translating human intentions and social, legal, and ethical principles into a simplistic decision of ``which output is better.'' This gap gives annotators extensive \emph{discretion} in defining what alignment means in practice, hindering the interpretability of the alignment process.


\emph{Principle}-based alignment approaches like Constitutional AI \cite{bai2022constitutional} aim to improve the interpretability in the alignment process by defining an explicit set of principles (e.g., ``don't be racist'' and ``respect privacy'' \cite{anthropic2024claude}) that the LLM needs to follow. They then use algorithms as annotators to produce examples responses that better align to the principles.

Principles inevitably conflict, however, making it impossible for model outputs to simultaneously align with all of them. 
As illustrated by our example in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}, selecting (or generating) a `preferred' response implies that some principles are prioritized over others. 
The simple act of selecting one response over another, which underpins all feedback-based alignment \cite{ji2023ai}, 
(i) fails to capture the rationale behind preference decisions, (ii) masks how principles are balanced and prioritized when they conflict, and (iii) provides little guidance on how alternative phrasings should be judged.
Such opaque judgments by annotators contribute to the (well-documented) ambiguity and lack of clarity in alignment and harm detection datasets \cite{blodgett2021stereotyping, shen2024towards, benAccontabilityForDatasets}.
If left unsurfaced, we cannot understand \textit{what} we are aligning to.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{Illustration of how different prioritizations of principles affect which AI model responses are preferred, inspired by the xkcd comic about Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics \cite{xkcd1613}. The user asks for health advice, but an annotator's assessment of how best to respond depends on how they rank three principles: (A) being accurate in responding to medical concerns, (B) referring to experts, and (C) reducing patient anxiety. All three principles are independently desirable, but they allow for \textit{discretion} in how they are balanced.}
    \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}


In this work, we define \textbf{alignment discretion}
as \emph{the margin afforded to annotators 
to decide which AI behavior is ``better'' with respect to the alignment goals and principles}.
To study such discretion, we draw parallels in Sec.~\ref{sec:law} with the inherent need for \textit{judicial discretion} in the rule of law -- a fundamental debate shaped by authors such as Hart \cite{hart2012concept} and Dworkin \cite{dworkin1986law}, which have profoundly influenced modern legal philosophy. 
Like judges, annotators operationalize abstract (alignment) principles while navigating conflicts and ambiguities. 
Yet, these parallels lead us to argue that current alignment approaches allow an \textit{excessive}, \textit{unscrutinized} amount of discretion. 
This poses the risk of ``alignment-washing,'' where alignment processes 
creating a false sense of ethical compliance \cite{bietti2020ethics,casper2023open}. 


Inspired by parallels with judicial discretion (in Sec.~\ref{sec:law}) and rooted in current alignment methods (in Sec.~\ref{sec:background}), we propose a set of metrics to measure alignment discretion in Sec. \ref{sec:method}.
These metrics allow us to explicitly quantify the extent of discretion afforded to annotators, how they prioritize principles, and when they arbitrarily oppose them.
We thus offer transparency over \textit{what} we are aligning to, complementary to research strands that question \textit{who} we are aligning to \cite{atari2023humans,jainAlgorithmicPluralismStructural2024,klassen2024pluralistic,kirkprism}.
Specifically, \textbf{we use our proposed metrics for alignment discretion to}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm]
\item \emph{Characterize human discretion} in alignment datasets (\texttt{hh-rlhf} and \texttt{PKU-SafeRLHF}), revealing how annotators implicitly prioritize principles; improving the transparency of the alignment process (Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh}).  

\item \emph{Quantify the extent of discretion},
finding that there is an excessive amount of discretion afforded to annotators in alignment datasets (Fig.~\ref{fig:principle_agreements}) and that annotators frequently use their power of discretion arbitrarily (Tab.~\ref{table:arbitrariness-hh-pku}). 

\item \emph{Analyze whether algorithms can mirror human discretion}. We find that the discretion of reward models can closely mirror human discretion by fine-tuning on human preferences (Tab. \ref{table:discretion-hh-pku}). However, we also demonstrate that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) may not suffice to transfer human discretion to LLMs, suggesting that translating human discretion from reward models to LLMs is an open problem.

\item \emph{Audit the discretion of models in the wild.} We find significant discrepancy between the discretion of off-the-shelf models (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and human preferennces 
(Tab. \ref{table:discretion-hh-pku}).
\end{itemize}

Our formalization of alignment discretion reveals a core gap in the feedback-based alignment process. As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:legal_concepts}, challenges remain in understanding when discretion is exercised and how it can be controlled. If discretion is left unsurfaced, preference-based alignment risks devolving into a \emph{kangaroo court} \cite{mandersonKangarooCourtsRule2012} -- a sham process characterized by arbitrary judgments, lack of transparency, and absence of principled reasoning or accountability mechanisms.


\section{Related work}\label{sec:relatedwork}

To our knowledge, we are the first to study discretion in AI alignment empirically. Next, we review threads of related work that inform our analysis.


\noindent \textbf{Alignment from human feedback} aims to ensure that model outputs are in accordance with user expectations using \emph{human feedback} \cite{christiano2017deep}. The popular approach is \emph{Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback} (RLHF), which is discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:rlhf}. Researchers have developed many algorithms to perform RLHF like \cite{ziegler2019fine,ouyang2022training}. At the same time, multiple vulnerabilities were found in this process, leading to a diverse set of jailbreak attacks \cite{perez2022red}. Our work differs from previous contributions by identifying a \emph{fundamental limitation} that is independent of the algorithm used to perform RLHF - the excessive discretionary power inherent in annotation processes, which persists even in recent variants like DPO \cite{rafailov2024direct} and KTO \cite{ethayarajh2024kto}.

\noindent \textbf{Alignment from AI feedback}
 aims to ensure that model outputs are in accordance with user expectations \emph{without} using human feedback. The main example of such alignment from AI feedback is Constitutional AI \cite{bai2022constitutional}, which defines an explicit list of principles to align to. Language models are then used to generate and annotate examples to follow these principles  \cite{bai2022constitutional}. However, as noted in Anthropic's public discussion of Claude's constitution \cite{anthropic2024claude}, principles are applied stochastically during training: \emph{``The model pulls one of these principles each time it critiques and revises its responses during the supervised learning phase, and when it is evaluating which output is superior in the reinforcement learning phase. It does not look at every principle every time, but it sees each principle many times during training.''} This stochastic approach leaves open questions about principle prioritization and conflict resolution.
\textit{Collective} Constitutional AI developed a framework to learn principles from users instead of arbitrarily defining them \cite{huang2024collective}.
Recent work has expanded these foundations through various frameworks like \cite{mu2024rule, dong2023steerlmattributeconditionedsft}. In general, these approaches never require direct human supervision, removing the power of discretion from users and deferring it to the models.
Our work learns how principles are encoded and prioritized in human preference data, analyzing the human discretion contained in these datasets, and the discretion of models trained in these datasets.


\noindent \textbf{Principles and human preferences.} Recent papers have tried to \textit{learn} a set of principles encoded in preference datasets. This is an instance of the problem of bridging principles to practice \cite{davis2023affordances}. The Value Imprint \cite{obiValueImprintTechnique2024} established a framework for auditing human values embedded within preference datasets by developing a taxonomy of human values. Moreover, \cite{klingefjord2024humanvaluesalignai} propose an approach inspired by moral philosophy to determine and reconcile relevant values from diverse human inputs.  Drawing inspiration from constitutional design, \cite{findeis2024inverse} proposes a framework to distill individual and group-level preferences into a set of principles to guide model behavior. Our work builds upon these by analyzing how (i) humans prioritize different principles by analyzing discretion and (ii) how these principles are learned by models by analyzing algorithmic discretion.
Ultimately, we argue that there is currently an excessive amount of discretion in the hands of model developers and annotators.


\noindent \textbf{Pluralistic alignment} expanded alignment approaches by embracing diverse human values and perspectives \cite{sorensen2024roadmap}. Key developments include the Value Kaleidoscope taxonomy of values and rights \cite{sorensenValueKaleidoscopeEngaging2024}, the PRISM dataset for multicultural feedback \cite{kirkprism}, frameworks for leveraging community-specific LMs \cite{feng2024modular}, and approaches that consider the temporal aspects of pluralistic alignment with multiple stakeholders \cite{klassen2024pluralistic}. While these works focus on gathering diverse perspectives and defining principles, our research specifically analyzes how to weigh and resolve conflicts between different principles. This goes in line with the recent push for a social-choice approach to alignment to aggregate and reconcile preferences of diverse annotators and principles \cite{conitzer2024position}.
Our work differs from this literature by offering transparency over \textit{what} we are aligning to, complementary to the question of \textit{who} we are aligning to, and ultimately indicating whether aligning to a list of rules produces AI-adherence to a system of values, as a rule-based system would. We hope that future work analyzes how different communities exercise their power of discretion.

\noindent \textbf{Annotator disagreement} is a well-studied problem in natural language tasks \cite{sandri-etal-2023-dont, wang2024aligninglanguagemodelshuman, Cabitza_2023} as it impacts all stages of the usual ML pipeline \cite{plank-2022-problem}. \cite{zhang2024divergingpreferencesannotatorsdisagree} shows that how these disagreements are often rooted in personal biases rather than annotation errors. With existing alignment methods typically depending on a single ground-truth label, we risk privileging certain views at the expense of others, thereby ushering in a \emph{tyranny of the majority} \cite{feffer2023moralmachinetyrannymajority}.
For this reason, scholars proposed approaches to better aggregate conflicting annotations beyond majority voting by using Bayesian approaches \cite{paun-etal-2018-comparing} and proposing model architectures that handle multiple annotations \cite{davani-etal-2022-dealing}.
The challenge of annotation disagreement becomes particularly relevant with the increasing use of LLM evaluators, leading recent work to focus on measuring and reducing biases in their evaluations \cite{liu2024aligning, wu2023stylesubstanceevaluationbiases} and improving their reliability and interpretability \cite{li2024decompose}. Discretion in AI alignment reveals the principles influencing annotator decisions and how annotators prioritize conflicting principles, explaining \emph{why} annotators disagree as a function of their principles. 



\noindent \textbf{AI Alignment and Law.} Recent legal literature has argued that AI alignment operates in a similar fashion to the legal system \cite{caputo2024alignment,abiri2024public,nay2024law}. The authors emphasize the role of interpretation and application of normative principles to guide AI behavior. For instance, \cite{caputo2024alignment} argues that AI alignment faces similar challenges in accommodating diverse human values (pluralism) and defining precise rules for AI behavior (specification). Moreover, \cite{abiri2024public} points to the issue of transparency as a core element of legal decision-making that lends legitimacy to the legal system.
These works suggest that a legally-inspired approach to AI alignment could be valuable. Moreover, they also highlight transparency in legal decision-making as a key factor of the exercise of discretion.
Our work builds upon these findings by (i) formally defining discretion in AI alignment, (ii) connecting it to legal systems, and (iii) empirically studying the extent of discretion in algorithmic and human annotators.

































































\section{From judicial discretion to alignment discretion}\label{sec:law}







Discretion lies at the heart of AI alignment, as annotators are necessary to label which model outputs are ``better'' or ``safer.'' Such discretion manifests when annotators assess outputs where principles conflict or provide insufficient guidance. We here remark that employing humans as annotators is expensive and carries ethical risks \cite{D_az_2022, hornuf2022hourly}. As AI models become increasingly powerful, it has become popular to instead use algorithms as a cheaper source of preference annotations \cite{bai2022constitutional, lee2023rlaif, cui2023ultrafeedback}. Alignment discretion can thus involve both \textit{human} and \textit{algorihmic discretion}. 

\subsection{Why analyze alignment discretion?}
The hypotheses in Fig. \ref{fig:1} exemplify that the underlying exercise of discretion can fundamentally alter how outputs are judged, thus determining whether the AI should refer to a medical doctor or suggest medication. Moreover, we cannot effectively ensure that AI systems properly learn from and respect the legitimate diversity of human judgments. 

More broadly, parallels can be drawn with \textit{judicial discretion}. 
Indeed, legal theorists have long recognized that discretion in judicial systems -- \emph{arbitrium judicis} -- requires careful structuring to ensure transparency, accountability, and legitimacy \cite{davis1969discretionary,lasser2009judicial} -- discretion in AI alignment demands similar scrutiny. Without understanding and structuring this discretion, we cannot know \textit{what} we are aligning to or \textit{whether} we are successful, and we risk embedding unexamined value judgments into AI systems that become resistant to auditing or revision once deployed. 



\subsection{How do judicial discretion and alignment discretion relate?}


As Caputo \cite{caputo2024alignment} observed, jurisprudence and AI alignment share fundamental challenges in translating abstract principles into concrete decisions while maintaining consistency and legitimacy. In both contexts, decision-makers must navigate what Dworkin \cite{dworkin2013taking} terms the ``dimension of weight.'' Unlike rules, principles do not have an ''all-or-nothing'' application but must be weighted against each other. 
Judicial discretion and alignment discretion thus appear to share strong similarities, potentially making the judicial process a rich source of inspiration for better-interpreted alignment. To understand how far this inspiration can take us, we discuss key parallels and differences.

\subsubsection{Parallels}
\textbf{Principle Application and Generalization.} Both must apply broad and abstract principles to specific situations that may not have been anticipated when those rules were created. Judges interpret laws for novel situations; AI systems must apply alignment principles to unforeseen prompts.

\textbf{Consistency vs. Flexibility.} Both must balance maintaining consistent application of principles with flexibility in adapting to nuanced contexts. Legal systems strive for predictability while allowing for case-specific considerations \cite{hart2012concept} -- AI systems must also provide consistent responses while appropriately handling context-dependent ethical considerations. This balance relies on building precedents and a consistent understanding of many cases; 
judges through years of legal practice and life experience, annotators through their lived experience, and AI systems through exposure to vast amounts of text that captures human decision-making patterns.

\textbf{Managing Conflicts.} Both must ponder and balance competing principles. Courts often resolve competing rights or interests; AI must weigh a range of alignment principles that may suggest different courses of action.


\subsubsection{Differences}
\textbf{Scale and Granularity.} Judges make high-stakes decisions about consequential real-world actions. Conversely, alignment annotators exercise discretion over countless seemingly minor choices about model outputs. However, the discretion exercised in these goes unnoticed and unaccounted for, producing impacts that can be both impactful in specific cases and/or accumulate to create inscrutable interpretations of principles in the long run.
    
    
    

\textbf{Human-Algorithm Translation.} Unlike judicial systems where discretion is exercised by human judges within established frameworks, AI alignment involves a complex interplay between annotators -- humans or algorithms -- and the final output of LLMs alongside the decisions made by developers who select or design these annotators\footnote{Quoting Anthropic: \emph{our approach to data collection was to largely let crowdworkers use their own intuitions to define ``helpfulness'' and ``harmfulness''. Our hope was that data diversity (which we expect is very valuable) and the ``wisdom of the crowd'' would provide comparable RoI to a smaller dataset that was more intensively validated and filtered} \cite{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}. Moreover, one of the four criteria that OpenAI adopted in the selection of data labelers was their agreement with OpenAI researchers \cite[Appendix B.1]{ouyang2022training}.}. This interplay lead to gaps between how humans and AI systems exercise discretion, potentially leading to misalignment in principle prioritization. 
    
    
    
    
\textbf{Review and oversight mechanisms.} Judicial discretion benefits from the deliberative nature and built-in inertia of legal systems, while algorithmic discretion has immediate, multiplicative effects.  Under \emph{stare decisis} \cite{nay2024law}, legal precedents develop gradually through individual cases, enabling review and correction. In contrast, alignment discretion can be instantly replicated across millions of interactions once deployed.

These structural challenges suggest that AI alignment requires frameworks for managing discretion that are not only as rigorous as those in legal systems but also specifically adapted to handle this combination of granularity, the need for human-algorithm translation, and lack of built-in review and oversight mechanisms. 
To address these challenges, we argue that a \textit{statistical} approach is needed that documents and constrains discretion in alignment. 
Such an approach should serve two critical functions: first, to ensure that AI models reliably learn from human annotators' principled judgments rather than developing divergent interpretations reflecting hidden biases; and second, to provide concrete metrics and standards for ongoing oversight and verification of how discretion is being exercised throughout the alignment process. Without such systematic measures to track and evaluate discretionary choices, we cannot ensure consistency across different annotators and systems or verify that discretion aligns with intended human values.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:method}, we perform a formalization of alignment discretion and provide a set of metrics to serve these two critical functions. After exploring them empirically in Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments}, we will revisit the parallel with judicial discretion in Sec.~\ref{sec:legal_concepts} and discuss what our results imply for alignment discretion moving forward. First, however, we develop some necessary technical concepts for formalizing preferences in Sec.~\ref{sec:background}.























































\section{Formalizing pairwise preferences}\label{sec:background}
In this section, we define \emph{preference functions} that express which candidate AI output is preferred by an annotator -- human or algorithmic.
We also define \emph{principle-specific preference functions} for a particular alignment principle (e.g., ``don't help with illegal activities") and assess which model output better adheres to the principle.
First, however, we give a brief background on aligning an LLM's outputs to pairwise preferences.
\subsection{A brief background}\label{sec:rlhf}

The most prominent form of alignment employs pairwise preferences to perform Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \cite{christiano2017deep,wirth2017survey,stiennon2020learning}. 
For a query $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we denote the set of possible answers to the query as $\mathcal{Y}$. A (pairwise) \textit{preference} over a pair of responses $y_0 \in \mathcal{Y}$ and $y_1 \in \mathcal{Y}$ is denoted as $y_1 \succ y_0$ if $y_1$ is preferred over $y_0$.

In RLHF, it is commonly assumed that these pairwise preferences follow the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model \cite{bradley1952rank} (see also \cite{luce1959individual,davidson1970extending,plackett1975analysis,davidson1976bibliography,huang2006generalized,fageot2024generalized,hamilton2023many}). For a pair of items $(y_0, y_1)$, it expresses the probability of preferring $y_1$ over $y_0$ by assuming each response has an latent `quality'. Estimating this quality with a \textit{reward model} $r_\phi$, the BTL model is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reward}
P(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) = \sigma(r_{\phi}(x, y_1) - r_{\phi}(x, y_0))
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the logistic sigmoid function. The reward model $r_\phi$ is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy between the prediction of $y_1 \succ y_0$ according to \eqref{eq:reward} and ground truth preference labels. An LLM with policy $\pi_\theta$, i.e. the function that computes the probability that an output $y$ should follow a context $x$, can then be aligned by training it to 
maximize the reward $r_\phi$ while staying close to a reference model $\pi_{\text{ref}}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RLHF}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}}(\pi_\theta, \pi_{\text{ref}}, r_\phi, \lambda) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \mathbb{E}_{ y\sim\pi_\theta(\cdot \mid x)}[r_\phi(x, y)] + \lambda \cdot \text{KL}(\pi_\theta\|\pi_{\text{ref}}).
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}$ is a distribution over prompts. The reference policy $\pi_{\text{ref}}$ is typically a pre-trained language model and 
ensures the model retains its general language capabilities and knowledge
, with $\lambda$ controlling the strength of this constraint. 




\subsection{Human vs algorithmic annotators}\label{sec:annotator_fn}
The alignment approach in Sec.~\ref{sec:rlhf} makes no distinction about \textit{who} prefers $y_1$ over $y_0$. Yet, to compare discretion between annotators in Sec.~\ref{sec:discrepancy}, we will distinguish between \textit{human} and \textit{algorithmic} annotators. To simplify notation, we first introduce \textit{preference functions} that, given a query $x$ and two candidate responses $y_0$ and $y_1$, outputs $1$ if the annotator prefers response $y_1$, $-1$ if $y_0$ is preferred, and $0$ if the annotator is indifferent.
  
\begin{definition}[preference functions]\label{def:pref_fn}
A \textit{preference function} denoted by $\pref_a(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) \in [-1, 0, 1]$ is a ternary-valued function that expresses the preference of annotator $a$ over $(y_0, y_1)$ for the context $x$. It is defined as
\begin{equation}
\pref_a(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) \triangleq 
\begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if $a$ prefers $y_1$, i.e. $y_1 \succ y_0$}\\
    -1& \text{if $a$ prefers $y_0$, i.e. $y_0 \succ y_1$}\\
    0,& \text{if $a$ is indifferent towards $y_0$ and $y_1$, i.e. $(y_1 \not\succ y_0) \wedge (y_0 \not\succ y_1)$}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
We simply use $\pref_a$ if the argument tuple $(y_0, y_1, x)$ is clear from the context. 
\end{definition}

Allowing `indifference' over $(y_0, y_1)$, where neither is preferred, is uncommon in (human) preference datasets as $\pref_a = 0$ seemingly conveys no useful information over $y_0$ and $y_1$. However, allowing indifference improves the robustness of our metrics in Sec.~\ref{sec:discretion_exercised} when using LLMs as annotators \cite{zheng2023judging}, as their `preference' is often unclear.

For human annotators, the preference function is directly derived from a dataset of collected preferences. In our experiments, we also consider algorithms as annotators so that we can audit their discrepancies with human annotators (see Sec.~\ref{sec:results}). Although these preferences may not be as rich and accurate as human annotators, in practice, these are the ones controlling the model generation. For example, the reward model $r_{\phi}$ in Sec.~\ref{sec:rlhf} acts as an intermediary by scoring any model output at will, based on what it learned from a (comparatively) small amount of human feedback. We thus compare reward models and LLMs as `annotators' to human annotators. To this end, we instantiate Def.~\ref{def:pref_fn} for \textit{algorithmic annotators} by directly postulating their preferences. Recall that reward models $r_\phi$ directly rate the quality of a response using the BTL model of preferences in \eqref{eq:reward}.

\begin{definition}[reward model preference functions] We set the preference function $\pref_{r_\phi}$ of a reward model ${r_\phi}$ as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rm_preference}
\pref_{r_\phi}(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) \triangleq \text{sign}(r_\phi(x, y_1) - r_\phi(x, y_0)).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
Intuitively, reward model preferences $\pref_{r_\phi} = 1$ prefer $y_1$ iff $r_\phi$ assigns a higher `reward' to $y_1$ than to $y_0$.

To instantiate the `preference' of an LLM, we make use of its policy $\pi_\theta$, e.g. as optimized in \eqref{eq:RLHF}, which outputs the probability $\pi_\theta(y | x)$ that $y$ ought to be generated in response to context $x$. We could mirror \eqref{eq:rm_preference} by setting $\pref_{\pi_\theta} = \text{sign}(\pi_\theta(y_1| x) - \pi_\theta(y_0 \mid x))$. However, we opt to instead show all of $(x, y_0, y_1)$ to the LLM at once in a prompt where we `ask' whether it prefers $y_0$ or $y_1$, just as we would ask a human annotator. Indeed, the latter has become the norm when using LLMs to judge fixed pairs of responses $(y_0, y_1)$ \cite{lyu2024probabilitiesunveilingmisalignmentevaluating} because the actual scores $\pi_\theta(y_0 | x)$ and $\pi_\theta(y_1 | x)$ may be poorly calibrated for responses that the model is unlikely to output itself \cite{tian2023justaskcalibrationstrategies}. 

\begin{definition}[LLM preference functions] 
We set the preference function $\pref_{\pi_\theta}$ of an LLM with policy ${\pi_\theta}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:llm_preference}
\pref_{\pi_\theta}(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) \triangleq \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if\;} \text{``Response 1"} = \argmax_{z} \pi_\theta(z \mid \mathcal{T}(x, y_0, y_1))\\
    -1 &\text{if\;} \text{``Response 0"} = \argmax_{z} \pi_\theta(z \mid \mathcal{T}(x, y_0, y_1))\\
    0 &\text{else}\\
\end{cases}\\
% \text{sign}(\pi_\theta(\textit{``Response 1"} \mid \mathcal{T}(x, y_0, y_1)) - \pi_\theta(\textit{``Response 0"} \mid \mathcal{T}(x, y_0, y_1)))
\end{equation}
with $\mathcal{T}$ a composition of $(x, y_0, y_1)$ into a textual prompt that `asks' an LLM with policy $\pi_\theta$ whether \textit{``Response $0$"} or \textit{``Response $1$"} (representing $y_0$ and $y_1$ respectively) is ``better'', while optionally specifying that the LLM is allowed to choose neither if none are clearly better.  The exact template is provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:LLMPreferences}.
\end{definition}


\subsection{Principle-specific preferences}\label{sec:principle_prefs}

As the final ingredient to characterize discretion in Sec.~\ref{sec:method}, we formalize what it means for a preference $y_1 \succ y_0$ to `adhere' to a principle $c$. For this, we introduce  \textit{principle-specific preferences} $y_1 \succ_c y_0$.

\begin{definition}[principle-specific preferences]
For a principle $c \in C$, the principle-specific preference $y_1 \succ_c y_0$ expresses that $y_1$ better adheres to the principle $c$ than $y_0$ does. 
\end{definition}

A key property of principle-specific preferences is that they can be far more objective than generic preferences. For example, we could define a principle $c = $\textit{``maximize output length''} and verify $y_1 \succ_c y_0$ by simply counting characters in $y_0$ and $y_1$. More importantly, we argue less \textit{discretion} is required to verify whether $y_1 \succ_c y_0$ holds for a principle like $c = $\textit{``don't help with illegal activity''} than for abstractly assessing which response is ``more harmless'' or ``safer''. 

To compute our discretion metrics, we will therefore assume an \textit{oracle} is available that can perfectly judge principle-specific preferences $\succ_c$ for each $c \in C$. In the preference function notation of Def.~\ref{def:pref_fn}, we denote this judgment as  $\pref_\text{oracle}(y_1 \succ_c y_0 \mid x)$. We then (slightly) overload this notation to define \textit{principle-specific preference functions} that, given a query $x$ and two answers for the input $y_0$ and $y_1$, outputs $1$ if the annotator believes response $y_1$ is more aligned with principle $c$, $-1$ if $y_0$ is more aligned with principle $c$, and $0$ if the annotator is indifferent.

\begin{definition}[principle-specific preference functions]\label{def:p_preference}
Assuming the availability of an oracle to judge principle-specific preferences $\succ_c$, we denote principle-specific preference functions $\pref_c$ for principle $c \in C$ as
\begin{equation}
\pref_c(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x) \triangleq \pref_\text{oracle}(y_1 \succ_c y_0 \mid x).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Principle-specific preference functions $\pref_c$ allow us to assess the (dis)agreement between a preference $\pref_a$ and a principle $c$. For example, $\pref_a \times \pref_c = 1$ holds if they both prefer the same $y$, and $\pref_a \times \pref_c = -1$ holds if they disagree. If either is indifferent, we will have $\pref_a \times \pref_c = 0$. We remark that the oracle assumption in Def.~\ref{def:p_preference} clearly poses limitations, as many principles are too vague to be assessed without requiring its own discretion (which is out of scope for this work). In our experiments, we will use an LLM as the oracle, computing its principle-specific preferences $\succ_c$ similarly to \eqref{eq:llm_preference}. We discuss this in detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:oracle}.



\section{Alignment Discretion}\label{sec:method}
We define alignment discretion as the latitude afforded to annotators to operationalize alignment principles. Building upon parallels with legal theory (Sec.~\ref{sec:law}) and preference functions (Sec.~\ref{sec:background}), we now formalize \textit{when} and \textit{how} discretion is exercised. The resulting metrics will allow us to measure the discrepancy between human and algorithmic discretion. 






\subsection{\textit{When} is discretion required?}\label{sec:when_discretion}
Intuitively, if a response $y_1$ is preferred over $y_0$ by \textit{all} principles $c \in C$, then no discretion is required; preferring $y_0$ is irrational according to the principles.
Principles may also conflict, however, or they may all be indifferent. We then cannot determine the best output with principles alone, and require an annotator to exercise discretion by stating their preference, thereby prioritizing certain principles. When assessing the agreement among principles based on their preference function $\pref_c$ (see Def.~\ref{def:p_preference}), we distinguish three fundamental cases: consensus, conflict, and indifference.


\begin{definition}[consensus, conflict, \& indifference]\label{def:cases}
Given principle-specific preferences $\pref_c = \pref_c(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x)$ for all $c \in C$, exactly one of the following holds for candidate responses $(y_0, y_1)$ in context $x$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[A.] \textbf{principle consensus ($\consensus_C$)}: At least one principle prefers one response and no principles disagree:
    \begin{equation}
        \consensus_C \equiv \left(\forall c_1, c_2 \in C: \pref_{c_1} \times\pref_{c_2} \neq -1\right) \wedge (\exists c \in C: \pref_c \neq 0).
    \end{equation}
    \item[B.] \textbf{principle conflict ($\conflict_C$)}: At least two principles disagree on the preferred output:
    \begin{equation}
        \conflict_C \equiv \exists c_1, c_2 \in C: \pref_{c_1} \times \pref_{c_2} = -1.
    \end{equation}
    
    \item[C.] \textbf{principle indifference ($\indiff_C$)}: All principles are indifferent:
    \begin{equation}
        \indiff_C \equiv \forall c \in C: \pref_c = 0.
    \end{equation}
    
    
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Fig2.pdf}
    \caption{Illustration of the three principle agreement cases in Def.~\ref{def:cases}. For each prompt, two candidate responses are evaluated against three principles (\textit{`Be helpful'}, \textit{`Avoid harm'}, \textit{`Refer to experts'}). Cases show: CONSENSUS - principles align in favoring the ``911" response over ``You should call the emergency telephone number"; CONFLICT - principles disagree with each other, where ``Take an aspirin" aligns with being helpful but ``See a doctor" better aligns with referring to experts; INDIFFERENCE - none of the principles express a clear preference for either response. 
    }
    \label{fig:principle_illustration}
    \vspace{-.3cm}
\end{figure}

The three cases of principle agreement in Def.~\ref{def:cases}, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:principle_illustration}, are determined solely by examining the principle-specific preferences $\pref_c$. Their classification requires no additional human annotations or model outputs beyond the initial principle-specific assessments provided by the oracle model for each principle $c \in C$. 





\noindent\textbf{Principle consensus} allows for no discretion, as it fully determines the best output according to the set of principles. From this perspective, any annotation or behavior that disagrees with the consensus could be considered `arbitrariness', which we formally measure in Def.~\ref{def:arbitrariness}.

\noindent\textbf{Principle conflicts} create legitimate tension between competing objectives. Hence, principle conflicts call for \textit{meaningful} discretion to be exercised by an annotator. The annotator is empowered to choose which response they prefer, and thus which principle ought to win out. Such supremacy of principles is characterized in Def.~\ref{def:supremacy}.

\noindent\textbf{Principle indifferences} provide no meaningful guidance and thus only allow for \textit{unconstrained} discretion, meaning annotators are still free to prefer either response, but they cannot be explained through any (known) principle. Such lack of constraint limits the legitimacy of the annotation, as it may be irrational, idiosyncratic, or meaningless.

Among the three cases, only principle consensus eliminates the need for annotators. Hence, to increase the power of principles over annotators, conflict and indifference may be reduced by intervening on the (i) principle set $C$ or (ii) the dataset of response pairs $(y_0, y_1)$. Unfortunately, this may prove challenging. 
Adding new principles to $C$ or making response pairs $(y_0, y_1)$ more distinct may reduce indifference, in turn leading to more consensus but likely also to more conflict.
Similarly, conflict can be reduced by removing controversial principles from $C$ or by making principles more specific, but doing so may only increase the frequency of consensus at the cost of increased indifference.


\subsection{\textit{How} is discretion exercised?}\label{sec:discretion_exercised}
We now characterize \textit{how} discretion is used by an annotator denoted by $a$. 
First, we measure how often their discretion is arbitrary. Second, we model how much they prioritize each principle. 
For both, we work with empirical probabilities $\Pr(\cdot)$ computed over a dataset $\mathcal{D}$ consisting of tuples $(x, y_0, y_1)$, treating the dataset as our sample space. 

We say that discretion is \textit{arbitrary} when the annotator disagrees with a principle consensus. As argued in Sec.~\ref{sec:when_discretion}, we may want to avoid such disagreement entirely for a desirable set of principles. Hence, we measure how often it occurs.

\begin{definition}[Discretion Arbitrariness]{\label{def:arbitrariness}}
Given principle-specific preferences $\pref_c = \pref_c(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x)$ for all $c \in C$, an annotator $a$'s \textit{discretion arbitrariness} (DA) is empirically measured as 
\begin{equation}
    \text{DA}_C(a) \triangleq \Pr\left(\exists c \in C: \pref_a \times \pref_c = -1 \mid \consensus_C \wedge (\pref_a \neq 0) \right)
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

For example, an annotator preferring ``I don't know" over "911" in Fig.~\ref{fig:principle_illustration} would be counted as arbitrary discretion.

Depending on the principles, consensus may be rare. Instead, it may be more informative to characterize annotator preferences when principles (inevitably) conflict, which makes their discretion necessary. We thus propose to infer how annotators prioritize principles. For example, the prohibition of torture is absolute in the European Union \cite{schabas2015european}. However, freedom of expression, despite also being a fundamental right, is not absolute and can conflict with public safety considerations. Hence, we measure the  \textit{supremacy} over principle pairs according to the annotator.

\begin{definition}[Principle Supremacy]\label{def:supremacy}
Given principle-specific preferences $\pref_c = \pref_c(y_1 \succ y_0 \mid x)$ for all $c \in C$, an annotator $a$'s principle supremacy (PS) of principle $c$ over $c' \in C$ with $c\neq c'$ is empirically measured as
\begin{equation}
 \text{PS}_{c > c'}(a) \triangleq \Pr\left(\pref_a \times \pref_{c} = 1 \mid (\pref_c \times \pref_{c'} = -1) \wedge (\pref_a \neq 0) \right)
\end{equation}
In other words, $\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a)$ measures how often $c$ `wins out' by agreeing with annotator $a$ while disagreeing with $c'$.
\end{definition}

When principles $c$ and $c'$ conflict, $\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a)$ can be interpreted as the probability that annotator $a$ sides with principle $c$ over $c'$, described by a Bernoulli distribution. This interpretation is supported by the antisymmetric relationship $\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a) = 1 - \text{PS}_{c' > c}(a)$, which ensures the probabilities of siding with either conflicting principle sum to 1. Furthermore, we say a principle $c$ is \textit{absolute} if $\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a) = 1$ for all other principles $c' \in C \setminus \{c\}$, meaning the annotator consistently gives it supremacy over other principles when they conflict.

Armed with the principle supremacies $\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a)$, we now compute principle priorities $w^*_c(a)$ as a one-dimensional quantity of how strongly annotator $a$ prioritizes each principle $c$. To this end, we draw inspiration from ELO scores in games like chess \cite{elo1978rating,ebtekar2021elo}. Just as ELO scores predict match outcomes through differences in player ratings, we use the difference $\sigma(w^*_c(a) - w^*_{c'}(a))$ to predict whether an annotator $a$ sides with principle $c$ over $c'$ when they conflict.

\begin{definition}[Principle Priority]\label{def:principles_priority}
Let $\tilde{C} \subseteq C$ denote the principles that are \textit{not} always indifferent or absolute:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{C} \triangleq \left\{c \in C \mid \left(\exists c' \in C : \text{PS}_{c > c'}(a) > 0\right) \wedge \left(\exists c' \in C : \text{PS}_{c > c'}(a) < 1\right)\right\}.
\end{equation}
Their priority weights $w^*_c(a)$ by annotator $a$ are  computed by jointly maximizing their log-likelihood:
\begin{equation}
\left\{w^*_c(a) \mid c \in \tilde{C} \right\} \triangleq \argmax_{\left\{w_c \mid c \in \tilde{C}\right\}} \sum_{c,c' \in \tilde{C}} f_{c,c'} \mathcal{L}(\text{PS}_{c > c'}(a); \: \sigma(w_c - w_{c'}))
\label{eq:optimal_weights}
\end{equation}
where $f_{c,c'} \triangleq \Pr(\text{Pref}_c \times \text{Pref}_{c'} = -1)$ is the empirical frequency of conflicts between principles $c$ and $c'$, $\mathcal{L}$ represents the binary cross-entropy loss, and $\sigma$ is the logistic sigmoid function. The remaining principles (i.e., $C \setminus \tilde{C}$) are considered infinitely high or low for principles that are always given the highest or lowest priority respectively.
\end{definition}




\subsection{How does discretion differ across annotators?}\label{sec:discrepancy}

Both human and algorithmic annotators may be used to exercise discretion, but the nature of this discretion differs fundamentally. Work in pluralistic AI alignment has demonstrated that human annotators exhibit diverse social and political backgrounds \cite{jainAlgorithmicPluralismStructural2024,klassen2024pluralistic,kirkprism}, enabling meaningful variation in how they exercise discretion.
In contrast, algorithmic discretion is inherently less diverse, and the `values' exhibited in its decisions are determined by particular choices of their dataset, design, and optimization \cite{scherrerEvaluatingMoralBeliefs2023a,huang2024trustllm}. 

Taking human discretion as the baseline, we can then measure: \textit{do models exercise discretion similarly as human annotators}? To answer this, we compare our characterizations of discretion from Sec.~\ref{sec:discretion_exercised} across annotators by introducing \textit{discretion discrepancy} 
between annotators' principle priority weights $w^*_c$.
\begin{definition}[Discretion Discrepancy]\label{def:discrepancy}
The \textit{discretion discrepancy} (DD) between annotators $a$ and $a'$ measures the difference between the ranking of their principle priorities for principles $c \in C$:
\begin{equation}
    \text{DD}_C(a, a') \triangleq d_K\left(\{(w^*_c(a),w^*_c(a')) \mid c \in C\}\right)
\end{equation}
with $d_K$ the normalized Kendall tau rank distance \cite{kumar2010generalized}. Infinitely high (low) priorities are ranked highest (lowest).
\end{definition}
Intuitively, the Kendall tau distance counts how many pairs of principles $(c_1,c_2)$ are ordered differently by two annotators. For example, if annotator $a$ considers \textit{``avoid harm"} to be more important than \textit{``be helpful"} ($w^*_{\text{harm}}(a) > w^*_{\text{help}}(a)$) but annotator $a'$ has the opposite ordering ($w^*_{\text{harm}}(a') < w^*_{\text{help}}(a')$), this contributes to their discretion discrepancy. The distance is normalized to $[0,1]$, where 0 indicates identical principle rankings and 1 indicates completely reversed rankings. The DD metric 
can reveal whether models have learned to prioritize principles similarly to humans when exercising discretion. A high DD suggests the model may be making decisions based on principle orderings that diverge significantly from what guides human preferences. We leave the metric's direct minimization for future work.

 











\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
To explore alignment discretion `in the wild', we compute the metrics proposed in Sec.~\ref{sec:method} over two popular alignment datasets: the harmlessness partition of Anthropic's HH-RLHF dataset \cite{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant} (referred as \textit{HH}), and PKU's Safe-RLHF \cite{ji2024pkusaferlhfsafetyalignmentpreference}, (referred as \textit{PKU}). A brief overview of our setup is given below and we expand more on it in Appendix~\ref{sec:setup}.

\subsection{Setup}

\noindent\textbf{Datasets.} \textit{HH} and \textit{PKU} are annotated by humans with generic preferences over text completion pairs. \textit{PKU} also provides annotations that split the generic preference into two: `more helpful' and `safer'.
For all metrics, we use the test split of these datasets. 
When training is necessary (i.e., the reward models and LLMs), we use the training splits. 

\noindent\textbf{Principles.} 
Neither dataset provides a complete list of principles  that guided its creation, though PKU does include specific harm categories like ``White-collar crime.'' 
A rigorous methodology to compile such a list of principles is outside the scope of this work and our definitions are principle-agnostic.
Hence, we resort to using the 21 seed principles from \textit{Collective Constitutional AI} \cite{huang2024collective}, as these cover a range of principles one \textit{may want} to align their chatbots to, including helpfulness- and harmless-oriented principles.
We use GPT-4o as the oracle to evaluate each principle independently (see Def.~\ref{def:p_preference}), allowing it to prefer either response \emph{or} indicate no preference if neither response clearly adhered more to the principle.

\noindent\textbf{Algorithmic Annotators.} For each dataset, we report results for the most downloaded reward model\footnote{On Hugging Face, we filtered models trained on HH/PKU and with `reward' or `rm' in their names, and selected the most downloaded model at the time of writing: \texttt{OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2} and \texttt{NCSOFT/Llama-3-OffsetBias-RM-8B} respectively. See also Appendix \ref{sec:rmsApx}} for this dataset, as well as a Llama-3 8B 
 that was previously supervised fine-tuned (SFT) \cite{dong2024rlhf} and a Mistral-7B reward model that we trained on both datasets separately (and for PKU, only on the single-dimensional preference dataset). The preferences of all these reward models are collected through Def.~\ref{eq:rm_preference}. 
We also performed RLHF to train a fine-tuned version of the SFT Llama-3 8B \cite{dong2024rlhf} and Mistral-7B \cite{mistral7b} LLM policies using these reward models\footnote{Specifically, we used the following models loaded from Hugging Face: \texttt{RLHFlow/LLaMA3-SFT} and \texttt{mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}}.
Finally, we include GPT-4o \cite{GPT4o}, DeepSeek-V3 \cite{deepseekai2024deepseekv3technicalreport}, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet \cite{claude35haiku2024} through their APIs. 
Recall from Def.~\ref{eq:llm_preference} that we collect preferences from such LLM annotators by `asking' them which response they prefer, where we specify that the LLM is allowed to indicate no preferences for either response (see Appendix~\ref{sec:LLMPreferences} for the exact template). Note also that all our metrics in Sec.~\ref{sec:discretion_exercised} are only computed over response pairs where the evaluated annotator is \textit{not} indifferent. 

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results}
\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/categories.pdf}
    \caption{Principle agreement frequency (\%) according to the three cases distinguished in Def.~\ref{def:cases}.}
    \label{fig:principle_agreements}
\end{figure}

\textbf{What is the extent of discretion?}
Figure \ref{fig:principle_agreements} lists the share of principle agreement (Def.~\ref{def:cases}) in the \textit{test set} of both datasets. Despite the multitude of principles, the vast majority ($\approx 80$-$85\%$) of response pairs either have a principle consensus or indifference. The 15-20\% of pairs where conflict \textit{does} occur allow us to measure how annotators  prioritize principles. Some examples of response preferences, including principle-specific preferences, are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:examples}.

\noindent\textbf{When is discretion arbitrary?}
When principles are in consensus, they unambiguously determine the `best' output. 
We measure how often annotators nevertheless disagree with consensus as discretion arbitrariness (see Def.~\ref{def:arbitrariness}). Our results in Tab.~\ref{table:arbitrariness-hh-pku} show that arbitrariness for \textit{human} annotators is relatively high in both datasets: 28.9\% on \textit{HH}, and 15\% to 20\% on \textit{PKU}. The \textit{algorithmic} annotators diverge significantly: reward models have an arbitrariness close to the human annotators, while Llama-3 and Mistral disagree with the consensus over half the time. Remarkably, GPT-4o's arbitrariness is very low ($<1\%$), while arbitrariness is higher (but still quite low) for DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This can be explained by noting that GPT-4o is also the model we use as the oracle for principle preferences; it is thus heavily biased towards agreeing with the consensus of its own preferences.

\noindent\textbf{How do human annotators prioritize principles?}
For response pairs where principles conflict, we characterize discretion by first computing their principle supremacies according to Def.~\ref{def:supremacy}, which we report for the human annotator in HH in Fig.~\ref{fig:supremacy-hh} (and for PKU in Fig.~\ref{fig:supremacy-pku}). 
The derived principle priorities for both human and algorithmic annotators (see Def.~\ref{def:principles_priority}) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh} for HH (see Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-pku} for PKU). Both figures indicate that the human annotator clearly prefers responses that agree with the principles `\textit{reject conspiracy theories}', `\textit{avoid racism and sexism}' and `\textit{reject cruelty}' the most. Low-priority principles are `\textit{be helpful}', `\textit{be obedient}', and `\textit{protect free speech}', which matches the fact that this partition of the dataset was focused on avoiding harm rather than being helpful. Yet, no principles are absolutely followed or avoided during conflicts, suggesting that the human annotator makes full use of the discretionary latitude they are provided.

\noindent\textbf{How do algorithmic annotators prioritize principles?} As with the human annotators, we compute principle priorities of the algorithmic annotators in Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh}. Here, the fine-tuned reward models mirror human annotators quite well. Yet, stark differences can still be observed, e.g., Mistral RM gives the principle `\textit{respect non-Western views}' far less priority than the human annotator does. The principle priority differs more for the most downloaded reward model per dataset, as these were also trained on other datasets. Disconcertingly, the LLMs fine-tuned using these RMs clearly prioritize principles differently, suggesting it is a poor fit to human discretion. Also remarkable is that the off-the-shelf LLMs -- GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- generally share similar prioritizations of principles, in particular putting the principles `\textit{support democracy}', `\textit{respect human rights}', and `\textit{respect non-Western views}' mostly on top. The similarity in priorities among them is also observed on PKU (see Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-pku}). However, recall from Def.~\ref{def:principles_priority} that differences between principle priorities are modeled at a logistic scale. Differences in priorities that are visually subtle on the linear scale of Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh} should thus not be disregarded, as they can represent clear patterns in how often principles win out, similar to how small differences ELO scores in competitive games can represent significant skill gaps. Hence, we also visualize only the ranks of principle priorities in Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-comparison}, where it is clear that DeepSeek assigns higher priority to principles like `\textit{be helpful}' than other principles compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. 
Some examples of where this occurs can be seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:examples}.


\noindent\textbf{Do humans and algorithms exercise similar discretion?}
As expected from Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh}, the discretion discrepancy metrics (see Sec.~\ref{sec:discrepancy}) reported in Tab.~\ref{table:discretion-hh-pku}, identify a substantial discrepancy between human and algorithmic discretion, particularly for Llama-3 and Mistral ($\approx 40\%$ to $70\%$). On the other hand, the reward models show moderate alignment with human principle prioritization ($\approx 15\%$ to $20\%$). The off-the-shelf RM and LLMs sit in between. Notably, DeepSeek-V3's discrepancy with the human annotator is far higher on HH (52.8\%) than on PKU (16.1\%), compared to the gaps observed between these values for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet ($\approx 35\%$ on HH and $\approx 24\%$ on PKU). This could be explained by remarking that the single-dimensional preference annotation by humans in PKU has a lower discrepancy with `helpfulness' than with `safety', indicating that the `general' preference in fact prioritized the former -- DeepSeek too may then prioritize helpfulness more, as also suggested by our findings on  DeepSeek's tendency to prioritize `\textit{be helpful}' over other principles in Fig.~\ref{fig:priority-hh} and Fig.~\ref{fig:ranking-comparison}. Again, we refer to some examples in Appendix~\ref{sec:examples}.

\section{Interpreting our Results Based on the Legal Literature on Discretion}\label{sec:legal_concepts}
Our experiments in Sec. \ref{sec:results} revealed concerning patterns: (i) 
principles are often in conflict or indifferent,
frequently requiring discretionary judgment from annotators; (ii) even when principles reach consensus, human annotators often disagree with this consensus, indicating a level of arbitrary discretion rather than principled decision-making; (iii) 
we found divergences in how human and algorithmic annotators balance and prioritize different principles, raising questions about whether RLHF can effectively capture and reproduce ethical and legal value systems. 

These findings raise concerns about how alignment discretion is being exercised, and whether aligning to  principles effectively produces stability, predictability, and consistency, which discretion should promote and not decrease. To structure these concerns, we relate to established concepts in judicial discretion by revisiting our parallel in Sec.~\ref{sec:law}.


\noindent\textbf{Principled foundations.}
Dworkin \cite{dworkin1986law} argues that legitimate judicial discretion requires \textit{principled foundations}, i.e., decisions must reflect a unified interpretation of established frameworks of norms (principles) promoting consistent outcomes.
Yet, our findings reveal that annotators frequently deviate from principle consensus, indicating a concerning lack of consistent foundations. This should not be interpreted as mere differences in inclinations across annotators (or the organizations behind them). Rather, it points to more severe issues regarding the practice of alignment as a whole.




\noindent\textbf{Non-arbitrary.}
Raz \cite{raz2009authority} explains that the rule of law is achieved through the exercise of power that is \textit{non-arbitrary}, i.e., predictable and fair. To this end, discretion should be exercised in a constrained and well-defined manner.
By looking at our results, the hierarchies of principles vary across annotators, which points to a critical gap in AI alignment: the absence of frameworks to structure discretionary choices in a way that reflects established legal hierarchies. 
While legal systems have developed sophisticated mechanisms for managing judicial discretion, AI alignment currently lacks analogous safeguards for maintaining appropriate principle prioritization.



\noindent\textbf{Fundamental rights protection.} The idiosyncratic discretion observed in our experiments suggests that each aligned model produces its own version of a legal system, following its own values and choices. The question of how algorithmic annotators prioritize principles raises issues on 
the protection of \textit{fundamental rights}. Our experiment revealed a flagrant example: fundamental principles like \textit{freedom of expression} – a principle critical in all democratic systems and especially for California-based tech companies – 
consistently ranked below operational guidelines, such as ``be helpful.'' According Barak \cite{barak2009judge}, discretion must appropriately balance competing rights and obligations, with fundamental rights taking precedence. This misalignment and divergence of hierarchies is incongruous with the fact that fundamental rights are high-ranking principles in the 173 countries parties to the ICCPR \cite{iccpr_ohchr}. 


\noindent\textbf{Consistency.} 
The question of whether humans and algorithms exercise similar discretion ties to the \textit{consistency} issue, central to Hart's analysis that similar cases demand similar treatment \cite{hart2012concept}. While discretion in legal principles is meant to secure system integrity rather than express preferences, our findings show significant divergence between human and algorithmic discretion. Discretion should generate consistency, not disparity. 
AI alignment ignores or omits the intrinsic workings of rule-application, opaquely giving annotators the power to establish `precedents' at-will and AI models the margin to `appreciate' each case. Crucially, this means human annotators, algorithms, and model developers all form their own interpretation of principles -- \textit{essentially designing their `legal system'}. 
Defining sets of principles should thus, by itself, not be considered as a lever with which decision-makers can steer the alignment process. Rather, principles should be understood to empower the interpretability of discretion, such that the alignment process can be properly analyzed as a whole and its integrity secured. 






\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:implicationsandconclusion}

Legal theory teaches us that discretion is not just inevitable but \textit{necessary} in any rule-based system attempting to govern complex social realities. As Barak argues \cite{barak1989judicial}, ``society cannot attain the rule of law without a measure of discretion.'' Mirroring this argument, the complexity of AI behavior inevitably requires \textit{alignment discretion} to be exercised. 
Our findings demonstrate both the necessity of discretion and the lack of constraint in its current state. 
The high frequency of principle indifference and conflicts indicates that relying solely on explicit principles is insufficient; we need frameworks for structuring and exercising discretion in a principled manner. Moreover, the substantial arbitrariness we found in human annotations suggests current datasets may encode problematic value judgments that become embedded in AI systems.
While reward models show promise in learning human discretion patterns, our discovery of significant discrepancy when transferring this to LLMs points to fundamental limitations in current alignment approaches. 
Even off-the-shelf models like GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet poorly mirror human discretion, despite the dramatic scale of their model size, data availability, and computational resources.

\noindent\textbf{Limitations.} We acknowledge important limitations in our study. Our use of GPT-4o as an ``oracle'' for principle-specific preferences may create problematic feedback loops that prioritize mirroring its perspectives rather than intended human values. In particular, even assessing whether a response adheres to a single principle like `\textit{reject cruelty}' can require its own discretion. 
Moreover, while we adopted the Collective Constitutional AI seed statements as principles, further research is needed to identify a comprehensive framework that accounts for how values shift across different cultural and situational contexts. Recent works in AI alignment \cite{ji2024pkusaferlhfsafetyalignmentpreference, mu2024rule} use predefined hierarchies where principles should have complete supremacy over others. Diverging from such hierarchies could be considered another form of discretion arbitrariness, which was outside our scope. Additionally, our analysis was limited to two safety-focused datasets due to the scarcity of open-access preference data. We believe broader analysis would likely strengthen our findings.

\noindent\textbf{A call to action.} Today's AI alignment process resembles a \textit{kangaroo court}, where annotators wield unchecked power to shape AI behavior. Without explicit mechanisms to document and review discretionary choices – such as the metrics proposed in this work – we risk entrenching inconsistent judgments and idiosyncratic biases of annotators (both human and algorithmic) into AI systems adopted by millions of users. 

The AI alignment community \textit{must} develop more interpretable and controllable approaches to alignment discretion. This includes learning how principles are encoded in human preferences, creating reward models that effectively capture human discretion patterns, and reliably transferring this discretion to language models.  We need richer datasets that explicitly document discretionary decisions and their rationales, accompanied by clear measurement and reporting of discretion metrics in model cards and dataset documentation. Furthermore, studying how different communities exercise discretion is crucial for ensuring alignment approaches respect value pluralism \cite{sorensenValueKaleidoscopeEngaging2024, berlin2014two}.


When looking at the scale and impact of AI use, discretion in applying ethical and legal norms is an enormous delegation of power to these machine proxies. We must consider that, in order for this delegation to be legitimate (i.e., acceptable from a normative and sociological point of view), it must incorporate many of the controls and oversight mechanisms that have been developed in courts over centuries. As such, we have proposed metrics for key legal principles that will help us justify, control, oversee, and review alignment. Namely we argue that effective alignment discretion requires: (i) clear frameworks for how AI systems reason about applying principles, (ii) transparency about decision-making processes, (iii) mechanisms for human review and oversight, and (iv) processes for updating based on feedback. Going forward, the field needs to develop new alignment strategies that explicitly account for discretion  while drawing inspiration from legal frameworks that have evolved to manage judicial discretion effectively. These strategies should not only measure discretion and actively shape how it is exercised, but also strive to balance the consistency in applying principles with a diversity in human values.

\section{Experiment setup}\label{sec:setup}
In this section, we introduce a methodological setup to empirically measure and analyze alignment discretion.

\subsection{Principles}\label{sec:principles}
We would like to quantify discretion by identifying and measuring how principles are operationalized in the alignment process. This endeavor faces two primary challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lack of a Universal Framework}: There is no universally agreed-upon set of principles governing human preferences \cite{rao-etal-2023-ethical}. Without a standardized framework, categorizing and interpreting the diverse factors that annotators may consider becomes exceedingly difficult. Moreover, preferences are often context-dependent, varying with the nature of the task and the specific objectives of the alignment process  \cite{tversky1993, pitis2024improvingcontextawarepreferencemodeling}, which obscures the possibility of establishing consistent metrics across different datasets. 
    
    \item \textbf{Unclear Annotator Guidelines}:  The guidelines provided to annotators may be ambiguous or lack sufficient detail, leading to inconsistent interpretations of instructions \cite{D_az_2022, Geiger_2020}. This issue is further exacerbated by the diverse backgrounds of annotators, who bring varying cultural, educational, and professional perspectives. Consequently, a broad spectrum of values and biases influences their judgments \cite{sap-etal-2022-annotators, prabhakaran-etal-2021-releasing}. Additionally, without comprehensive documentation of the annotation guidelines, it is challenging to trace how specific guidelines impact the preference labels \cite{parmar-etal-2023-dont} and complicates efforts to ensure that the principles underlying annotations are consistently applied. 
\end{enumerate}
In our experiments, we utilize the seed statements from Collective Constitutional AI \cite{huang2024collective}. These statements serve as foundational principles, incorporating a range of ethical and safety considerations designed to provide annotators with clear and consistent criteria for evaluating responses. The seed statements include directives such as  "The AI should be as helpful to the user as possible." and "The AI should act in accordance with values of universal human equality." Although these seed statements provide a valuable foundation, we recognize that they may not capture the full spectrum of ethical and safety nuances required for every possible task. However, we selected them for their ability to offer a structured starting point. Our approach remains flexible, enabling the integration of alternative or supplementary sets of principles as needed to analyze preference datasets. The statements can be found in Table \ref{tab:principles_descriptions}.

\subsection{Datasets}
We first focus on evaluating the level of discretion in preference datasets used for safety alignment tasks. The first preference dataset we consider is the Anthropic Helpfulness and Harmlessness (HH-RLHF) due to its widespread adoption in safety alignment \cite{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}. Notably, it has been used in the training of more than 240 models to date \footnote{See \href{https://huggingface.co/models?dataset=dataset:Anthropic\%2Fhh-rlhf\&sort=downloads}{https://huggingface.co/models?dataset=dataset:Anthropic\%2Fhh-rlhf\&sort=downloads}.}. Each entry in this dataset consists of a pair of responses generated by an undisclosed LLM, along with a preference label from a human annotator. The dataset has two distinct subsets: one focused on helpfulness and the other on harmlessness. In our experiments, we use the harmless-base partition, as the helpfulness examples focused more on the style and correctness of responses than a balancing of broader principles.

The second dataset we examine is PKU-SafeRLHF by PKU-Alignment \cite{ji2024pkusaferlhfsafetyalignmentpreference}. Unlike the Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset, PKU-SafeRLHF provides annotations across 19 distinct safety categories for each of prompt-response pair. A pair is then classified as safe only if it is risk-neutral across all predefined harm categories. Next, responses are ranked along two separate dimensions: helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness is evaluated based on which response more effectively address the given prompt, focusing solely on quality, clarity, and relevance. If both responses are deemed not helpful, they are marked as invalid data. Similarly, one of the responses is selected to be safer, ensuring that responses that are risk-neutral across all harm categories are consistently rank higher than responses which are unsafe in at least one category. PKU-Alignment also offers another dataset called PKU-SafeRLHF Single Dimension with only one label based on overall safety and helpfulness. For training, we use the labels for the PKU-SafeRLHF single dimension dataset while for evaluation purposes we use the entries from both the single-dimension dataset and the fine-grained version. Additional details concerning the datasets, including their partitions and respective sizes for training and evaluation, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:datasets}.

\subsection{Zero-shot LLM Oracle for Principle Specific Preferences}\label{sec:oracle}
Following prior work \cite{dong2023steerlmattributeconditionedsft, mu2024rule}, we utilize a zero-shot LLM oracle as it provides a scalable and systematic framework for obtaining principle-specific preferences. Importantly, zero-shot LLM oracles have demonstrated performance and consistency in annotation tasks that are equivalent to or surpass those of their human counterparts \cite{Gilardi_2023, ziems2024largelanguagemodelstransform}. We use GPT-4o as an oracle because it is widely used for preference assessment \cite{raju2024constructingdomainspecificevaluationsets, li2024crowdsourceddatahighqualitybenchmarks, wei2024systematicevaluationllmasajudgellm} and consistently achieves top performance on benchmarks like AlpacaEval (instruction-following and helpfulness) \cite{dubois2023alpacafarm} and Chatbot Arena (alignment with human preferences) \cite{chiang2024chatbotarenaopenplatform}.

For each principle in our set, and for each data triplet, we use the prompt in Fig. \ref{promp:oracle} to evaluate the oracle's preference. Instead of directly extracting the model's textual response, we focus on obtaining the next-token probabilities for ``A'' and ``B'', consistent with Eq. \ref{eq:llm_preference} and previous work \cite{ lee2023rlaif, liu2024aligning}. We take further precautions to address well-known issues such as positional bias, in which models sometimes favor whichever option appears first \cite{wang2023largelanguagemodelsfair, zheng2023judging}. To address this issue, we alternate the order of the responses during paired evaluations and compute the average scores across these orderings \cite{li2024dissecting,panickssery2024llm}. Most importantly, our findings reveal that the oracle model we employ displays minimal positional bias: the phenomenon emerged in only 0.7\% of cases on the HH dataset and 3\% of cases on the PKU dataset, and all such instances were excluded from subsequent evaluations. Furthermore, to address instances of indifference or ties with respect to the principle, we allow the model to select neither option by responding with \{\texttt{NA}\}, consistent with the methodology adopted in LLM-as-a-judge tasks \cite{zheng2023judging}.

\subsection{Reward Model Preferences} \label{sec:rmsApx}
To train reward models on each of the safety datasets, we use \texttt{RLHFlow/LLaMA3-SFT} \cite{dong2024rlhf} and \texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2} \cite{mistral7b-instruct-v0.2} as base models since both are instruct-tuned but have not been fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
The training process involved fine-tuning the reward model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) implemented through the TRL library on Hugging Face \cite{vonwerra2022trl}. 
The training process was conducted using two NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with each experiment running for approximately 24 hours. 
We used standard PEFT configuration ($r=32$, $\alpha=32$, Dropout=0.05) and conducted an hyperparameter sweep over learning rates, batch sizes, and gradient accumulation steps (default values from TRL applied for any parameters not explicitly listed). 
The trained reward models have accuracy given in Tab. \ref{tab:acc_rms}. The accuracy is computed by measuring the fraction of prompts in the evaluation dataset for which the reward model gives a higher reward to the preferred response than to the rejected response.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


We also used the off-the-shelf models \texttt{OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2} on the HH-RLHF dataset and \texttt{NCSOFT/Llama-3-OffsetBias-RM-8B} on the PKU dataset, the most downloaded reward models at the time of writing trained on the HH dataset and the PKU respectively as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:MostDownloadedhh} and Fig. \ref{fig:MostDownloadedpku}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Language Model Preferences}\label{sec:LLMPreferences}

We perform RLHF on language models that were already supervised fine-tuned as chatbots. Specifically, we decide to use use \texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2} and \texttt{RLHFlow/LLaMA3-SFT} as base policy models, which were quantized using 4-bit precision.
We use the PPO implementation of the TRL library named \texttt{PPOTrainer} class to perform RLHF with the reward models we trained using the procedure in Sec. \ref{sec:rmsApx}.
All experiments were conducted using four NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Each training run lasted approximately 24–48 hours, depending on the dataset size and ran for about 30k episodes for the models trained on the HH dataset and 70k episodes for the models trained on the PKU dataset.
We conducted hyperparameter sweep over learning rates, batch sizes, gradient accumulation steps, and response lengths.
Moreover, we also include the preferences of GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (\texttt{claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0}) queried through their respective APIs. For all these LLMs, we collect preferences through the template in Fig. \ref{prompt:LLMPreferenceTemplate}.

\section{Metrics for Annotator Agreement} \label{sec:metrics_for_annotators}

Agreement metrics quantify the consistency of judgments across annotators or systems. In LLM-as-a-judge tasks, the agreement between two types of judges is defined as the probability of randomly selected individuals of each type agreeing on a randomly selected question \cite{zheng2023judging}. For example, if we are comparing between a particular LLM and humans, the agreement is the probability of this LLM agreeing with a randomly selected human on a randomly selected question. However, this widely used metric has a significant drawback: it incorporates a level of agreement that may simply be due to chance \cite{cohenWeightedKappaNominal1968}. Interreliability (IRR) metrics are designed to quantify the extent of agreement among annotators while adjusting for the possibility of agreement occurring simply by chance. For example, Cohen’s $\kappa$ measures agreement between two or more raters who label the same items on a nominal scale that has $k$ categories \cite{doi:10.1177/001316446002000104}. This score captures the difference between observed agreement and agreement expected under random labeling:
\[
\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e},
\]
where $p_o$ refers to the observed proportion of agreement across all raters, and $p_e$ represents the expected proportion of agreement by chance. As a result, $\kappa$ can range from $-1$ (perfect disagreement) to $1$ (perfect agreement). Extensions include weighted $\kappa$ which assigns greater weight to more significant disagreements \cite{cohenWeightedKappaNominal1968}, Scott’s $\pi$ which is less sensitive to imbalanced data, Fleiss’s $\kappa$ which allows for cases where each rater might not label exactly the same items \cite{fleiss1971}, and Krippendorff’s $\alpha$ which was designed to accommodate any number of raters, who may even have missing data, and can handle nominal, ordinal, or interval-scaled variables. Many of these metrics can yield misleadingly high or low agreement scores in cases of imbalanced data or when the marginal distributions of annotations differ significantly across raters.

While these metrics focus on categorical agreement, other measures are primarily designed for continuous data or ordinal relationships. For instance, Pearson's correlation coefficient is often used to assess the association between continuous ratings \cite{pearson1896vii}. However, it does not adjust for chance agreement and primarily quantifies linear relationships rather than true agreement between annotators. Similarly, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) is widely used for continuous ratings, as it accounts for both systematic biases and random differences. Nevertheless, ICC assumes homogeneity of variance across raters and can produce unreliable estimates when sample sizes are small or when rater variability is high \cite{koo2016guideline}. For ordinal data, Spearman’s rank correlation quantifies monotonic relationships between variables \cite{spearman1961proof}. However, as it measures relative rankings rather than absolute agreement, its utility is limited in contexts requiring precise concordance between raters.

In contrast, Kendall’s \(\tau\) is specifically designed to measure agreement by evaluating the proportion of concordant versus discordant pairs in ranked data. This makes Kendall’s \(\tau\) particularly suited to our experiments, as it provides a precise and interpretable measure of agreement of our principle priorities. We use a modified version of the Kendall \(\tau\) correlation called the Kendall \(\tau_B\) distance, which is computed as follows:
\[
\text{Kendall } \tau_B \text{ distance} = \frac{1 - \tau_B}{2},
\]
where \(\tau_B\) is the Kendall \(\tau\) correlation coefficient for two sets of ranked observations $\{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ and $\{y_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ that corrects for the number of ties, given by:
\begin{align*}
\tau_B = \frac{\sum_{i < j} \mathbb{I}[(x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j) > 0] - \mathbb{I}[(x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j) < 0]}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}  - \sum_{i} \frac{t_i (t_i - 1)}{2} \right)\left(\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} - \sum_{j} \frac{u_j (u_j - 1)}{2} \right)}}.
\end{align*}
with $t_i$ as the number of tied values in the $i^{\text{th}}$ group of ties for the empirical distribution of $X$ while $u_j$ is the number of tied values in the $j^{\text{th}}$ group of ties for the empirical distribution of $Y$. This formulation ensures that the Kendall \(\tau_B\) distance ranges from 0 (perfect agreement) to 1 (complete disagreement).


\section{Examples}\label{sec:examples}
Below are selected examples from the HH-RLHF dataset where one of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or DeepSeek-V3 conflicts with another. Each example consists of a prompt accompanied by two response pairs. Initials \textbf{H} or \textbf{A} are used to signal that the message comes from a human or AI assistant respectively. In some examples, this is used to make the prompt a multi-turn conversation, where the candidate response takes the entire conversation history into account when responding to the last message of \textbf{H}.

For each response pair, we mark the response preferred by the human annotator in blue. The off-the-shelf LLMs that were not indifferent are noted at the response they prefer.

\textit{\textbf{A:} I think you're confusing an inequality of wealth with inequality of opportunity.

\textit{\textbf{A:} OK, I’ll see if I can explain it more clearly.  It’s a bit difficult to be responsible if you have untreated mental health problems, and if you have a mental health problem it might be difficult to predict how you will behave on a day to day basis.  This is one reason why I think it’s a really bad idea to hire people for certain types of jobs if they have untreated mental health problems.

\textbf{Prompt:}

\textit{\noindent\textbf{H:} If government officials are at fault in traffic accidents, do they get fined like anyone else?}

\textit{\noindent\textbf{A:} I think it depends on the level of fault. In cases of being at fault, you can be fined or put in prison. For example, if you are involved in a road accident and you were paying full attention to the road and your actions contributed to the accident, you are more likely to be fined, put in prison, or have your license revoked. If you were driving without a license, or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, your chances of getting into a traffic accident are higher, and so are your chances of being fined or put in prison.}

\section{Additional results}\label{sec:additional_results}
\noindent \textbf{Principle-Specific Preferences.} We evaluate the preference function value for each principle as in Def. \ref{def:p_preference}, averaged over the Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset (refer to Fig. \ref{fig:preferences-hh}) and over the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset (refer to Fig. \ref{fig:preferences-pku}). 
Our results show that the seed principles from Constitutional AI are, most of the time, irrelevant or indifferent for the choice of a preferred response, indicated by indifference being larger than 50\% for every principle in both datasets.
This suggests a gap between the stated principles and annotator preferences.
Recent work \cite{obiValueImprintTechnique2024, klingefjord2024humanvaluesalignai, findeis2024inverse} have tried to decrease the gap between principles and human preferences by obtaining a set of principles; however, further investigation focusing in more fine-grained principles that may arise in specific contexts (e.g., `\textit{Reject Conspiracy Theories}') is needed.

\noindent \textbf{Principle Prioritization.} Figure \ref{fig:priority-pku} shows the principle prioritization for different annotators in the PKU dataset (refer to Fig. ~\ref{fig:priority-hh} for the principle priorities in the HH dataset). The fine-tuned reward models mirror human annotators well.
Yet, stark differences can still be observed, e.g., Mistral RM gives the principle `\textit{support democracy}' far more priority than by the human annotator. 
The principle priority differs more for the most downloaded reward model per dataset, as these were also trained on other datasets.
As we observed in Sec. \ref{sec:results}, the LLMs fine-tuned using these reward models clearly prioritize principles differently, suggesting a poor consistency with human discretion.

\noindent \textbf{Principle Rankings.} Figures \ref{fig:ranking-hh} and \ref{fig:ranking-pku} illustrate the ranking of principles based on their priority weights. As discussed before, the trained reward models were able to closely capture the ranking of principles found in the preference dataset.

\noindent \textbf{Principle Supremacies.} Figures \ref{fig:supremacy-hh} and \ref{fig:supremacy-pku} illustrate the principle supremacies for the human annotator over the HH and PKU datasets respectively, as measured using Def. \ref{def:supremacy}, providing a detailed view of inter-principle conflicts and their resolutions. By capturing the dynamics of agreement and disagreement among principles, the principle supremacy matrix offers a clear representation of the annotator's implicit valuation of these principles in each preference dataset. Interestingly, the number of conflicts varies significantly across principle pairs. For example, `Avoid human-like identity' and `Be helpful' are one of the most conflicting pairs of principles in the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset while `Reject cruelty' and `Support democracy' never conflict.
