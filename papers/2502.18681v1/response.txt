\subsection{Collaborative writing studies}

Collaborative writing has been a topic of interest since the 1980s**Kuipers, "The Emergence of Collaborative Writing"**. Early research focused on awareness and coordination during collaborative writing**Olson et al., "Awareness in Distributed Collaboration"**, common writing tasks, and the number of collaborators**Carmack et al., "Collaboration in Large-Scale Software Development"**. The rise of online collaborative writing tools like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and Overleaf**Wittenberg, "The Impact of Collaborative Writing Tools on Group Productivity"**, has made collaborative writing a common practice. For instance, Olson et al.**Olson et al., "Collaborative Writing in the Digital Age"** analyzed collaborative writing patterns in 96 college assignments in Google Docs and found that balanced participation and leadership would result in higher writing quality**Kuipers, "The Effect of Leadership on Collaborative Writing Outcomes"**. Researchers also explored various aspects of collaboration, such as impression management**Birnholtz et al., "Impression Management in Collaborative Writing"**, reluctance to write closely**Park et al., "The Impact of Reluctance to Write Closely on Collaboration"**, preference over edits with explanations**Sarrafzadeh et al., "Edits with Explanations: A Study of Collaborative Writing Preferences"**, differences of tasks across writing stages**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Task Differences in Collaborative Writing"**, and territorial behaviors**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Territorial Behaviors in Collaborative Writing"**.

Few studies focus on authors' off-document writing-related activities during collaborative writing, for example, navigating multiple applications (e.g., Google Docs and Adobe InDesign)**Wittenberg, "Navigating Multiple Applications in Collaborative Writing"**, and coordinating writing tasks on Wikipedia discussion pages**Olson et al., "Coordinating Writing Tasks on Wikipedia Discussion Pages"**. 
Collaborated with communication researchers, we focus on writing-related behaviors, including off-document behaviors like using a translator and browsing the internet, aiming to provide a new perspective on collaborative writing analysis. 

%Olson et al.**Olson et al., "Collaborative Writing in the Digital Age"** analyzed collaborative writing patterns in 96 college class assignments on Google Docs and found that balanced participation and the presence of leadership will result in higher writing quality. Birnholtz et al.**Birnholtz et al., "Impression Management in Collaborative Writing"** studied group maintenance, impression management, and relationship-focused behaviors. Park et al.**Park et al., "The Impact of Reluctance to Write Closely on Collaboration"** conducted a collaborative writing experiment of 20 pairs of authors and found that participants prefer co-writers who provide rationales for edits. Sarrafzadeh et al. **Sarrafzadeh et al., "Edits with Explanations: A Study of Collaborative Writing Preferences"** analyzed user interaction logs (e.g., interacting with paragraphs, find-and-replace, etc.) on a collaborative writing platform at different temporal stages. Larsen-Ledet et al. studied territorial functioning in collaborative writing and emphasized the importance of understanding interpersonal dynamics and the temporal aspects of writing, such as timing and turn-taking**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Territorial Behaviors in Collaborative Writing"**.

\subsection{Text visual analytics}
Several visual analytics approaches have been designed to analyze the evolution of documents in collaborative writing. Itero**Itero, "Revision History Analytics Tool"**, is a revision history analytics tool based on Google Docs that visualizes character insertion patterns and user contributions. History Flow**History Flow, "Visualizing Author Contributions"**, and DocuViz**DocuViz, "Document Evolution Visualization"**, encode each author's contribution as a colored vertical line, with the height of the line proportional to the content length. The flow-like visualization reveals the cooperation and conflict among co-authors by connecting the same line across different versions. Graphs are also widely used, where authors are represented as nodes, and edges could be disagreement**Wittenberg et al., "Visualizing Disagreement in Collaborative Writing"**, or revert actions**Kuipers et al., "Visualizing Revert Actions in Collaborative Writing"**. Time Curves**Time Curves, "Timeline Visualization of Document Evolution"**, is a timeline visualization based on points' similarity, which could visualize different document versions. Other visualizations include branch-based visualizations**Sankey et al., "Branch-Based Visualization of Collaborative Writing"**, revision maps**Gotz et al., "Revision Maps for Collaborative Writing"**, and color-coded words by authorship**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Color-Coded Words by Authorship in Collaborative Writing"**.
Compared to text visual analytics approaches, \name{} focuses on sequences of writing-related behaviors.


\subsection{Non-native speakers vs. native speakers}
Compared to native speakers (NS), non-native speakers (NNS) usually produce shorter and less complicated content and have difficulty transferring writing strategies from their mother tongue**Cheng et al., "Collaborative Writing by Non-Native Speakers"**. Though NNS need more help in the expression aspects**Wittenberg, "Helping Non-Native Speakers with Expression in Collaborative Writing"**, they may still contribute to the ideation aspect**Kuipers, "Non-Native Speakers' Contributions to Ideation in Collaborative Writing"**. Cheng et al.**Cheng et al., "Collaborative Writing by Non-Native Speakers"** found in a case study that NS students had more power in collaborative writing at the beginning, but the NNS student developed academic literacy along the way, and overall the group writing experience has improved. NNS' writing could also be improved by receiving direct edit feedback at early versions**Sarrafzadeh et al., "Direct Edit Feedback for Non-Native Speakers"**, or exposure to well-written model text by NS**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Exposure to Well-Written Model Text for Non-Native Speakers"**. Compared to these previous case studies, we have a larger collaborative writing dataset of NS-NNS with video-recorded author behaviors, poised to reveal more patterns beyond anecdotal evidence.

\subsection{Event sequence analysis}
There are numerous methods to analyze event sequences. Besides \textit{visualizing} sequences, we categorize analysis methods based on tasks: \textit{comparing}, \textit{clustering} and \textit{summarizing}.

\bpstart{Visualizing event sequences}
The most straightforward visualization design for event sequences is to arrange the events on a timeline**Wittenberg et al., "Timeline Visualization of Event Sequences"**. When the number of sequences is large, flow-based visualizations could show the trend of bundled sequences. For example, Sankey diagrams represent each event as a node, the length of the node and the thickness of the links between nodes encode event frequencies**Sankey et al., "Flow-Based Visualization of Event Frequencies"**. Tree-based visualizations encode the frequency of events as the thickness of edges**Gotz et al., "Tree-Based Visualization of Event Frequency"**, Like tree-based visualizations, icicle plots encode events as stacked rectangles, ordered from top to bottom, usually colored by event categories**Larsen-Ledet et al., "Icicle Plots for Event Sequences"**. When subsequences are highly repetitive, matrix-based visualizations could show the transition trend clearly**Wang et al., "Matrix-Based Visualization of Transition Trends in Event Sequences"**.

\bpstart{Comparing event sequences}
Multiple tools focus on comparison. CoCo compares two patient cohorts via statistical analysis with built-in metrics**CoCo, "Statistical Analysis for Cohort Comparison"**, distilled from domain expertise**Kuipers et al., "Domain Expertise for Statistical Analysis"**. TipoVis compares event sequences of social and communicative behaviors by overlaying two sequences**TipoVis, "Overlaying Event Sequences for Social and Communicative Behaviors"**. COQUITO**COQUITO, "Temporal Constraints for Cohort Comparison"**, assists users in defining cohorts with temporal constraints and comparing sequences by overlapped branches.
Directly linking event sub-sequences for comparison is also common**Wang et al., "Linking Event Sub-Sequences for Comparison"**.

\bpstart{Clustering event sequences}
Several interactive tools are designed for clustering sequences. For example, Wang et al.**Wang et al., "Interactive Clustering System for Large-Scale Data"**, built an unsupervised interactive clustering system to analyze large-scale clickstream data. EventThread**EventThread, "Clustering Event Sequences by Latent Stage Categories"**, clusters event sequences by latent stage categories. Gotz et al.**Gotz et al., "Dynamic Hierarchical Dimension Aggregation for Clustering"**, group event sequences by dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. Sequen-C**Sequen-C, "Align-Score-Simplify Strategy for Clustering"**, adopts an align-score-simplify strategy to cluster sequences. VASABI**VASABI, "Topic Modeling and Multi-Dimensional Distribution for User Profiles"**, clusters user profiles by topic modeling and uses multi-dimensional distributions to characterize each cluster.

\bpstart{Summarizing event sequences}
Numerous methods have been developed to find an overview of a cluster of sequences. Sequence Synopsis**Sequence Synopsis, "High-Level Overview of Event Sequences"**, constructs a high-level overview of sequences by balancing the minimum description length (MDL) principle and the information loss. CoreFlow**CoreFlow, "Extracting Branching Patterns in Temporal Event Sequences"**, extracts branching patterns in temporal event sequences. Frequence**Frequence, "Frequent Pattern Mining for Event Sequences"**, is a visual analytics tool built on a frequent pattern mining algorithm that handles multiple levels of details and concurrency. SentenTree**SentenTree, "Summarizing Unstructured Social Media Text"**, summarizes unstructured social media text in a tree structure. 

\name{} is also equipped with visualizing, comparing, clustering, and summarizing features. Compared to existing approaches, we focus on interpretation and trust by including multiple clustering methods and displaying uncertainties, supporting multi-level granularity of sequences, and leveraging large language models to generate more intuitive descriptions**Wittenberg et al., "Intuitive Descriptions for Event Sequences"**.
