Swarming with fixed-wing UAVs

NMPC for UAV control

With a few exceptions [e.g., (Hamer et al., 2018; Turpin et al., 2014)], approaches to swarm control
have been surprisingly limited in their ability to reason about the dynamics of individual agents.
Typically, swarm research has sought to develop coordinated behaviors for large numbers of agents
(Preiss et al., 2017) or to solve the multi-agent collision-free path planning problem (Arul et al.,
2019). However, this has often been done with extremely simplified dynamic or even kinematic
models (Chung et al., 2018). Even in the context of aerial swarm-on-swarm combat, agents have
maintained fairly conservative flight envelopes (McGrew et al., 2010; Strickland et al., 2018).
