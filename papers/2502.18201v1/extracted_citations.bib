               theoretical framework describing what factors make
               miscommunication most likely, how emotional miscommunication
               affects organizations, and how employees can improve the accuracy

    abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-mediated communication (AIMC), tools powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to interpersonal communication. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we conducted a one-week diary and interview study to explore users’ perceptions of these tools’ ability to: 1) support interpersonal communication in the short-term, and 2) lead to potential long-term effects. Our findings indicate that participants view AIMC support favorably, citing benefits such as increased communication confidence, finding precise language to express their thoughts, and navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. However, our findings also show current limitations of AIMC tools, including verbosity, unnatural responses, and excessive emotional intensity. These shortcomings are further exacerbated by user concerns about inauthenticity and potential overreliance on the technology. We identify four key communication spaces delineated by communication stakes (high or low) and relationship dynamics (formal or informal) that differentially predict users’ attitudes toward AIMC tools. Specifically, participants report that these tools are more suitable for communicating in formal relationships than informal ones and more beneficial in high-stakes than low-stakes communication.},

The recent advent of AI-MC raises new questions about how technology may shape human communication and requires re-evaluation – and potentially expansion – of many of Computer-Mediated Communication’s (CMC) key theories, frameworks, and findings. A research agenda around AI-MC should consider the design of these technologies and the psychological, linguistic, relational, policy and ethical implications of introducing AI into human–human communication. This article aims to articulate such an agenda.}",

@article{WALTHER1992h,
abstract = {Several theories and much experimental research on relational tone in computer-mediated communication (CMC) points to the lack of nonverbal cues in this channel as a cause of impersonal and task-oriented messages. Field research in CMC often reports more positive relational behavior. This article examines the assumptions, methods, and findings of such research and suggests that negative relational effects are confined to narrow situational boundary conditions. Alternatively, it is suggested that communicators develop individuating impressions of others through accumulated CMC messages. Based upon these impressions, users may develop relationships and express multidimensional relational messages through verbal or textual cues. Predictions regarding these processes are suggested, and future research incorporating these points is urged. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage. All rights reserved.},

@article{WALTHER1994a,
abstract = {Previous research on the interpersonal tone of computer‐mediated communication shows different effects using longitudinal computer‐mediated groups than are found in research using one‐shot groups, even before the developmental aspects associated with time can accrue. One factor distinguishing these approaches is the anticipation of future interaction experienced by longitudinal groups. This research reports an experiment assessing the relative effects of anticipated future interaction and different communication media (computer‐mediated versus face‐to‐face communication) on the communication of relational intimacy and composure. Asynchronous and synchronous computer conferencing and face‐to‐face groups were examined. Results show that the assignment of long‐term versus short‐term partnerships has a larger impact on anticipated future interaction reported by computer‐mediated, rather than face‐to‐face, partners. Evidence also shows that anticipation is a more potent predictor of several relational communication dimensions than is communication condition. Implications for theory and practice are identified.
