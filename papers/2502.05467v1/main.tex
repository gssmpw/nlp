% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
% \usepackage{icml2025}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2025
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
