\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper positions LLMs as promising tutors in FLE. By leveraging LLMs, we aim to enhance inclusivity, personalization, and overall accessibility. However, potential risks—such as bias, privacy issues, and over-reliance on AI tutoring—necessitate careful oversight, which have been discussed in the paper. In particular, ensuring equitable data representation, model usage transparency, and human agency preservation remains critical. While careful integration with human expertise is essential, the potential for LLMs to revolutionize FLE is significant, paving the way for more inclusive, efficient, and engaging educational practices. We encourage continuing dialogue and interdisciplinary collaboration to responsibly integrate LLMs into educational ecosystems and mitigate potential harms.
