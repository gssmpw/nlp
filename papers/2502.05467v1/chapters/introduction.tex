% Background of foreign language education
Foreign Language Education (FLE) has long been a cornerstone of global education and a critical component of K-12 curricula, equipping students with the linguistic and cultural competencies necessary for an interconnected world. However, traditional FLE methods often fall short in addressing the diverse needs of learners~\cite{hou2020foreign}. Challenges such as limited personalization, scalability constraints, and the lack of real-time feedback are particularly pronounced in large classroom settings~\cite{ehrenberg2001class}, where individual attention is scarce, leaving many students disengaged or struggling to keep pace. Addressing these shortcomings requires innovative approaches that not only enhance the quality of instruction but also adapt to the unique learning trajectories of students~\cite{eaton2010global}.

In parallel, the advent of LLMs has opened new possibilities for transforming FLE~\cite{caines2023application}. These models, powered by large-scale pre-training, exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, making them promising candidates for roles traditionally filled by human tutors. By leveraging LLMs as AI tutors, we may overcome many of the inherent limitations of conventional teaching methods, offering scalable, interactive, and personalized learning experiences~\cite{chen2024empowering,schmucker2024ruffle}. Therefore, this position paper argues that \textbf{LLMs can be effective tutors in foreign language education, complementing human expertise and addressing key limitations of traditional methods}.

% However, the integration of LLMs into educational settings is not without challenges, including their reliance on general-purpose pre-training corpora, limited pedagogical alignment, and lack of nuanced interactivity, such as fostering motivation or providing context-sensitive feedback. These limitations highlight the need for thoughtful and evidence-based approaches to deploying LLMs in FLE.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:introduction}, FLE intersects with multiple \textit{disciplines}, each of which underscores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize this domain. From the perspective of (1) \textit{computer science}, advancements in machine learning and NLP have enabled LLMs to process and generate human-like language at an unprecedented scale; (2) \textit{linguistics}~\cite{radford2009linguistics} contributes a deeper understanding of grammar, phonetics, and semantics, allowing LLMs to generate accurate and understandable language outputs; (3) \textit{education} provides the foundation for designing effective pedagogical strategies, ensuring that LLMs can deliver personalized, engaging, and developmentally appropriate learning experiences; and finally, (4) \textit{psycholinguistics}~\cite{steinberg2013introduction} bridges the gap between language acquisition and cognitive processes, enabling LLMs to optimize learner interactions by adapting to individual needs and fostering meaningful engagement. Together, these disciplines position LLMs as uniquely capable of addressing the multifaceted challenges of foreign language education.


Moreover, FLE encompasses four \textit{core skills}: listening, speaking, reading, and writing, each of which can be significantly enhanced by LLMs. For listening, LLMs can generate diverse audio materials~\cite{ghosal2023text} and facilitate interactive voice-based exercises, helping learners improve their ability to discern pronunciation, intonation, and contextual meaning. In speaking, LLMs can simulate realistic conversations~\cite{li-etal-2024-eden}, provide pronunciation feedback, and scaffold learnersâ€™ oral communication skills through iterative practice. For reading, LLMs can curate leveled texts, generate comprehension questions~\cite{samuel-etal-2024-llms}, and engage learners in discussions that deepen their understanding of written content. Finally, in writing, LLMs can offer real-time grammar, syntax, and style feedback while assisting with idea generation and iterative revisions~\cite{stahl-etal-2024-exploring}. By addressing these core skills holistically, LLMs have the potential to deliver a comprehensive and adaptive learning experience.

Despite these opportunities, the deployment of LLMs in FLE must be approached carefully, ensuring that their integration complements rather than replaces human tutors~\cite{jeon2023large}. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}, this paper explores three critical \textit{roles of LLMs} in this context: their function as \textbf{\textit{data enhancers}} (Section \ref{sec:enhancer}) to optimize learning materials, their capacity as \textbf{\textit{task predictors}} (Section \ref{sec:predictor}) to tailor educational solutions, and their potential as \textbf{\textit{agents}} (Section \ref{sec:agent}) that deliver interactive and adaptive language instruction. By examining these roles, we aim to demonstrate how LLMs can address the limitations of traditional FLE methods while advancing our understanding of intelligent tutoring systems. Additionally, we discuss potential challenges, ethical considerations, and future directions (Section \ref{sec:challenge}) for integrating LLMs into FLE, offering a technical guideline for researchers and educators to harness their transformative potential. We also describe the paradigm shift of leveraging AI for FLE, starting from the last century, as one of our contributions in Section~\ref{sec:paradigm}.
