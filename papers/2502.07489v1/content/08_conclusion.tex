\section{Conclusion}
We introduced \Bench, the first ever IMTS forecasting benchmark.
\Bench's datasets are created with ODE models, that were defined in decades of research and published on
the Physiome Model Repository. Our experiments showed that LinODEnet and CRU are actually
better than previous evaluation on established datasets indicated. Nevertheless,
we also provided a few datasets, on which models are unable to outperform a
constant baseline model. We believe that our datasets, especially the very difficult ones,
can help to identify deficits of current architectures and support future research on
IMTS forecasting.
