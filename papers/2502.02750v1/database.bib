abstract = {As Linux runs an increasing variety of workloads, its in-kernel readahead algorithm has been challenged by many unexpected and subtle problems. To name a few: readahead thrashings arise when readahead pages are evicted prematurely under memory pressure; readahead attempts on already cached pages are undesirable; interrupted-then-retried reads and locally disordered NFS reads that can easily fool the sequential detection logic. In this paper, we present a new Linux readahead framework with flexible and robust heuristics that can cover varied sequential I/O patterns. It also enjoys great simplicity by handling most abnormal cases in an implicit way. We demonstrate its advantages by a host of case studies. Network throughput is 3 times better in the case of thrashing and 1.8 times better for large NFS files. On serving large files with lighttpd, the disk utilization is decreased by 26\% while providing 17\% more network throughput.},

The design of WiscKey is highly SSD optimized, leveraging both the sequential and random performance characteristics of the device. We demonstrate the advantages of WiscKey with both microbenchmarks and YCSB workloads. Microbenchmark results show that WiscKey is 2.5 \texttimes{} to 111 \texttimes{} faster than LevelDB for loading a database (with significantly better tail latencies) and 1.6 \texttimes{} to 14 \texttimes{} faster for random lookups. WiscKey is faster than both LevelDB and RocksDB in all six YCSB workloads.},
