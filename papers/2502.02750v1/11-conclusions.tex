\section{Conclusion}

This work explores the design of a new eBPF framework to implement custom eviction policies in the kernel, enabling applications to choose a policy according to their needs and making the latest caching research accessible to the kernel. We believe there are significant future research challenges in this area, such as exploring ML-based eviction algorithms and integrating more parts of the page cache into the \name framework (\eg writeback and prefetching). Furthermore, we are aware of efforts in the eBPF verifier to support more complex data structures and believe that \name could benefit from these efforts.
