\section{Challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}

There are several challenges in allowing applications to customize the page cache using eBPF. We describe them below.

\begin{denseenum}
\item \textbf{Scalability.} Modern SSDs support millions of IOPS~\cite{solidigm-specs,western-digital-nvme-specs}, requiring the page cache to efficiently handle millions of events a second. Any changes to the page cache in order to enable custom policies must incur a low overhead, and the policies themselves must also be efficient.


\item \textbf{Flexibility.} Researchers have proposed many different caching algorithms for different use cases. These algorithms often require custom data structures. Any interface for custom policies must be flexible enough to accommodate the diversity of existing caching algorithms.

\item \textbf{Isolation and sharing.} The page cache is shared by many applications. Therefore, we must avoid a situation where one application's policy interferes with those of other applications, while still allowing applications to benefit from the shared nature of the page cache.

\item \textbf{Memory safety.} Custom eviction policies return page references to the kernel to indicate which pages to evict. This must not lead to unsafe memory references. %
