\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces the first data overvaluation attack in CML scenarios.
We characterized the subclass of linear and BIC data valuation metrics that can resist this attack and selected Truth-Shapley from the subclass as a promising solution to truthful data valuation. 
Through both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrated the vulnerability of existing linear data valuation metrics to data overvaluation and the robustness and effectiveness of Truth-Shapley. 
In addition to the research opportunities discussed in Section \ref{sec:discuss}, there remains substantial room for further exploration in data overvaluation and truthful data valuation.
Potential directions include developing new data overvaluation strategies, designing tailored algorithms for implementing data overvaluation in specific CML scenarios, and constructing defense mechanisms compatible with those vulnerable data valuation metrics.
