\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed a Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, \textit{{MedGNN}}, 
% a novel Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning (MedGNN) framework
% Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Adaptive Graph Learning (MSAGL) framework 
for medical time series classification. We have constructed multi-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale embeddings. Based on the graph structure, we have proposed two types of networks, i.e., Difference Attention Networks and Frequency Convolution Networks, to address the baseline wander problem in medical time series and learn the multi-perspective information for temporal modeling. We have also adapted Multi-resolution Graph Transformer for the dynamic spatial learning and information fusion. Extensive experiments have shown the superiority of our methods in different settings. We hope this could facilitate more future works on medical time series and healthcare applications.
