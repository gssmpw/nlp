\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.0391in}
In this work, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model with a general understanding of molecular features across structural, chemical, and biological features. To this end, we present a large instruction dataset by conceptualizing the core data types for molecular understanding including detailed structural descriptions, structure-to-feature relationship explanations, and comprehensive conversations, to cover the fundamental features from structural features to chemical and biological features. Further, we propose the blending module to fully capture the structural information from different encoder types to enhance the understanding of structures and advanced properties. Experimentally, we show that Mol-LLaMA is capable of predicting molecular features accurately and providing informative and helpful responses, implying its utility as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis. We hope that our work can be utilized to solve scientific problems based on its capability.
