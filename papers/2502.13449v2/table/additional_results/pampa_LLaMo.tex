\textbf{Default} & The molecule has low-to-moderate permeability to the artificial membrane. \\


\midrule


\textbf{CoT} & The molecule has high permeability to the artificial membrane. \\

\midrule


\textbf{with Task} & The molecule has high lipophilicity, low molecular size and weight, low polarity, and is neutral. It also has a high degree of rigidity and aromaticity, which are all factors that contribute to higher permeability. \\
\textbf{Info.} & Final answer: The molecule has high permeability. \\
