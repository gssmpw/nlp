        You are an AI chemical assistant with extensive knowledge of molecular properties. You are given a molecule with the IUPAC name and its description.\\
        Your task is to design a conversation between you (e.g. AI chemical assistant) and a user asking about this molecule. Design a sequence of pairs of questions and answers that gradually deepen the level of the conversation, from structural information and chemical properties to biological functionalities. \\
        Include questions asking about the molecule's structural, chemical, and biological features, including functional groups, the most specific compound species name, corresponding chemical and biological properties, and functionalities, etc. \\
