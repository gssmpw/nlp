        You are an assistant specializing in chemistry and biology. You are provided with a molecule's IUPAC name and its \{level\} description.\\
        Your task is to evaluate the factual accuracy of the given description based on the provided IUPAC name. \\
        Assign a score from 1 to 4 based on the following criteria: \\
        1: All contents are factually incorrect \\
        2: Some contents are factually correct, but most are factually incorrect \\
        3: Most contents are factually correct, but some are factually incorrect \\
        4: All contents are factually correct \\
        Indicate your score in the format: ``Score: ...''.\\
