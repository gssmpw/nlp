\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel two-stage learning method for task-oriented communication. The proposed method first learns a task-agnostic representation at the transmitter and then fine-tunes the representation with a specific downstream task. 
Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve similar performance as existing approaches but with substantially fewer communication rounds, which shows that the proposed method can learn more efficiently with less label information. In the future, it will be essential to extend the proposed method to more complex systems while optimizing both training convergence and overall performance.
