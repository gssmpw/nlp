\paragraph{System message: utilization and evaluation.}
A system message is a unique component of LLMs to initiate a conversation with them.
It is utilized by many proprietary models (e.g.,  ChatGPT~\citep{openai2023b} and Claude~\citep{anthropic2024}) as well as open-source models (e.g.,  Mistral~\citep{alkhamissi2024investigating}, LLaMA~\citep{meta2024introducing}, Qwen~\citep{yang2025qwen2}, and DeepSeek~\citep{guo2025deepseek}).
The system messages serve the purpose of steering the LLM's generation behavior and are widely used for various functions, including imprinting the model's identity, recording the knowledge cut-off date of the training data, and providing guidelines for various tool usages~\citep{openai2024function, cohere2024, prompthub2025}.
Additionally, the system messages are used to guide the model in generating safe and harmless responses~\citep{touvron2023llama, lu2024sofa, wallace2404instruction}.

Despite the usefulness of system messages, there is a significant lack of data that includes system messages reflecting diverse user instructions without license constraints.
Furthermore, manually labeling such data requires substantial human resources and even among publicly available datasets, it is challenging to obtain data that includes various system messages~\citep{lin2024baichuan, xu2024magpie}.
\citet{lee2024aligning} provide data augmentation which reflects hierarchical dimensions of system role data with multiple aspects of evaluation benchmark.
Furthermore, \citet{qin2024sysbench} provide multi-turn benchmark to evaluate system message alignment.
In line of these works, our \textsc{SysGen} pipeline  ensures high-quality system messages and assistant responses by supplementing data using only open-source models without licensing concerns.
Furthermore, it demonstrates that data augmentation is possible on existing SFT datasets without requiring extensive human labeling efforts.
