\section{Conclusion}
In our study, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{SysGen}}, a novel pipeline to generate system messages with better aligned assistant responses from an existing SFT datasets without system messages.
Using the \textsc{SysGen} data, new assistant responses maintain lexical and semantic consistency with the original responses while aligning more closely with user instructions.
Our experiments reveal that various open-source models trained on \textsc{SysGen} data perform better on the Multifacet dataset while maintaining minimal performance degradation on unseen benchmarks, Open LLM Leaderboard 2.
Our analysis demonstrates that diverse system messages improve the LLMs' abilities to adapt to different user instructions.
Additionally, we emphasize the importance of clearly distinguishing between the system and user roles.
