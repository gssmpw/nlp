\begin{abstract}
The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This work investigates the vulnerabilities of ALMs to stealthy, universal, and robust audio jailbreaks, revealing critical weaknesses in their alignment mechanisms. Our findings highlight potential risks associated with adversarial manipulations in multimodal AI systems, particularly in applications that rely on voice-based interactions, such as virtual assistants, security authentication, and automated decision-making systems.

From an ethical perspective, our research underscores the need for stronger defenses against adversarial attacks in the audio domain, as such exploits could lead to the dissemination of harmful content, security breaches, or manipulation of AI-driven services. However, our study is intended to advance the field of AI safety by providing insights into how ALMs process adversarial inputs, thereby informing the development of more robust mitigation strategies.

While our work exposes risks, it also contributes to the responsible deployment of AI by emphasizing the necessity of improved security measures, including better adversarial training and anomaly detection techniques for audio inputs. We encourage further research on defenses that preserve the integrity of AI safety mechanisms across multimodal interactions.
