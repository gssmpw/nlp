\section{Results}

We run $178$ individual experiments, each optimizing an audio jailbreak and evaluating according to the procedure described in~\Cref{section:eval}. We are able to show that we can craft effective audio jailbreaks using the few-shot optimization corpus method, which exhibit a similar attack efficacy (albeit on a broader and different evaluation set) to visual jailbreaks generated by the same method \cite{qi2023visualadversarialexamplesjailbreak}. We report our most interesting observations below.

\fakeparagraph{Jailbreaks optimized on a few-shot corpus work, remain effective under stealth constraints, and can generalize across seemingly arbitrary dimensions} \ul{Our audio jailbreaks evoke toxic content on the target task and other types of misalignment without sacrificing output quality on logical reasoning}. We plot the correlation between Attack Success Rate (ASR) on the reduced evaluation set and the logic performance of the model when fed the same audio jailbreak in~\Cref{fig:asr-vs-logic}. Our jailbreaks $x$ generally hold the property that $toxic(f(x, \text{toxic prompt})) = 1$, but $logic(f(x))$ is close to 100\%. This is shown by the poor correlation between ASR and logic performance, with an R2 score of 0.12, and in~\Cref{fig:epochs}, where the logical performance stays highly consistent while the ASR and average toxicity increase over the course of the optimization steps. Indeed, we see in~\Cref{fig:transferability} that we achieve up to 65\% ASR on the specific target task from our few-shot optimization, and more powerfully, a considerable ASR on other misalignment tasks, showing generalization across a broad notion of ``toxicity".

\ul{It is possible to make an effective, stealthy audio jailbreak, and stronger stealth constraints do not appear to generally worsen the effect of the jailbreak.} As shown in \cref{fig:stealth}, even with different ways of concealing the added noise, the jailbreak is effective, and we see up to a 55\% ASR with an imperceptible perturbation. For the epsilon constraint, for example, the added noise cannot be heard at $\epsilon \leq 0.001$. It appears that certain base audios are more receptive to this type of optimization: \textit{mountain} and \textit{duck} consistently show higher ASRs. The $\epsilon$ approach yields the most toxic results, with an average ASR of 17.7\%; frequency masking gives 14\% and prepend snippet gives 15.4\%. Across all three stealth approaches, we do not notice a correlation between the harshness of the stealth constraint and the resulting ASR. In fact for the $\epsilon$ and prepend approaches, the most potent attack is produced under the strictest condition. This implies that (at 16000Hz) there is still enough leeway for the provocative signal to be encoded under such constraints.

\ul{It is also possible to generate a base-audio-agnostic adversarial prepend snippet}. We optimize a 1s prepend snippet on each subset of four audios and evaluate it as a prepend to the held out fifth audio. We also optimize on all five audios and evaluate the snippet on its own. We observe in \cref{tab:multi-audio} that this works very well, with the universally optimized prefix achieving an average 28.3\% ASR on the holdout. Interestingly, the plain universal snippet (tested without suffix) is the most effective, with an ASR of 40\%. Thus the jailbreak signal is able to generalize across base audio files as well. Finally, \ul{it is possible to evoke toxic output from benign prompts using a universal jailbreak.} The universal optimization drives loss down further than any of the individually optimized audios, indicating that a multi-audio optimization permits for a more effective capture of the notion of toxicity (\cref{fig:universal_jailbreak}). This snippet invokes highly toxic output even from 14/24 completely benign prompts, including no textual prompt, prompts in other languages, and audio question answering. This is highly relevant to Scenario 2 in~\Cref{section:threat}.

\fakeparagraph{Meaningful interpretations of audio jailbreaks exhibit striking characteristics} \ul{The model perceives unintelligble adversarial noise as speech}. This is confirmed simply through the availability of coherent Whisper transcriptions and also through the observation that the top BEATs labels always come to include ``Speech" over the course of the optimization (\Cref{fig:epochs,apx:epochs-additional,fig:universal_jailbreak}). This suggests that conditioning the model into toxicity through linguistic communication is more effective than, for instance, converting the audio into sounds that might be interpreted as gunshots, shouting, or other violent or negative noises.

\ul{The jailbreak often assumes a first-person voice}. Many of the Whisper transcriptions begin with `I' or even include a personal opinion (``I'm a bigot man!" in~\Cref{fig:epochs} (left) or ``I'm not going to be mad at the people of humanity for killing each other" in~\Cref{fig:universal_jailbreak}). This implies that the jailbreak creates a toxic/bad persona to guide the subsequent output, which frequently speaks with vulgar/explicit/sinister language. \ul{The toxicity of the Whisper transcription affects ASR.} We notice at certain points in the optimization (\Cref{fig:duck-by-epoch},~\Cref{fig:gunshots-by-epoch}) that spikes in attack success rate and average output toxicity coincides with particularly unpleasant language in the Whisper transcription. This kind of language is directly associated with the jailbreak objective we are measuring in the output evaluation.

\ul{However, a jailbreak can be effective despite inconspicuous transcription features.} In the unconstrained case, we notice that the transcription of the audio exhibits toxic/noteworthy characteristics. Conversely, the stealthy jailbreaks derived from each of the base audios show consistent and correct Whisper transcriptions and Beats features throughout the optimization process - that is, the remain the same as pre-optimization - despite the resulting jailbreak showing anywhere in the range of 7-40\% ASR. This reveals that the danger of the jailbreak does not depend \textit{only} on transcription/classification characteristics discussed previously, such as hidden first-person toxic speech.

% \ul{The Whisper transcription often becomes `stuck' in repetition.} Since many of the transcriptions repeatedly produce the same sentence, we infer that the jailbreak content itself repeats at a certain frequency—one too high for the sentence to be clearly audible. Interestingly, the jailbreak that exhibits this behavior the least is the universally optimized prepend snippet (\Cref{fig:universal_jailbreak}), which features more diverse and obscure sentences. We believe this is because the jailbreak must account for a broader range of frequencies, as it is optimized across multiple audio inputs simultaneously.

\fakeparagraph{Jailbreak success is hindered by signal degradation and accompanying prompts}
\ul{Audio quality and filtering can significantly reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR).} As shown in \cref{apx:robustnessresults}, over-the-air recording is the most damaging form of degradation, causing the largest average drop in ASR. However, many jailbreaks still maintain a considerable ASR, demonstrating their resilience.
\ul{ASR does not increase substantially with more epochs, but average toxicity does.} Across the base audios, we observe that while more epochs generally lead to a gradual improvement in ASR, this increase is modest compared to the sharp rise in average toxicity throughout optimization (particularly evident in~\Cref{fig:epochs} (left) and \Cref{fig:duck-by-epoch}). This suggests that although jailbroken prompts produce increasingly toxic and vulgar outputs, some prompts remain resistant even to highly optimized jailbreak audios.

\fakeparagraph{Characteristics of the base audio that influence the optimization process include frequency structures and original loss on the target corpus} \ul{The optimization process relies on frequency structures in the base audio, which influence the characteristics of the jailbreak}. It is significantly more effective to initialize random noise than silence (zero-signal): \Cref{fig:silencevsrandom} shows that even over 1000 epochs, starting with silence as a base audio is conspicuously ineffective, with the jailbreak never reaching over 10\% ASR, whereas initializing with random noise achieves over 30\% ASR. This indicates that the formation of a jailbreak might require some initial structure to exploit and perturb into a negative meaning; indeed the meaningfulness logging reveals that the transcription of the silence optimization remains ``you" throughout the 1000 epochs and the loss doesn't sink, whereas the random noise transcription tends to repetitive but increasingly negative, biased content.

\ul{There is some correlation between the original loss of the base audio file and its suitability to stealth constraints.} There is some grounds to believe that the original loss of the audio plays a role in e.g. how well it reacts to stealth constraints, \Cref{fig:stealth} shows that in general base audios with a lower original loss are more performant under stealth constraints, likely because the required perturbation to provoke toxicity is of a lower magnitude. However, the general effectiveness or transferability does not seem to correlate with length, content, original loss, or any other characteristics of the base audios. 

\ul{Notably, plain random noise achieves 8\% ASR as a jailbreak} \cref{fig:asr-vs-logic} shows a randomly initialized signal, not optimized with any steps of gradient descent, seems to be occasionally sufficient to confuse the model into ignoring its alignment. 

% \fakeparagraph{Audio quality and filtering can severely limit the Attack Success Rate} We see in \cref{apx:robustnessresults} that over-the-air recording is the most erosive form of degradation with the highest average decrease in ASR. However, many of the jailbreaks still have a significant ASR, and are thus still effective.
