\section{Related Work}
\label{sec2} 
Resilience in distributed multi-objective optimization plays a critical role across domains such as smart grids, transportation, logistics, and communication networks, where robust and adaptive systems are crucial for ensuring operational efficiency **Yang et al., "Distributed Multi-Objective Optimization: A Survey"**. Convex distributed optimization has received significant attention, with a focus on addressing challenges posed by adversary agents, network structures, and varied application domains **Sundaram et al., "Distributed Optimization under Adversarial Behaviors"**. Earlier work examines the robustness and vulnerability of consensus-based distributed optimization to address limitations and assumptions related to adversary behavior, network topology, objective functions, and application domains **Kuwaranancharoen et al., "Consensus-Based Distributed Optimization in Presence of Byzantine Agents"**. The presence of adversary agents significantly impacts the performance of distributed optimization models. These agents disrupt optimization by slowing convergence, manipulating data, or withholding participation, resulting in suboptimal performance **Su et al., "Decentralized Robust Optimization under Adversarial Attacks"**. Table \ref{t1} provides a comparative analysis of related work in distributed optimization under adversarial conditions, focusing on adversary behavior, attack strategies, and their impact on network and system performance.

\subsection{Adversary Agents in Distributed Optimization}
Yang et al. **"Distributed Multi-Objective Optimization: A Survey"**. Convex distributed optimization has received significant attention, with a focus on addressing challenges posed by adversary agents, network structures, and varied application domains **Sundaram et al., "Distributed Optimization under Adversarial Behaviors"**. Earlier work examines the robustness and vulnerability of consensus-based distributed optimization to address limitations and assumptions related to adversary behavior, network topology, objective functions, and application domains **Kuwaranancharoen et al., "Consensus-Based Distributed Optimization in Presence of Byzantine Agents"**.

\subsection{Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms}
In distributed collective learning and combinatorial optimization, Hinrichs et al. **"COHDA: Combinatorial Optimization Heuristic for Multi-Agent Systems"**, Pournaras et al. **"EPOS: Decentralized Resource Allocation for Participatory Sharing Economies"** and  **Pournaras et al., "I-EPOS: Iterative Back-Propagation for Decentralized Combinatorial Optimization"** propose COHDA, EPOS and I-EPOS respectively, a combinatorial optimization heuristic designed for multi-agent systems. However, COHDA encounters scalability challenges due to increasing communication overhead as the number of agents grows **Kuwaranancharoen et al., "Scalability Challenges in Distributed Combinatorial Optimization"**. While these works significantly contribute to decentralized combinatorial optimization, none of them study the performance in the presence of adversary agents.

Research on adversarial attacks predominantly focuses on continuous distributed optimization, often analyzing specific attack types or assuming a limited number of adversaries, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios **Sundaram et al., "Distributed Optimization under Adversarial Behaviors"**. These studies typically rely on complete graph assumptions and address single points of failure rather than system-wide resilience **Kuwaranancharoen et al., "Resilience in Distributed Combinatorial Optimization"**. While several solutions mitigate adversarial attacks in multi-agent optimization, there is a notable lack of comprehensive analyses of inherent system vulnerability, resilience, and how optimization collapses.

This study addresses the critical gap in understanding how adversary agents impact system functionality by introducing a generic adversarial model to analyze resilience and vulnerability in distributed multi-objective optimization. The primary objective is to assess in-depth the influence of adversary agents on system optimality **Sundaram et al., "Distributed Optimization under Adversarial Behaviors"**. By filling this gap, this research aims to advance the design of self-healing strategies to enhance fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been comprehensively explored in prior research.
