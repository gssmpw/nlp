\subsection{Adversary Agents in Distributed Optimization}
Yang et al. ____ provide a comprehensive survey on distributed optimization. Notable advancements include extensions of consensus-based protocols by Sundaram et al. ____ and Kuwaranancharoen et al. ____, which address adversarial threats in convex optimization. Su et al. ____ enhance these methods with decentralized architectures and explore adversarial influence on global objectives. However, these approaches assume adversary agents have full knowledge of the network topology and the private functions of all agents. This coordination among adversaries compromises the privacy of the agents in the system.

\subsection{Adversarial Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems}
Adversarial attacks significantly impact reinforcement learning (RL) systems across applications such as robotics, video games, and smart grids, undermining system stability and performance ____. Lin et al. ____ demonstrate how adversarial perturbations affect cooperative multi-agent RL (c-MARL), showing its vulnerability compared to single-agent RL. Figura et al. ____ highlight how a single adversary can influence consensus-based c-MARL systems, disrupting team objectives. Zheng et al. ____ introduce criticality-based perturbations in deep Q-networks, demonstrating substantial performance degradation due to adversarial attacks. These studies highlight that an adversary agent has the ability not only to disrupt system operations but also to manipulate the policy to align with its own adversarial objectives, thereby influencing other agents to adopt a policy of its preference. These insights underscore the critical need for robust defense against adversaries that manipulate policies and system states in RL systems.

\subsection{Cyber-Attacks and Resilient Control}
Cyber-attacks, including data injection and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, pose significant threats to distributed optimization by disrupting system operations and consensus mechanisms ____. To address these challenges, Yemini et al. ____ introduce trust-based frameworks that mitigate malicious input, ensuring convergence to global optima. Similarly, Du et al. ____ and Zhao et al. ____ propose models relying on trusted agents to counteract adversarial influence. However, the effectiveness of these can be limited in scenarios with intermittent communication, such as ad hoc or robotic networks.

\subsection{Resource Allocation Challenges Under Adversaries}
In resource allocation, adversarial disruptions are mitigated using robust optimization algorithms. Uribe et al. ____ and Turan et al. ____ propose primal-dual methods to tolerate adversaries by identifying and eliminating Byzantine inputs. Similarly, Ravi et al. ____ and Gentz et al. ____ focus on adversary detection, using statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to isolate malicious agents. These methods achieve resilience for up to 50\% adversary density. However, they assume adversarial influence is evenly distributed and may not generalize to more concentrated or dynamic adversarial settings.
 
Another approach focuses on devising an adversary detection model to identify malicious agents in distributed optimization systems ____. Ravi et al. ____ address the challenge of detecting and mitigating malicious inputs in a distributed optimization system. Their method focuses on utilizing the data values of the agents to identify and isolate potential malicious agents. The researchers impose an upper limit on the number of tolerable malicious agents, specifically setting it at half of the total number of agents in the network topology. On the other hand, Gentz et al. propose a detection method for insider attackers in randomized gossip-based sensor networks. This approach involves utilizing theory and hypothesis testing to analyze the statistical states of the sensors, enabling the detection of malicious agents within the network ____.

\subsection{Privacy-Preserving Distributed Optimization}
Privacy-preserving distributed optimization safeguards sensitive agent information against eavesdropping adversaries using techniques such as differential privacy ____, homomorphic cryptography ____, and gradient perturbation ____, to ensure secure information exchange. However, these studies focus on privacy protection rather than adversarial behavior in optimization contexts.

\subsection{Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms}
In distributed collective learning and combinatorial optimization, Hinrichs et al. ____ propose COHDA, a combinatorial optimization heuristic designed for multi-agent systems. However, COHDA encounters scalability challenges due to increasing communication overhead as the number of agents grows. Pournaras et al. ____ address this with EPOS,
a decentralized framework that enables agents to collaboratively optimize global resource allocation, particularly in participatory sharing economies. EPOS ensures privacy, autonomy, and scalability but encounters computational limitations when applied to wide tree structures with multiple child nodes ____. I-EPOS extends EPOS by introducing decentralized iterative back-propagation and localized decision-making to enhance scalability ____. While these works significantly contribute to decentralized combinatorial optimization, none of them study the performance in the presence of adversary agents.

Research on adversarial attacks predominantly focuses on continuous distributed optimization, often analyzing specific attack types or assuming a limited number of adversaries, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. These studies typically rely on complete graph assumptions and address single points of failure rather than system-wide resilience. While several solutions mitigate adversarial attacks in multi-agent optimization, there is a notable lack of comprehensive analyses of inherent system vulnerability, resilience, and how optimization collapses.

This study addresses the critical gap in understanding how adversary agents impact system functionality by introducing a generic adversarial model to analyze resilience and vulnerability in distributed multi-objective optimization. The primary objective is to assess in-depth the influence of adversary agents on system optimality. By filling this gap, this research aims to advance the design of self-healing strategies to enhance fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been comprehensively explored in prior research.
