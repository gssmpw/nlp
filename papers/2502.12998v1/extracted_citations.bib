abstract = {The impressive accuracy of deep neural networks (DNNs) has created great demands on practical analytics over video data. Although efficient and accurate, the latest video analytic systems have not supported analytics beyond selection and aggregation queries. In data analytics, Top-K is a very important analytical operation that enables analysts to focus on the most important entities. In this paper, we present Everest, the first system that supports efficient and accurate Top-K video analytics. Everest ranks and identifies the most interesting frames/moments from videos with probabilistic guarantees. Everest is a system built with a careful synthesis of deep computer vision models, uncertain data management, and Top-K query processing. Evaluations on real-world videos and the latest Visual Road benchmark show that Everest achieves between 14.3x to 20.6x higher efficiency than baseline approaches with high result accuracy.},

abstract = {We consider accelerating machine learning (ML) inference queries on unstructured datasets. Expensive operators such as feature extractors and classifiers are deployed as user-defined functions (UDFs), which are not penetrable with classic query optimization techniques such as predicate push-down. Recent optimization schemes (e.g., Probabilistic Predicates or PP) assume independence among the query predicates, build a proxy model for each predicate offline, and rewrite a new query by injecting these cheap proxy models in the front of the expensive ML UDFs. In such a manner, unlikely inputs that do not satisfy query predicates are filtered early to bypass the ML UDFs. We show that enforcing the independence assumption in this context may result in sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we propose CORE, a query optimizer that better exploits the predicate correlations and accelerates ML inference queries. Our solution builds the proxy models online for a new query and leverages a branch-and-bound search process to reduce the building costs. Results on three real-world text, image and video datasets show that CORE improves the query throughput by up to 63\% compared to PP and up to 80\% compared to running the queries as it is.},

abstract = {We present Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: a fully managed system that provides an automatic machine learning solution. Given a tabular dataset and the target column name, Autopilot identifies the problem type, analyzes the data and produces a diverse set of complete ML pipelines, which are tuned to generate a leaderboard of candidate models that the customer can choose from. The diversity allows users to balance between different needs such as model accuracy vs. latency. By exposing not only the final models but the way they are trained, meaning the pipelines, we allow to customize the generated training pipeline, thus catering the need of users with different levels of expertise. This trait is crucial for users and is the main novelty of Autopilot; it provides a solution that on one hand is not fully black-box and can be further worked on, while on the other hand is not a do it yourself solution, requiring expertise in all aspects of machine learning. This paper describes the different components in the eco-system of Autopilot, emphasizing the infrastructure choices that allow scalability, high quality models, editable ML pipelines, consumption of artifacts of offline meta-learning, and a convenient integration with the entire SageMaker system allowing these trained models to be used in a production setting.},
