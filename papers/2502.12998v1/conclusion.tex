\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
We presented the novel problem of computing personalized top-$k$ sets with user-defined set-based scoring functions when the function constructs are computed with expensive oracle calls. This problem is ubiquitous in applications where scoring requires access to multimodal entities such as pictures and audio. Computing scores of those entities requires calling oracles such as LLMs. We believe our work to be the first to examine the question of reducing the computation cost of score constructs for set-based scoring functions when invoking expert oracles.

Our framework aims to reduce the number of oracle calls necessary to compute the exact top-$k$ set. It relies on four tasks that compute score bounds of candidate sets and a probabilistic model that takes into account interdependency between those sets. The framework determines the next best question to ask an LLM to complete scores and handles score uncertainty obtained from LLMs. We make principled contributions in designing solution for each of these tasks.

Our extensive experiments on a large corpora of entities representing hotels and their modalities, demonstrate that our framework is able to compute exact top-$k$ results by invoking the minimum number of calls necessary to expensive oracles. This work opens many new directions that we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ext}.
