%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {In this paper, we revisit a suite of popular proximity problems (such as, KNN, clustering, minimum spanning tree) that repeatedly perform distance computations to compare distances during their execution. Our effort here is to design principled solutions to minimize distance computations for such problems in general metric spaces, especially for the scenarios where calling an expensive oracle to resolve unknown distances are the dominant cost of the algorithms for these problems. We present a suite of techniques, including a novel formulation of the problem, that studies how distance comparisons between objects could be modelled as a system of linear inequalities that assists in saving distance computations, multiple graph based solutions, as well as a practitioners guide to adopt our solution frameworks to proximity problems. We compare our designed solutions conceptually and empirically with respect to a broad range of existing works. We finally present a comprehensive set of experimental results using multiple large scale real-world datasets and a suite of popular proximity algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

abstract = {We consider accelerating machine learning (ML) inference queries on unstructured datasets. Expensive operators such as feature extractors and classifiers are deployed as user-defined functions (UDFs), which are not penetrable with classic query optimization techniques such as predicate push-down. Recent optimization schemes (e.g., Probabilistic Predicates or PP) assume independence among the query predicates, build a proxy model for each predicate offline, and rewrite a new query by injecting these cheap proxy models in the front of the expensive ML UDFs. In such a manner, unlikely inputs that do not satisfy query predicates are filtered early to bypass the ML UDFs. We show that enforcing the independence assumption in this context may result in sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we propose CORE, a query optimizer that better exploits the predicate correlations and accelerates ML inference queries. Our solution builds the proxy models online for a new query and leverages a branch-and-bound search process to reduce the building costs. Results on three real-world text, image and video datasets show that CORE improves the query throughput by up to 63\% compared to PP and up to 80\% compared to running the queries as it is.},

abstract = {The impressive accuracy of deep neural networks (DNNs) has created great demands on practical analytics over video data. Although efficient and accurate, the latest video analytic systems have not supported analytics beyond selection and aggregation queries. In data analytics, Top-K is a very important analytical operation that enables analysts to focus on the most important entities. In this paper, we present Everest, the first system that supports efficient and accurate Top-K video analytics. Everest ranks and identifies the most interesting frames/moments from videos with probabilistic guarantees. Everest is a system built with a careful synthesis of deep computer vision models, uncertain data management, and Top-K query processing. Evaluations on real-world videos and the latest Visual Road benchmark show that Everest achieves between 14.3x to 20.6x higher efficiency than baseline approaches with high result accuracy.},

abstract = {We present Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: a fully managed system that provides an automatic machine learning solution. Given a tabular dataset and the target column name, Autopilot identifies the problem type, analyzes the data and produces a diverse set of complete ML pipelines, which are tuned to generate a leaderboard of candidate models that the customer can choose from. The diversity allows users to balance between different needs such as model accuracy vs. latency. By exposing not only the final models but the way they are trained, meaning the pipelines, we allow to customize the generated training pipeline, thus catering the need of users with different levels of expertise. This trait is crucial for users and is the main novelty of Autopilot; it provides a solution that on one hand is not fully black-box and can be further worked on, while on the other hand is not a do it yourself solution, requiring expertise in all aspects of machine learning. This paper describes the different components in the eco-system of Autopilot, emphasizing the infrastructure choices that allow scalability, high quality models, editable ML pipelines, consumption of artifacts of offline meta-learning, and a convenient integration with the entire SageMaker system allowing these trained models to be used in a production setting.},

abstract="Stochastic orders enable global comparison of two distributions in terms of their characteristics. Specifically, for a given characteristic A, stochastic order says that the distribution of X has lesser (greater) A than the distribution of Y. For example, one may use hazard rate or mean residual life for such a comparison. In this chapter, we discuss various stochastic orders useful in reliability modelling and analysis.The stochastic order treated here are the usual stochastic order, hazard rate order, mean residual life order, harmonic mean residual life order, renewal and harmonic renewal mean residual life orders, variance residual life order, percentile residual life order, reversed hazard rate order, mean inactivity time order, variance inactivity time order, the total time on test transform order, the convex transform (IHR) order, star (IHRA) order, DMRL order, superadditive (NBU) order, NBUE order, NBUHR and NBUHRA orders and MTTF order. The interpretation of ageing concepts, preservation properties with reference to convolution, mixing and coherent structures are also discussed in relation to each of these orders. Implications among the different orders are also presented. Examples of the stochastic orders and counter examples where certain implications do not hold are also provided. Some special models used in reliability like proportional hazard and reverse hazard models, mean residual life models and weighted distributions have been discussed in earlier chapters. Some applications of these stochastic models are reviewed as well.",

abstract = {The interest for patient trajectory prediction, a sort of computer-aided medicine, has steadily increased with the pace of artificial intelligence innovation. Notwithstanding, the design of effective systems able to predict clinical outcomes based on the history of a patient is far from trivial. Works so far are based on neural architectures with low performance, especially when using low-cardinality datasets; alternatively, complex inference approaches are hard to reproduce and/or extrapolate as they are designed for very specific circumstances. We introduce LIG-Doctor, an artificial neural network architecture based on two Minimal Gated Recurrent Unit networks functioning in a bidirectional parallel manner, benefiting from temporal events both forward and backward. In comparison to state-of-the-art works, consistent improvements were achieved in prognosis prediction, as assessed with metrics Recall@k, Precision@k, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Besides the detailed delineation of our architecture, a sequence of experiments is reported with insights that progressively guided design decisions to inspire future works on similar problems. Our results shall contribute to the improvement of computer-aided medicine and, more generally, to processes related to the design of neural network architectures.}

Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN.

Such problems are in general unsolvable and therefore the methods are designed to maximize the probability of discovering the global minimum. One class of such methods are the so called clustering methods. In these computations are made to concentrate sampled points around the local minima so that they can be recognized by a cluster analysis technique. Using these methods multiple determination of the local minima (multiple local optimizations) can be avoided and more work spent on the global exploration thereby increasing the probability that the global minimum will be found.}
