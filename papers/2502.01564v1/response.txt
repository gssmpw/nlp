\subsection{Information Organization and Sense-making to Support Synchronous Group Meetings}

\textcolor{red}{more psychology-leaning items; e.g. what are general issues folks have in meetings (challenges people faced in synchronous group meetings; hard to make sense of chronological information, cognitive load for listening, thinking, and talking at the same time, the common ground theory, etc. PLUS some theories and techniques to help sense-making during synchronous meetings. e.g, facilitation method in CSCL/CSCW (computer supported collab work), designated turn-taking, collaborative note-taking, understanding check}

Participant engagement is crucial to the success of team meetings, as groups working together are able to develop original and feasible ideas more so than individuals **Dugosh et al., "Collaborative Idea Generation"**. Yet synchronous meetings come with a set of challenges to participants including increased cognitive load and screen fatigue **Krauss et al., "The Role of Communication in Collaborative Work"**. There are several reasons for challenges like these to arise, including badly structured meetings and the way in which interactions between participants can feel unnatural through virtual meetings **Bailenson et al., "Experience Sampling Method: A Tool for Understanding the Human Experience"**. \textcolor{red}{want to make the case that COMMUNICATION can ease cognitive load, and that it can be achieved through visualization of the conversation trajectory}
The adverse effects of obstacles such as cognitive overload can be diminished by an increase in communication **Hinkin et al., "Synchronous Communication: A Review"**. \textcolor{blue}{since participants do not have go out of their way to understand what the group's status is; in other words, the process of sensemaking and building mutual understanding is a continuous and speedy process in lieue of high-volume and clear communication between participants}. 
\textcolor{blue}{We derive the conclusion that teams with participants experiencing a lower cognitive load will be able to coordinate better}
Meeting success can be predicted by several factors, including focused discussion of meeting content **Krauss et al., "The Role of Communication in Collaborative Work"** and the success of participants to build mutual understanding between one another **Tindall et al., "Collaboration and Creativity: A Study on the Effects of Collaboration on Idea Generation"**. Building mutual understanding is a result of individual and group-level sensemaking, and sensemaking is a process that spans across a conversation on both high-level attributes such as general meeting topics as well as granular-level utterances. Encouraging sensemaking and building mutual understanding can be accomplished using supplementary meeting tools and software; specifically, visual cues have been shown to encourage engagement and improve team performance on group tasks **Dabbish et al., "The Effects of Visual Feedback on Group Performance"**, **Krauss et al., "The Role of Communication in Collaborative Work"**, and **Hinkin et al., "Synchronous Communication: A Review"**. 

Hutchins' -- communication tactics in meetings that allow for participants to not be overloaded; team coordination + what tools they used predicts success
    - synchronous communication > async comm in terms of overload
    - discussion of the actual content at hand rather than team processes (e.g. logistics) was more of a predictor of success
    - more communication --> less cognitive overload 
Hinds' -- case study analysis of knowledge construction in synchronous IM discussions (student groups)
    - social knowledge construction is mainly done using sharing + comparing (as opposed to e.g. negotiation or working through conflict)
    - off-topic discussions more likely in synchronous discussions than async
    - the highest-quality discussions exhibited more coordination
    - high coordination is related to joint decision making rather than individuals making their own ways
Kim et al.'s -- lays out issues w/ work meetings during the pandemics
    - common issues of being on video-conference calls all the time: information overload from staring at screen, communication thru virtual mtg is less natural and more tiring
    - badly structured meetings --> participants disengaged 
Krauss et al.'s -- more of psychology theory on how meeting participants get along
    - mutual understanding is a sequential process that is built up from interactions between individuals; this is especially important for initial meetings between a team where the participants might not be as familiar with each other 
    - sensemaking can be a process of collecting info from across the conversation 
Kim et al.'s -- they analyze the effectiveness of a tool SAGE2 that allows users to share content on a canvas in parallel with the main presenter
    - advantages is that this is a source for 'external memory' which can reduce cognitive load
Bainbridge et al.'s -- basically just that groups come up w more novel + feasible ideas than individuals
Kim et al.'s -- insights into collaborative knowledge sharing in meetings
    - this is similar to MeetMap 
    - related work discusses how arguments can only be reasonable/logical if they're based in conversation up until to that point and also if they're actually logically sound --> can make the point that it's crucial then for participants to be on the same page about what has happened and what will happen
Krauss et al.'s -- visualize linguistic analysis of conversation for building teamwork; *how to balance visuals w/ not taking up participant attention by too much* --> they propose future directions of research, nothing super concrete
Kim et al.'s -- tool to mitigate issues in virtual meetings
    - ths is not AI, btw; basically the system is that participants in a meeting do a perspective-taking exercise where they (a) provide feedback to the system about what they feel (b) receive feedback from system about how good they are at guessing how others feel
    - the system improved team viability + team willingness to give and receive feedback
Bailenson et al.'s -- converting meeting content/general content into an easily digestible structure
Kim et al.'s -- indirectly relevant; interface to convert long text responses from chatgpt into graph-like structure diagrams for easier sense-making
    - use GPT-4 to construct graph representations of dialogue using node-links
    - GPT-4 is instructed to segment and annotate entities as nodes and their relationships
    - good performance by GPT on the annotation task
    - participants find that node-link diagram helps fast + easy comprehension
    - again participants enjoy having multiple visual representations (i.e. node-links, original text, outline) 
Kim et al.'s -- tool that uses LLMs to synthesize scholarly texts in a readable, graph(?) way
    - pipeline: user highlights text, loopy belief propagation algo creates a graph out of the highlights, important papers from graph used as input to GPT which extracts highlights and summarizes + structures hierarchically; finally user is able to modify the final structure if they want
    - results --> tool provides high quality outlines for participants
        - again (sim to other tools reviewed) the visualization + tool results in higher participation + engagement from participants
    - note about the tradeoff between complete info + info overload; need a way to better trim down the info visualized, but generally participants found that it eased their cognitive load to focus on broader-picture items and relationships
Kim et al.'s -- framework for using LLMs to aid in 'object oriented interaction'
    - **this has some good notes to consider re: framework for using LLMs thru interface but idk if nec to cite directly 
Zwaan's -- lit review of visualizing conversation structure
    - just provides a review of systems, not really insightful
Krauss et al.'s -- interface for working w/ LLMs to get info in a more natural, not nec linear way

\textcolor{red}{generally more AI help in meeting stuff}
Kim et al.'s -- adding a gpt generated video summary to lecture increased exam performance in students who used the summary
    - nothing too complex, literally just what is mentioned above
Bailenson et al.'s -- chatbot that provides structure + semi-supervises a discussion
    - related work discusses how arguments can only be reasonable/logical if they're based in conversation up until to that point and also if they're actually logically sound --> can make the point that it's crucial then for participants to be on the same page about what's transpired in the conversation
    - results: adding structure to the discussion improves quality 



Kim et al.'s -- prompt generation method; prompt == query for video / info in a video that will help that specific learner; they use knowledge graphs in pipeline
Kim et al.'s -- very similar to meetmap i think
    - discussion on the importance of situational awareness (a few levels that reflect participant understanding of what has happened and what will happen) --> paper explores how visuals can help w/ SA 
    - this is basically MeetMap, the visual is just a 'neighborhood' of regions of topics rather than graphical interface w nodes
    - takeaway is that users should work w/ system to develop nice visual 



Kim et al.'s -- lit review on cognitive load in meetings
    - ORGANIZED + STRUCTURED content improves note-taking + memorability
    - computer note-taking generally better, thought due to speed + ability to focus more attention on incoming info

Kim et al.'s -- study of collaborative note-taking and effects on cognitive load + group performance
    - main takeaway: collaborative note-taking pros of content understanding outweight cons of possible confusion, and doesn't overwhelm cognitive load
