\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
In local differential privacy, we assume that each of $n$ users hold a data point $x$ in the discrete and ordered domain $[B]= \{1, 2, \ldots, B\}$ for a positive integer $B$.
Each user will communicate to a central (untrusted) aggregator using a differentially private mechanism. We consider sequentially adaptive protocols: In round $t$ the aggregator \emph{queries} a set $I_t\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}$ of one or more parties, asking them to run a differentially private mechanism $\mathcal{M}_t$ on their data.
The output of $\mathcal{M}_t(x_i)$ is then sent to the aggregator for each $i\in I_t$. In general, any sequentially adaptive protocol may be implemented by querying one new user over $n$ rounds\footnote{Rounds which query multiple new users may be split into many rounds, each querying one user.}. Let us label the users $1,\dots,n$ in the order in which the protocol queries them and denote the data of user $i$ by $x_i\in [B]$. Also denote the the private mechanism that user $i$ uses by $\mathcal{M}_i$ and the output $y_i=\mathcal{M}_i(x_i)$

Given the outputs $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $y_i = \calM_i(x_i)$, the data aggregator makes an estimate of the $q$th quantile with a post-processing function $\calF$:
\[
    \tm_q = \calF(y_1, \ldots, y_n).
\]
We require that each $\calM_i$ satisfy local differential privacy:
\begin{definition}\label{def:dp}
    We say $\calM_i$ satisfies $(\epsilon,\delta)$-local DP if for all $x, x' \in [B]$, and all outputs $y$, we have
    \[
        \Pr[\calM_i(x) = y] \leq e^\epsilon \Pr[\calM_i(x') = y].
    \]
    We say that $\calM_i$ satisfies $\eps$-local DP if it satisfies $(\eps,0)$-DP.
\end{definition}
%
In the adaptive setting, we allow $\calM_i$ to depend on $y_1, \ldots, y_{i-1}$; i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sequential-interaction}
y_i = \calM_i(x_i, y_1, \ldots, y_{i-1}).
\end{equation}


where each $\calM_i$ satisfies Definition~\ref{def:dp} in $x_i$ (for any fixed choice of $y_1, \ldots, y_{i-1}$). In contrast, in a \emph{non-adaptive} protocol, each $\calM_i$ is fixed in advance (and usually all $\calM_i$ are the same mechanism).

%


To measure the utility of $\tm_q$, we use the \emph{quantile error}. For a given data set $X = (x_i)_{i=1}^n$ 
define $F_X$ %
as in \autoref{eq: empirical cdf}.
%
We say $\tm_q$ is an $\alpha$-approximate quantile estimate on $X$ if
\[
    \Pr[ [F_X(\tm_q), F_X(\tm_q + 1)] \cap (q - \alpha, q + \alpha) \neq \emptyset] \geq 1-\failp,
\]
where the above probability is over the randomness in $\tm_q$.
We are typically interested in the high-probability setting, where $\failp = \frac{1}{\text{poly}(\ab)}$. 

Now, we formally define the LDP median problems in both the statistical and empirical settings:

\begin{definition}[\texttt{LDPstat-median}]\label{def:med-stat}
In \emph{\texttt{LDPstat-median}}$(\mathcal{D},n,\alpha,\eps)$, $\mathcal{D}$ is an unknown distribution over $[\ab]$. Users $1,\dots,n$ sample $x_1,\dots, x_n$ according to $\mathcal{D}$. Each user $i$ outputs $y_i=\mathcal{M}_i(x_i,y_1,\dots,y_{i-1})$ where the $\mathcal{M}_i$'s are $\eps$-LDP mechanisms. The goal is to output an $\tilde m=\tilde m(y_1,\dots, y_n)\in [\ab]$ such that $\tilde m$ is an $\alpha$-approximate median of $\mathcal{D}$.
\end{definition}
%
%
%
\begin{definition}[\texttt{LDPemp-median}]\label{def:med-emp}
In \emph{\texttt{LDPemp-median}}$(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n,\alpha,\eps)$, there are users $1,\dots, n$ (where the ordering is chosen by the protocol) with data points $(x_i)_{i=1}^n\in [\ab]^n$. User $i$ outputs $y_i=\mathcal{M}_i(x_i,y_1,\dots,y_{i-1})$ where the $\mathcal{M}_i$'s are $\eps$-LDP mechanisms. The goal is to output an $\tilde m=\tilde m(y_1,\dots, y_n)\in [\ab]$ such that $\tilde m$ is an $\alpha$-approximate empirical median of $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$.
\end{definition}

For shuffle DP, we assume that the protocol partitions the users $\{1,\dots, n\}$ into $r$ disjoint subsets $I_1,\dots, I_r$ and that each user $i\in I_t$ applies the same mechanism $\mathcal{M}_t$ to their data $x_i$ where $\mathcal{M}_t$ may be chosen adaptively based on $(\mathcal{M}_j(x_i))_{1\leq j\leq t-1,i\in I_j}$. We assume that $\pi_t:I_t\to I_t$ is a uniformly random permutation for each $t\in [r]$. Given the outputs $(y_t)_{t\in [r]}$
where,
$y_t=(\mathcal{M}_t(x_{\pi_t(i)}))_{i\in I_t}$ (in shuffled order), the data aggregator outputs
\[
    \tm_q = \calF(y_1, \dots, y_t),
\]
for a post-processing function $\calF$. We say that the protocol satisfies $(\eps,\delta)$-shuffle DP if for any $t\in [r]$, any $(x_i)_{i\in I_t},(x_i')_{i\in I_t}$ differing only in a single coordinate, and any set $S$,
\begin{align*}  &\Pr[(\mathcal{M}_t(x_{\pi_t(i)}))_{i\in I_t} \in S]
\\
\leq &e^\epsilon \Pr[(\mathcal{M}_t(x'_{\pi_t(i)}))_{i\in I_t} \in S]+\delta.
\end{align*}
    
\begin{definition}[\texttt{shuffle-emp-median}]\label{def:med-emp-shuffle}
In \emph{\texttt{shuffle-emp-median}}$(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n,\alpha,\eps,\delta,r)$, there are users $1,\dots, n$ (where the ordering is chosen by the protocol) with data points $(x_i)_{i=1}^n\in [\ab]^n$. Using an $(\eps,\delta)$-shuffle DP mechanism with $r$ rounds of adaptivity, the goal is to output an $\tilde m=\tilde m(y_1,\dots, y_r)\in [\ab]$ such that $\tilde m$ is an $\alpha$-approximate empirical median of $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$.
\end{definition}
