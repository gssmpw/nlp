\subsection{Node and Edge Details}\label{sec:graph-details}

As described in the preliminaries \autoref{sec:inter-graph}, there are three different types of nodes: user, listing, and city. There are different relationships or edges between them, as shown in \autoref{tab:edge-attr}. The most popular relationship between the user and the listing is the \code{views} relationship, since users view multiple listings before narrowing down their search by saving the listing and finally touring the listing. Between user and city, \code{searched in} relationship exists, and between city and listing \code{contains} relationship exists.

\subsection{Dataset Statistics}\label{sec:data-stats}

The dataset statistics as shown in \autoref{tab:summary} shows that the datset is divided into three segments—training (May 17–20), testing (May 27–30), and evaluation (May 31)—providing a temporal snapshot of various metrics.  The training dataset, spanning May 17th to May 20th, includes 55k listings viewed by 393k users across 449 cities, resulting in 789k \code{views}, 169k \code{saves}, and 234k \code{tours}. The \code{contains} relationship matches the number of listings since each listing must belong to a city. The testing dataset exhibits similar characteristics from May 27th to May 30th with slightly different values (53k listings and 405k users). Notably, the evaluation dataset on May 31st, while covering a similar number of cities (448), shows a smaller number of listings (45k), users (203k), saves (41k), and tours (56k) in comparison to training and testing datasets since there is a decrease in user engagement during the evaluation period which is just one day after the testing period. The \code{views} are the largest interactions since users view the listing the most, and only a few of them convert to \code{saves}, and fewer convert to \code{tours}.

\autoref{tab:node-attr} outlines the attribute schema for the different node types used in our model. The User node is characterized by a numeric session identifier. The Listing node includes a diverse set of features: numeric attributes (\eg bedrooms, bathrooms, price, etc.), boolean attributes (\eg waterfront, heating, etc.), and detailed geographic attributes (latitude and longitude for the property boundaries). Meanwhile, the City node aggregates listing data by averaging numeric, boolean, and geographic attributes and providing a population count. This structured representation supports our approach to integrating heterogeneous data for improved node representation learning in the ML framework.

\subsection{Unimportant Features}\label{sec:unimp-feat}

The unimportant features, as shown in \autoref{fig:gnn-feat3}, are identified by measuring the performance increase when the features are zeroed out, indicating that the feature was detrimental to the \pname’s predictive performance. Therefore, these are unimportant features and should be removed from the model to enhance accuracy. It is interesting to see that the numeric unimportant features are usually used to identify listing. Understandably, aggregating those listing features is not helpful to \pname when compared against city-specific features, such as population count, average year built, and geographic-based features.
