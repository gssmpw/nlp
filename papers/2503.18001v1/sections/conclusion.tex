\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduced \pnameexp, which aims to bridge a critical gap in explainable ML for recommendation systems by providing human-interpretable insights into \gnn-based recommenders to increase user confidence and customer engagement. 
% We address the important challenges of model transparency and accountability in \gnn-based recommendation systems. 
Specifically, we provide whole graph instance-level explanations for \gnn models in the context of the heterogeneous link prediction (LP) tasks. 
%\pnameexp is a novel \gnn-based explanability framework designed to enhance recommendation accuracy and interpretability.
\pnameexp offers contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations through structural and attribute perturbation. We also introduce \pname, a \gnn-based recommendation system tailored for real-world real-estate heterogeneous datasets. We use \pnameexp to explain the recommendations of \pname to show its superior explanation performance compared to the \sota \gnn-explainers by providing qualitative insights and quantitative performance.
