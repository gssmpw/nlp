\vspace{-2.5mm}
We introduce a new research direction in collaborative driving and present the first solution. Empirical results show our approach can significantly reduce data collection and development efforts, advancing safer autonomous systems. 

\nbf{Limitations and future work}
Following existing benchmarks~\citep{xu2022opv2v, xu2023v2v4real}, \ours focuses on vehicle-like objects. Future work could extend it to broader objects and static entities (\eg, traffic signs, signals) essential for real-world traffic.
