\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we tackled the problem of computing general equilibrium in dynamic stochastic economies. 
We showed that the computation of a recursive Radner equilibrium in an infinite horizon Markov exchange economy can be reduced to the computation of a generalized Markov perfect equilibrium in an associated generalized Markov pseudo-game.
This reduction allowed us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to approximate \samy{}{recursive} Radner equilibria. 
Perhaps more importantly, our work connects recent developments in deep reinforcement learning to macroeconomics, thereby uncovering myriad potential new research directions.
