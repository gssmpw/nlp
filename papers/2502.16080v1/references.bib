 abstract = {Parts I and II of this paper have described a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information. Two cases have been distinguished: consistent games in which there exists some basic probability distribution from which the players' subjective probability distributions can be derived as conditional probability distributions; and inconsistent games in which no such basic probability distribution exists. Part III will now show that in consistent games, where a basic probability distribution exists, it is essentially unique. It will also be argued that, in the absence of special reasons to the contrary, one should try to analyze any given game situation with incomplete information in terms of a consistent-game model. However, it will be shown that our theory can be extended also to inconsistent games, in case the situation does require the use of an inconsistent-game model.},

abstract = {We consider a reach-avoid differential game, in which one of the players aims to steer the system into a target set without violating a set of state constraints, while the other player tries to prevent the first from succeeding; the system dynamics, target set, and state constraints may all be time-varying. The analysis of this problem plays an important role in collision avoidance, motion planning and aircraft control, among other applications. Previous methods for computing the guaranteed winning initial conditions and strategies for each player have either required augmenting the state vector to include time, or have been limited to problems with either no state constraints or entirely static targets, constraints and dynamics. To incorporate time-varying dynamics, targets and constraints without the need for state augmentation, we propose a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation in the form of a double-obstacle variational inequality, and prove that the zero sublevel set of its viscosity solution characterizes the capture basin for the target under the state constraints. Through this formulation, our method can compute the capture basin and winning strategies for time-varying games at virtually no additional computational cost relative to the time-invariant case. We provide an implementation of this method based on well-known numerical schemes and show its convergence through a simple example; we include a second example in which our method substantially outperforms the state augmentation approach.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm which allows the on-demand delivering of software, hardware, and data as services. As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic, the development of efficient service provisioning policies become increasingly challenging. Game theoretic approaches have shown to gain a thorough analytical understanding of the service provisioning problem.In this paper we take the perspective of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers which host their applications at an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. Each SaaS needs to comply with quality of service requirements, specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts with the end-users, which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level. SaaS providers want to maximize their revenues from SLAs, while minimizing the cost of use of resources supplied by the IaaS provider. Moreover, SaaS providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources. On the other hand, the IaaS wants to maximize the revenues obtained providing virtualized resources. In this paper we model the service provisioning problem as a Generalized Nash game, and we propose an efficient algorithm for the run time management and allocation of IaaS resources to competing SaaSs.},

 abstract = {A constrained n-person game is considered in which the constraints for each player, as well as his payoff function, may depend on the strategy of every player. The existence of an equilibrium point for such a game is shown. By requiring appropriate concavity in the payoff functions a concave game is defined. It is proved that there is a unique equilibrium point for every strictly concave game. A dynamic model for nonequilibrium situations is proposed. This model consists of a system of differential equations which specify the rate of change of each player's strategy. It is shown that for a strictly concave game the system is globally asymptotically stable with respect to the unique equilibrium point of the game. Finally, it is shown how a gradient method suitable for a concave mathematical programming problem can be used to find the equilibrium point for a concave game.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on how to model and solve an environmental compliance problem using [Rosen, J.B., 1965. Existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points for concave n-person games. Econometrica 33 (3), 520–534] seminal idea of coupled constraint equilibrium. First, Rosen's results about the existence and uniqueness of a Nash normalised equilibrium for coupled constraint games are explained. These results are then combined with a numerical approach to game solutions based on the Nikaido–Isoda function. A river basin pollution game, which is a model for a common nonpoint source pollution problem, is solved numerically using this approach. In the game, the agents face a joint constraint on the total pollution, which defines a coupled constraint set in the combined strategy space. This makes the game special in terms of the strategy spaces. Unlike for standard games where they are defined separately for each player, here we have a joint constraint on the combined strategy space of all players. Hence, the game needs coupled constraint equilibrium as the solution concept. Static and (open-loop) dynamic equilibria are computed for the basin problem under the discussed equilibrium concept. All equilibria are instructive for the legislator, in that they contain information on how to choose the “optimal” charges, under which agents obey the constraints.}

abstract = {Passengers are increasingly using e-hailing as a means to request transportation services. Adoption of these types of services has the potential to impact the travel behavior of individuals as well as increase congestion and vehicle miles driven since extra deadhead miles must be added to the trip (e.g., the extra miles from the driver location to the pick-up location of the customer). The objective of this paper is to develop a basic mathematical model to help transportation planners understand the relationship between the wide-scale use of e-hailing transportation services and deadhead miles and resulting impact on congestion. Specifically, this paper develops a general economic equilibrium model at the macroscopic level to describe the equilibrium state of a transportation system composed of solo drivers and the e-hailing service providers (e-HSPs). The equilibrium model consists of three interacting sub-models: e-HSP choice, customer choice, and network congestion; the model is completed with a “market clearance” condition describing the waiting costs in the customer’s optimization problem in terms of the e-HSPs’ decisions, thereby connecting the supply and demand sides of the equilibrium. We show the existence of an equilibrium of a certain kind under some mild assumptions. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the sensitivity on the usage of these modes to various parameters representing cost, value of time, safety, and comfort level, as well as the resulting relationship between usage of these services and vehicle miles.}

    abstract = { Most previous Nash-Cournot models of competition among electricity generators have assumed smooth demand (price) functions, facilitating computation and proofs of existence and uniqueness. However, nonsmooth demand functions are an important feature of real power markets due, for example, to price caps and generator recognition of transmission constraints that limit exports. A more general model of Nash-Cournot competition on networks is proposed that accounts for these features by including (1) concave piecewise-linear demand curves and (2) joint constraints that include variables from other generating companies within the profit maximization problems for individual generators. The piecewise demand curves imply, in general, a nonmonotone multivalued variational inequality problem. Thus, for instance, imposition of a price cap can destroy the uniqueness properties found in previous models, so that distinct solutions can yield different sets of profits for market participants. The joint constraints turn the equilibrium problem into a quasi-variational inequality, which also can yield multiple solutions. The formulation poses computational challenges that can cause Lemke’s algorithm to fail; a restricted formulation is proposed that can be solved by that algorithm. }

The producers are assumed to behave in a Cournot manner with regulated transmission prices. A (generalized) Nash equilibrium is sought. The story of the game is as follows. Each generator takes its rivals' output (generation, supply, and flows) and the prices for transmission services as fixed when it decides upon its output to maximize its profit; the transmission firm takes the quantities of transmission services demanded by the generators as fixed when it determines the transmission prices according to certain regulatory rules. An equilibrium of the model is a set of generation output at which no generator will obtain more profit if it unilaterally modifies its output from this set, and a set of transmission prices satisfying certain regulatory requirements. A variational inequality approach is used for computing the equilibria of the model. Using the same approach, two variants of the model, respectively based on average-cost and marginal-cost pricing for transmission services, are also formulated. This model is applied to simulate a long-run electricity market where transmission prices are regulated. }

This problem is rather difficult to solve and there are only a few methods available in the literature. One of the most popular ones is the so-called relaxation method, which is known to be globally convergent under a set of assumptions. Some of these assumptions, however, are rather strong or somewhat difficult to understand. Here, we present a modified relaxation method for the solution of a certain class of GNEPs. The convergence analysis uses completely different arguments based on a certain descent property and avoids some of the technical conditions for the original relaxation method. Moreover, numerical experiments indicate that the modified relaxation method performs quite well on a number of different examples taken from the literature.},

	abstract = {
      Affine generalized Nash equilibrium problems (AGNEPs) represent a class of non-cooperative games in which players solve convex quadratic programs with a set of (linear) constraints that couple the players’ variables. The generalized Nash equilibria (GNE) associated with such games are given by solutions to a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This paper treats a large subclass of AGNEPs wherein the coupled constraints are shared by, i.e., common to, the players. Specifically, we present several avenues for computing structurally different GNE based on varying consistency requirements on the Lagrange multipliers associated with the shared constraints. Traditionally, variational equilibria (VE) have been amongst the more well-studied GNE and are characterized by a requirement that the shared constraint multipliers be identical across players. We present and analyze a modification to Lemke’s method that allows us to compute GNE that are not necessarily VE. If successful, the modified method computes a partial variational equilibrium characterized by the property that some shared constraints are imposed to have common multipliers across the players while other are not so imposed. Trajectories arising from regularizing the LCP formulations of AGNEPs are shown to converge to a particular type of GNE more general than Rosen’s normalized equilibrium that in turn includes a variational equilibrium as a special case. A third avenue for constructing alternate GNE arises from employing a novel constraint reformulation and parameterization technique. The associated parametric solution method is capable of identifying continuous manifolds of equilibria. Numerical results suggest that the modified Lemke’s method is more robust than the standard version of the method and entails only a modest increase in computational effort on the problems tested. Finally, we show that the conditions for applying the modified Lemke’s scheme are readily satisfied in a breadth of application problems drawn from communication networks, environmental pollution games, and power markets.

A practical approach to solving this problem that has received increasing attention lately entails solving a related variational inequality (VI). From the viewpoint of game theory, it is important to find as many GNEs as possible, if not all of them. We propose two types of parametrized VIs related to the GNEP, one price-directed and the other resource-directed. We show that these parametrized VIs inherit the monotonicity properties of the original VI and, under mild constraint qualifications, their solutions yield all GNEs. We propose strategies to sample in the parameter spaces and show, through numerical experiments on benchmark examples, that the GNEs found by the parametrized VI approaches are widely distributed over the GNE set.},

abstract = {The generalized Nash equilibrium is a Nash game, where not only the players' cost functions, but also the constraints of a player depend on the rival players decisions. We present a globally convergent algorithm that is suited for the computation of a normalized Nash equilibrium in the generalized Nash game with jointly convex constraints. The main tool is the regularized Nikaido---Isoda function as a basis for a locally convergent nonsmooth Newton method and, in another way, for the definition of a merit function for globalization. We conclude with some numerical results.},

Min–max problems are considered difficult to solve, specially constrained min–max optimization problems. Approaches using co-evolutionary algorithms have successfully been used to solve min–max optimization problems without constraints. We propose a novel differential evolution approach consisting of three populations with a scheme of copying individuals for solving constrained min–max problems. Promising results have been obtained showing the suitability of the approach.}

     abstract = {This paper is concerned mainly with two-stage Max-Min problems, in which the minimizing "player" acts after the maximizing "player" and with full knowledge of the choice of the maximizing player. Such problems arise in operations research for instance when defense installations must be built "in concrete" long before a battle, while the attack against them is made in full knowledge of what they are. Such problems are not games in the usual sense. To treat them it was necessary to treat a new kind of derivative and to study its peculiar properties. Using this derivative, this paper sets forth a general theory of Max-Min analogous to the elementary theory of maximizing for finite problems, applies this to find criteria in a particular long-unsolved military allocation problem, and finally indicates an application to economics.},

Many people’s interests, however, are affected by their social interactions with others. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of Fisher markets, namely influence Fisher markets, which captures the impact of social influence on buyers’ utilities. We show that competitive equilibria in influence Fisher markets correspond to generalized Nash equilibria in an associated pseudo-game, which implies the existence of competitive equilibria in all influence Fisher markets with continuous and concave utility functions. We then construct a monotone pseudo-game, whose variational equilibria and their duals together characterize competitive equilibria in influence Fisher markets with continuous, jointly concave, and homogeneous utility functions. This observation implies that competitive equilibria in these markets can be computed in polynomial time under standard smoothness assumptions on the utility functions. The dual of this second pseudo-game enables us to interpret the competitive equilibria of influence CCH Fisher markets as the solutions to a system of simultaneous Stackelberg games. Finally, we derive a novel first-order method that solves this Stackelberg system in polynomial time, prove that it is equivalent to computing competitive equilibrium prices via tâtonnement, and run experiments that confirm our theoretical results.}, number={5}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Zhao, Jiayi and Goktas, Denizalp and Greenwald, Amy}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={5900-5909} }

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The theory of regular economies is useful for the studies of the local uniqueness of equilibria, continuity of the equilibrium price correspondence, and possibility of comparative statics. The theory of regular economies also helps give a better understanding of the core correspondence, because core allocations in a large economy is approximately decentralized through prices. There is an intimate relationship between the theory of regular economies and the new methods of computing economic equilibria. The chapter discusses that regularity studies play a role in fields related to economic equilibrium theory. For instance, the general complementarity problem in mathematical programming has been investigated by regularity methods. Another field where regularity methods are applied is game theory. The chapter also focuses on the Arrow–Debreu equilibrium theory. The chapter discusses other problems arising in this context, such as the basic problem of existence of price equilibria or the problem of how equilibrium prices are reached. The investigation of regular equilibria has led to a revival of calculus methods in equilibrium theory. A valuable comprehensive study of many important questions of equilibrium theory is presented in the chapter in a differentiable framework.}

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most practical methods for learning data distributions. A popular GAN formulation is based on the use of Wasserstein distance as a metric between probability distributions. Unfortunately, minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generative model distribution is a computationally challenging problem as its objective is non-convex, non-smooth, and even hard to compute. In this work, we show that obtaining gradient information of the smoothed Wasserstein GAN formulation, which is based on regularized Optimal Transport (OT), is computationally effortless and hence one can apply first order optimization methods to minimize this objective. Consequently, we establish theoretical convergence guarantee to stationarity for a proposed class of GAN optimization algorithms. Unlike the original non-smooth formulation, our algorithm only requires solving the discriminator to approximate optimality. We apply our method to learning MNIST digits as well as CIFAR-10 images. Our experiments show that our method is computationally efficient and generates images comparable to the state of the art algorithms given the same architecture and computational power.},

Key to our approach is a novel technique, doubly dual embedding, that avoids computation of the partition function. This technique also allows the development of a flexible sampling strategy that amortizes the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling in the inference stage. The resulting estimator can be easily generalized to kernel conditional exponential families. We establish a connection between kernel exponential family estimation and MMD-GANs, revealing a new perspective for understanding GANs. Compared to the score matching based estimators, the proposed method improves both memory and time efficiency while enjoying stronger statistical properties, such as fully capturing smoothness in its statistical convergence rate while the score matching estimator appears to saturate. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator  empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both kernel exponential family estimation and its conditional extension.}

In both contexts, we demonstrate that dynamic position auctions converge to their associated static, envy-free equilibria. Furthermore, convergence is efficient, and the entry of low-quality advertisers does not slow convergence. Because our approach predominantly relies on assumptions common in the sponsored search literature, our results suggest that dynamic position auctions converge more generally.},

The fundamental difficulty is that the Bellman operator may become an expansion in general, resulting in oscillating and even divergent behavior of popular algorithms like Q-learning. In this paper, we revisit the Bellman equation, and reformulate it into a novel primal-dual optimization problem using Nesterov’s smoothing technique and the Legendre-Fenchel transformation. We then develop a new algorithm, called Smoothed Bellman Error Embedding, to solve this optimization problem where any differentiable function class may be used. We provide what we believe to be the first convergence guarantee for general nonlinear function approximation, and analyze the algorithm’s sample complexity. Empirically, our algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines in several benchmark control problems.}

Unlike the tatonnement process and its variants, the proportional response dynamics is a large step discrete dynamics, and the buyers do not solve any optimization problem at each step. In addition, the goods are always cleared and assigned to the buyers proportional to their bids at each step. Despite its simplicity, the dynamics converges fast for strictly concave CES utility functions, matching the best upper-bound of computing the market equilibrium via the solution of a global convex optimization problem.},

This chapter discusses some problems of proving the existence of equilibrium in a monetary economy. Most theories in economics involve the equilibrium solutions of certain models. These solutions are used as benchmarks, or as states to which an economic system is believed to tend or as the means for making long-term predictions. Implicitly or explicitly most economists use the notion of an equilibrium. It is evident that a proof of the existence of equilibrium that turns crucially on a supposition is hardly acceptable. The role of this assumption is simply to enable one to employ a technical trick to ensure that one can use a fixed point theorem and one cannot believe that it has any fundamental significance to the whole problem. The trick of course was to keep the exchange value of money strictly positive throughout so that money was always desirable and to obtain the desired continuity be varying initial total stocks knowing that once an equilibrium was found the actual initial stock distribution could be restored without upsetting the equilibrium.}

This class of problems has a multitude of important engineering applications, and yet solution algorithms are extremely scarce. In this paper, we analyze in detail a globally convergent penalty method that has favorable theoretical properties. We also consider strengthened results for a particular subclass of problems very often considered in the literature. Basically our method reduces the GNEP to a single penalized (and nonsmooth) Nash equilibrium problem. We suggest a suitable method for the solution of the latter penalized problem and present extensive numerical results. }

We derive lower bounds on the communication complexity of reaching a Nash equilibrium, i.e., on the number of bits that need to be transmitted, and thus also on the required number of steps. Specifically, we show lower bounds that are exponential in the number of players in each one of the following cases: (1) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium; (2) reaching a pure Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian setting; and (3) reaching a mixed Nash equilibrium. We then show that, in contrast, the communication complexity of reaching a correlated equilibrium is polynomial in the number of players.}

    abstract = {Designing distributed algorithms that converge quickly to an equilibrium is one of the foremost research goals in algorithmic game theory, and convex programs have played a crucial role in the design of algorithms for Fisher markets. In this paper we shed new light on both aspects for Fisher markets with linear and spending constraint utilities. We show fast convergence of the Proportional Response dynamics recently introduced by Wu and Zhang. The convergence is obtained from a new perspective: we show that the Proportional Response dynamics is equivalent to a gradient descent algorithm (with respect to a Bregman divergence instead of euclidean distance) on a convex program that captures the equilibria for linear utilities. We further show that the convex program program easily extends to the case of spending constraint utilities, thus resolving an open question raised by Vazirani. This also gives a way to extend the Proportional Response dynamics to spending constraint utilties. We also prove a technical result that is interesting in its own right: that the gradient descent algorithm based on a Bregman divergence converges with rate O(1/t) under a condition that is weaker than having Lipschitz continuous gradient (which is the usual assumption in the optimization literature for obtaining the same rate).},

In this paper, we model the bandwidth allocation in a P2P system as an exchange economy and study a tit-for-tat dynamics, namely the proportional response dynamics, in this economy. In aproportional response dynamics each player distributes its good to its neighbors proportional to the utility it received from them in thelast period. We show that this dynamics not only converges but converges to a market equilibrium, a standard economic characterization of efficient exchanges in a competitive market. In addition, for some classes of utility functions we consider, it converges much faster than the classical tat process and any existingalgorithms for computing market equilibria.As a part of our proof we study the double normalization of a matrix, an operation that linearly scales the rows of a matrix sothat each row sums to a prescribed positive number, followed by a similar scaling of the columns. We show that the iterative double normalization process of any non-negative matrix always converges. This complements the previous studies in matrix scaling that has focused on the convergence condition of the process when the row and column normalizations are considered as separate steps.},

In a Fisher market, the prices and allocations of goods are determined according to the preferences and budgets of buyers to clear the market.In a Fisher market game, however, buyers are strategic and report their preferences over goods; the market-clearing prices and allocations are then determined based on their reported preferences rather than their real preferences. We show that the Fisher market game always has a pure Nash equilibrium, for buyers with linear, Leontief, and Cobb-Douglas utility functions, which are three representative classes of utility functions in the important Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) family. Furthermore, to quantify the social efficiency, we prove Price of Anarchy bounds for the game when the utility functions of buyers fall into these three classes respectively.},

    abstract = {Tatonnement is a simple and natural rule for updating prices in Exchange (Arrow-Debreu) markets. In this paper we define a class of markets for which tatonnement is equivalent to gradient descent. This is the class of markets for which there is a convex potential function whose gradient is always equal to the negative of the excess demand and we call it Convex Potential Function (CPF) markets. We show the following results. CPF markets contain the class of Eisenberg Gale (EG) markets, defined previously by Jain and Vazirani. The subclass of CPF markets for which the demand is a differentiable function contains exactly those markets whose demand function has a symmetric negative semi-definite Jacobian. We define a family of continuous versions of tatonnement based on gradient descent using a Bregman divergence. As we show, all processes in this family converge to an equilibrium for any CPF market. This is analogous to the classic result for markets satisfying the Weak Gross Substitutes property. A discrete version of tatonnement converges toward the equilibrium for the following markets of complementary goods; its convergence rate for these settings is analyzed using a common potential function. Fisher markets in which all buyers have Leontief utilities. The tatonnement process reduces the distance to the equilibrium, as measured by the potential function, to an ε fraction of its initial value in O(1/ε) rounds of price updates. Fisher markets in which all buyers have complementary CES utilities. Here, the distance to the equilibrium is reduced to an ε fraction of its initial value in O(log(1/ε)) rounds of price updates.This shows that tatonnement converges for the entire range of Fisher markets when buyers have complementary CES utilities, in contrast to prior work, which could analyze only the substitutes range, together with a small portion of the complementary range.},

Recent theoretical studies have shown that a relaxation algorithm can be used to find noncooperative equilibria of synchronous infinite games with nonlinear payoff functions and coupled constraints. In this study, we introduce an improvement to the algorithm, such as the steepest-descent step-size control, for which the convergence of the algorithm is proved. The algorithm is then tested on several economic applications. In particular, a River Basin Pollution problem is considered where coupled environmental constraints are crucial for the relevant model definition. Numerical runs demonstrate fast convergence of the algorithm for a wide range of parameters.

To do so, we first show that both OGDA and EG can be interpreted as approximate variants of the proximal point method. This is similar to the approach taken in (A. Nemirovski (2004), SIAM J. Optim., 15, pp. 229--251) which analyzes EG as an approximation of the “conceptual mirror prox.” In this paper, we highlight how gradients used in OGDA and EG try to approximate the gradient of the proximal point method. We then exploit this interpretation to show that both algorithms produce iterates that remain within a bounded set. We further show that the primal-dual gap of the averaged iterates generated by both of these algorithms converge with a rate of O(1/k). Our theoretical analysis is of interest as it provides the first convergence rate estimate for OGDA in the general convex-concave setting. Moreover, it provides a simple convergence analysis for the EG algorithm in terms of function value without using a compactness assumption. }

Because these games have complicated rules, an action sampled from the full discrete action distribution predicted by the learned policy is likely to be invalid according to the game rules (e.g., walking into a wall). The usual approach to deal with this problem in policy gradient algorithms is to "mask out" invalid actions and just sample from the set of valid actions. The implications of this process, however, remain under-investigated. In this paper, we 1) show theoretical justification for such a practice, 2) empirically demonstrate its importance as the space of invalid actions grows, and 3) provide further insights by evaluating different action masking regimes, such as removing masking after an agent has been trained using masking.

  abstract = {It is sometimes the case that one solution concept in game theory is equivalent to applying another solution concept to a modified version of the game. In such cases, does it make sense to study the former separately (as it applies to the original representation of the game), or should we entirely subordinate it to the latter? The answer probably depends on the particular circumstances, and indeed the literature takes different approaches in different cases. In this article, I consider the specific example of Stackelberg mixed strategies. I argue that, even though a Stackelberg mixed strategy can also be seen as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of a corresponding extensive-form game, there remains significant value in studying it separately. The analysis of this special case may have implications for other solution concepts.},

	abstract = {We explore reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. In particular, we consider the convergence of policy gradient methods in the setting of known and unknown parameters. We are able to produce a global linear convergence guarantee for this approach in the setting of finite time horizon and stochastic state dynamics under weak assumptions. The convergence of a projected policy gradient method is also established in order to handle problems with constraints. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first example is the optimal liquidation of a holding in an asset. We show results for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework and that it is more robust with respect to model mis-specification when compared to a model-based approach. The second example is an LQR system in a higher dimensional setting with synthetic data.},

Our main result is that in the expected revenue-maximizing mechanism, the seller makes available all the information that she can, and her expected revenue is the same as it would be if she could observe the part of the information that is "new" to the buyers. We also show that this mechanism can be implemented by what we call a handicap auction in interesting applications. In the first round of this auction, each buyer picks a price premium from a menu offered by the seller (a smaller premium costs more). Then the seller releases the additional signals. In the second round, the buyers bid in a second-price auction where the winner pays the sum of his premium and the second highest non-negative bid. In the case of a single buyer, this mechanism simplifies to a menu of European call options.},

For a class of finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with general state and action spaces, we develop a framework that provides a set of easily verifiable assumptions to ensure the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition of the policy optimization. Leveraging the KL condition, policy gradient methods converge to the globally optimal policy with a non-asymptomatic rate despite nonconvexity. Our results find applications in various control and operations models, including entropy-regularized tabular MDPs, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems, stochastic inventory models, and stochastic cash balance problems, for which we show an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-optimal policy can be obtained using a sample size in \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$ and polynomial in terms of the planning horizon by stochastic policy gradient methods.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2312.08358},
	abstract = {In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

Additionally, we have shown that, under some extra assumption, the algorithm is efficient and approaches a particular type of Minty solution. Interpreting these results in an equivalent game theory problem, weak coupling conditions will be obtained, stating that if the players' cost functions are sufficiently weakly coupled, the game has a pure quasi-Nash equilibrium.

We identify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize pluralism in AI systems: 1) Overton pluralistic models that present a spectrum of reasonable responses; 2) Steerably pluralistic models that can steer to reflect certain perspectives; and 3) Distributionally pluralistic models that are well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize and discuss three possible classes of pluralistic benchmarks: 1) Multi-objective benchmarks, 2) Trade-off steerable benchmarks, which incentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) Jury-pluralistic benchmarks which explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework to argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own experiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might reduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further research on pluralistic alignment.},

	abstract = {Large foundation models pretrained on raw web-scale data are not readily deployable without additional step of extensive alignment to human preferences. Such alignment is typically done by collecting large amounts of pairwise comparisons from humans ("Do you prefer output A or B?") and learning a reward model or a policy with the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model as a proxy for a human's underlying implicit preferences. These methods generally suffer from assuming a universal preference shared by all humans, which lacks the flexibility of adapting to plurality of opinions and preferences. In this work, we propose PAL, a framework to model human preference complementary to existing pretraining strategies, which incorporates plurality from the ground up. We propose using the ideal point model as a lens to view alignment using preference comparisons. Together with our novel reformulation and using mixture modeling, our framework captures the plurality of population preferences while simultaneously learning a common preference latent space across different preferences, which can few-shot generalize to new, unseen users. Our approach enables us to use the penultimate-layer representation of large foundation models and simple MLP layers to learn reward functions that are on-par with the existing large state-of-the-art reward models, thereby enhancing efficiency of reward modeling significantly. We show that PAL achieves competitive reward model accuracy compared to strong baselines on 1) Language models with Summary dataset ; 2) Image Generative models with Pick-a-Pic dataset ; 3) A new semisynthetic heterogeneous dataset generated using Anthropic Personas. Finally, our experiments also highlight the shortcoming of current preference datasets that are created using rigid rubrics which wash away heterogeneity, and call for more nuanced data collection approaches.},

However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16\% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33\% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach.

We show that many natural games are indeed socially concave games. Specifically, we show that linear Cournot competition and linear resource allocation games are socially-concave games, and therefore our convergence result applies to them. In addition, we show that a simple best response dynamics might diverge for linear resource allocation games, and is known to diverge for linear Cournot competition. For the TCP congestion games we show that "near" the equilibrium the games are socially-concave, and using our general methodology we show the convergence of a specific regret minimization dynamics.},

Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60\% and 6\%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We describe an approach to robustly optimize hard text prompts through efficient gradient-based optimization. Our approach automatically generates hard text-based prompts for both text-to-image and text-to-text applications. In the text-to-image setting, the method creates hard prompts for diffusion models, allowing API users to easily generate, discover, and mix and match image concepts without prior knowledge on how to prompt the model.

The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language "gradients" that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then "propagated" into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31\%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.},

Much less is known about the possible kinds of regret in online convex programming problems (OCPs), or about equilibria in the analogous multiagent setting of repeated convex games. This gap is unfortunate, since convex games are much more expressive than matrix games, and since many important machine learning problems can be expressed as OCPs. In this paper, we work to close this gap: we analyze a spectrum of regret types which lie between external and swap regret, along with their corresponding equilibria, which lie between coarse correlated and correlated equilibrium. We also analyze algorithms for minimizing these regret types. As examples of our framework, we derive algorithms for learning correlated equilibria in polyhedral convex games and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. The former is exponentially more eﬃcient than previous algorithms, and the latter is the ﬁrst of its type.},

	abstract = {Bilevel optimization has been recently applied to many machine learning tasks. However, their applications have been restricted to the supervised learning setting, where static objective functions with benign structures are considered. But bilevel problems such as incentive design, inverse reinforcement learning (RL), and RL from human feedback (RLHF) are often modeled as dynamic objective functions that go beyond the simple static objective structures, which pose significant challenges of using existing bilevel solutions. To tackle this new class of bilevel problems, we introduce the first principled algorithmic framework for solving bilevel RL problems through the lens of penalty formulation. We provide theoretical studies of the problem landscape and its penalty-based (policy) gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms via simulations in the Stackelberg Markov game, RL from human feedback and incentive design.},

We propose a series of technical tools, including a novel notion of advantage function, to develop policy gradient algorithms and study their convergence properties in such environments. Deploying these tools, we generalize a variety of existing theoretical guarantees, such as policy gradient and convergence theorems, to partially observable domains, those which also could be carried to more settings of interest. This study also sheds light on the understanding of policy gradient approaches in real-world applications which tend to be partially observable.},

This work identifies structural properties -- shared by several classic control problems -- that ensure the policy gradient objective function has no suboptimal stationary points despite being non-convex. When these conditions are strengthened, this objective satisfies a Polyak-lojasiewicz (gradient dominance) condition that yields convergence rates. We also provide bounds on the optimality gap of any stationary point when some of these conditions are relaxed.},

Algorithms for minimizing internal regret are known for the finite experts setting, including a general reduction to the problem of minimizing external regret for this case. The reduction however crucially depends on the finiteness of the action space. In this work we approach the problem of minimizing internal regret for a continuous action space. For the full information setting, we show how to obtain O(sqrt(T)) internal regret for the class of Lipschitz functions, as well as non-Lipschitz dispersed functions, i.e. the non-Lipschitzness may not concentrate in a small region of the action space. We also consider extensions to partial feedback settings, and again obtain sublinear internal regret. Finally we discuss applications of internal regret minimization over continuous spaces to correlated equilibria in pricing problems and auction design, as well as to data-driven hyperparameter tuning.},

The design of this sampling distribution is also inspired by the analogy between active learning and multi-armed bandits. We show how to derive lower confidence bounds required by our algorithm.

Using the language of structural econometrics, we re-frame the optimal decision problem and introduce an alternative representation of value functions due to (Hotz and Miller 1993). In addition to presenting the theoretical connections that bridge the IRL literature between Economics and Robotics, the use of CCPs also has the practical benefit of reducing the computational cost of solving the IRL problem. Specifically, under the CCP representation, we show how one can avoid repeated calls to the dynamic programming subroutine typically used in IRL. We show via extensive experimentation on standard IRL benchmarks that CCP-IRL is able to outperform MaxEnt-IRL, with as much as a 5x speedup and without compromising on the quality of the recovered reward function.},

In the offline setting, the decision-maker has information available from past periods and needs to make one decision, while in the online setting, the decision-maker optimizes decisions dynamically over time based a new set of feasible actions and contextual functions in each period. For the offline setting, we characterize the optimal minimax policy, establishing the performance that can be achieved as a function of the underlying geometry of the information induced by the data. In the online setting, we leverage this geometric characterization to optimize the cumulative regret. We develop an algorithm that yields the first regret bound for this problem that is logarithmic in the time horizon.

	abstract = {We study Bayesian automated mechanism design in unstructured dynamic environments, where a principal repeatedly interacts with an agent, and takes actions based on the strategic agent's report of the current state of the world.  Both the principal and the agent can have arbitrary and potentially different valuations for the actions taken, possibly also depending on the actual state of the world.  Moreover, at any time, the state of the world may evolve arbitrarily depending on the action taken by the principal.  The goal is to compute an optimal mechanism which maximizes the principal's utility in the face of the self-interested strategic agent.We give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or without payments, under different individual-rationality constraints, when the time horizon is constant.  Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear program formulation, which can be customized in various ways to accommodate richer constraints.  For environments with large time horizons, we show that the principal's optimal utility is hard to approximate within a certain constant factor, complementing our algorithmic result.  These results paint a relatively complete picture for automated dynamic mechanism design in unstructured environments.  We further consider a special case of the problem where the agent is myopic, and give a refined efficient algorithm whose time complexity scales linearly in the time horizon.    In the full version of the paper, we show that memoryless mechanisms, which are without loss of generality optimal in Markov decision processes without strategic behavior, do not provide a good solution for our problem, in terms of both optimality and computational tractability.  Moreover, we present experimental results where our algorithms are applied to synthetic dynamic environments with different characteristics, which not only serve as a proof of concept for our algorithms, but also exhibit intriguing phenomena in dynamic mechanism design.},

It combines the familiar marginal effect of types on payoffs with novel marginal effects of the current type on future ones that are captured by "impulse response functions." The formula yields an expression for dynamic virtual surplus that is instrumental to the design of optimal mechanisms and to the study of distortions under such mechanisms. Second, we characterize the transfers that satisfy the envelope formula and establish a sense in which they are pinned down by the allocation rule ("revenue equivalence"). Third, we characterize perfect Bayesian equilibrium-implementable allocation rules in Markov environments, which yields tractable sufficient conditions that facilitate novel applications.

Bidders in these domains face highly complex decision-making problems, as their preferences for outcomes in one auction often depend on the outcomes of other auctions, and bidders have limited information about factors that drive outcomes, such as other bidders' preferences and past actions.   In this work, we formulate the bidder's problem as one of price prediction (i.e., learning) and optimization. We define the concept of stable price predictions and show that (approximate) equilibrium in sequential auctions can be characterized as a profile of strategies that (approximately) optimize with respect to such (approximately) stable price predictions. We show how equilibria found with our formulation compare to known theoretical equilibria for simpler auction domains, and we find new approximate equilibria for a more complex auction domain where analytical solutions were heretofore unknown.},

	abstract = {Dynamic mechanism design is a challenging extension to ordinary mechanism design in which the mechanism designer must make a sequence of decisions over time in the face of possibly untruthful reports of participating agents. Optimizing dynamic mechanisms for welfare is relatively well understood. However, there has been less work on optimizing for other goals (e.g. revenue), and without restrictive assumptions on valuations, it is remarkably challenging to characterize good mechanisms. Instead, we turn to automated mechanism design to find mechanisms with good performance in specific problem instances. In fact, the situation is similar even in static mechanism design. However, in the static case, optimization/machine learning-based automated mechanism design techniques have been successful in finding high-revenue mechanisms in cases beyond the reach of analytical results. We extend the class of affine maximizer mechanisms to MDPs where agents may untruthfully report their rewards. This extension results in a challenging bilevel optimization problem in which the upper problem involves choosing optimal mechanism parameters, and the lower problem involves solving the resulting MDP. Our approach can find truthful dynamic mechanisms that achieve strong performance on goals other than welfare, and can be applied to essentially any problem setting-without restrictions on valuations-for which RL can learn optimal policies.},

	abstract = {Real world applications such as economics and policy making often involve solving multi-agent games with two unique features: (1) The agents are inherently asymmetric and partitioned into leaders and followers; (2) The agents have different reward functions, thus the game is general-sum. The majority of existing results in this field focuses on either symmetric solution concepts (e.g. Nash equilibrium) or zero-sum games. It remains open how to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium -- an asymmetric analog of the Nash equilibrium -- in general-sum games efficiently from noisy samples. This paper initiates the theoretical study of sample-efficient learning of the Stackelberg equilibrium, in the bandit feedback setting where we only observe noisy samples of the reward. We consider three representative two-player general-sum games: bandit games, bandit-reinforcement learning (bandit-RL) games, and linear bandit games. In all these games, we identify a fundamental gap between the exact value of the Stackelberg equilibrium and its estimated version using finitely many noisy samples, which can not be closed information-theoretically regardless of the algorithm. We then establish sharp positive results on sample-efficient learning of Stackelberg equilibrium with value optimal up to the gap identified above, with matching lower bounds in the dependency on the gap, error tolerance, and the size of the action spaces. Overall, our results unveil unique challenges in learning Stackelberg equilibria under noisy bandit feedback, which we hope could shed light on future research on this topic.},

In {\textbackslash}emph\{zero-sum\} games, the notion of a Stackelberg equilibrium coincides with the notion of a {\textbackslash}emph\{Nash Equilibrium\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{korzhyk2011stackelberg\}. Finding these equilibrium concepts in zero-sum games can be efficiently done when the players have polynomially many pure strategies or when (in additional to some structural properties) a best-response oracle is available{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{ahmadinejad2016duels, DHL+17, KV05\}. Despite such advancements in the case of zero-sum games, little is known for general-sum games. In light of the above, we examine the computational complexity of computing a Stackelberg equilibrium in large general-sum games. We show that while there are natural large general-sum games where the Stackelberg Equilibria can be computed efficiently if the Nash equilibrium in its zero-sum form could be computed efficiently, in general, structural properties that allow for efficient computation of Nash equilibrium in zero-sum games are not sufficient for computing Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games.},

Much like Newton's method is a standard tool for solving unconstrained smooth optimization problems of modest size, proximal algorithms can be viewed as an analogous tool for nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale, or distributed versions of these problems. They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical algorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed-form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpretations of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest form of no-regret algorithms in this class are no-internal-regret algorithms. Thus, the tightest game-theoretic solution concept to which Phi-no-regret algorithms (provably) converge is correlated equilibrium. In particular, Nash equilibrium is not a necessary outcome of learning via any Phi-no-regret learning algorithms.},

Indeed, non-concave games present a host of game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may fail to exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria exist but are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria have infinite support in general, and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges we propose a new solution concept, termed \$({\textbackslash}varepsilon, {\textbackslash}Phi({\textbackslash}delta))\$-local equilibrium, which generalizes local Nash equilibrium in non-concave games, as well as (coarse) correlated equilibrium in concave games. Importantly, we show that two instantiations of this solution concept capture the convergence guarantees of Online Gradient Descent and no-regret learning, which we show efficiently converge to this type of equilibrium in non-concave games with smooth utilities.},

The first optimization problem is a complete reformulation of the generalized Nash game in the sense that the global minima are precisely the solutions of the game. However, this reformulation is nonsmooth. We then modify this approach and obtain a smooth constrained optimization problem whose global minima correspond to so-called normalized Nash equilibria. The third approach uses the difference of two regularized Nikaido-Isoda-functions in order to get a smooth unconstrained optimization problem whose global minima are, once again, precisely the normalized Nash equilibria. Conditions for stationary points to be global minima of the two smooth optimization problems are also given. Some numerical results illustrate the behaviour of our approaches.},

	abstract = {In today's economy, it becomes important for Internet platforms to consider the sequential information design problem to align its long term interest with incentives of the gig service providers. This paper proposes a novel model of sequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs), where a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of myopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative utilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and utility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding a signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers and inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender. Nevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out that we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-optimal) policy with finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified formulation of the Bellman equation. Our main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online reinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal signaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the knowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the Markov transition kernels. We design a provably efficient no-regret learning algorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which features a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. Our algorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}\$-regret upper bound. Furthermore, both our algorithm and theory can be applied to MPPs with large space of outcomes and states via function approximation, and we showcase such a success under the linear setting.},

We consider the use of second-price auctions for selling these objects, and show that there exists a unique symmetric Markov equilibrium in this market. In equilibrium, buyers shade their bids down by their continuation value, which is the (endogenous) option value of participating in future auctions. We characterize this option value and show that it depends not only on the number of buyers currently present on the market and the distribution of their values, but also on anticipated market dynamics.},

	abstract = {We are interested in the setting where a seller sells sequentially arriving items, one per period, via a dynamic auction. At the beginning of each period, each buyer draws a private valuation for the item to be sold in that period and this valuation is independent across buyers and periods. The auction can be dynamic in the sense that the auction at period \$t\$ can be conditional on the bids in that period and all previous periods, subject to certain appropriately defined incentive compatible and individually rational conditions. Perhaps not surprisingly, the revenue optimal dynamic auctions are computationally hard to find and existing literatures that aim to approximate the optimal auctions are all based on solving complex dynamic programs. It remains largely open on the structural interpretability of the optimal dynamic auctions. In this paper, we show that any optimal dynamic auction is a virtual welfare maximizer subject to some monotone allocation constraints. In particular, the explicit definition of the virtual value function above arises naturally from the primal-dual analysis by relaxing the monotone constraints. We further develop an ironing technique that gets rid of the monotone allocation constraints. Quite different from Myerson's ironing approach, our technique is more technically involved due to the interdependence of the virtual value functions across buyers. We nevertheless show that ironing can be done approximately and efficiently, which in turn leads to a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme of the optimal dynamic auction.},

	abstract = {We analyze a dynamic auction, in which a seller with C units to sell faces a sequence of buyers separated into T time periods. Each group of buyers has independent, private values for a single unit. Buyers compete directly against each other within a period, as in a traditional auction, and indirectly with buyers in other periods through the opportunity cost of capacity assessed by the seller. The number of buyers in each period, as well as the individual buyers' valuations, are random. The model is a variation of the traditional single-leg, multiperiod revenue management problem, in which consumers act strategically and bid for units of a fixed capacity over time. For this setting, we prove that dynamic variants of the first-price and second-price auction mechanisms maximize the seller's expected revenue. We also show explicitly how to compute and implement these optimal auctions. The optimal auctions are then compared to a traditional revenue management mechanism-in which list prices are used in each period together with capacity controls-and to a simple auction heuristic that consists of allocating units to each period and running a sequence of standard, multiunit auctions with fixed reserve prices in each period. The traditional revenue management mechanism is proven to be optimal in the limiting cases when there is at most one buyer per period, when capacity is not constraining, and asymptotically when the number of buyers and the capacity increases. The optimal auction significantly outperforms both suboptimal mechanisms when there are a moderate number of periods, capacity is constrained, and the total volume of sales is not too large. The benefit also increases when variability in the dispersion in buyers' valuations or in the number of buyers per period increases.},

We show that if both players run policy gradient methods in tandem, their policies will converge to a min-max equilibrium of the game, as long as their learning rates follow a two-timescale rule (which is necessary). To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first finite-sample convergence result for independent policy gradient methods in competitive RL; prior work has largely focused on centralized, coordinated procedures for equilibrium computation.},

Unfortunately, even for simple control problems solvable by standard dynamic programming techniques, policy gradient algorithms face non-convex optimization problems and are widely understood to converge only to a stationary point. This work identifies structural properties -- shared by several classic control problems -- that ensure the policy gradient objective function has no suboptimal stationary points despite being non-convex. When these conditions are strengthened, this objective satisfies a Polyak-lojasiewicz (gradient dominance) condition that yields convergence rates. We also provide bounds on the optimality gap of any stationary point when some of these conditions are relaxed.},

Different types of MPE are characterized distinguishing between delay equilibria, inducing for some initial conditions mode switches after a positive finite delay, and now or never equilibria, under which, depending on the initial condition, a mode switch occurs immediately or never. These results are applied to analyze the MPE of a game capturing the dynamic interaction between two incumbent firms among which one has to decide when to extend its product range by introducing a new product. The market appeal of the new product can be influenced over time by both firms through costly investments. Under a wide range of market introduction costs a now or never equilibrium coexists with a continuum of delay equilibria, each of them inducing a different time of product introduction.},

In recent years research has proceeded on a track to incorporate stochasticity in one way or another. However, the main focus has been on rather limited ideas of what a stochastic variational inequality might be. Because variational inequalities are especially tuned to capturing conditions for optimality and equilibrium, stochastic variational inequalities ought to provide such service for problems of optimization and equilibrium in a stochastic setting. Therefore they ought to be able to deal with multistage decision processes involving actions that respond to increasing levels of information. Critical for that, as discovered in stochastic programming, is introducing nonanticipativity as an explicit constraint on responses along with an associated “multiplier” element which captures the “price of information” and provides a means of decomposition as a tool in algorithmic developments. That idea is extended here to a framework which supports multistage optimization and equilibrium models while also clarifying the single-stage picture.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

On the other hand, FM, with its enormous size, pre-trained knowledge, and exceptional performance, serves as a robust starting point for FL, facilitating faster convergence and better performance under non-iid data. Additionally, leveraging FM to generate synthetic data enriches data diversity, reduces overfitting, and preserves privacy. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper aims to deepen the understanding of their synergistic relationship, highlighting the motivations, challenges, and future directions.

	abstract = {There is a long history in game theory on the topic of Bayesian or "rational" learning, in which each player maintains beliefs over a set of alternative behaviours, or types, for the other players. This idea has gained increasing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, where it is used as a method to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying a possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with respect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed actions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily in the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many AI applications have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate evidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are correct, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that prior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs in the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent performance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are able complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised types. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {In principle, anything that a player can do to communicate and coordinate with other players could be described by moves in an extensive-form game, so that planning these communication moves would become part of the player's strategy choice itself. Adding a communication system does not eliminate any of the equilibria of the original game because there are always equilibria of the communication game in which reports and messages are treated as having no meaning and hence are ignored by all players. Such equilibria of the communication game are called “babbling equilibria.” The set of correlated equilibria of a strategic-form game Г has a simple and tractable mathematical structure because it is closed by convex and is characterized by a finite system of linear inequalities. The revelation principle for strategic-form games asserted that any equilibrium of any communication system can be simulated by a communication system in which the only communication is from a central mediator to the players, without any communication from the players to the mediator. The one-way nature of this communication is not surprising, because the players have no private information to tell the mediator about, within the structure of the strategic-form game. However, players in a Bayesian game may have private information about their types, and two-way communication would then allow the players' actions to depend on each other's types as well as on extraneous random variables, such as coin tosses. Thus, in Bayesian games with communication, there may be a need for players to talk as well as to listen in mediated communication systems.},

	title = {Optimization methods for collaborative learning},
	abstract = {A traditional machine learning pipeline involves collecting massive amounts of data centrally on a server and training models to fit the data. However, increasing concerns about the privacy and security of user's data, combined with the sheer growth in the data sizes has incentivized looking beyond such traditional centralized approaches. Collaborative learning (which encompasses distributed, federated, and decentralized learning) proposes instead for a network of data holders to collaborate together to train models without transmitting any data. This new paradigm minimizes data exposure, but inherently faces some fundamental challenges. In this thesis, we bring to bear the framework of stochastic optimization to formalize and develop new algorithms for these challenges. This serves not only to develop novel solutions, but also to test the utility of the optimization lens in modern deep learning.


We study three fundamental problems. Firstly, collaborative training replaces a one-time transmission of raw data with repeated rounds of communicating partially trained models. However, this quickly runs against bandwidth constraints when dealing with large models. We propose to solve this bandwidth constraint using compressed communication. Next, collaborative training leverages the computation power of the data holders directly. However, this is not as reliable as using a data center with only a subset of them available at any given time. Thus, we require new algorithms which can efficiently utilize unreliable local computation of the data holders. Finally, collaborative training allows any data holder to participate in the training process, without being able to inspect their data or local computation. This may potentially open the system to malicious or faulty agents who seek to derail the training. We develop algorithms with Byzantine robustness which are guaranteed to be resilient to such attackers},

In this work, we initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learning for the automated design of optimal auctions. We model an auction as a multi-layer neural network, frame optimal auction design as a constrained learning problem, and show how it can be solved using standard machine learning pipelines. In addition to providing generalization bounds, we present extensive experimental results, recovering essentially all known solutions that come from the theoretical analysis of optimal auction design problems and obtaining novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal mechanism is unknown.},

	abstract = {In many real-world situations, data is distributed across multiple self-interested agents. These agents can collaborate to build a machine learning model based on data from multiple agents, potentially reducing the error each experiences. However, sharing models in this way raises questions of fairness: to what extent can the error experienced by one agent be significantly lower than the error experienced by another agent in the same coalition? In this work, we consider two notions of fairness that each may be appropriate in different circumstances: "egalitarian fairness" (which aims to bound how dissimilar error rates can be) and "proportional fairness" (which aims to reward players for contributing more data). We similarly consider two common methods of model aggregation, one where a single model is created for all agents (uniform), and one where an individualized model is created for each agent. For egalitarian fairness, we obtain a tight multiplicative bound on how widely error rates can diverge between agents collaborating (which holds for both aggregation methods). For proportional fairness, we show that the individualized aggregation method always gives a small player error that is upper bounded by proportionality. For uniform aggregation, we show that this upper bound is guaranteed for any individually rational coalition (where no player wishes to leave to do local learning).},

	abstract = {Federated learning is a setting where agents, each with access to their own data source, combine models from local data to create a global model. If agents are drawing their data from different distributions, though, federated learning might produce a biased global model that is not optimal for each agent. This means that agents face a fundamental question: should they choose the global model or their local model? We show how this situation can be naturally analyzed through the framework of coalitional game theory. We propose the following game: there are heterogeneous players with different model parameters governing their data distribution and different amounts of data they have noisily drawn from their own distribution. Each player's goal is to obtain a model with minimal expected mean squared error (MSE) on their own distribution. They have a choice of fitting a model based solely on their own data, or combining their learned parameters with those of some subset of the other players. Combining models reduces the variance component of their error through access to more data, but increases the bias because of the heterogeneity of distributions. Here, we derive exact expected MSE values for problems in linear regression and mean estimation. We then analyze the resulting game in the framework of hedonic game theory; we study how players might divide into coalitions, where each set of players within a coalition jointly construct model(s). We analyze three methods of federation, modeling differing degrees of customization. In uniform federation, the agents collectively produce a single model. In coarse-grained federation, each agent can weight the global model together with their local model. In fine-grained federation, each agent can flexibly combine models from all other agents in the federation. For each method, we analyze the stable partitions of players into coalitions.},

We solve our POMDP under a limited set of policy options via the centralized training with decentralized execution framework.

In this problem, the preferences of each agent over stochastically generated contents are described/encoded as an LLM. A key motivation is to design an auction format for AI-generated ad creatives to combine inputs from different advertisers. We argue that this problem, while generally falling under the umbrella of mechanism design, has several unique features. We propose a general formalism -- the token auction model -- for studying this problem. A key feature of this model is that it acts on a token-by-token basis and lets LLM agents influence generated contents through single dimensional bids. We first explore a robust auction design approach, in which all we assume is that agent preferences entail partial orders over outcome distributions. We formulate two natural incentive properties, and show that these are equivalent to a monotonicity condition on distribution aggregation. We also show that for such aggregation functions, it is possible to design a second-price auction, despite the absence of bidder valuation functions. We then move to designing concrete aggregation functions by focusing on specific valuation forms based on KL-divergence, a commonly used loss function in LLM. The welfare-maximizing aggregation rules turn out to be the weighted (log-space) convex combination of the target distributions from all participants. We conclude with experimental results in support of the token auction formulation.},

Despite their fundamental role in game theory, best-response dynamics are poorly understood in many games of interest due to the discontinuous, set-valued nature of the best-response map. The paper focuses on elucidating several important properties of best-response dynamics in the class of multi-agent games known as potential games---a class of games with fundamental importance in multi-agent systems and distributed control. It is shown that in almost every potential game and for almost every initial condition, the best-response dynamics (i) have a unique solution, (ii) converge to pure-strategy Nash equilibria, and (iii) converge at an exponential rate.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the equilibrium convergence properties of no-regret learning with exponential weights in potential games. To establish convergence with minimal information requirements on the players' side, we focus on two frameworks: the semi-bandit case (where players have access to a noisy estimate of their payoff vectors, including strategies they did not play), and the bandit case (where players are only able to observe their in-game, realized payoffs). In the semi-bandit case, we show that the induced sequence of play converges almost surely to a Nash equilibrium at a quasi-exponential rate. In the bandit case, the same result holds for approximate Nash equilibria if we introduce a constant exploration factor that guarantees that action choice probabilities never become arbitrarily small. In particular, if the algorithm is run with a suitably decreasing exploration factor, the sequence of play converges to a bona fide Nash equilibrium with probability 1.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is typically considered a beneficial technology which allows multiple agents to collaborate with each other, improve the accuracy of their models, and solve problems which are otherwise too data-intensive / expensive to be solved individually. However, under the expectation that other agents will share their data, rational agents may be tempted to engage in detrimental behavior such as free-riding where they contribute no data but still enjoy an improved model. In this work, we propose a framework to analyze the behavior of such rational data generators. We first show how a naive scheme leads to catastrophic levels of free-riding where the benefits of data sharing are completely eroded. Then, using ideas from contract theory, we introduce accuracy shaping based mechanisms to maximize the amount of data generated by each agent. These provably prevent free-riding without needing any payment mechanism.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents, each only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has recently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy rates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social good properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a game-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated learning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves into federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable coalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how far from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and define a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating agents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient algorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players. Next, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an arrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all stable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show this is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements with higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we give the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability and optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can be no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of Anarchy bound of 9).},

Although there has been rich literature on designing federated learning algorithms, most prior works implicitly assume that all clients are willing to participate in a FL scheme. In practice, clients may not benefit from joining in FL, especially in light of potential costs related to issues such as privacy and computation. In this work, we study the clients' incentives in federated learning to help the service provider design better solutions and ensure clients make better decisions. We are the first to model clients' behaviors in FL as a network effects game, where each client's benefit depends on other clients who also join the network. Using this setup we analyze the dynamics of clients' participation and characterize the equilibrium, where no client has incentives to alter their decision. Specifically, we show that dynamics in the population naturally converge to equilibrium without needing explicit interventions. Finally, we provide a cost-efficient payment scheme that incentivizes clients to reach a desired equilibrium when the initial network is empty.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaboration between a group of clients who seek to train a common machine learning model without directly sharing their local data. Although there is an abundance of research on improving the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of federated training, most works implicitly assume that all clients are willing to participate in the FL framework. Due to data heterogeneity, however, the global model may not work well for some clients, and they may instead choose to use their own local model. Such disincentivization of clients can be problematic from the server's perspective because having more participating clients yields a better global model, and offers better privacy guarantees to the participating clients. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called IncFL that explicitly maximizes the fraction of clients who are incentivized to use the global model by dynamically adjusting the aggregation weights assigned to their updates. Our experiments show that IncFL increases the number of incentivized clients by \$30\$-\$55{\textbackslash}\%\$ compared to standard federated training algorithms, and can also improve the generalization performance of the global model on unseen clients.},

	abstract = {In recent years, federated learning has been embraced as an approach for bringing about collaboration across large populations of learning agents. However, little is known about how collaboration protocols should take agents' incentives into account when allocating individual resources for communal learning in order to maintain such collaborations. Inspired by game theoretic notions, this paper introduces a framework for incentive-aware learning and data sharing in federated learning. Our stable and envy-free equilibria capture notions of collaboration in the presence of agents interested in meeting their learning objectives while keeping their own sample collection burden low. For example, in an envy-free equilibrium, no agent would wish to swap their sampling burden with any other agent and in a stable equilibrium, no agent would wish to unilaterally reduce their sampling burden. In addition to formalizing this framework, our contributions include characterizing the structural properties of such equilibria, proving when they exist, and showing how they can be computed. Furthermore, we compare the sample complexity of incentive-aware collaboration with that of optimal collaboration when one ignores agents' incentives.},

Beyond multicalibration, we use these game dynamics to address emerging considerations in the study of group fairness and multi-distribution learning.},

	abstract = {Social and real-world considerations such as robustness, fairness, social welfare and multi-agent tradeoffs have given rise to multi-distribution learning paradigms, such as collaborative, group distributionally robust, and fair federated learning. In each of these settings, a learner seeks to minimize its worst-case loss over a set of \$n\$ predefined distributions, while using as few samples as possible. In this paper, we establish the optimal sample complexity of these learning paradigms and give algorithms that meet this sample complexity. Importantly, our sample complexity bounds exceed that of the sample complexity of learning a single distribution only by an additive factor of \$n {\textbackslash}log(n) / {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\$. These improve upon the best known sample complexity of agnostic federated learning by Mohri et al. by a multiplicative factor of \$n\$, the sample complexity of collaborative learning by Nguyen and Zakynthinou by a multiplicative factor \${\textbackslash}log n / {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}3\$, and give the first sample complexity bounds for the group DRO objective of Sagawa et al. To achieve optimal sample complexity, our algorithms learn to sample and learn from distributions on demand. Our algorithm design and analysis is enabled by our extensions of stochastic optimization techniques for solving stochastic zero-sum games. In particular, we contribute variants of Stochastic Mirror Descent that can trade off between players' access to cheap one-off samples or more expensive reusable ones.},
