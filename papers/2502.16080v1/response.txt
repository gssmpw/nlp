The Arrow-Debreu model comprises a set of commodities; a set of firms, each deciding what quantity of each commodity to supply; and a set of consumers, each choosing a quantity of each commodity to demand in exchange for their endowment ____(Arrow and Debreau 1954).

____ define a competitive equilibrium as a collection of consumptions, one per consumer, a collection of productions, one per firm, and prices, one per commodity, such that fixing equilibrium prices: (1) no consumer can increase their utility by deviating to an alternative affordable consumption, (2) no firm can increase profit by deviating to another production in their production set, and (3) the aggregate demand for each commodity (i.e., the sum of the commodity's consumption across all consumers) does not exceed to its aggregate supply (i.e., the sum of the commodity's production and endowment across firms and consumers, respectively), while the total value of the aggregate demand is equal to the total value of the aggregate supply, i.e., Walras' law holds.

The canonical solution concept for stochastic economies is sequential competitive equilibrium (also called Radner equilibrium): a collection of per-state and per-time prices for commodities and Arrow securities, as well as per-state and per-time consumptions of commodities and portfolios of Arrow securities such that for all states and time-steps, 1) the aggregate demand for commodities is less than the aggregate supply at, 2) the aggregate demand for Arrow securities, i.e., the total number of Arrow securities bought, is equal to the aggregate supply of Arrow securities, i.e., total number of Arrow securities sold, and 3) Walras' law holds, i.e., the total value of the aggregate demand for commodities and Arrow securities is equal to the total value of the aggregate supply for commodities and Arrow securities (Radner 1967).

The study of the computational complexity of competitive equilibria was initiated by Vazirani and Vazirani (2006), who provided a polynomial-time method for computing competitive equilibrium in a special case of the Arrow-Debreu (exchange) market model, namely Fisher markets, when buyers utilities are linear.

____ subsequently showed that a large class of Fisher markets with homogeneous utility functions could be solved in polynomial-time using interior point methods (Duan et al. 2009).

____ studied an alternative family of first-order methods for solving Fisher markets, assuming linear, quasilinear, and Leontief utilities, as such methods can be more efficient when markets are large (Moulin 1980).

More recently, ____ showed that t\^atonnement converges to competitive equilibrium in homothetic Fisher markets, assuming bounded elasticity of Hicksian demand (Carreras et al. 2014).

Devising algorithms for the computation of competitive equilibrium in general Arrow-Debreu markets is still an active area of research.

While the computation of competitive equilibrium is PPAD-hard in general ____ , the computation of competitive equilibrium in Arrow-Debreu markets with Leontief buyers is equivalent to the computation of Nash equilibrium in bimatrix games ____, and hence PPAD-hard as well, there exist polynomial-time algorithms to compute competitive equilibrium in special cases of Arrow-Debreu markets, including markets whose excess demand satisfies the weak gross substitutes condition ____ and Arrow-Debreu markets with buyers whose utilities are linear ____ or satisfy constant elasticity of substitution, which gives rise to weak gross substitute demands ____.

As stochastic economies can be analytically intractable to solve without restrictive assumptions, such as homogeneous consumers (e.g., representative agent new Keynesian models  models, for a survey, see ____(Woodford 2003)), researchers have attempted to solve them via dynamic programming.

These methods often discretize the continuous state and action spaces, and then apply variants of value and policy iteration ____.

Unfortunately, this approach is unwieldy when applied to incomplete markets with multiple commodities and/or heterogeneous consumers ____.

As a result, many of these methods lack optimality guarantees, and thus might not produce correct solutions, which may lead to drastically different policy recommendations, as inaccurate solutions to stochastic economies have been known to cause spurious welfare reversal ____.

Perhaps even more importantly, while static markets afford efficient, i.e., polynomial-time, algorithms for computing competitive equilibrium under suitable assumption (see, for instance ____ or ____ for a more recent survey), to the best of our knowledge, there is no known class of stochastic economies (excluding the special case of static economies) for which the computation of a sequential or recursive competitive equilibrium is polynomial-time.

Yet the macroeconomics literature speaks to the need for efficient methods to solve these models, or at least better understand the trade-offs between the speed and accuracy of proposed solution techniques ____.

We describe only a few of the most influential computational approaches to solving stochastic economies in macroeconomics, and refer the reader to ____ for a detailed survey.

____ ____ developed an extended path algorithm (EPA).

The idea was to solve, for a terminal date sufficiently far into the future, the path of endogenous variables using a shooting algorithm.

Recently, ____ (____) extended this idea, developing the extended function path (EFP) algorithm, applicable to models that do not admit stationary Markov equilibria.

____ (____) exploit the fact that their model admits a Pareto-optimal recursive equilibrium, and thus they solve the social planner's problem, instead of solving for an equilibrium.

To do so, they rely on a linear quadratic approximation, and exploit the fast algorithms known to solve that class of optimization problems.

____ (____) (in the widely disseminated technical appendix, not published until 2002), building on ____ (____)'s approach, linearized the equilibrium conditions of their model (optimality conditions, market clearing conditions, etc.), and solved the resulting system of stochastic linear difference equations.

More recently, a growing literature has been applying deep learning methods in attempt to stochastic economies (see, for instance, ____(Li et al. 2018)).
