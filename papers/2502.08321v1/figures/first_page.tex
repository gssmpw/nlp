\caption{Examples of 2D slices of 3D medical CT images (the first row), the ground truth masks of their pathological regions (the second row) and the anomaly maps predicted by our fully self-supervised Screener model (the third row). Note that, the second image from the left contains pneumothorax, missed by ground truth annotation mask, but detected by our model.}
