\caption{The figure shows 2D slices of CT images (first column) alongside reconstructions and anomaly maps generated by two methods: an Autoencoder~\cite{autoencoder} (second and third columns) and f-AnoGAN~\cite{fanogan} (last two columns). Autoencoder overfits for pixel reconstruction, so it generates pathologies and fails to segment them. Also Autoencoder produces blurry generations, leading to inaccurate reconstructions of fine details and high anomaly scores on these details (e.g., vessels in the lungs). f-AnoGAN, on the other hand, avoids generating pathologies, but the generation quality still is insufficient for precise segmentation of only pathological voxels. GANs are known to be unstable and sensitive to hyperparameters, necessitating careful tuning and experimentation to achieve optimal results.}
