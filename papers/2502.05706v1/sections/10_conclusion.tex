\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we provided a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence properties of the Temporal Difference (TD(0)) learning algorithm for linear and non-linear under polynomial mixing for markov processes. By coupling arguments, we demonstrate that the mixing properties of the Markov process can be leveraged to achieve meaningful high-probability bounds, even without assuming strong smoothness or exponential stability.

Furthermore, our analysis shows that polynomial mixing conditions suffice to ensure robust convergence, broadening the applicability of TD learning to a wider range of reinforcement learning problems. This relaxation of assumptions opens the door to studying TD learning in more realistic and challenging settings where strong regularity conditions are impractical.

Future work may focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploring the impact of weaker mixing conditions, such as sub-polynomial mixing, on convergence rates.
    \item Remove the need for h\"older continuous functions
    \item Developing adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust step sizes based on the observed mixing properties.
    \item Extend to Deep Neural Networks
\end{enumerate}

We hope that these insights will pave the way for more general and robust methods in reinforcement learning.
