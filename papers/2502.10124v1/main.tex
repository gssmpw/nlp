\begin{abstract}

% \textbf{150}:
% Users embody virtual avatars that mirror their physical movements in Virtual Reality. We propose to measure how the user's visual attention to the avatar impacts the probability of them noticing an offset applied on the avatar’s body movement with respect to their own motion. We conduct two user studies applying a dual-task paradigm to control and alter their visual attention and record noticing probability. Results confirm that more visual attention attracted away from the avatar leads to lower the noticeability of the offset. In addition, we identified the behavioral pattern of users' gaze can serve as an effective indicator of noticeability. Based on the findings, we implement a regression model that predicts noticeability taking the user's gaze data as input. We evaluate the extendability of the model on unseen visual attractions. Results show that the model achieves an MSE of 0.012 with new participants exposed to new visual attractions. 
While users could embody virtual avatars that mirror their physical movements in Virtual Reality, these avatars' motions can be redirected to enable novel interactions.
Excessive redirection, however, could break the user's sense of embodiment due to perceptual conflicts between vision and proprioception. 
While prior work focused on avatar-related factors influencing the noticeability of redirection, we investigate how the visual stimuli in the surrounding virtual environment affect user behavior and, in turn, the noticeability of redirection.
Given the wide variety of different types of visual stimuli and their tendency to elicit varying individual reactions, 
we propose to use users' gaze behavior as an indicator of their response to the stimuli and model the noticeability of redirection.
We conducted two user studies to collect users' gaze behavior and noticeability, investigating the relationship between them and identifying the most effective gaze behavior features for predicting noticeability. 
Based on the data, we developed a regression model that takes users' gaze behavior as input and outputs the noticeability of redirection. 
We then conducted an evaluation study to test our model on unseen visual stimuli, achieving an accuracy of 0.012 MSE. 
We further implemented an adaptive redirection technique and conducted a preliminary study to evaluate its effectiveness with complex visual stimuli in two applications. 
The results indicated that participants experienced less physical demanding and a stronger sense of body ownership when using our adaptive technique, demonstrating the potential of our model to support real-world use cases.

    In this paper, we explored the impact of visual stimuli on the noticeability of redirection in Virtual Reality. 
    We developed a computational model that takes users' gaze behavior as input and predicts the noticeability of redirection under different visual stimuli.
    Using this model, we implemented an adaptive redirection technique, demonstrated in a boxing training scenario:
    Left: When the opponent approaches and attacks, visual stimuli are intense, making the redirection unnoticable.
    Middle: As the opponent retreats, visual stimuli decrease that causes the noticeability becoming higher during the interaction.
    Right: When the model detects the change in noticeability, the system dynamically adjusts the redirection magnitude, ensuring it remains unnoticed.
