\section{Influence on Quality}
\label{append:analysis_ppl}
In addition to the effectiveness of boosting safety alignment, we also consider the influence of the alignment methods on the quality and fluency of the model's response. Only natural refusal could be counted as a safe response, while irrelevant or nonsense sentences should not be considered as a safe response even though not any harmful answer is generated. As shown in \Cref{tab:main_results}, the average perplexity of responses under all settings is relatively low and remains similar to the performance of vanilla LLaVA, indicating that these methods do not undermine the quality of the model's response and the safety shown by the model stems from valid refusals.
