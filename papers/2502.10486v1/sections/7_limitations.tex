% First, 

The current investigation of the proposed method has the following limitations:
First, our approach primarily intervenes at the inference stage and does not address the issue comprehensively during the training phase.
Second, while our work explores the impact of the modality gap on the safety of VLMs, the influence of this gap on other capabilities such as reasoning and understanding remains to be investigated in future research.
Third, to visually validate the impact of the modality gap on VLM safety, we utilized a simple blank image as input to the visual encoder. However, it should be noted that the influence on safety persists even when normal images are used as visual inputs.


%apply only to training time defense (black-box model / generative task)

%following previous work, discriminative tasks

%applying to generative tasks may need non-trivial adaption.
