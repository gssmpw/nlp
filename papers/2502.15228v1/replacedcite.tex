\section{RELATED WORK}
Existing research on gesture and motion data analysis spans task-specific models____, AutoMR frameworks____, and hyperparameter tuning tools____. While each of these areas has made significant contributions, they also present certain limitations when applied to multimodal datasets. 

\subsection{Task-Specific Models}
% Task-specific models have been widely adopted for gesture and motion data recognition tasks. For instance, DeepConvLSTM integrates convolutional layers with LSTMs to capture spatiotemporal patterns, achieving strong results on datasets such as UCI-HAR____.

Similarly, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) use dilated convolutions to model long-range dependencies in time-series data____, demonstrating success on OPPORTUNITY____ and other multimodal datasets. However, these methods are typically tailored to specific modalities (e.g., IMU or skeletal motion) and often lack scalability to new data types such as sEMG signals or unsegmented motion capture data.

\subsection{Auto Training Frameworks for Time-Series Data}
Auto training frameworks, such as Auto-sklearn and H2O AutoGR____, offer automation in model selection and hyperparameter tuning. These tools reduce the expertise required to build machine learning pipelines and have demonstrated potential in time-series classification.
However, these frameworks are not tailored for multimodal datasets and often require extensive customization for preprocessing and handling heterogeneous sensor data. For example, TPOTâ€™s limited modality-specific pipelines restrict its applicability to datasets like LMDHG, where skeletal motion data demands complex preprocessing and feature extraction____.

These tools use algorithms like Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the search space, and they have been applied to datasets like MHEALTH____ and OPPORTUNITY____ for tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates and network depths.

% However, these tools lack integration into end-to-end workflows, often requiring significant manual intervention to set up pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

% Our work addresses these limitations by introducing AutoGR, an end-to-end AutoMR framework designed specifically for gesture and motion data recognition. AutoGR integrates preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, supporting diverse modalities such as sEMG, skeletal motion, and IMU data. Unlike task-specific models, AutoGR is adaptable across datasets without requiring significant manual adjustments. It also incorporates automated hyperparameter tuning, fully integrated into the pipeline, to simplify deployment and reduce the technical barriers for users.
