abstract = { Providing users with accurate gestural interfaces, such as gesture recognition based on wrist-worn devices, is a key challenge in mixed reality. However, static machine learning processes in gesture recognition assume that training and test data come from the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, in real-world applications involving gesture recognition, such as gesture recognition based on wrist-worn devices, the data distribution may change over time. We formulate this problem of adapting recognition models to new tasks, where new data patterns emerge, as open-world gesture recognition (OWGR). We propose the use of continual learning to enable machine learning models to be adaptive to new tasks without degrading performance on previously learned tasks. However, the process of exploring parameters for questions around when, and how, to train and deploy recognition models requires resource-intensive user studies may be impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a design engineering approach that enables offline analysis on a collected large-scale dataset by systematically examining various parameters and comparing different continual learning methods. Finally, we provide design guidelines to enhance the development of an open-world wrist-worn gesture recognition process. },

abstract = {General-purpose automated algorithm configuration procedures have enabled impressive improvements in the state of the art in solving challenging problems from AI, operations research and other areas. The most successful configurators combine multiple techniques to search vast combinatorial spaces of parameter settings for a given algorithm as efficiently as possible. Specifically, two of the most prominent general-purpose algorithm configurators, SMAC and irace, can be seen as combinations of Bayesian optimisation and racing, and of racing and an estimation of distribution algorithm, respectively. Here, we investigate an approach that combines all three of these techniques into one single configurator, while exploiting prior knowledge contained in expert-chosen default parameter values. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over irace and SMAC on a broad range of running time optimisation scenarios from AClib.},
