In this paper, we present \name, the world's first large foundational model for EEG-Based Alzheimerâ€™s Disease detection on the world's largest EEG-based AD detection corpus, including 813 subjects. We design a complete pipeline encompassing dataset selection, data processing, pre-training framework, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. We perform self-supervised pre-training on 4 AD datasets and 7 non-AD neurological diseases or healthy control datasets, totaling 2,354 subjects. The self-supervised pre-training includes sample-level and subject-level contrastive learning. Unified fine-tuning is performed on 5 AD datasets with channel-aligned datasets, totaling 615 subjects. We use a backbone encoder that can leverage both temporal and spatial features. The significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our design for dataset selection, channel alignment, self-supervised pre-training, and unified fine-tuning. We hope to inspire future research on EEG-based AD detection and other neurological disease detection, such as Parkinson's disease. More discussion on the existing large EEG model, the effectiveness of our subject-level contrasting, and limitations \& future works are presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:discussion}.
