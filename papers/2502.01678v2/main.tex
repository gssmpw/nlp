\section*{Impact Statement}
\label{sec:impact_statement}
This paper introduces the first large foundational model for EEG-based Alzheimer's Disease detection, trained on the largest EEG-AD corpus to date. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of large pre-trained models and multi-dataset fine-tuning for AD detection, provided that appropriate training methods and datasets are selected. Our approach significantly outperforms methods trained on single datasets and other state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training methods and large EEG foundational models trained on multiple datasets. The subject-independent evaluation, which tests on unseen subjects, further highlights the applicability of our method in real-world scenarios. We open-source our code, pre-trained model, and fine-tuned model with the hope that this work will drive progress in EEG-based AD detection and inspire future research in detecting other brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
