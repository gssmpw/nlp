Through a literature review, we found that various studies have investigated haptic perception through styluses, but to our knowledge, none have explored how the stiffness of the stylus itself influences haptic perception. In contrast, this study investigates the effects on haptic perception when an object is touched with styluses of different stiffness and applies these findings to the design of haptic interfaces.

In response to the challenge of requiring external compressor, many soft actuators utilizing the characteristics of functional materials have been developed. For example, low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) [1] and shape-memory polymers (SMP) [2] have been used as actuators, where temperature control to adjust the stiffness variation.

McKibben-type artificial muscles have been applied in various applications, such as tele-surgery [3], shape-changing interfaces [4], and haptic gloves [5].

However, these functional materials can be difficult to obtain and manage, limiting their ease of use. Ryu et al. proposed ElaStick [6], a handheld device that dynamically modulates the stiffness of four elastic tendons for 2-DoF haptic feedback, simulating flexible objects, but its size limits integration into stylus-shaped interfaces.

While methods like layer jamming and functional materials have limitations, we believe that artificial muscles, controlled by simple fluid manipulation, offer a more suitable and straightforward solution for stiffness control in stylus-shaped interfaces. Consequently, we employed McKibben-type artificial muscles to develop an interface capable of controlling stiffness.

The details of the proposed interface are described in \cref{4}.
