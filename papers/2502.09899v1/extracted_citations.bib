    abstract = {This study explored the relationship between the softness of two output displays (glass and elastic surfaces) and three direct input devices (fingertip and two types of styli, with acrylic and rubber tips) in terms of user task performance and satisfaction in tapping tasks. In a within-subjects experiment, 44 participants were asked to play a touch-based game as quickly and accurately as possible across combinations of the two independent variables. After finishing tasks in each condition, they filled out an evaluation questionnaire regarding tactile satisfaction, which addressed perceived feeling of pressing down on the surface, pleasantness, helpfulness, finger fatigue, and degree of elasticity. The results of this experiment show a main effect of touchscreen type on task performance, whereas input device type shows main effects on both task performance and satisfaction. Measures of five key sub-factors of subjective satisfaction are explained, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Haptic controllers have an important role in providing rich and immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. While previous works have succeeded in creating handheld devices that simulate dynamic properties of rigid objects, such as weight, shape, and movement, recreating the behavior of flexible objects with different stiffness using ungrounded controllers remains an open challenge. In this paper we present ElaStick, a variable-stiffness controller that simulates the dynamic response resulting from shaking or swinging flexible virtual objects. This is achieved by dynamically changing the stiffness of four custom elastic tendons along a joint that effectively increase and reduce the overall stiffness of a perceived object in 2-DoF. We show that with the proposed mechanism, we can render stiffness with high precision and granularity in a continuous range between 10.8 and 71.5Nmm/degree. We estimate the threshold of the human perception of stiffness with a just-noticeable difference (JND) study and investigate the levels of immersion, realism and enjoyment using a VR application.},

We propose interaction techniques using the FlexStylus to improve menu navigation and tool selection. Finally, we describe a study comparing users' ability to match a changing target value using a commercial pressure stylus and the FlexStylus' absolute deformation.

    abstract = {Tablet PCs and smartphones rapidly become popular nowadays. People can touch objects on the touch panel display of the tablet PC or smartphone, but only get sensation of touching the surface of the display. Recently, some systems capable of inserting themselves into the display by using retractable stylus have been proposed. Beyond [Lee and Ishii 2010] is one of these systems. It consists of a retractable stylus, a table-top display, an infrared marker and a camera set at an environment. A virtual tip of the stylus is rendered when the retractable stylus is pushed to the table-top display. The head position of the user is detected by the infrared marker and the camera, and the virtual objects and the tip of the stylus are rendered properly according to the head's position. The system enables the user to interact with a virtual object under the table. However, the stylus dose not shrink or extend automatically because the stylus dose not have any actuators such as a motor. So the user is unable to feel the haptic sensation from the virtual object. It is necessary for the user to perceive the force from the virtual object to interact with the object more realistically. Another limitation is the fact that the system is stationary. ImpAct [Withana et al. 2010] is another interaction system with a smartphone and a retractable stylus. The force feedback is represented by simply stopping the shrinkage of the stylus. However, the system gives only the rigid force feedback without tactile sensations. And the system does not give a user the tactile sensation from the virtual objects. In addition, the system does not consider the viewpoint of the user.},

Once the users can see the stylus immersed in the digital world below the screen, he or she can manipulate and interact with the virtual objects with active haptic sensations. In this article, ImpAct's functionality, design, and prototype applications are described in detail with relevance to the concept of direct touch, giving special attention to novel interaction scenarios and design challenges. Furthermore, a technical evaluation was done to study ImpAct's accuracy and controlability and the results presented. This article concludes by discussing ImpAct's current limitations and future perspectives as a direct touch and manipulation tool.},

To facilitate a wide variety of applications we propose six types of reinforcement modules capable of either shape deformation and/or variable stiffness. Users can create an approximate prototype using lego-built modules with magnetic connectors. A modeling toolkit can then be used to recreate and customize the prototype structure. After 3D printing, the shape-changing interface can be assembled by threading the PAMs through holes in the reinforcement. We envision that this prototyping platform can be useful in shape-changing interface exploration, where researchers can create working prototypes easily, rapidly, and at a low cost.},

Moreover, 3D printing allows the interface to have a double structure consisting of multiple rooms functioning jamming independently, which realizes a richer haptic experience. Finally, this paper describes the manufacturing process of the jamming interface using 3D modeling software/3D printing.

While physical props and haptic devices help, their haptic properties do not allow for dynamic adjustments. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel technique for changing the perceived stiffness of objects based on a visuo-haptic illusion. We achieved this by manipulating the hands’ Control-to-Display (C/D) ratio in virtual reality while pressing down on an object with fixed stiffness. In the first study (N=12), we determine the detection thresholds of the illusion. Our results show that we can exploit a C/D ratio from 0.7 to 3.5 without user detection. In the second study (N=12), we analyze the illusion’s impact on the perceived stiffness. Our results show that participants perceive the objects to be up to 28.1\% softer and 8.9\% stiffer, allowing for various haptic applications in virtual reality.},

abstract = { The abilities of humans to discriminate the softness of rubber objects of differing compliance with a hand-held tool (a stylus) was measured under experimental conditions that differed as to how the tool was used and the kind of sensory information available. When the subject actively tapped or pressed the compliant objects, they discriminated softness as well by means of a stylus as they did by contacting the objects directly with the fingerpad. Discrimination with the stylus was unaffected by whether the stylus was controlled by one or two fingers. While tapping or pressing a stylus held in a precision grip, the grip force increased before, reached a maximum at the same time as, and decreased in parallel with the compressional force. This relationship was suggestive of anticipatory motor control based on an internal model of the motor system and the physical properties of the object. Discrimination was significantly better when tapping as opposed to pressing the objects with the stylus. This was hypothesized as due to the presence of tactile cues generated by the rapid increase in force rate as the stylus struck and indented the object during tapping. During tapping, the magnitude and rate of compressional force produced by the stylus against the object were greater, the harder the object. An additional cue, possibly kinesthetic, during pressing and tapping was the magnitude of indentation of the specimen by the stylus that was greater, the softer the object. Subjects could discriminate differences on softness by tactile cues alone in the absence of kinesthetic when compliant objects were tapped at approximately the same velocity by the experimenter against a stylus in contact with the subject's passive fingerpad. Discrimination deteriorated if the softer specimen of a pair was tapped with a slightly greater velocity than the harder and not possible if the specimens were pressed against the stylus without generating tactile cues of mechanical contact. In contrast, discrimination was possible during active pressing and unaffected by variations in velocity during active tapping. It is concluded that during active movements, kinesthetic information and knowledge of central efferent commands provide useful cues that are not present during passive touch. These cues allow the observer to discriminate differences in object compliance not confounded by differences in applied velocity. }

This work has been particularly focused on the employment of the McKibben muscle to this aim. A prototype of one finger has been realized that is intended to be part of a haptic glove, and is based on an articulated mechanism driven by a McKibben muscle. A dynamic model of the finger has been created and validated; then, it has been used to define the control algorithm of the device. Experimental tests highlighted the static and dynamic effectiveness of the device and proved that a McKibben muscle can be appropriately used in such an application.},

@article{hao2018eutectic,
 abstract = {This paper presents a soft actuator embedded with two types of eutectic alloys which enable sensing, tunable mechanical degrees of freedom (DOF), and variable stiffness properties. To modulate the stiffness of the actuator, we embedded a low melting point alloy (LMPA) in the bottom portion of the soft actuator. Different sections of the LMPA could be selectively melted by the Ni–Cr wires twined underneath. To acquire the curvature information, EGaIn (eutectic gallium indium) was infused into a microchannel surrounding the chambers of the soft actuator. Systematic experiments were performed to characterize the stiffness, tunable DOF, and sensing the bending curvature. We found that the average bending force and elasticity modulus could be increased about 35 and 4000 times, respectively, with the LMPA in a solid state. The entire LMPA could be melted from a solid to a liquid state within 12 s. In particular, up to six different motion patterns could be achieved under each pneumatic pressure of the soft actuator. Furthermore, the kinematics of the actuator under different motion patterns could be obtained by a mathematical model whose input was provided by the EGaIn sensor. For demonstration purposes, a two-fingered gripper was fabricated to grasp various objects by adjusting the DOF and mechanical stiffness.},

 abstract = {Hydraulic control systems have become increasingly popular as the means of actuation for human-scale legged robots and assistive devices. One of the biggest limitations to these systems is their run time untethered from a power source. One way to increase endurance is by improving actuation efficiency. We investigate reducing servovalve throttling losses by using a selective recruitment artificial muscle bundle comprised of three motor units. Each motor unit is made up of a pair of hydraulic McKibben muscles connected to one servovalve. The pressure and recruitment state of the artificial muscle bundle can be adjusted to match the load in an efficient manner, much like the firing rate and total number of recruited motor units is adjusted in skeletal muscle. A volume-based effective initial braid angle is used in the model of each recruitment level. This semi-empirical model is utilized to predict the efficiency gains of the proposed variable recruitment actuation scheme versus a throttling-only approach. A real-time orderly recruitment controller with pressure-based thresholds is developed. This controller is used to experimentally validate the model-predicted efficiency gains of recruitment on a robot arm. The results show that utilizing variable recruitment allows for much higher efficiencies over a broader operating envelope.},

Transtiff can be applied to touch interaction of the screen, augmenting the haptic experience of operating with a stylus pen, which is usually felt uniform. As applications, users can experience the sensation of pen and brush writing on a single device. In addition, it is possible to change the stiffness of the device for each object on the screen to reproduce the tactile feel of that object.},

By perceiving changes in the feel of the finger, we perceive the characteristic of the object when we manipulate sticks, such as pens and brushes. Therefore, we can extend the tactile experience of touching something by controlling a stick's grasping sensation. In this study, we propose Transtiff which has a joint that changes its stiffness dynamically to a stick object that generally cannot bend. We use a piston mechanism that uses a small motor to compress the liquid in a flexible tube to control the stiffness of the joint.},

@article{zhang2017modeling,
 abstract = {Fluidic artificial muscles are popular in robotics and function as biomimetic actuators. Their pneumatic version has been widely investigated. A novel water hydraulic artificial muscle (WHAM) with high strength is developed in this study. WHAMs can be applied to underwater manipulators widely used in ocean development because of their environment-friendly characteristics, high force-to-weight ratio, and good bio-imitability. Therefore, the strength of WHAMs has been improved to fit the requirements of underwater environments and the work pressure of water hydraulic components. However, understanding the mechanical behaviors of WHAMs is necessary because WHAMs use work media and pressure control that are different from those used by pneumatic artificial muscles. This paper presents the static and dynamic characteristics of the WHAM system, including the water hydraulic pressure control circuit. A test system is designed and built to analyze the drive characteristics of the developed WHAM. The theoretical relationships among the amount of contraction, pressure, and output drawing force of the WHAM are tested and verified. A linearized transfer function is proposed, and the dynamic characteristics of the WHAM are investigated through simulation and inertia load experiments. Simulation results agree with the experimental results and show that the proposed model can be applied to the control of WHAM actuators.},

    abstract = {Abstract Soft robots have the appealing advantages of being highly flexible and adaptive to complex environments. However, the low-stiffness nature of the constituent materials makes soft robotic systems incompetent in tasks requiring relatively high load capacity. Despite recent attempts to develop stiffness-tunable soft actuators by employing variable stiffness materials and structures, the reported stiffness-tunable actuators generally suffer from limitations including slow responses, small deformations, and difficulties in fabrication with microfeatures. This work presents a paradigm to design and manufacture fast-response, stiffness-tunable (FRST) soft actuators via hybrid multimaterial 3D printing. The integration of a shape memory polymer layer into the fully printed actuator body enhances its stiffness by up to 120 times without sacrificing flexibility and adaptivity. The printed Joule-heating circuit and fluidic cooling microchannel enable fast heating and cooling rates and allow the FRST actuator to complete a softening–stiffening cycle within 32 s. Numerical simulations are used to optimize the load capacity and thermal rates. The high load capacity and shape adaptivity of the FRST actuator are finally demonstrated by a robotic gripper with three FRST actuators that can grasp and lift objects with arbitrary shapes and various weights spanning from less than 10 g to up to 1.5 kg.},
