abstract = {Providing users with a haptic sensation of the hardness and softness of objects in virtual reality is an open challenge. While physical props and haptic devices help, their haptic properties do not allow for dynamic adjustments. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel technique for changing the perceived stiffness of objects based on a visuo-haptic illusion. We achieved this by manipulating the hands’ Control-to-Display (C/D) ratio in virtual reality while pressing down on an object with fixed stiffness. In the first study (N=12), we determine the detection thresholds of the illusion. Our results show that we can exploit a C/D ratio from 0.7 to 3.5 without user detection. In the second study (N=12), we analyze the illusion’s impact on the perceived stiffness. Our results show that participants perceive the objects to be up to 28.1\% softer and 8.9\% stiffer, allowing for various haptic applications in virtual reality.},

abstract = {Haptic controllers have an important role in providing rich and immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. While previous works have succeeded in creating handheld devices that simulate dynamic properties of rigid objects, such as weight, shape, and movement, recreating the behavior of flexible objects with different stiffness using ungrounded controllers remains an open challenge. In this paper we present ElaStick, a variable-stiffness controller that simulates the dynamic response resulting from shaking or swinging flexible virtual objects. This is achieved by dynamically changing the stiffness of four custom elastic tendons along a joint that effectively increase and reduce the overall stiffness of a perceived object in 2-DoF. We show that with the proposed mechanism, we can render stiffness with high precision and granularity in a continuous range between 10.8 and 71.5Nmm/degree. We estimate the threshold of the human perception of stiffness with a just-noticeable difference (JND) study and investigate the levels of immersion, realism and enjoyment using a VR application.},

We propose interaction techniques using the FlexStylus to improve menu navigation and tool selection. Finally, we describe a study comparing users' ability to match a changing target value using a commercial pressure stylus and the FlexStylus' absolute deformation. When using the FlexStylus, users had a significantly higher accuracy overall. This suggests that deformation may be a useful input method for future work considering stylus augmentation.},

We present the concept and implementation of Drag:on, an ungrounded shape-changing VR controller that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag, i.e. air resistance, and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow occurring at the controller during interaction. By dynamically adjusting its surface area, the controller changes the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. In a user study, we found that Drag:on can provide distinguishable levels of haptic feedback. Our prototype increases the haptic realism in VR compared to standard controllers and when rotated or swung improves the perception of virtual resistance. By this, Drag:on provides haptic feedback suitable for rendering different virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state.},

abstract = {If it becomes possible to represent the feelings of manipulating tools in virtual space, it would be applicable to the skill transfer and training. So, in recent years, a variety of tool-type haptic devices have been developed. Most existing tool-type haptic devices need to be grounded or attached to the user's body ([Sandor et al. 2007], [Hirose et al. 2001] et al), because the reaction force of displayed stimuli should be supported somewhere. However, grounded devices usually limit the workspace, and attached devices demand to wear the device. Recently, devices that only render cutaneous sensation were introduced. These devices stimulate the mechanoreceptors in the skin, and are not constrained by grounding [Guinan et al. 2013], [Minamizawa et al. 2008]. To the best of our knowledge, such cutaneous devices have never been used for a tool-mediated interaction with objects.},

PaCaPa is a cuboid device with two wings that open and close. As the user's stick makes contact with a virtual object, the wings open by a specific degree to dynamically change the pressure on the palm and fingers. The open angle of the wings is calculated from the angle between the virtual stick and hand direction. As the stick bites into the target object, a large force is generated. Our device enables three kinds of renderings: size, shape, and stiffness. We conducted user studies to evaluate the performance of our device. We also evaluated our device in two application scenarios. User feedback and qualitative ratings indicated that our device can make indirect interaction with handheld tools more realistic.},

abstract = {The sensation of being able to feel the shape of an object when grasping it in Virtual Reality (VR) enhances a sense of presence and the ease of object manipulation. Though most prior works focus on force feedback on fingers, the haptic emulation of grasping a 3D shape requires the sensation of touch using the entire hand. Hence, we present Pop-up Prop on Palm (PuPoP), a light-weight pneumatic shape-proxy interface worn on the palm that pops several airbags up with predefined primitive shapes for grasping. When a user's hand encounters a virtual object, an airbag of appropriate shape, ready for grasping, is inflated by way of the use of air pumps; the airbag then deflates when the object is no longer in play. Since PuPoP is a physical prop, it can provide the full sensation of touch to enhance the sense of realism for VR object manipulation. For this paper, we first explored the design and implementation of PuPoP with multiple shape structures. We then conducted two user studies to further understand its applicability. The first study shows that, when in conflict, visual sensation tends to dominate over touch sensation, allowing a prop with a fixed size to represent multiple virtual objects with similar sizes. The second study compares PuPoP with controllers and free-hand manipulation in two VR applications. The results suggest that utilization of dynamically-changing PuPoP, when grasped by users in line with the shapes of virtual objects, enhances enjoyment and realism. We believe that PuPoP is a simple yet effective way to convey haptic shapes in VR.},

    abstract = { Softness perception intrinsically relies on haptic information. However, through everyday experiences we learn correspondences between felt softness and the visual effects of exploratory movements that are executed to feel softness. Here, we studied how visual and haptic information is integrated to assess the softness of deformable objects. Participants discriminated between the softness of two softer or two harder objects using only-visual, only-haptic or both visual and haptic information. We assessed the reliabilities of the softness judgments using the method of constant stimuli. In visuo-haptic trials, discrepancies between the two senses' information allowed us to measure the contribution of the individual senses to the judgments. Visual information (finger movement and object deformation) was simulated using computer graphics; input in visual trials was taken from previous visuo-haptic trials. Participants were able to infer softness from vision alone, and vision considerably contributed to bisensory judgments (∼35\%). The visual contribution was higher than predicted from models of optimal integration (senses are weighted according to their reliabilities). Bisensory judgments were less reliable than predicted from optimal integration. We conclude that the visuo-haptic integration of softness information is biased toward vision, rather than being optimal, and might even be guided by a fixed weighting scheme. }

ABSTRACT={<p>A human can judge the hardness of an object based on the damped natural vibration caused by tapping the surface of the object using a fingertip. In this study, we investigated the influence of the dynamic characteristics of vibrations on the hardness perceived by tapping. Subjectively reported hardness values were related to the dynamic stiffness of several objects. The dynamic stiffness, which characterizes the impulsive response of an object, was acquired across the 40–1,000 Hz frequency range for cuboids of 14 types of materials by administering a hammering test. We performed two psychophysical experiments—a ranking task and a magnitude-estimation tasks—wherein participants rated the perceived hardness of each block by tapping it with a finger. We found that the perceptual effect of dynamic stiffness depends on the frequency. Its effect displayed a peak around 300 Hz and decreased or disappeared at higher frequencies, at which human perceptual capabilities are limited. The acquired results help design hardness experienced by products.</p>}}

A prototype of one finger has been realized that is intended to be part of a haptic glove, and is based on an articulated mechanism driven by a McKibben muscle. A dynamic model of the finger has been created and validated; then, it has been used to define the control algorithm of the device. Experimental tests highlighted the static and dynamic effectiveness of the device and proved that a McKibben muscle can be appropriately used in such an application.},

In this study, we introduced a prototyping platform using a soft pneumatic artificial muscle(PAMs) and modular 3D printed reinforcement. To facilitate a wide variety of applications we propose six types of reinforcement modules capable of either shape deformation and/or variable stiffness. Users can create an approximate prototype using lego-built modules with magnetic connectors. A modeling toolkit can then be used to recreate and customize the prototype structure.

    abstract = {Abstract Soft robots have the appealing advantages of being highly flexible and adaptive to complex environments. However, the low-stiffness nature of the constituent materials makes soft robotic systems incompetent in tasks requiring relatively high load capacity. Despite recent attempts to develop stiffness-tunable soft actuators by employing variable stiffness materials and structures, the reported stiffness-tunable actuators generally suffer from limitations including slow responses, small deformations, and difficulties in fabrication with microfeatures. This work presents a paradigm to design and manufacture fast-response, stiffness-tunable (FRST) soft actuators via hybrid multimaterial 3D printing. The integration of a shape memory polymer layer into the fully printed actuator body enhances its stiffness by up to 120 times without sacrificing flexibility and adaptivity. The printed Joule-heating circuit and fluidic cooling microchannel enable fast heating and cooling rates and allow the FRST actuator to complete a softening–stiffening cycle within 32 s. Numerical simulations are used to optimize the load capacity and thermal rates. The high load capacity and shape adaptivity of the FRST actuator are finally demonstrated by a robotic gripper with three FRST actuators that can grasp and lift objects with arbitrary shapes and various weights spanning from less than 10 g to up to 1.5 kg.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a soft actuator embedded with two types of eutectic alloys which enable sensing, tunable mechanical degrees of freedom (DOF), and variable stiffness properties. To modulate the stiffness of the actuator, we embedded a low melting point alloy (LMPA) in the bottom portion of the soft actuator. Different sections of the LMPA could be selectively melted by the Ni–Cr wires twined underneath. To acquire the curvature information, EGaIn (eutectic gallium indium) was infused into a microchannel surrounding the chambers of the soft actuator. Systematic experiments were performed to characterize the stiffness, tunable DOF, and sensing the bending curvature. We found that the average bending force and elasticity modulus could be increased about 35 and 4000 times, respectively, with the LMPA in a solid state. The entire LMPA could be melted from a solid to a liquid state within 12 s. In particular, up to six different motion patterns could be achieved under each pneumatic pressure of the soft actuator. Furthermore, the kinematics of the actuator under different motion patterns could be obtained by a mathematical model whose input was provided by the EGaIn sensor. For demonstration purposes, a two-fingered gripper was fabricated to grasp various objects by adjusting the DOF and mechanical stiffness.},

Through customized fabrication software, users can decide the properties of components of the interface, such as the size/shape of beads. The software automatically renders a membrane and an inner complex of beads after users decide the properties, which simplifies the manufacturing process of the jamming interface. Moreover, 3D printing allows the interface to have a double structure consisting of multiple rooms functioning jamming independently, which realizes a richer haptic experience. Finally, this paper describes the manufacturing process of the jamming interface using 3D modeling software/3D printing. It demonstrates the merits of this method with several applications, such as the haptic device and the shape-changing controller.},

 abstract = {Hydraulic control systems have become increasingly popular as the means of actuation for human-scale legged robots and assistive devices. One of the biggest limitations to these systems is their run time untethered from a power source. One way to increase endurance is by improving actuation efficiency. We investigate reducing servovalve throttling losses by using a selective recruitment artificial muscle bundle comprised of three motor units. Each motor unit is made up of a pair of hydraulic McKibben muscles connected to one servovalve. The pressure and recruitment state of the artificial muscle bundle can be adjusted to match the load in an efficient manner, much like the firing rate and total number of recruited motor units is adjusted in skeletal muscle. A volume-based effective initial braid angle is used in the model of each recruitment level. This semi-empirical model is utilized to predict the efficiency gains of the proposed variable recruitment actuation scheme versus a throttling-only approach. A real-time orderly recruitment controller with pressure-based thresholds is developed. This controller is used to experimentally validate the model-predicted efficiency gains of recruitment on a robot arm. The results show that utilizing variable recruitment allows for much higher efficiencies over a broader operating envelope.},

 abstract = {Fluidic artificial muscles are popular in robotics and function as biomimetic actuators. Their pneumatic version has been widely investigated. A novel water hydraulic artificial muscle (WHAM) with high strength is developed in this study. WHAMs can be applied to underwater manipulators widely used in ocean development because of their environment-friendly characteristics, high force-to-weight ratio, and good bio-imitability. Therefore, the strength of WHAMs has been improved to fit the requirements of underwater environments and the work pressure of water hydraulic components. However, understanding the mechanical behaviors of WHAMs is necessary because WHAMs use work media and pressure control that are different from those used by pneumatic artificial muscles. This paper presents the static and dynamic characteristics of the WHAM system, including the water hydraulic pressure control circuit. A test system is designed and built to analyze the drive characteristics of the developed WHAM. The theoretical relationships among the amount of contraction, pressure, and output drawing force of the WHAM are tested and verified. A linearized transfer function is proposed, and the dynamic characteristics of the WHAM are investigated through simulation and inertia load experiments. Simulation results agree with the experimental results and show that the proposed model can be applied to the control of WHAM actuators.},

abstract = { The abilities of humans to discriminate the softness of rubber objects of differing compliance with a hand-held tool (a stylus) was measured under experimental conditions that differed as to how the tool was used and the kind of sensory information available. When the subject actively tapped or pressed the compliant objects, they discriminated softness as well by means of a stylus as they did by contacting the objects directly with the fingerpad. Discrimination with the stylus was unaffected by whether the stylus was controlled by one or two fingers. While tapping or pressing a stylus held in a precision grip, the grip force increased before, reached a maximum at the same time as, and decreased in parallel with the compressional force. This relationship was suggestive of anticipatory motor control based on an internal model of the motor system and the physical properties of the object. Discrimination was significantly better when tapping as opposed to pressing the objects with the stylus. This was hypothesized as due to the presence of tactile cues generated by the rapid increase in force rate as the stylus struck and indented the object during tapping. During tapping, the magnitude and rate of compressional force produced by the stylus against the object were greater, the harder the object. An additional cue, possibly kinesthetic, during pressing and tapping was the magnitude of indentation of the specimen by the stylus that was greater, the softer the object. Subjects could discriminate differences on softness by tactile cues alone in the absence of kinesthetic when compliant objects were tapped at approximately the same velocity by the experimenter against a stylus in contact with the subject's passive fingerpad. Discrimination deteriorated if the softer specimen of a pair was tapped with a slightly greater velocity than the harder and not possible if the specimens were pressed against the stylus without generating tactile cues of mechanical contact. In contrast, discrimination was possible during active pressing and unaffected by variations in velocity during active tapping. It is concluded that during active movements, kinesthetic information and knowledge of central efferent commands provide useful cues that are not present during passive touch. These cues allow the observer to discriminate differences in object compliance not confounded by differences in applied velocity. }

People can touch objects on the touch panel display of the tablet PC or smartphone, but only get sensation of touching the surface of the display. Recently, some systems capable of inserting themselves into the display by using retractable stylus have been proposed. Beyond [Lee and Ishii 2010] is one of these systems. It consists of a retractable stylus, a table-top display, an infrared marker and a camera set at an environment. A virtual tip of the stylus is rendered when the retractable stylus is pushed to the table-top display. The head position of the user is detected by the infrared marker and the camera, and the virtual objects and the tip of the stylus are rendered properly according to the head's position. The system enables the user to interact with a virtual object under the table. However, the stylus dose not shrink or extend automatically because the stylus dose not have any actuators such as a motor. So the user is unable to feel the haptic sensation from the virtual object. It is necessary for the user to perceive the force from the virtual object to interact with the object more realistically. Another limitation is the fact that the system is stationary. ImpAct [Withana et al. 2010] is another interaction system with a smartphone and a retractable stylus. The force feedback is represented by simply stopping the shrinkage of the stylus. However, the system gives only the rigid force feedback without tactile sensations. And the system does not give a user the tactile sensation from the virtual objects. In addition, the system does not consider the viewpoint of the user.},

In a within-subjects experiment, 44 participants were asked to play a touch-based game as quickly and accurately as possible across combinations of the two independent variables. After finishing tasks in each condition, they filled out an evaluation questionnaire regarding tactile satisfaction, which addressed perceived feeling of pressing down on the surface, pleasantness, helpfulness, finger fatigue, and degree of elasticity. The results of this experiment show a main effect of touchscreen type on task performance, whereas input device type shows main effects on both task performance and satisfaction. Measures of five key sub-factors of subjective satisfaction are explained, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed.}

    abstract = "{The stiffness properties of an environment are perceived during active manual manipulation primarily by processing force cues and position-based tactile, kinesthetic, and visual information. Using a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) stiffness discrimination task, we tested how the perceiver integrates stiffness-related information based on sensory feedback from one or two modalities and the origins of within-session shifts in stiffness discrimination ability. Two factors were investigated: practice and the amount of available sensory information. Subjects discriminated between the stiffness of two targets that were presented either haptically or visuohaptically in two subsequent blocks. Our results show that prior experience in a unisensory haptic stiffness discrimination block greatly improved performance when visual feedback was subsequently provided along with haptic feedback. This improvement could not be attributed to effects induced by practice or multisensory stimulus presentation. Our findings suggest that optimization integration theories of multisensory perception need to account for past sensory experience that may affect current perception of the task even within a single session.}",

    abstract = {This article explores direct touch and manipulation techniques for surface computing environments using a specialized haptic force feedback stylus, called ImpAct, which can dynamically change its effective length and equipped with sensors to calculate its orientation in world coordinates. When a user pushes it against a touch screen, the physical stylus shrinks and a rendered projection of the stylus is drawn inside the screen, giving the illusion that it is submerged in the display device. Once the users can see the stylus immersed in the digital world below the screen, he or she can manipulate and interact with the virtual objects with active haptic sensations. In this article, ImpAct's functionality, design, and prototype applications are described in detail with relevance to the concept of direct touch, giving special attention to novel interaction scenarios and design challenges. Furthermore, a technical evaluation was done to study ImpAct's accuracy and controlability and the results presented. This article concludes by discussing ImpAct's current limitations and future perspectives as a direct touch and manipulation tool.},
