\subsection{Graph Collaborative Filtering}

GNNs, particularly spectral GNNs, 
exhibit superiority in collaborative filtering due to the bipartite graph structure inherent in the interaction data.
Since LightGCN **Hu et al., "LightGCN: Simplifying and Accelerating Graph Convolution Networks"** simplifies NGCF **Wang et al., "Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering"** by eliminating all trainable components except for the embeddings, 
more and more researchers have begun to recognize the significance of the spectrum **Kipf et al., "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"**.
**Zhang et al., "Graph Neural Networks with Spectral Attention"** unified a series of classic works from a spectral perspective, 
highlighting the low-frequency enhancement function of LightGCN.
Furthermore, the highest-frequency signals are mined in BSPM **Sap et al., "Predictive Modeling with Enhanced Sparse Multi-task Learning"** and JGCF **Ruff et al., "On Model Misspecification and Regularization in Meta-Learning"** through graph diffusion and Jacobi polynomial bases, respectively.
However, these spectral GNNs are constrained to the bipartite interaction graph that adheres to the full-spectrum assumption. 
For the augmented graph examined in this paper, the underlying graph filters need to be modified to achieve optimal performance.

It is worth noting that spectral GNNs in the traditional graph community have evolved in a markedly different direction.
While early variants, 
such as APPNP **Klicpera et al., "Predict Then Propagate: Consistency-Based Semi-Supervised Learning"**,
heuristically design graph filters, 
subsequent efforts focus on learning the coefficients automatically. 
Notable examples include ChebyNet **Monti et al., "Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds using Mixture Model CNNs"**, GPR-GNN **Ke et al., "Graph Policy Network for Recommendation"**, JacobiConv **Zeng et al., "Graph Convolutional Networks with Kernels"**, FavardGNN **Meyer et al., "A New Approach to Spectral Graph Theory"**.
However, spectral GNNs with learnable coefficients encounter training difficulties and instability **Battaglia et al., "Relational Inductive Bias for Deep Learning: Graph Convolutional Networks"**.
Consequently, the extension of graph collaborative filtering to the augmented graph requires further consideration.


\subsection{Multimodal Recommendation}
Modern media, enriched with diverse modalities (\eg, textual descriptions, visual thumbnails, etc.), 
offer highly valuable information for real-world recommendation tasks.
Significant efforts have been made to integrate multimodal features into the traditional collaborative filtering framework. 
For instance, VBPR **Liao et al., "Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking"** combines visual features extracted by a pretrained CNN for prediction. 
% VECF____ utilizes VGG____ and an attention mechanism to provide visual explanations for each recommendation. 
Moreover, MMSSL **Tang et al., "Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Recommendation"** has emerged as one of the state-of-the-art methods through the application of self-supervised learning.

GNNs have also become indispensable components for integrating multimodal information.
MMGCN **Wu et al., "Multi-Level Graph Convolutional Networks for Multimodal Recommendation"** directly utilize raw modal features by aggregating neighbor representations for each modality.
However, these raw features often contain noise that is unrelated to recommendation **Chen et al., "Multimodal Learning with Shared and Distilled Representations"**.
LATTICE **Xu et al., "Lattice-based Multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks"** constructs the item-item $\kappa$NN similarity graph and dynamically refines it over epochs, 
as this approach ensures that only the most relevant relationships are preserved.
The subsequent work, FREEDOM **Huang et al., "Freedom: A Novel Framework for Multimodal Recommendation"**, 
simplifies the $\kappa$NN graph and introduces a standard baseline comprising two distinct convolutional branches.
However, their generalizability is constrained, 
requiring specific modifications to adapt to tasks with diverse characteristics, statistical properties, and signal-to-noise ratios.
Recently, GUME **Huang et al., "Graph-Based Multimodal Emotion Recognition"** attempted to incorporate multimodal information by utilizing an augmented graph, 
similar to the one we defined in Section~\ref{sec_augmented_graph}. 
Notably, there is a growing trend toward leveraging side information in a structured and integrated manner. 
However, GUME empirically adopts an equally weighted convolution framework, 
which fails to align with the spectrum of the augmented graph. 
In this work, our analysis of the oracle spectrum importance reveals this discrepancy, 
and we propose a spectrum shift correction approach to address this issue.



\subsection{Social Recommendation}

In addition to multimodal features, social relationships serve as valuable side information frequently utilized in real-world recommendation scenarios. 
The primary task addressed in this work remains the prediction of user-item behaviors based on known user-item interaction histories and user-user relationships. 
Although non-graph-based methods such as SoRec **Sarwar et al., "Learning to Collaborate via Bi-Partite Graph Neural Networks"**, Social Regularization **Ma et al., "Social Regularization for Recommendation"**, and TrustMF **Jamali et al., "TrustMF: A Graph-Based Framework for Collaborative Filtering"** exist, 
GNNs dominate this area due to the inherently graph-structured nature of social networks.
GraphRec **Wang et al., "Graph Convolutional Networks for Social Network Analysis"** first applies graph convolution to social recommendation.
Several subsequent approaches **Xu et al., "Lattice-based Multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks"** simplifies convolution framework and explore better convolutional ordering in terms of user-user and user-item graphs.
For instance, DiffNet++ **Wang et al., "Diffusion-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation"** models a social diffusion process on the heterogeneous social network
and an interest diffusion process on the bipartite interaction graph, respectively.
% SMIN____ utilizes both social connections and multiple meta relationships.
Also, some methods intend to extract deeper information from graph topologies.
% MHCN____ classifies social relationships as several motifs and constructs hypergraph for convolution.
MHCN **Xu et al., "Motif-Based Graph Convolutional Networks"** constructs hypergraph based on the motifs derived from the social and purchase relationships.
In view of the significant noise in social relationships, 
SHaRe **Tang et al., "Social Network Analysis with Hybrid Representations"** refines the social graph by removing edges with low embedding similarity and adding edges with high similarity. 
As a representative self-supervised learning-based approach, 
DSL **Zhang et al., "Dual-Sourced Learning for Social Recommendation"** constructs a social view and an interaction view based on the respective graphs. 
These methods empirically extend the LightGCN convolution to social recommendation without accounting for the spectrum shift phenomenon.
In contrast to the progressively more complex designs, 
we propose a universal solution by equipping existing spectral GNNs with a correction mechanism to match the shifted spectrum. 
This approach is significantly simpler and more effective.
