%\textbf{Part 1: General description on category theory for databases. }

The application of category theory to databases has a rich history, with its earliest instances dating back to the 1990s. Notable papers from this period include those by Tuijn and Gyssens (1989,1996) ____ , Baclawski et al. (1994) ____ , Libkin (1995) ____ , Hofstede et al. (1996) ____ , etc. While the majority of previous papers focus on the application of category theory to relational databases, there are also works that apply category theory to object databases and graph databases. The existing literature in this field can be broadly categorized into three main areas: \textbf{category theory for conceptual modeling,  for query languages, and for data transformation}. To provide an overview of the related works, Table \ref{tab:relatedwork} presents a taxonomy of these contributions.

%As for previous works on using category theory to define a conceptual model.  Paper ____ proposes a category theory approach for conceptual modeling, by choosing appropriate instance categories and adding features such as missing values, multi-valued relations, and uncertainty into conceptual data models. Paper ____  defines a respective schema category and operations using standard categorical approaches (such as functors). Paper ____ defines Well-known conceptual data modelling concepts, such as relationship types, generalization, specialization, collection types, and constraint types.  Paper ____ shows how commutative diagrams have been used to develop new methodologies in ER modeling, constraint specification, and process modeling.

In order to apply category theory to conceptual models, previous works define concepts in the (extended) ER model using category theory to provide a general and formal framework. In particular, Lippe and Hofstede (1996) ____ define total role constraints as epimorphisms, unique constraints as monomorphisms, and generalization as colimits. Johnson and Dampney (1993) ____ demonstrate the application of commutative diagrams in developing novel methodologies for constraint specification and process modeling. More recent works by Spivak  (2014) ____  consider database schema as a notion of ``onto-logical logs" (olog), which applies the basic concepts of category theory for knowledge representation.

%resent a category theory-based approach to conceptual modeling in their paper . They propose the selection of suitable instance categories and introduce features such as missing values, multi-valued relations, and uncertainty to enhance conceptual data models.  Hofstede et al. (1996) ____ focus on defining well-known concepts in conceptual data modeling using category theory. These include relationship types, generalization, specialization, collection types, and constraint types. Additionally,


%As for previous work on category theory for data mitigation: Paper ____  showed that morphisms of database schemas induce three "data migration functors", which translate instances from one schema to the other in canonical ways. For example, they Use push-forwards to construct joins of tables. In contrast, this paper proposes to use limit objects to model join operations. Paper ____ studied the data transformation capabilities associated with schemas that are presented by directed multi-graphs and path equations.  They also present an algebraic query language FQL based on these functors.




In the field of category theory applied to query languages, Moggi (1991) ____ proposes to use monads to organize the semantics of programming constructs. Wadler ____ (1990) shows that monads are also useful in organizing syntax, in particular, they explain the
"list-comprehension" syntax of functional programming. Libkin and Wong ____ exploit theoretical foundations for querying databases based on bags, showcasing how database operations on collections align with the categorical notion of a monad. Furthermore, Rosebrugh (1991) ____ presents a categorical terminology for describing relational databases, with a particular focus on studying database dynamics by considering updates as database objects within a suitable category indexed by a topos. Libkin (1995) ____ employs universality properties, a central concept in category theory, to propose syntax for query languages that incorporate approximations.  Gibbons et al. (2018) ____ delve into the role of adjunctions, which are categorical generalizations of Galois connections, in the processing of collections. These papers collectively contribute to the field by leveraging category theory to  deepen our understanding of database query languages.



Regarding previous work on the application of category theory to data transformation,  Spivak (2010) ____ demonstrates how morphisms of database schemata give rise to three distinct data migration functors, which serve as powerful tools for translating instances between different schemata in canonical ways. He employs push-forwards to construct joins of tables. In contrast, our paper propose the utilization of limit objects to model join operations.  Rosebrugh et al. (1991) ____ presents a categorical framework for data transformation that incorporates colimits and commutative diagrams.



While previous pioneering works have explored the application of category theory to various aspects of databases, this paper makes a unique contribution by identifying a connection between the reduced representation of a category and database normal form theory. By establishing this connection, the paper sheds light on the principles for defining a unified theoretical framework for multi-model normal forms. 


    Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between the category data model and the object-oriented (OO) data model (e.g. ____). Although both models can be viewed as directed graphs, their semantic definitions differ significantly. The OO model defines objects and methods, while the category model defines objects and morphisms (functions). Unlike methods, morphisms have more rigorous mathematical definitions. Category theory offers a comprehensive set of precise mathematical terminologies and theories, which can lead to valuable insights for databases.

%\textbf{Part 4: Summarizing}

%While the existing works are theoretically interesting to show the broad application of the language of theory in different fields, from the perspective of the database community, category theory does not play an essential role in practical database theory and algorithms. The possible explanation is that it lacks convincing examples to show that category theory can be used to solve real database problems. If category theory can only provide another terminology or view to the known database theory and algorithm, then its impact on databases becomes limited. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified framework for multi-model data which contributes to one important problem in databases.
