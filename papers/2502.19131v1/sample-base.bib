%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Object-oriented database systems are the focus of current research and development efforts. Yet, there is no commonly accepted object model, nor is it clear whether such a model can be developed. This paper reports on efforts to develop a formal framework that contains most features found in current object oriented database systems. The framework contains two parts. The first is a structural object model, including concepts such as structured objects, identity, and some form of inheritance. For this model, we explain the distinction between values and (abstract) objects, describe a system as a directed graph, and discuss declarative languages. The second part deals with higher-order concepts, such as classes and functions as data, methods, and inheritance. This part is a sketch, and leaves many issues unresolved. Throughout the paper, the emphasis is on logic-oriented modeling.}

abstract = {We propose here a data model that generalizes the relational, hierarchical, and network models. A database scheme in this model is a directed graph, where leaves represent data and internal nodes represent connections between the data. Instances are constructed from r-values, which constitute the data space, and l-values, which constitute the address space. We define a logic for the model, and describe a non-procedural quary language that is based on the logic. Finally, we describe an algebraic query language and show that it is equivalent to the logical language.},

abstract = {Multivalued dependencies (MVDs) are data dependencies that appear frequently in the “real world” and play an important role in designing relational database schemes. Given a set of MVDs to constrain a database scheme, it is desirable to obtain an equivalent set of MVDs that do not have any redundancies. In this paper we define such a set of MVDs, called reduced MVDs, and present an algorithm to obtain reduced MVDs. We also define a minimal cover of a set of MVDs, which is a set of reduced MVDs, and give an efficient method to find such a minimal cover. The significance and properties of reduced MVDs are also discussed in the context of database design (e.g., 4NF decomposition) and conflict-free MVDs.},

First, we list the well known rules for functional dependencies. Then we investigate the rules for multivalued dependencies. It is shown that for each rule for functional dependencies the same rule or a similar rule holds for multivalued dependencies. There is, however, one additional rule for multivalued dependencies that has no parallel among the rules for functional dependencies. Finally, we present rules that involve functional and multivalued dependencies together. The main result of the paper is that the rules presented are complete for the family of functional and multivalued dependencies.},

In the first part, we use polynomial functors to derive a new convenient formalism for trees, and obtain a natural and conceptual construction of the category Ω of Moerdijk and Weiss; its main properties are described in terms of some factorization systems. Although the constructions are motivated and explained in terms of polynomial functors, they all amount to elementary manipulations with finite sets. In the second part, we describe polynomial endofunctors and monads as structures built from trees, characterizing the images of several nerve functors from polynomial endofunctors and monads into presheaves on categories of trees. Polynomial endofunctors and monads over a base are characterized by a sheaf condition on categories of decorated trees. In the absolute case, one further condition is needed, a certain projectivity condition, which serves also to characterize polynomial endofunctors and monads among (colored) collections and operads.}",

We define "projection-join normal form" (PJ/NF), which is the ultimate normal form when only projection and join are allowed. Aho, Beeri and Ullman made the counterintuitive discovery that there is a relation schema with a valid decomposition into three of its projections without the decomposition being equivalent to a cascade of decompositions, each into two projections. Because of this possibility, there exist bizarre relation schemata that are in fourth normal form but not in PJ/NF. We also discuss issues associated with allowing the union operator.},

The running time of the algorithm is O(| Y |‖Σ‖), where Y is the number of attributes in Y and ‖Σ‖ is the size of the description of Σ. The problem of constructing the dependency basis of a set of attributes X is also investigated. It is shown that the dependency basis can be found in O(S‖Σ‖) time, where S is the number of sets in the dependency basis. Since functional and multivalued dependencies correspond to a subclass of propositional logic (that can be viewed as a generalization of Horn clauses), the algorithm given is also an efficient inference procedure for this subclass of propositional logic.},

abstract="Unlike traditional database management systems which are organized around a single data model, a multi-model database (MMDB) utilizes a single, integrated back-end to support multiple data models, such as document, graph, relational, and key-value. As more and more platforms are proposed to deal with multi-model data, it becomes crucial to establish a benchmark for evaluating the performance and usability of MMDBs. Previous benchmarks, however, are inadequate for such scenario because they lack a comprehensive consideration for multiple models of data. In this paper, we present a benchmark, called UniBench, with the goal of facilitating a holistic and rigorous evaluation of MMDBs. UniBench consists of a mixed data model, a synthetic multi-model data generator, and a set of core workloads. Specifically, the data model simulates an emerging application: Social Commerce, a Web-based application combining E-commerce and social media. The data generator provides diverse data format including JSON, XML, key-value, tabular, and graph. The workloads are comprised of a set of multi-model queries and transactions, aiming to cover essential aspects of multi-model data management. We implemented all workloads on ArangoDB and OrientDB to illustrate the feasibility of our proposed benchmarking system and show the learned lessons through the evaluation of these two multi-model databases. The source code and data of this benchmark can be downloaded at http://udbms.cs.helsinki.fi/bench/.",

    abstract = {Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs -- categories in disguise. After explaining the "big three" concepts of category theory -- categories, functors, and natural transformations -- the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with selected solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.}
