\section{Complexity analysis of algorithms}
\label{sec:complexity}

The time complexity of Algorithm \ref{alg:closureFD} is dominated by the cost to compute the closure of the functional dependencies (i.e. Line 4). Let $m$ and $n$ be the number of objects and arrows in $G$, and let $d$ be the number of FDs. The total time for computing the FD closure is $O((d+n) \cdot m)$ based on the implementations of the previous work (e.g. \cite{10.1145/320493.320489}). Using this procedure, one can implement Algorithm \ref{alg:closureFD} with the time $O((d+n) \cdot m)$.

The time complexity of Algorithm \ref{alg:closureMVD} is essentially that of the computation of the closure of FDs and MVDs. Let $m$ be the number of objects in $G$, $n$ the number of arrows in $G$, and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the number of FDs and MVDs, respectively. The total time for computing the FD closure is $O((d_1+n) \cdot m)$ and MVD closure is $O((d_2+n) \cdot m^3)$ based on the implementations of papers  (\cite{10.1145/320493.320489, 10.1145/320613.320614}. Using these procedures, one can implement Algorithm \ref{alg:2RR} with the time $O((d_1+d_2+n) \cdot m^3)$.

The time complexities of Algorithms \ref{alg:1RR} and \ref{alg:2RR} are essentially equivalent to those of computing the closures of the categories. In other words, they mirror the time complexities of Algorithm \ref{alg:closureFD} and \ref{alg:closureMVD}, respectively, which have been previously analyzed.

Algorithms \ref{alg:map2relationschema}, \ref{alg:map2DTD} and \ref{alg:map2graphschema} demonstrate a computational complexity of $O(m+n)$, where $m$ denotes the number of objects in $G$, $n$ the number of arrows in $G$, as each arrow is processed once.
