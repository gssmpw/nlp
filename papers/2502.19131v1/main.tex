\begin{abstract}
%Modern database systems face a significant challenge in effectively handling the Variety of data. This paper presents a categorical framework that addresses this challenge by unifying three types of structured data: relation, XML, and graph-structured data. Leveraging the language of category theory, our framework offers a sound formal abstraction for representing these data types. The primary objective is to establish a unified data model that enables research and techniques for multi-model data management.

Modern database systems face a significant challenge in effectively handling the Variety of data. The primary objective of this paper is to establish a unified data model and theoretical framework for multi-model data management. To achieve this, we present a categorical framework to unify three types of structured or semi-structured data: relation, XML, and graph-structured data. Utilizing the language of category theory, our framework offers a sound formal abstraction for representing these diverse data types. We extend the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram with enriched semantic constraints, incorporating categorical ingredients such as pullback, pushout and limit. Furthermore, we develop a categorical normal form theory which is applied to category data to reduce redundancy and facilitate data maintenance. Those normal forms are applicable to relation, XML and graph data simultaneously, thereby eliminating the need for ad-hoc, model-specific definitions as found in separated normal form theories before. Finally, we discuss the connections between this new normal form framework and  Boyce-Codd normal form, fourth normal form, and XML normal form.
