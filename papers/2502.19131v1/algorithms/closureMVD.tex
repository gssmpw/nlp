\KwIn{A graph representation $G$, a set of functional dependencies $F$ and a set of multivalued dependencies $M$} 
\KwOut{The relevant closure representation of $(G,F,M)^+$} 
\DontPrintSemicolon

 Convert $G$ to a set of functional dependencies denoted by $FD(G)$;
 
$D$ = $FD(G) \cup F \cup M$;
 
\ForEach{  $X \in LHS(D)$} 
{
        \If{$X \notin G$}
        {
        add $X$ in $G$;
        }
        

        Compute the FD closure attributes of $X$ based on $D$: giving $X^+$;

        \ForEach{  $Y \in X^+$ and $Y \in G$} 
        {
            \If{$X \to Y $ is not an arrow in $G$}
            {
            add an arrow from $X$ to $Y$ in $G$;
            }
        }

       Identify all MVD objects in $G$ based on the inferred MVDs from $D$;
}
