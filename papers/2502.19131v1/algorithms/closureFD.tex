\KwIn{A graph representation $G$ and  a set of functional dependencies $F$ } 
\KwOut{The relevant closure representation  $(G,F)^+$} 
\DontPrintSemicolon

 Convert $G$ to a set of functional dependencies denoted by $FD(G)$;
 
 $D = FD(G) \cup F$;
 
\ForEach{  $X \in LHS(D)$} 
{
    \If{$X \notin G$}
        {
        add $X$ in G; 
        }
    
    Compute the closure attributes of $X$: giving $X^+$;

   \ForEach{  $Y \in X^+$ and $Y \in G$} 
    {
     \If{ there is no arrow from $X$ to $Y$ in $G$}
        {
        add an arrow from $X$ to $Y$ in $G$;
        }
    }
    
        
}
