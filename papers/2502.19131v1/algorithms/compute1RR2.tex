\KwIn{A graph representation $G$ and  a set of functional dependencies $F$} 
\KwOut{The first reduced representation of $G$} 
\DontPrintSemicolon

 Use Algorithm \ref{alg:closureFD} to compute a closure graph $(G,F)^+$;

\ForEach {arrow  $f: X \to Y$ in $(G,F)^+$} 
{
    \If{($(G,F)^+ - f)$ is equivalent to $(G,F)^+$}
    {
    Remove $f$ in $(G,F)^+$;
    }
}

Return the updated graph $(G,F)^+$;
