\begin{abstract}
The use of \acp{auv} for surveying, mapping, and inspecting unexplored underwater areas plays a crucial role, where maneuverability and power efficiency are key factors for extending the use of these platforms, making \ac{6dof} holonomic platforms essential tools. Although \ac{pid} and \acl{mpc} controllers are widely used in these applications, they often require accurate system knowledge, struggle with repeatability when facing payload or configuration changes, and can be time-consuming to fine-tune. While more advanced methods based on \acl{drl} have been proposed, they are typically limited to operating in fewer degrees of freedom.
%
This paper proposes a novel \acs{drl}-based approach for controlling holonomic \ac{6dof} \acp{auv} using the \ac{tqc} algorithm, which does not require manual tuning and directly feeds commands to the thrusters without prior knowledge of their configuration. Furthermore, it incorporates power consumption directly into the reward function. Simulation results show that the \acl{tqc-hp} method achieves better performance to a fine-tuned \ac{pid} controller when reaching a goal point, while the \acl{tqc-ea} method demonstrates slightly lower performance but consumes \SI{30}{\percent} less power on average.
