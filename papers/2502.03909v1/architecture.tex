\section{Architecture}
We utilize the traffic generator to generate a large dataset within a virtualized cloud environment based on OpenStack. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} depicts the architecture of the testbed. It consists of two virtual networks interconnected via a router running Zeek\footnote{\url{https://zeek.org}} to record all traffic. The external zone contains five clients, while the internal zone hosts five servers. Both networks are connected to the internet to include realistic web traffic in the dataset. To prevent client fingerprinting and ensure data authenticity, each client operates in both normal and benign modes across different iterations.
