\section{Dataset}
We process the traffic recordings to create flow-level features. This results in a total of 82 features capturing various aspects, such as packet counts, inter-arrival times, payload characteristics as well as metadata about service type and duration. Each sample is labeled based on the logs generated by the traffic generator and result in 21 classes, including 20 attack classes and one benign class. In total, the dataset includes 12,059,749 samples. The dataset can be downloaded via the osnaData Repsoitory \cite{FK2/MOCIY8_2025}.

Table~\ref{tab:class_distribution} shows the distribution of the samples over the different classes. Among the attack classes, \emph{portscan} and \emph{hostsweep\_Pn} make up a large proportion of the dataset. In total, the dataset includes 825,187 benign samples that do not cover an attack. For each of the six web attacks (\emph{xss}, \emph{sql}, \emph{dos}, \emph{bruteforce}, \emph{ssrf}, \emph{revshell}), classes exist in both HTTP and HTTPS versions. For classification purposes, these classes might be kept as they are or merged, to apply classification independent of the protocol. For \emph{ssh\_login}, classes exist for successful as well as unsuccessful attempts, in the classes \emph{ssh\_login} and \emph{ssh\_login\_succesful}, respectively.

We extract 80 flow-level features from the network traffic recordings using the \emph{Zeek FlowMeter} tool\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zeek-flowmeter/zeek-flowmeter}}, and additionally the service type and traffic direction for a total of 82 features. For most metrics, statistics such as the minimum, maximum, total, average, and standard deviation within a flow are computed. Features like \emph{flow\_duration}, the inter-arrival time of packets (e.g., \emph{fwd\_iat.min} and \emph{fwd\_iat.avg}) and the idle time capture temporal characteristics. Packet counts and directional statistics are given as the total packets in forward/backward direction, also in relation to the flow time and the ratio between forward and backward packets. The packet payloads are extracted as statistics about the payload length (e.g., \emph{fwd\_pkts\_payload.avg} and \emph{payload\_bytes\_per\_second}). Additionally, features about the header size, TCP control flags and bulk statistics are generated.
A more detailed description of each feature can be seen in the repository of the Zeek FlowMeter tool.
