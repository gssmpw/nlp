\section*{Impact Statement}

Our research enhances the robustness of LLM unlearning against relearning and jailbreaking attacks by leveraging smoothness optimization, thereby strengthening data privacy and regulatory compliance. By integrating techniques such as sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), we achieve more reliable unlearning, reducing unintended knowledge retention and reinforcing model security. Furthermore, this study establishes a critical link between smoothness optimization and unlearning, helping bridge the gap between foundational optimization research and use-inspired advancements in LLM unlearning.

However, enhanced unlearning could be misused to selectively erase essential knowledge, while stronger resistance to relearning may hinder the recovery of valuable information. To address these risks, strict ethical standards and regulatory oversight are essential. Future research should prioritize governance, fairness, and auditing to ensure AI technologies are developed responsibly and transparently.


% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.
