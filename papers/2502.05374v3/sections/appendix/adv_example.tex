\section{Generation Examples under Jailbreaking Attack}
\label{appendix: adv_examples}

\textbf{Table\,\ref{tab: adv_examples}} presents examples generated by the NPO and NPO+SAM unlearned models under jailbreaking attacks. For better comparison, we also include the generation examples from the original model alongside the ground truth labels. As we can see, the NPO+SAM model consistently generates responses different from the label, regardless of the presence of an adversarial prompt, demonstrating that SAM enhances the robustness of NPO against jailbreaking attacks. In contrast, when subjected to adversarial prompts, the NPO-unlearned model produces responses identical to both the label and the original model's output.

\caption{\small{Examples of responses from the WMDP Bio evaluation set with and without the adversarial prompt for the original model, the NPO-unlearned model, and the NPO+SAM-unlearned model. \textremarkadvprompt{Dark yellow} denotes the adversarial prefix. \textremarksafe{Green} highlights responses that differ from the label, indicating successful unlearning. \textremarkdanger{Red} marks responses that are identical to the label, signifying unlearning failure.}}
