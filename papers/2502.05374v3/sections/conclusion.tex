To mitigate the vulnerability of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks, we explored the role of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) in enhancing unlearning robustness and established novel connections with broader smoothness optimization techniques. Through loss landscape analysis, we demonstrated how smoothness optimization impacts unlearning effectiveness and stability. Extensive experiments confirmed that smoothness-enhanced LLM unlearning significantly improves robustness, with SAM-based unlearning emerging as a particularly effective defense against relearning attacks as well as input-level jailbreaking attacks.
