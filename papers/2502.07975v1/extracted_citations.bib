We show that, when players learn using weighted stochastic fictitious play and so place greater weight on recent experience, the time average of play often converges in these “unstable” games, even while mixed strategies and beliefs continue to cycle. This time average, the TASP, is related to the cycle identified by Shapley [L.S. Shapley, Some topics in two person games, in: M. Dresher, et al. (Eds.), Advances in Game Theory, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1964]. The TASP can be close to or quite distinct from Nash equilibrium.},

Specifically, we prove that every zero-sum game possesses a unique global replicator attractor, which we then characterise. Most surprisingly, this attractor depends only on each player’s preference order over their own strategies and not on the cardinal payoff values, defined by a finite directed graph we call the game’s preference graph. When the game is symmetric, this graph is a tournament whose nodes are strategies; when the game is not symmetric, this graph is the game’s response graph. We discuss the consequences of our results on chain recurrence and Nash equilibria.}

The response graph has nodes which are strategy profiles, with an arc between profiles if they differ in the strategy of a single player, with the direction of the arc indicating the preferred option for that player. Response graphs, and particularly their sink strongly connected components, play an important role in modern techniques in evolutionary game theory and multi-agent learning. We show that the response graph is a simple and well-motivated model of strategic interaction which captures many non-trivial properties of a game, despite not depending on cardinal payoffs. We characterise the games which share a response graph with a zero-sum or potential game respectively, and demonstrate a duality between these sets. This allows us to understand the influence of these properties on the response graph. The response graphs of Matching Pennies and Coordination are shown to play a key role in all two-player games: every non-iteratively-dominated strategy takes part in a subgame with these graph structures. As a corollary, any game sharing a response graph with both a zero-sum game and potential game must be dominance-solvable. Finally, we demonstrate our results on some larger games.},

We settle an open problem establishing that under the replicator, {\textbackslash}emph\{sink chain components\}—a topological notion of long-run outcome of a dynamical system—always exist and are approximated by the {\textbackslash}emph\{sink connected components\} of the game’s response graph. More specifically, each sink chain component contains a sink connected component of the response graph, as well as all mixed strategy profiles whose support consists of pure profiles in the same connected component, a set we call the {\textbackslash}emph\{content\} of the connected component. As a corollary, all profiles are chain recurrent in games with strongly connected response graphs. In any two-player game sharing a response graph with a zero-sum game, the sink chain component is unique. In two-player zero-sum and potential games the sink chain components and sink connected components are in a one-to-one correspondence, and we conjecture that this holds in all games.},

              We introduce

              -
              Rank
              , a principled evolutionary dynamics methodology, for the
              evaluation
              and
              ranking
              of agents in large-scale multi-agent interactions, grounded in a novel dynamical game-theoretic solution concept called
              Markov
              -
              Conley chains
              (MCCs). The approach leverages continuous-time and discrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems applied to empirical games, and scales tractably in the number of agents, in the type of interactions (beyond dyadic), and the type of empirical games (symmetric and asymmetric). Current models are fundamentally limited in one or more of these dimensions, and are not guaranteed to converge to the desired game-theoretic solution concept (typically the Nash equilibrium).
              $\alpha$
              -Rank automatically provides a ranking over the set of agents under evaluation and provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and long-term dynamics in terms of basins of attraction and sink components. This is a direct consequence of the correspondence we establish to the dynamical MCC solution concept when the underlying evolutionary model’s ranking-intensity parameter,
              $\alpha$
              , is chosen to be large, which exactly forms the basis of
              $\alpha$
              -Rank. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, which is a static solution concept based solely on fixed points, MCCs are a dynamical solution concept based on the Markov chain formalism, Conley’s Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems, and the core ingredients of dynamical systems: fixed points, recurrent sets, periodic orbits, and limit cycles. Our
              $\alpha$
              -Rank method runs in polynomial time with respect to the total number of pure strategy profiles, whereas computing a Nash equilibrium for a general-sum game is known to be intractable. We introduce mathematical proofs that not only provide an overarching and unifying perspective of existing continuous- and discrete-time evolutionary evaluation models, but also reveal the formal underpinnings of the
              $\alpha$
              -Rank methodology. We illustrate the method in canonical games and empirically validate it in several domains, including AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuJoCo Soccer, and Poker.},

Traditionally, researchers have focused on using well-known games to build strong agents. This progress, however, can be better informed by characterizing games and their topological landscape. Tackling this latter question can facilitate understanding of agents and help determine what game an agent should target next as part of its training. Here, we show how network measures applied to response graphs of large-scale games enable the creation of a landscape of games, quantifying relationships between games of varying sizes and characteristics. We illustrate our findings in domains ranging from canonical games to complex empirical games capturing the performance of trained agents pitted against one another. Our results culminate in a demonstration leveraging this information to generate new and interesting games, including mixtures of empirical games synthesized from real world games.},

	abstract = {We consider a class of matrix games in which successful strategies are rewarded by high reproductive rates, so become more likely to participate in subsequent playings of the game. Thus, over time, the strategy mix should evolve to some type of optimal or stable state. Maynard Smith and Price (1973) have introduced the concept of ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) to describe a stable state of the game. We attempt to model the dynamics of the game both in the continuous case, with a system of non-linear first-order differential equations, and in the discrete case, with a system of non-linear difference equations. Using this model, we look at the notions of stability and asymptotic behavior. Our notion of stable equilibrium for the continuous dynamic includes, but is somewhat more general than, the notion of ESS.},
