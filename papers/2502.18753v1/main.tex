\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
The Open \gls{ran} paradigm for \oran networks is pivotal in transforming cellular network design. Grounded in the principles of disaggregation, virtualization, and programmable radios, components are interconnected through open, standardized interfaces, ensuring multi-vendor interoperability. This approach enables the deployment of flexible architectures built on cloud-native principles. %while
The %resiliency and 
reconfigurability of the \gls{ran} is further enhanced through \glspl{ric}, streaming \gls{ran} telemetry and implementing control policies via a closed-loop mechanism~\cite{polese2023understanding}. Both near- and non-real time \glspl{ric}, deployed at the \gls{ran}'s edge, leverage xApps and rApps to optimize network management and resource allocation. This functionality further advances the integration of \gls{ai} for the \gls{ran} and \gls{ai} on the \gls{ran}, fostering the development of intelligent and adaptive \gls{ran} architectures~\cite{AIRANAlliance2024}.

At the same time, \glspl{ris} are envisioned to be an integral part of \gls{nextg} cellular architectures, enabling smart propagation environments that can be controlled through %\gls{sdr} techniques
programmable \gls{rf} components~\cite{liaskos2022software}. Thanks to their reconfigurability, \glspl{ris} can manipulate electromagnetic waves, reshaping wireless propagation to optimize spectrum utilization and efficiency, particularly in %This is also needed to overcome side-effects in 
multi-operator networks~\cite{angjo2023side}. This reconfiguration capability aligns with \oran's objectives of developing adaptable and resource-efficient \glspl{ran}. 

Intelligent control loops with xApps in \oran have attracted widespread attention from the research community~\cite{bonati2023openran}. In~\cite{tsampazi2024pandora}, the authors explore the impact of xApps embedding \gls{drl} agents to manage the \gls{bs}'s slicing and scheduling control policies across various network deployments on the Colosseum testbed. In addition, several efforts have been conducted in the optimization of wireless propagation with \glspl{ris}. Some previous works~\cite{li2020reconfigurable,diamanti2021energy,diamanti2021prospect} have focused on the use of \glspl{ris} and constructive beams to achieve coherent signal construction at the \gls{bs}, for maximizing the achieved \gls{rssi}.  Finally, a system-level experimental evaluation of \gls{ris}-enabled deployments and their cross-layer optimization, leveraging the full protocol stack on the Colosseum testbed has been discussed in~\cite{tsampazi2024system}.

However, limited research has focused on bridging %the aforementioned %\gls{nextg} 
%technologies. 
\oran and \glspl{ris} at a system level.
In this study, we aim to address this research gap by evaluating network performance across various \gls{ris}-assisted topologies using the Colosseum Open \gls{ran} testbed~\cite{polese2024colosseum}. We consider an Open \gls{ran} delivering services to the \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc} network slices. Using OpenRAN Gym~\cite{bonati2023openran}---an open-source framework for experimentation in \oran---we deploy this Open \gls{ran} on the Colosseum network emulator and manage it through an xApp that controls the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy. By investigating various spectrum allocation policies and \gls{ris} deployments, we demonstrate how network performance and resource efficiency are impacted differently for each slice. %To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study %to provide a comprehensive evaluation of design choices for 
With this work, we aim to complement prior studies~\cite{tsampazi2024system} by providing a comprehensive evaluation of \gls{ris}-assisted Open \glspl{ran} on an \oran-compliant testbed.

\section{System Model}\label{system model}


\subsection{Open RAN Framework}\label{oranframe}
We investigate an Open \gls{ran} system where \glspl{ue} generate traffic with diverse profiles, which is classified into the \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc} network slices. We leverage an xApp tasked with reconfiguring the \gls{bs}'s \gls{mac}-layer scheduling policies. The xApp selects a dedicated scheduling profile among multiple resource allocation algorithms (i.e., \gls{rr}, \gls{wf}, and \gls{pf}), influencing how \glspl{prb} are internally allocated to the \glspl{ue} of each slice~\cite{tsampazi2024pandora}. It is noted that for the \gls{rf} environment we consider various \gls{ris}-assisted network deployments. %, which will be described in the following sections.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:ris-top}, we outline the reference architecture considered in our work.

\subsection{Channel Model}\label{channelmod}
We consider a topology consisting of a \gls{ris}, a \gls{bs}, and a set of \glspl{ue}, denoted by $I=\{1,\dots,i,\dots, |I|\}$, which establish direct communication with the \gls{bs}. The number of elements on the \gls{ris} is given as $|M|$ and their set is defined as $M=\{1, \dots , m, \dots , |M|\}$. The first \gls{ris} element, i.e., $m=1$, with its respective coordinates, i.e., $(x_R, y_R, z_R)$ [m], is used as a reference point in the following arithmetic calculations, while for the \gls{bs}, its coordinates are given as follows $(x_A, y_A, z_A)$ [m]. 
The channel gain corresponding to the direct link between a \gls{ue} $i$ and the \gls{bs} is given as $h_{iA}$, the channel gain between a \gls{ue} $i$ and the \gls{ris} is defined as $\mathbf{h}_{iR}$, where $\mathbf{h}_{iR}=[|h_{iR,1}| e^{j \omega_{1}}, \dots,|h_{iR,m}| e^{j \omega_{m}}, \dots,|h_{iR,|M|}| e^{j\omega_{|M|}}]^T$, and finally, the channel gain of the reflected link from the \gls{ris} to the \gls{bs} is denoted as $\mathbf{h}_{RA}$. 
The diagonal phase-shift matrix is defined as $\boldsymbol{\Theta}=\mathrm{diag}( e^{j\theta_1},\dots,e^{j\theta_m},\dots,e^{j\theta_{|M|}} )$, while
each \gls{ris} element's phase shift is $\theta_m \in [0,2\pi]$, $\forall~m~\in~M$, and the cascaded channel is therefore given as $\mathbf{{h}}_{RA}^H\boldsymbol{\Theta}\mathbf{{h}}_{iR}$. Finally, the steering vector for the \gls{ue} $i$ to the \gls{ris} link is given as $\mathbf{h}_{iR}^{\prime\prime\prime}=[1, e^{-j \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} d \phi_{iR}}, \dots, e^{-j \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(|M|-1) d \phi_{i R}}]^{T}$, while the steering vector for the \gls{ris} to the \gls{bs} link is denoted as $\mathbf{h}_{RA}^{\prime\prime\prime}=[1, e^{-j \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} d \phi_{RA}}, \dots, e^{-j \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(|M|-1) d \phi_{RA}}]^T$. In the above calculations, $d$ is the Euclidean distance, $\lambda [m]$ is the carrier wavelength and $d [m]$ is the antenna separation. Additionally, $\phi_{RA}$ is the cosine of the signal's \gls{aod} for the \gls{ris} to the \gls{bs} link, and
$\phi_{iR}$ is the Cosine of the signal's \gls{aoa} for the \gls{ue} $i$ to \gls{ris} link. 
It is noted that we consider the links between the \glspl{ue} and the \gls{bs} to be \gls{nlos}, while the channels connecting the \glspl{ue} to the \gls{ris} and the \gls{ris} to the \gls{bs} are assumed to be \gls{los}. These transmission conditions are chosen to ensure that the cascaded channel formed by the \gls{ris} provides a sufficiently strong link for redirecting the \glspl{ue}' signals to the \gls{bs}. 
%Such placement can represent a maneuverable flying \gls{bs} (e.g., a \gls{uav}) positioned near a \gls{ris} mounted on a building facade~\cite{diamanti2021energy,tsampazi2024system}, to enhance capacity in emergency response scenarios, %but it is not limited to this use case. Another application could involve an \gls{enb} mounted on a building's roof, positioned close to a \gls{ris} %mounted on another building,
Such placement can represent a maneuverable flying \gls{ris} mounted on an \gls{uav}, capable of dynamically establishing \gls{los} to \glspl{ue} that would otherwise encounter \gls{nlos} relative to a fixed-position \gls{bs}.
%as well as traditional deployments where \glspl{ris} and \glspl{enb} are leveraged together to improve coverage.

Lastly, both the \gls{bs} and the \glspl{ue} are equipped with single-antenna omnidirectional \glspl{tx}/\glspl{rx}, with their center frequency set to $5.9$~GHz, where \glspl{ris} are considered for deployment\cite{ETSI_RIS001}. For the generation of the wireless links, we leverage the capabilities of the \gls{quadriga}'s~\cite{jaeckel2014quadriga} statistical ray-tracing approach, which is based on channel sounding and geometry-based channel modeling. We observe the channels every $0.1$~s and select the 3GPP\textunderscore38.901\textunderscore UMa scenario for the channel generator. A number of \glspl{mpc} (denoted as $|N|$) are produced for each generated link, with the channel generation procedure based on the following flow adopted from~\cite{tsampazi2024system}:
%\vspace{-0.15cm}
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}

\item Generate scenario-specific \glspl{mpc} (denoted as $h_{xy}^\prime$) for each link, leveraging \gls{quadriga}.

\item Combine the \glspl{mpc} coherently to compute the channel gain for every link, following Eq.~\eqref{eq:mpc-def}:
%{\small
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mpc-def}
\vspace{-0.12cm}
    %\setlength{\belowdisplayskip}{-0.001cm}   
   %\setlength{\abovedisplayskip}{-0.001cm} 
    \mathrm{h}^{\prime\prime}_{xy}=\sum_{j=1}^{|N|}\left|\textit{h}_{xy}^\prime\right| \cdot e^{j \varphi_{xy}^\prime},
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\end{equation}
%}
\noindent
The \gls{mpc} gain is denoted as $\textit{h}^\prime_{xy}$, where $\text{\(x \in \{i, R\}, \ y \in \{R, A\}\)}$, and
$|\textit{h}^\prime_{xy}|$, $\varphi^\prime_{xy}$ are the respective  \gls{mpc} magnitude and phase.

\item Calculate the average of the channel gains (i.e., $\mathrm{h^{\prime\prime}_{xy}}$) over $100$ different channel realizations to determine the link's final channel gain (i.e., $h_{iA}$).

\item Multiply the computed channels by their corresponding steering vectors, denoted as $\mathbf{h}_{RA}^{\prime\prime\prime}$ and $\mathbf{h}_{iR}^{\prime\prime\prime}$, to obtain the respective final channel gains (i.e., $\mathbf{h}_{RA}$, $\mathbf{h}_{iR}$).

\item Calculate the overall channel power gain for the \gls{ue} $i$ to \gls{bs} link as follows $G_{i}=|h_{iA}+\mathbf{h}_{RA}^H \boldsymbol{\Theta} \mathbf{h}_{iR}|^2$.

\section{Optimizing Wireless Propagation with RIS}\label{opt}

In this work, the wireless environment is not treated as an uncontrollable entity but is instead subject to optimization. For this purpose, we leverage the capabilities of \glspl{ris} to reshape the wireless propagation by effectively adapting the phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements. For these reasons, we formulate the following optimization problem defined in Eqs.~(\ref{eq4a})-(\ref{eq4b}), as follows:
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
%\vspace{-3pt}
\max_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sum_{i=1}^{|I|} |h_{iA}+\mathbf{h}_{RA}^H \boldsymbol{\Theta} \mathbf{h}_{iR}|^2
\label{eq4a}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{s.t.\quad}0\leq\theta_m \leq 2\pi, \forall m\in M.
\vspace{-5pt}
\label{eq4b}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

%\noindent
It is noted that the solution to the aforementioned optimization problem, which takes place on the \gls{bs}'s side, is the effective phase shift vector of the \gls{ris} elements, denoted as $\boldsymbol{\theta^{*}}$. In order to maximize the overall channel power gain of the \glspl{ue}, the \gls{bs} only needs to calculate the effective phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements (i.e., \( \boldsymbol{\theta^*} \)). Given the non-convexity of the aforementioned optimization problem, computing a globally optimal solution is challenging. To derive a closed-form phase-shift solution, we aim to achieve coherent signal alignment for the incoming signals from different transmission paths at the \gls{bs}. Indeed, the \gls{ue}'s channel power gain is maximized when the direct signal and the signal reflected by the \gls{ris} are perfectly aligned and coherently combined at the \gls{bs}'s \gls{rx}~\cite{li2020reconfigurable,diamanti2021energy}. This condition is generally satisfied when the phase shifts of the direct and cascaded signals are aligned as $\angle h_{iA} = \angle \left( \mathbf{h}_{RA}^{H} \mathbf{\Theta} \mathbf{h}_{iR} \right)$. Therefore, in the single-\gls{ue} case there's an \(1 \times |M|\) phase-shift vector \(\boldsymbol{\theta^*} = \angle \mathbf{v}\), where the optimal phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements are given as follows: %in Eq.~\eqref{eq8}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq8}
\theta_{m}^{*}=\angle{h_{iA}}+\omega_{m}+\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} d(m-1) \phi_{RA}, \forall m \in \ M.
\end{equation}

%\noindent
In the multi-\gls{ue} case, the solution to the maximization problem is also a linear combination of the phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements, with the reflection-coefficient vectors \( \mathbf{v}_i \) being distinct for each \gls{ue}. Therefore, there exists a distinct reflection-coefficient vector \( \mathbf{v}_i = [v_{i,1}, \ldots, v_{i,|M|}] \in \mathbb{C}^{|M| \times 1} \) for each \gls{ue} \( i \) that maximizes its channel power gain. To determine the set of suitable weights for each \gls{ue} that will maximize the aggregate channel power gain across all \glspl{ue} as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq4a}, we adopt the research methodologies proposed in~\cite{8970580,diamanti2021prospect}. For each \gls{ue} $i$, we define an appropriate weight factor \( w_i \in [0,1] \) and compute the linear combination of the overall
\glspl{ue}’ reflection-coefficients \( \mathbf{v}_i \) as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
\vspace{-0.18cm}
    \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{|I|} w_i \mathbf{v}_i,
\label{ris-weigh-factor}
\vspace{-0.28cm}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent
such as the weight factors satisfy the condition \( \sum\limits_{i=1}^{|I|} w_i = 1\).
\noindent
In the multi-\gls{ue} case, the goal is to determine the optimal values of the weight factors  (i.e., $w_i$) for the reflection-coefficient vector (i.e., $\mathbf{v}$) of Eq.~\ref{ris-weigh-factor}, which maximize the overall channel power gain of the \glspl{ue}, as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq4a}. Therefore, in order to compute the effective \gls{ris} elements phase shifts, the optimization problem defined in Eqs.~\eqref{eq4a}-\eqref{eq4b} is formulated as follows in Eqs.~\eqref{eq4-weights}-\eqref{eq4-weights3}:
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\max_{\textbf{w}} \sum_{i=1}^{|I|} |h_{iA}+\mathbf{h}_{RA}^H \boldsymbol{\Theta} \mathbf{h}_{iR}|^2
\label{eq4-weights}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\text{s.t.\quad}0\leq w_i \leq 1, \forall i\in I 
%\vspace{-5pt}
\label{eq4-weights2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{|I|} w_i = 1
\vspace{-5pt}
\label{eq4-weights3}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
\noindent
Through backward induction~\cite{diamanti2021prospect}, the \gls{ris} reflection matrix \( \boldsymbol{\Theta} = \mathrm{diag}(e^{j \angle \mathbf{v}}) \) is computed to optimize the phase alignment. %across multiple \glspl{ue}.
This approach ensures that the final \gls{ris} configuration \( \boldsymbol{\Theta} \) maximizes both the channel gain of each \gls{ue} and the total channel power gain across all \glspl{ue}. Given that 
\(\mathbf{w} = [w_1, \ldots, w_i, \ldots, w_{|I|}]\) is the vector of the \glspl{ue}' assigned weight factors, the optimization problem described in Eqs.~\eqref{eq4-weights}-\eqref{eq4-weights3} consists of a non-negative linear objective function and a set of constraints, which can be intuitively optimized to derive the optimal weights \( \mathbf{w}^* \). The derivation of the optimal weights \( \mathbf{w}^* \) leads to an effective \gls{ris} elements' reflection-coefficient vector 
\( \mathbf{v}^* = [v_1, \ldots, v_m, \ldots, v_{|M|}] \), which subsequently determines the corresponding phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements, expressed as
\( \boldsymbol{\theta}^* = [\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_m, \ldots, \theta_{|M|}] \).%\footnote{Extensions of the \oran control plane to carry \gls{ris} weights determined by the scheduler for real-time network adaptation are left for future work.}.


\section{Resource Allocation Strategies}\label{strategies}

We consider three different case studies, encompassing both single and multi-\gls{ue} scenarios, which are evaluated under various resource management policies in terms of \gls{prb} allocation and scheduling profile selection. %to assess the contribution of \glspl{ris} to network performance and resource utilization.

\begin{comment}
%\subsection{Sliced-based evaluation}
\textbf{Case A}. Following the requirements outlined in~\cite{ETSI_RIS001}, which specify that existing \gls{ris} elements can range from $10$ and above, we evaluate three \gls{ris}-assisted topologies with $10$, $100$, and $1000$ elements onboarded on the \gls{ris}. %These topologies represent increasing orders of magnitude, corresponding to successive powers of $10$.
We consider a single \gls{ue} allocated to the \gls{embb} network slice, which is assigned $\sim!1!/!3$ of the available bandwidth resources.
\end{comment}
\textbf{Case Study A}. Following the requirements outlined in~\cite{ETSI_RIS001}, which specify that existing \gls{ris} panels can host a minimum of $10$ elements, we evaluate three network configurations, where the number of \gls{ris} elements increases by orders of magnitude. %, corresponding to successive powers of $10$. 
We consider a single \gls{ue} allocated to the \gls{embb} network slice, which is assigned $\sim1/3$ of the available bandwidth resources. The \gls{csi} is varied to evaluate the contribution of \gls{ris} to network performance given the same resource availability, which is considered fixed. The results of this analysis are provided in Section~\ref{singleue-seca}. 

\textbf{Case Study B}. Considering the trade-off between hosting thousands of \gls{ris} elements and maintaining operational simplicity, we focus on a \gls{ris} with $100$ elements, serving multiple \glspl{ue}, which are distributed across the \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc} network slices. By dividing the available spectrum between the two, %, allocating $40\%$ of the \glspl{ue} to the \gls{embb} slice and the remaining $60\%$ to the \gls{urllc}. 
 we aim to demonstrate how a \gls{ris} can significantly enhance network performance, improve \gls{ue} satisfaction, and increase \gls{prb} utilization based on the capacity demands of each slice. The findings of this investigation are provided in Section~\ref{multiue-secb}.

%\subsection{xApp-based scheduling profile selection}
\textbf{Case Study C}. This case study focuses on an \oran infrastructure where an xApp controls the scheduling profile selection of the \gls{bs}'s \gls{du}. The xApp updates the scheduling profile of the \gls{bs}'s scheduler through a control loop by alternating its policy given the following options: \gls{rr}, \gls{wf}, and \gls{pf}. A multi-\gls{ue} use case is considered, where \gls{embb} \glspl{ue} are provisioned with $90\%$ of the available bandwidth, while \gls{urllc} \glspl{ue} are allocated the remaining $10\%$ of the spectrum resources. With this case study, we aim to study the impact of an xApp frequently changing the scheduling profile from fair scheduling (i.e., \gls{rr}) to spectral efficiency-driven (i.e., \gls{wf}), or balanced scheduling (i.e., \gls{pf}), analyzing its effect on resource allocation and overall network performance in both \gls{ris}-assisted and non-\gls{ris}-assisted topologies.

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{expsetup}

To experimentally evaluate the \gls{ris}-assisted channels within an \oran ecosystem, we leverage the capabilities of OpenRAN Gym, an experimental toolbox for the end-to-end development, implementation, and testing of diverse solutions---including, but not limited to, \gls{ai}/\gls{ml} applications---within \oran. The software offers capabilities such as \gls{ran} and core network deployments using the srsRAN~\cite{gomez2016srslte} protocol stack. It supports large-scale data collection, testing, and fine-tuning of \gls{ran} functionalities by integrating open \glspl{api} %into srsRAN 
for slicing and scheduling control, as well as \glspl{kpm} collection. Additionally, the software incorporates an \oran-compliant control architecture for executing xApps in the near-real-time \gls{ric}. Through the E2 interface, which bridges the \gls{ran} and \gls{ric}, along with its \glspl{sm}~\cite{polese2023understanding}, the streaming of \glspl{kpm} from the \gls{ran} and the execution of control actions by the xApps are enabled.
%We deploy OpenRAN Gym on the Colosseum Open RAN Digital Twin~\cite{polese2024colosseum}, a publicly available testbed designed for testing \oran-based optimization frameworks in controlled environments

We deploy OpenRAN Gym on Colosseum, which features $128$~\glspl{srn} consisting of pairs of Dell PowerEdge R730 servers and NI \gls{usrp} X310 \glspl{sdr}, supporting large-scale experimentation in diverse network deployments. The testbed’s \gls{mchem} component emulates the wireless environment by leveraging \gls{fpga}-based \gls{fir} filters. These filters simulate \gls{rf} conditions, including path loss, fading and attenuation based on models created through various frameworks (e.g., ray-tracing software, analytical models, or real-world measurements). Similarly, the Colosseum \gls{mgen} TCP/UDP traffic generator~\cite{mgen} emulates a variety of network traffic profiles (e.g., multimedia content) and demand distributions (e.g., Poisson, periodic).

\end{figure}

We consider a cellular network comprising one \gls{bs} and up to $5$~\glspl{ue} distributed across $2$ network slices. These are: (i)~\gls{embb}, for high-traffic scenarios involving multimedia content and streaming applications; and (ii)~\gls{urllc}, designed for time-critical applications such as vehicle coordination in \gls{cv2x} environments. The maximum bandwidth considered in this work is is set to $10$\:MHz (i.e., $50$ \glspl{prb}) and is divided among the $2$ slices. Traffic is slice-based and generated according to the following specifications: \gls{embb} \glspl{ue} request a constant bitrate of $4$\:Mbps, while \gls{urllc} \glspl{ue} generate Poisson traffic at $89.3$\:kbps. In terms of physical deployment, the \gls{bs} is placed at the point $(x_A=25,y_A=50,z_A=25)$ [m] of the three-dimensional space. 
Their distance from the \gls{ris} is given as $d_{i,R}=[20, 27, 37, 58, 66]$~[m] and all are uniformly distributed around the \gls{ris}'s reference point, denoted as $(x_R=30,y_R=40,z_R=20)$ [m]. %Both the \gls{enb} and the \gls{ris} are positioned in close proximity to ensure significantly strong \gls{los} links. Such placement can represent a maneuverable flying \gls{enb} (e.g., a \gls{uav}) positioned near a \gls{ris} mounted on a building facade~\cite{diamanti2021energy}, to enhance capacity in emergency response scenarios, %but it is not limited to this use case. Another application could involve an \gls{enb} mounted on a building's roof, positioned close to a \gls{ris} %mounted on another building,
%as well as traditional deployments where \glspl{ris} and \glspl{enb} are leveraged together to improve coverage.

%following the pipeline discussed in,
We install the generated links in Colosseum. The Colosseum scenario includes the path gain (i.e., a complex \gls{fir} coefficient) and the \gls{toa} values, %The path gain is derived as described in Section~\ref{channelmod},
%while the \gls{toa} values 
which are are calculated based on the Euclidean distance between the active entities (i.e., \gls{bs}, \gls{ris}, and \glspl{ue}), using the speed of light. % (i.e., $3 \times 10^8$ [m/s]).
These values are used to generate the time-variant \gls{cir} for each node pair in the network.

Each \gls{drl} model evaluated in the following sections takes as input \gls{ran} \glspl{kpm} such as throughput, buffer occupancy, number of \glspl{prb}, and outputs resource allocation policies (e.g., RAN slicing and/or scheduling) for \gls{ran} control.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:pathgainsris}, we present the path gains for each \gls{ue}, $i$, with and without a \gls{ris}, generated through the channel modeling process and the optimization procedure as described in Sections~\ref{channelmod} %. It is reminded that the generated channels result from %for deriving the effective phase shifts of the \gls{ris} elements,
and Section~\ref{opt}, respectively.
All the \glspl{ue} are sorted in descending order, such that the \gls{ue} with the lowest index corresponds to the \gls{ue} with the best channel, while the \gls{ue} with the highest index corresponds to the \gls{ue} with the worst. Based on the reported results, the performance with as few as~$10$ \gls{ris} elements is nearly identical to that observed without the \gls{ris}. Improvements in path gains are evident across all \glspl{ue} when examining scenarios with $100$ or $1000$ \gls{ris} elements.

In Table~\ref{table:net-topologies}, we present a catalog of the various \textit{network configurations} evaluated within the scope of this work. Configs. \textbf{I}-\textbf{IV} focus on a single \gls{ue}, whereas configs. \textbf{V}-\textbf{VIII} address the multi-\gls{ue} case study, where scheduling decisions influence intra-slice resource allocation. Regarding configs. \textbf{VII}-\textbf{VIII}, an xApp tasked with reconfiguring the scheduling profile selection is evaluated. The xApp updates the scheduling profile of the \gls{bs} at a granularity of $1$~s, assigning one of three scheduling profiles (i.e., \gls{rr}, \gls{wf}, and \gls{pf}) to the \glspl{ue} of the \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc} slices, %in all possible combinations and in a cyclic manner.
cycling through all possible combinations.



\subsection{Single-UE Case Study A}\label{singleue-seca}
In Fig.~\ref{singleue-total}, %we present the experimental results for the single-\gls{ue} use case. Specifically, 
we compare the \gls{ue} with the best channel conditions, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pathgainsris} (i.e., \gls{ue} with ID $1$), to the \gls{ue} with the worst (i.e., \gls{ue} with ID $5$). %We assume that they generate \gls{embb} traffic based on the specifications outlined in Section~\ref{expsetup}.
%Finally, the topologies evaluated in this subsection are \textbf{I}-\textbf{IV}, with their descriptions provided in Table~\ref{table:net-topologies}.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:singleue_thr}, focusing on Configs. \textbf{I} and \textbf{II} (Table~\ref{table:net-topologies}), which correspond to the \gls{ue} with the worst channel, we observe that the median throughput reported with $100$ \gls{ris} elements is $3.834$\:Mbps, representing an increase of $\sim10\%$ compared to the $3.486$\:Mbps observed with no \gls{ris}. Similarly, when focusing on the \gls{ue} with the best channel (Configs. \textbf{III} and \textbf{IV}), we observe that the median throughput reported with $1000$ \gls{ris} elements is $4.154$~Mbps, representing an $\sim10\%$ increase compared to the $3.8$~Mbps achieved with only $10$ \gls{ris} elements. 
%
It is reminded that according to the experimental results presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pathgainsris}, the performance achieved with $10$ \gls{ris} elements is nearly identical to that observed without a \gls{ris} in the topology. 
%
Based on the aforementioned experimental evaluation, we observe that increases in the order of $10^{2}$ in the size of the panels (e.g., from no \gls{ris} to $10^{2}$ \gls{ris}, or from $10^{1}$ \gls{ris} to $10^{3}$ \gls{ris}) can result in a $\sim10\%$ increase in the reported throughput under the same resource availability (e.g., $18$~\glspl{prb} or $3.6$~MHz bandwidth). 

In Figs.~\ref{fig:singleuecqi} and~\ref{fig:singleuemcs}, we present the corresponding \gls{cqi} and \gls{mcs} values as reported by the protocol stack. The results in Fig.~\ref{fig:singleuecqi} demonstrate the channel improvement introduced by the \gls{ris} in the topology, particularly for the \gls{ue} with the best channel conditions (Configs. \textbf{III}-\textbf{IV}), which reports a $\sim13\%$ 
improvement in the median \gls{cqi} value (from $8$ to $9$). Similarly, the \gls{mcs} (Fig.~\ref{fig:singleuemcs}) increases from a median value of $13$ to $16$, enabling higher data rates given the same \gls{prb} availability. Regarding the \gls{ue} with the worst channel (Configs. \textbf{I}-\textbf{II}), the \gls{mcs} shows an increase of $\sim18\%$, rising from $11$ to $13$, while the \gls{cqi} remains relatively stable around $7$, with a modest increase of $\sim8\%$ for the \gls{ris} topology.
 
\subsection{Multi-UE Case Study B}\label{multiue-secb}
We examine the multi-\gls{ue} case study, where \glspl{ue} are allocated to specific slices based on their traffic demands.  To express \gls{ue} satisfaction (which corresponds to high resource utilization), we define a new metric, i.e., the \gls{prb} Ratio. Its definition is given as $\text{\small \gls{prb} Ratio}=\frac{\text{Sum of Granted \glspl{prb}}}{\text{Sum of Requested \glspl{prb}}}, \text{where \gls{prb} Ratio} \in [0, 1]$, and it represents the amount of allocated \glspl{prb} to the slice according to the channel and traffic conditions. The analysis focuses on Configs. \textbf{V} and \textbf{VI} (Table~\ref{table:net-topologies}), where the \glspl{ue} with the best reported channel conditions (Fig.~\ref{fig:pathgainsris}) are grouped together on the \gls{embb} slice, while the remaining \glspl{ue} are assigned to the \gls{urllc}. 
The \gls{wf} algorithm is selected for the scheduling profile of the \gls{embb} (which has the highest throughput requirements), while \gls{rr} is used for the \gls{urllc} (which has the lowest). 
Fig.~\ref{multiue-1} presents the complete performance evaluation results for the aforementioned case.
Fig.~\ref{fig:multiue_thr} illustrates the median \gls{embb} throughput for the \gls{ris} and non-\gls{ris} assisted topologies. The median throughput with a \gls{ris} is $2.973$\:Mbps, $\sim34\%$ higher than the $2.219$\:Mbps achieved without a \gls{ris}, under the same resource availability. Fig.~\ref{fig:multiuebuf} shows that both topologies (with and without a \gls{ris}) result in a median buffer occupancy of $0$ in the \gls{urllc}, indicating significantly reduced latency levels.\footnote{It is noted that since srsRAN does not directly measure latency, buffer occupancy is used as a proxy~\cite{tsampazi2024pandora}.} 
Fig.~\ref{fig:multiueratio} shows that although both topologies indicate near-zero latency, the inclusion of a \gls{ris} (Config. \textbf{VI}) leads to higher utilization efficiency of the available \glspl{prb} at the \gls{bs}'s scheduler.


\subsection{Multi-UE \oran Case Study C}\label{multiue-secc}
In Fig.~\ref{multiue-2}, focusing on Configs. \textbf{VII} and \textbf{VIII}, as detailed in Table~\ref{table:net-topologies}, we present the results of the experimental evaluation where the \texttt{Sched} xApps controls the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy.
Fig.~\ref{fig:multiue_thr_c} shows that the median \gls{embb} throughput with a \gls{ris} in the topology is $4.234$\:Mbps, compared to $4.1$\:Mbps without a \gls{ris}. These high throughput values are reasonable, as the \gls{embb} \glspl{ue} are allocated $45$~\glspl{prb}, representing $90\%$ of the available resources. Fig.~\ref{fig:multiuebuf_c}, demonstrates that in the presence of a \gls{ris}, the median \gls{urllc} buffer occupancy is $0$, whereas in its absence, the corresponding value is $688$, indicating high latency levels. Therefore, the results show that the presence of $100$ \gls{ris} elements significantly reduces latency levels, regardless of the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy. On the contrary, non-\gls{ris}-assisted topologies in resource-limited environments (i.e., with only $\sim10\%$ of the available bandwidth) experience performance degradation, even when the \gls{bs} frequently updates its scheduler from fair (e.g., \gls{rr}) to more efficient approaches (e.g., \gls{wf} or \gls{pf}) to accommodate the \glspl{ue} based on their distinct \gls{qos} demands.
Finally, Figs.~\ref{fig:multiueprb_c} and~\ref{fig:multiue_case_c} demonstrate that \gls{ris}-enabled topologies achieve higher resource utilization for both the \gls{embb} and \gls{urllc} slices. Figs.~\ref{fig:baseline1} and~\ref{fig:baseline2} compare the previously discussed topologies to the case where no xApp reconfigures the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy. Notably, the keyword \texttt{baseline}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{baseline-total}, refers to srsRAN's default scheduling policy, which is \gls{rr}. Fig.~\ref{fig:baseline1} shows that updating the \gls{bs}'s scheduling profile increases resource efficiency for \gls{urllc} in the absence of a \gls{ris} (Config. \textbf{VII}). However, in the presence of a \gls{ris} (Fig.~\ref{fig:baseline2}), resource utilization and hence \gls{ue} satisfaction improve significantly (Config. \textbf{VIII}). Therefore, both the presence of \gls{ris} in the topology and frequent updates of the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy enhance the resource utilization efficiency.


\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{conculsion}
In this work, we focused on an Open \gls{ran} and investigated the impact of various network management policies on the performance of \gls{ris}-assisted topologies, leveraging the capabilities of Open RAN Gym on Colosseum. Our experimental results demonstrate that a \gls{ris} deployment can enhance network throughput and resource utilization under the same bandwidth availability. In addition, our experimentation in an emulated \oran system, where the \gls{bs}'s scheduling policy is controlled by an xApp, demonstrates that \gls{ris}-assisted topologies achieve superior network performance and higher resource efficiency compared to their non-\gls{ris}-assisted counterparts, regardless of the scheduling policy employed. Part of our current and future work focuses on designing \gls{ai}/\gls{ml} solutions to dynamically control the selection of scheduling policies in such Open \glspl{ran}, leveraging \gls{csi} and traffic conditions in the decision-making processes. Extensions to the \oran control plane for carrying \gls{ris} weights, determined by the scheduler for real-time network adaptation, are also left for future work.
