\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a framework for AI scaling, which is from Scaling Up to Scaling Down, then Scaling Out.
Scaling Up lays the groundwork with foundation models that generalize across tasks. Scaling Down ensures efficiency and accessibility, optimizing AI for diverse environments. Finally, Scaling Out provides multiple AI interfaces, which enables collaborative intelligence and interaction with users to tackle real-world challenges..
Together, these advancements offer a vision of AI that amplifies human creativity, bridges societal divides, and empowers humanity to confront its most ambitious goals. The future of AI is not solely about technological breakthroughs, it is about building systems that are equitable, sustainable, and deeply integrated into the fabric of human progress.
