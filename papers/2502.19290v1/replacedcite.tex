\textbf{Data-free deep learning Method} One of the most popular data-free deep learning methods is PINNs. This approach formalizes the constraints of PDEs, including the equations themselves, as well as initial and boundary conditions, as the objective functions within deep learning models ____. During the training process, the outputs of these models gradually align with the PDE constraints, allowing them to effectively approximate the solutions to the PDEs. However, this method mainly relies
on convolutional neural networks, ignoring the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems, making it challenging to forecast solutions outside the given training grids.
