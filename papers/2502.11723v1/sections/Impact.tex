\section{Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact} 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em 
    \item \textbf{Ethical Considerations:} This research does not involve any private or sensitive data, as all experiments are conducted using publicly available datasets. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we rely on the LM-Evaluation-Harness framework, which provides a unified approach for benchmarking language models. However, the investigation of different text generation strategies must be accompanied by a careful assessment of potential ethical risks, including bias, misinformation, and harmful content generation.
    
    \item \textbf{Societal Impact:} This work aims to advance the field of Machine Learning while addressing the growing concerns about the energy consumption and environmental impact of large-scale AI models. Recently, there has been growing concern about the high energy consumption and sustainability challenges of AI models, emphasizing the need for efficient inference methods. Selecting decoding strategies that preserve model quality while reducing energy usage can help mitigate the environmental footprint of large-scale language models. Our research encourages the AI community to not only prioritize output quality but also adopt a more energy-conscious approach when using LLMs, contributing to greater sustainability in AI.
