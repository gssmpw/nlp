\section{Summary of the \projecttitle{} Library}
We present the \projecttitle{} library, a generic library for transforming CFT protocols to tolerate Byzantine failures without any modifications to the core of the protocols, e.g., states, message rounds, and complexity. We realize our \projecttitle{} library by leveraging the advances in modern hardware; we use trusted hardware to guarantee transferable authentication and non-equivocation for thwarting Byzantine errors. Further, we combine trusted hardware with direct network I/O~\cite{rdma, dpdk} for performance. We present an extensive evaluation of \projecttitle{} by applying it to four CFT protocols: Chain Replication, Raft, ABD, and AllConcur. We evaluate these four protocols against the state-of-the-art BFT protocol implementations and show that \projecttitle{} achieves up to $24\times$ and $5.9\times$ better throughput.

    \item {\bf Hardware-assisted transformation of CFT protocols:} We present \projecttitle{}, a generic approach for transforming CFT protocols to tolerate Byzantine failures without any modifications to the core of the protocols.%, e.g., states, message rounds, and complexity. %We realize our approach by implementing \projecttitle{}-lib leveraging the advances in modern hardware; we use trusted hardware to guarantee transferrable authentication and non-equivocation for thwarting Byzantine errors. Further, we combine trusted hardware with direct network I/O (RDMA/DPDK~\cite{rdma, dpdk}) for performance.

    \item {\bf Generic \projecttitle{} APIs:} We propose generic \projecttitle{} APIs to transform the existing codebase of CFT protocols for Byzantine settings. Using \projecttitle{} APIs, we have successfully
transformed a range of leader-/leaderless-based CFT protocols enforcing different ordering semantics. % We further show that \projecttitle{} can offer confidentiality---a security property not provided by traditional BFT protocols.

transformation of CFT protocols operating in Byzantine settings. % We provide a formal analysis showing the correctness and

% In this work, we propose \projecttitle{}, a generic approach and library for
% transforming CFT protocols for Byzantine settings without any
% modifications to the protocols' states, message
% rounds and complexity. \projecttitle{} leverages the advances in modern hardware and uses Trusted Execution
% Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct execution of the protocol withstanding Byzantine failures. To optimize for performance we combine TEEs with direct network I/O. We build with \projecttitle{} four CFT protocols of different protocol families to show the generality of our approach. Our evaluation shows that these four protocols compared to BFT-smart and Damysus achieve up to $24\times$ and $5.9\times$ better performance respectively, with $f$ less replicas w.r.t. BFT-smart. In addition, we show that \projecttitle{} can provide stronger properties than BFT, i.e., confidentiality, without sacrificing performance---indeed, \projecttitle{} with confidentiality achieves up to $13\times$ (w.r.t. BFT-smart) and $4.9\times$ (w.r.t. Damysus) better performance.
