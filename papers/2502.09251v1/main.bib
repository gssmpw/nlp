abstract = {Mission critical systems deployed in data centers today are facing more sophisticated failures. Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols are capable of masking these types of failures, but are rarely deployed due to their performance cost and complexity. In this work, we propose a new approach to designing high performance BFT protocols in data centers. By re-examining the ordering responsibility between the network and the BFT protocol, we advocate a new abstraction offered by the data center network infrastructure. Concretely, we design a new authenticated ordered multicast primitive (aom) that provides transferable authentication and non-equivocation guarantees. Feasibility of the design is demonstrated by two hardware implementations of aom- one using HMAC and the other using public key cryptography for authentication - on new-generation programmable switches. We then co-design a new BFT protocol, NeoBFT, that leverages the guarantees of aom to eliminate cross-replica coordination and authentication in the common case. Evaluation results show that NeoBFT outperforms state-of-the-art protocols on both latency and throughput metrics by a wide margin, demonstrating the benefit of our new network ordering abstraction for BFT systems.},

However, there are hard limits to how much can be done with entirely untrusted components; for example, replicated state machines cannot tolerate more than a third of their replica population being Byzantine. In this paper, we investigate how minimal trusted abstractions can push through these hard limits in practical ways. We propose Attested Append-Only Memory (A2M), a trusted system facility that is small, easy to implement and easy to verify formally. A2M provides the programming abstraction of a trusted log, which leads to protocol designs immune to equivocation -- the ability of a faulty host to lie in different ways to different clients or servers -- which is a common source of Byzantine headaches. Using A2M, we improve upon the state of the art in Byzantine-fault tolerant replicated state machines, producing A2M-enabled protocols (variants of Castro and Liskov's PBFT) that remain correct (linearizable) and keep making progress (live) even when half the replicas are faulty, in contrast to the previous upper bound. We also present an A2M-enabled single-server shared storage protocol that guarantees linearizability despite server faults. We implement A2M and our protocols, evaluate them experimentally through micro- and macro-benchmarks, and argue that the improved fault tolerance is cost-effective for a broad range of uses, opening up new avenues for practical, more reliable services.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed requires large-scale datacenter architectures that are naturally more susceptible to faults of single components. One way to offer consistent services on such unreliable systems are replicated state machines (RSMs). Yet, traditional RSM protocols cannot deliver the needed latency and request rates for future large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a new set of protocols based on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) primitives. To asses these mechanisms, we use a strongly consistent key-value store; the evaluation shows that our simple protocols improve RSM performance by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that RDMA introduces various new options, such as log access management. Our protocols enable operators to fully utilize the new capabilities of the quickly growing number of RDMA-capable datacenter networks.},

abstract = {Atomic broadcast protocols ensure that messages are delivered to a group of machines in some total order, even when some of these machines can fail. These protocols are key to making distributed services fault-tolerant, as their total order guarantee allows keeping multiple service replicas in sync. But, unfortunately, atomic broadcast protocols are also notoriously expensive. We present a new protocol, called Acuerdo, that improves atomic broadcast performance by using remote direct memory addressing (RDMA). Acuerdo is built from the ground up to perform communication using one-side RDMA writes, which do not use the CPU of the remote machine, and is explicitly designed to minimize waiting on the critical path. Our experimental results demonstrate that Acuerdo provides raw throughput comparable to or exceeding other RDMA atomic broadcast protocols, while improving latency by almost 2x.},

The API provides interfaces for structuring applications into patterns of subgroups and shards, supports state machine replication within them, and includes mechanisms that assist in restart after failures. Running over 100Gbps RDMA, Derecho can send millions of events per second in each subgroup or shard and throughput peaks at 16GB/s, substantially outperforming prior solutions. Configured to run purely on TCP, Derecho is still substantially faster than comparable widely used, highly-tuned, standard tools. The key insight is that on modern hardware (including non-RDMA networks), data-intensive protocols should be built from non-blocking data-flow components.},

abstract = {Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (e.g., to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (e.g., to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data). Although the recent "Trusted Computing" initiative has drawn both positive and negative attention to this area, we consider the older and broader topic of bootstrapping trust in a computer. We cover issues ranging from the wide collection of secure hardware that can serve as a foundation for trust, to the usability issues that arise when trying to convey computer state information to humans. This approach unifies disparate research efforts and highlights opportunities for additional work that can guide real-world improvements in computer security.},

abstract = {A lease is an important primitive for building distributed protocols, and it is ubiquitously employed in distributed systems. However, the scope of the classic lease abstraction is restricted to the trusted computing infrastructure. Unfortunately, this important primitive cannot be employed in the untrusted computing infrastructure because the trusted execution environments (TEEs) do not provide a trusted time source. In the untrusted environment, an adversary can easily manipulate the system clock to violate the correctness properties of lease-based systems.We tackle this problem by introducing trusted lease---a lease that maintains its correctness properties even in the presence of a clock-manipulating attacker. To achieve these properties, we follow a "trust but verify" approach for an untrusted timer, and transform it into a trusted timing primitive by leveraging two hardware-assisted ISA extensions (Intel TSX and SGX) available in commodity CPUs. We provide a design and implementation of trusted lease in a system called T-Lease---the first trusted lease system that achieves high security, performance, and precision. For the application developers, T-Lease exposes an easy-to-use generic APIs that facilitate its usage to build a wide range of distributed protocols.},

abstract = {In recent years, there have been a few proposals to add a small amount of trusted hardware at each replica in a Byzantine fault tolerant system to cut back replication factors. These trusted components eliminate the ability for a Byzantine node to perform equivocation, which intuitively means making conflicting statements to different processes.In this paper, we define non-equivocation and study its power in the context of distributed protocols that assume a Byzantine fault model. We show that non-equivocation alone does not allow for reducing the number of processes required to reach agreement in the presence of Byzantine faults in the asynchronous communication model, by proving a lower bound of n >3f processes for agreement with non-equivocation. However, when we add the ability to guarantee the transferable authentication of network messages (e.g., using digital signatures), we show that it is possible to use non-equivocation to transform any protocol that works under the crash fault model into a protocol that tolerates Byzantine faults, without requiring an increase in the number of processes.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of Egalitarian Paxos (EPaxos), a new distributed consensus algorithm based on Paxos. EPaxos achieves three goals: (1) optimal commit latency in the wide-area when tolerating one and two failures, under realistic conditions; (2) uniform load balancing across all replicas (thus achieving high throughput); and (3) graceful performance degradation when replicas are slow or crash.Egalitarian Paxos is to our knowledge the first protocol to achieve the previously stated goals efficiently---that is, requiring only a simple majority of replicas to be non-faulty, using a number of messages linear in the number of replicas to choose a command, and committing commands after just one communication round (one round trip) in the common case or after at most two rounds in any case. We prove Egalitarian Paxos's properties theoretically and demonstrate its advantages empirically through an implementation running on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {Confidentiality is an indispensable requirement in financial applications of blockchain technology, and supporting it along with high performance and friendly programmability is technically challenging. In this paper, we present a system design called CONFIDE to support on-chain confidentiality by leveraging Trust Execution Environment (TEE). CONFIDE's secure data transmission protocol and data encryption protocol, together with a highly efficient virtual machine run in TEE, guarantee the confidentiality in the life cycle of a transaction from end to end. CONFIDE proposes a secure data model along with an application-driven secure protocol to guarantee data confidentiality and integrity. Its smart contract language extension offers users the flexibility to define complex confidentiality models. CONFIDE is implemented as a plugin module to Antfin Blockchain's proprietary platform, and can be plugged into other blockchain platforms as well with its universal interface design. Nowadays, CONFIDE is supporting millions of commercial transactions daily on consortium blockchain running financial applications including supply chain finance, ABS, commodity provenance, and cold-chain logistics.},

title = {A Principle for Resilient Sharing of Distributed Resources},
year = {1976},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society Press},
address = {Washington, DC, USA},
abstract = {A technique is described which permits distributed resources to be shared (services to be offered) in a resilient manner. The essence of the technique is to a priori declare one of the server hosts primary and the others backups. Any of the servers can perform the primary duties. Thus the role of primary can migrate around the set of servers. The concept of n-host resiliency is introduced and the error detection and recovery schemes for two-host resiliency are presented. The single primary, multiple backup technique for resource sharing is shown to have minimal delay. In the general case, this is superior to multiple primary techniques.},
