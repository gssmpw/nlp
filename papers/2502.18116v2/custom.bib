abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

Theoretical and experimental results illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as the experimental optimization of the performance of a system with a very general multipeak performance function when the only available information is noise-distributed samples of the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to optimization with respect to one system parameter. The observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of the next observation may be interpreted as the location of the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate) for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown function, and the observations are interpreted with respect to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system optimization.}",

  abstract  = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.}
