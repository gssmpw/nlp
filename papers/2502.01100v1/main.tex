\begin{abstract}

% We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. Using ZebraLogic, a newly developed benchmark dataset of logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), we systematically evaluate LLM performance. ZebraLogic spans a broad range of search space complexities and incorporates diverse logical constraints, providing a \textit{controlled} environment to assess reasoning abilities. Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity increases—a phenomenon we term the ``curse of complexity.'' Notably, this limitation persists even with scaling model size and inference-time computation, suggesting fundamental constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies such as Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts to enhance logical reasoning performance. Our findings provide critical insights into the scaling behavior of LLMs, highlight their limitations, and outline potential directions for advancing their reasoning capabilities.
 
We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.

Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows—a phenomenon we term the ``curse of complexity.'' This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts. Our findings offer critical insights into the scalability of LLM reasoning, highlight fundamental limitations, and outline potential directions for improvement.

\yuchen{still working on the abstract}
\peter{This is my old suggested version which is likely out of sync but might be a starting point....}
Our goal is to understand how well LMs perform complex reasoning,
in particular how those abilities scale along various dimensions.
Our approach is to develop a suite of reasoning problems using
a scalable problem generator, that tests reasoning at a wide
range of complexities. The generated dataset, called ZebraLogic,
contains "zebra" constraint problems (also known as Einstein problems)
spanning a wide range of search space sizes, allowing us for the
first time to study relationships between problem complexity,
model size, reasoning tokens, and the number of in-context examples.
In a detailed case study of the recent o1 LM, we show how this
dataset allows us to quantify o1's reasoning, determine o1's scaling
behaviors of that reasoning, and compare it with other models.
This provides new quantitative insights about how models are
progressing, [for example, ... could put an example here?],
illustrating the benefits of both the multiscale dataset and
the methodology in general.
