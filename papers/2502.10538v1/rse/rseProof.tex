\begin{IEEEproof}
First, the robustness property is achieved by our encoding algorithm outputting a codeword $Y$ with $\lambda$ from a Goppa code that is tolerant to $\lambda + \delta n$ errors. 
Since the channel can induce at most $\delta n$ errors, the robustness property follows dierectly from the error tolerance of the Goppa code.

Next, we show that for any $q \in \poly(\lambda)$, all probabilistic polynomial time adversaries $\calA,$
\[\left| \Pr[\RSEGame(A,\lambda,q) = 1] - \frac 1 2\right| < \eps(\lambda).\]
We proceed by a hybrid argument over the probability of adversary $\calA$ winning the $\RSEGame$. 
We define the series of hybrids $H_0$ to $H_2$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H_0$: The game is played as-is.
    \item $H_1$: Same as $H_0$, except in the key generation algorithm, replace the Goppa generator $G$ to a random code generator $R \unif \F^{k \times n}$.
    \item $H_2$: Same as $H_1$, except in encoding algorithm, replace the output in line $2$ with a random word $u \unif \{0,1\}^n.$
\end{enumerate}
Hybrid $H_0$ is indistinguishable to hybrid $H_1$ by Goppa-random indistinguishability in Assumption \ref{ass:GoppaRandom}.
More specifically, if hybrids $H_0$ and $H_1$ can be distinguished, then we can build a distinguisher for the \gdGame\ by applying the \gdGame\ challenge code (either a Goppa code or random code) to form challenge codewords for the \RSEGame.
Note that we can claim indistinguishability across all $q$ rounds immediately since the challenge messages are generated independently per round.
Next, hybrid $H_1$ is indistinguishable to $H_2$ by average decoding hardness, which follows immediately from the encoding algorithm in hybrid $H_1$, outputting $\bx R + \be$, where $wt(\be) = \lambda.$

In Hybrid $H_2$, the $b = 0$ and $b = 1$ cases are perfectly indistinguishable, and by our hybrid argument, the advantage of Hybrid $H_0$ is at most the advantage in Hybrid $H_2$ plus the negligibale advantage of the Hybrid in between.
Thus, the construction satisfies \RSE\ indistinguishability.
