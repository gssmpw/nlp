\begin{IEEEproof}     
    For any $L,R \in [k]$ such that $R - L + 1 \geq \kappa$, suppose $x[L,R]$ lie in blocks $w_{s+1},\dots,w_{s_{s + \ell}}$.
    Then, $\ell \leq \lfloor{\frac{R - L + 1}{a}}\rfloor + 1$.
    To recover each of these $w_j$ blocks from $\widetilde y$, the decoder accesses the corresponding encrypted block $w_j'$. 
    Thus, the decoder accesses $\ell A = \ell \times \frac{(a + b)}{R_\RSE}$ bits in total and we have that 
        \begin{align*}
        \alpha &\leq \frac{\ell(a + b)/(R - L + 1)}{R_\RSE} \\
               &\leq \frac{\left(\lfloor{\frac{R - L + 1}{a}}\rfloor + 1\right)( a + b)/(R - L + 1)}{R_\RSE} \\
               &\leq \frac{\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{R - L + 1} \right)(a + b)}{R_\RSE}\\
               &\leq \frac{2 + 2\frac{b}{a}}{R_\RSE} \tag{$R - L + 1 \geq a$},
    \end{align*}
    where the term ${2b/a \in o(1)}$.
    
    We now upper bound $\Pr[\paldcgame(\calA,\lambda,\delta,\kappa,q) = 1]$ by upper bounding the the probability of the event $\mathtt{BAD} = \bigcup_{i\leq q, j \leq B} \mathtt{BAD}_{j}^i$ where $\mathtt{BAD}_j^i$ is the event that in round $i$  block $\bw'_j$ has more than $\delta_\RSE A$ errors. As long as the event $\mathtt{BAD}$ does not occur it is guaranteed that the local decoder will be successful in all rounds. 
    
    We proceed by defining a series of modified games (or Hybrids), where we argue that the incorrect decoding probability difference from the original game only differs negligibly. 

    We define the series of Hybrids $H_0$ to $H_4$ as follows:
    Denote round by superscript notation. Then,
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $H_0$: The game is played as-is.
    \item $H_1$: Same as $H_0$, except that we update line 3 of the encoding algorithm to  $z_i \unif \{0,1\}^{A}$ i.e., we replace each pseudorandom string $f_{\bk}(j \circ \br_i)$ with a truly random string ${\bR_j \unif \{0,1\}^{A}}$ for each block $j \in [B]$.
    \item $H_2$: Same as $H_1$, except that we update line 4 of the encoding algorithm to $\bw_i'={\RSE.\Enc_{\sk'}(\bR_j)}$ where $\bR_j \unif \F^{a + \lg B}$ instead of $\bw_i'={\RSE.\Enc_{\sk'} (\bw_j \oplus \bR_j) \circ r_j^i}$.
    \item $H_3$: Same as $H_2$, but we update line 4 of the encoding algorithm to set $\bw_i\unif \F^A$ i.e., replacing $\RSE.\Enc_{\sk'}$ with a uniformly random string.
    \item $H_4$: Same as $H_3$, but in each round $i$ we sample a fresh permutation $\pi_i$ and output $\by = \pi_i(y')$. 
    \end{enumerate}
The indistinguishability of Hybrids $H_0$ and $H_1$ follow from PRF security and negligible collision probability.
First, disregarding possible collisions, the prf output $\bz_i^j = f_{\bk}(i \circ \br_i^j)$ is computationally indistinguishable from a random $\bR_j^i$.
Otherwise, a distinguisher for the prf can be constructed from the distinguisher of these Hybrids.
Next, there is added distinguishing probability when the same prf input is used across rounds i.e. when $j \circ \br_j^i = j \circ \br_j^{i'}$ for some $i \neq i' \in [q].$
Since the probability of a collision is at most $q^2/ 2^a,$ Hybrids $H_0$ and $H_1$ remain computationally indistinguishable.
Hybrids $H_1$ and $H_2$ are statistically indistinguishable because they are the same distribution.
Hybrids $H_2$ and $H_3$ are computationally indistinguishable by the security of \RSE. 
Recall that by the security property of \RSE, a computationally bound adversary cannot distinguish between polynomial-many random words and \RSE\ encodings with random inputs.
It follows that if Hybrids $H_2$ and $H_3$ were distinguishable, this would contradict the \RSE\ security property.
Lastly, Hybrids $H_3$ and $H_4$ are statistically indistinguishable since they form the same distribution. 
Justification for why each Hybrid is indistinguishable with respect to decoding error is summarized in the table \ref{tab:paldcHybrid}.

Thus, it suffices to upper bound the probability of the event $\mathtt{BAD}$ in Hybrid $H_4$ where a fresh random permutation $\pi_i$ is used in each round $i$.

Since a new permutation $\pi^j$ with a uniformly random mask $\bR^{'' i}_j$ is used in every round $j$, an adversary's $\delta Ab$ errors are uniformly distributed in each block of size $A$.
    Thus, the number of errors for a given block $j$ is hyper-geometric$(AB, \delta AB, A)$, and by \cite{goldberg_public_2011,hush_concentration_2005}, we have
    \[\Pr[\mathtt{BAD}_{j}^i] < 2^{\frac{-2(((\delta_\RSE - \delta)A)^2 - 1)}{A + 1}}\]
    which is negligible with respect to $A = a / R_\RSE$ as long $\delta_\RSE > \delta$. 
    By applying a union bound over all $B$ blocks and $q$ rounds, we have that there is an error decoding any block is negligible.
