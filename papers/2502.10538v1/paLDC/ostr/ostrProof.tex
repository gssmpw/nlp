\begin{IEEEproof}
    For any $L,R \geq 0$ such that $R - L + 1 \geq \kappa$, $x[L,R]$ lie in blocks $w_{s},w_{s+1},\dots,w_{s_{s + v}}$, where $v \leq \lfloor{\frac{R - L + 1}{ca}}\rfloor + 1$.
    We will show that our decoding process queries at most $2(R - L + 1) / R$ bits of the codeword i.e we show $\alpha \leq 2/R$.
    
    To recover these blocks, the decoder accesses $cAv$ bits and so,
    \begin{align*}
        \alpha &\leq \frac{cAv}{R - L + 1} \\
               &\leq \frac{cA\left(\lfloor{\frac{R - L + 1}{ca}}\rfloor + 1\right)}{R - L + 1} \\
               &\leq \frac{1}{R} + \frac{cA}{R - L + 1} \\
               &\leq \frac{1}{R} + \frac{cA}{ca}  \tag{$ca \leq R - L + 1 $}\\
               &= \frac{2}{R}.
    \end{align*}
    We show that the probability of an incorrect decoding $\Pr[\paldcgame(\calA,\lambda,\delta,\kappa,1) = 1]$ is negligible by upper bounding the the probability of the event $\mathtt{BAD} = \bigcup_{j \leq B} \mathtt{BAD}_{j}$ where $\mathtt{BAD}_j$ is the event that block $\bw'_j$ has more than $\delta_{\calC} A$ errors. 
    As long as the event $\mathtt{BAD}$ does not occur it is guaranteed that the local decoder will be successful in all rounds. 
    By Lipton's theorem\cite{STACS:Lipton94}, since our encoder applies a random mask and permutation, errors are added in a uniformly random manner with probability $\delta.$
    Thus, the number of errors for any given block $j$ is hypergeometric$(AB,\delta A B,A)$ and by \cite{goldberg_public_2011,hush_concentration_2005} we have 
    \[\Pr[\mathtt{BAD}_{j}] < 2^{\frac{-2(((\delta_{\calC} - \delta)cA)^2 - 1)}{cA + 1}},\]
    which is negligible for $\delta_{\calC} < \delta.$
    By a union bound over the total number of blocks, which is bounded by $\poly(\lambda)$, the probability, that any block fails its decoding is negligible.
