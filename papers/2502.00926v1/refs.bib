Here a design for an elastomeric surface that offers switchable adhesion strength through a combination of peel-rate dependent effects and actuation of sub-surface fluid chambers is presented. Microchannels and open reservoirs positioned under a thin surface membrane can be pressurized in a controlled manner to induce various levels of surface deformation via inflation. These pressurized structures demonstrate utility in controllably decreasing the strength of adhesion of flat, solid objects to the elastomeric surface, particularly in the limit of low peel-rates. Experimental and theoretical studies of these systems reveal the key mechanisms, and guide optimized geometries for broad control over adhesion, in a programmable and reversible manner. Implementing these concepts in stamps for transfer printing enables new modes for deterministic assembly of micro- and nanoscale materials onto diverse types of substrates.

This limitation arises from the need for a soft, mechanically compliant interface, which enables conformability to nonflat and irregularly shaped surfaces but significantly reduces the interfacial fracture strength. In this work, we overcome this trade-off with an adhesion-based soft-gripping system that exhibits enhanced fracture strength without sacrificing conformability to nonplanar 3D surfaces. Composed of a gecko-inspired elastomeric microfibrillar adhesive membrane supported by a pressure-controlled deformable gripper body, the proposed soft-gripping system controls the bonding strength by changing its internal pressure and exploiting the mechanics of interfacial equal load sharing. The soft adhesion system can use up to {$\sim$}26\% of the maximum adhesion of the fibrillar membrane, which is 14{\texttimes} higher than the adhering membrane without load sharing. Our proposed load-sharing method suggests a paradigm for soft adhesion-based gripping and transfer-printing systems that achieves area scaling similar to that of a natural gecko footpad.},

  abstract = {Researches on biological adhesive systems in nature have changed a perspective view on adhesion that it is not only the area of surface chemistry, but also mechanics of interfacial geometry which can significantly effect on fracture strength and load distribution on the contact interface. Various synthetic fibrillar adhesives in previous works have shown enhanced interfacial bond strength with the capacity of adhesion control by exploiting mechanical deformation of the elastomeric fibrillar structures inspired by geckos. However, control of the interfacial load distribution has been focused on the size of micro-contact with single or a few of micro-/nano-fibers on planar surface, and not for a large contact area on complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. This thesis work aims at investigating principles of the interfacial load distribution control in multi-scale, ranging from micro-contact with single micro-fiber to a centimeter-scale contact with a membrane-backed micro-fiber array on non-planar 3D surfaces. The findings are also applied for developing a soft robotic gripper capable of grasping a wide range of complex objects in size, shape, and number, expanding the area of practical applications for bio-inspired adhesives in transfer printing, robotic manipulators, and mobile robots. This paper comprises three main works. First, we investigate the effect of tip-shapes on the interfacial load sharing of mushroom-shaped micro-fibrillar adhesives with precisely defined tipgeometries using high resolution 3D nano-fabrication technique. For a large area of non-planar contact interface, we fabricate fibrillar adhesives on a membrane (FAM) by integrating micro-fibers with a soft backing, which enables robust and controllable adhesion on 3D surfaces. Picking and releasing mechanism for the maximal controllability in adhesion are discussed. Finally, we propose a soft robotic architecture which can control the interfacial load distribution for the FAM on 3D surfaces, solving an inherit dilemma between conformability and high fracture strength with the equal load sharing on complex non-planar 3D surfaces.},

  abstract = {Grasping and manipulation are challenging tasks that are nonetheless critical for many robotic systems and applications. A century ago, robots were conceived as humanoid automata. While conceptual at the time, this viewpoint remains influential today. Many robotic grippers have been inspired by the dexterity and functionality of the prehensile human hand. However, multi-fingered grippers that emulate the hand often integrate many kinematic degrees-of-freedom, and thus complex mechanisms, which must be controlled in order to grasp and manipulate objects. Soft fingers can facilitate grasping through intrinsic compliance, enabling them to conform to diverse objects. However, as with conventional fingered grippers, grasping via soft fingers involves challenges in perception, computation, and control, because fingers must be placed so as to achieve force closure, which depends on the shape and pose of the object. Emerging soft robotics research on non-anthropomorphic grippers has yielded new techniques that can circumvent fundamental challenges associated with grasping via fingered grippers. Common to many non-anthropomorphic soft grippers are mechanisms for morphological deformation or adhesion that simplify the grasping of diverse objects in different poses, without detailed knowledge of the object geometry. These advantages may allow robots to be used in challenging applications, such as logistics or rapid manufacturing, with lower cost and complexity. In this perspective, we examine challenges associated with grasping via anthropomorphic grippers. We describe emerging soft, non-anthropomorphic grasping methods, and how they may reduce grasping complexities. We conclude by proposing several research directions that could expand the capabilities of robotic systems utilizing non-anthropomorphic grippers.},

  abstract = {Surfaces with switchable adhesive properties are employed by robots to quickly grip and release objects and thereby to perform dexterous manipulation and locomotion tasks. Robotic grippers with switchable adhesion have been developed using structured polymers and electrostatic mechanisms. However, manipulating delicate items can be challenging as this requires strong, switchable gripping forces that do not damage the target object. Soft nanocomposite electroadhesives (SNEs) were recently introduced as an option for handling such objects. The technology integrates an electrostatic adhesion mechanism into a mechanically compliant surface formed from dielectric-coated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to ensure soft contact with target objects. In this study we explore the scaling of the electrostatic adhesion of SNEs, toward their potential application in macroscale grasping and manipulation. We measure electroadhesive pressures on millimeter-scale areas of up to {$\sim$}20 kPa with an on/off adhesion ratio of {$\sim$}700. Based on the measured forces and simple modeling, we conclude that the maximum achievable SNE adhesion forces are determined by dielectric breakdown in the insulating coating and surrounding air. Consequently, the SNE surface behaves as a parallel capacitor plate placed at an effective distance of 2.9 {$\mu$}m from the target object, despite being in contact with the target and therefore having the contacting CNTs separated from the surface by {$\sim$}2 nm dielectric coating. This mechanistic understanding of soft nanocomposite electroadhesives outlines the capabilities of the technology and informs their design for advanced manufacturing applications.},

Human motion can be divided into two classes, reflex and voluntary movement. Reflex is suppressed by voluntary movement. In the proposed method, a robot hand's grasping control corresponds to human reflex and manipulation control corresponds to voluntary movement. We constructed a controller composed of a manipulation controller, grasping controller and suppresser. The grasping controller has fast feedback but can only execute simple motion. The manipulation controller has slow feedback, and can execute complex motion. Finally, the validity of the hierarchical method is confirmed by computer simulation of various tasks, i.e. grasping, manipulation, and re-grasping motion.},

  abstract = {Soft robots offer significant advantages in adaptability, safety, and dexterity compared to conventional rigid-body robots. However, it is challenging to equip soft robots with accurate proprioception and tactile sensing due to their high flexibility and elasticity. In this work, we describe the development of a vision-based proprioceptive and tactile sensor for soft robots called GelFlex, which is inspired by previous GelSight sensing techniques. More specifically, we develop a novel exoskeleton-covered soft finger with embedded cameras and deep learning methods that enable high-resolution proprioceptive sensing and rich tactile sensing. To do so, we design features along the axial direction of the finger, which enable high-resolution proprioceptive sensing, and incorporate a reflective ink coating on the surface of the finger to enable rich tactile sensing. We design a highly underactuated exoskeleton with a tendon-driven mechanism to actuate the finger. Finally, we assemble 2 of the fingers together to form a robotic gripper and successfully perform a bar stock classification task, which requires both shape and tactile information. We train neural networks for proprioception and shape (box versus cylinder) classification using data from the embedded sensors. The proprioception CNN had over 99{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on our testing set (all six joint angles were within 1 degree of error) and had an average accumulative distance error of 0.77 mm during live testing, which is better than human finger proprioception. These proposed techniques offer soft robots the high-level ability to simultaneously perceive their proprioceptive state and peripheral environment, providing potential solutions for soft robots to solve everyday manipulation tasks. We believe the methods developed in this work can be widely applied to different designs and applications.},

Our framework utilizes a lightactivated chemical adhesive to attach to surfaces. The cured adhesive is part of a ``sacrificial layer,'' which is shed when the gripper separates from the surface. In order to control adhesive behavior we utilize ultraviolet (UV) light sensitive acrylics which are capable of rapid curing when activated with 380nm light. Once cured, zero input power is needed to hold load. Thin plastic parts can be used as the sacrificial layers, and these can be released using an electric motor. This new gripping framework including the curing load capacity, adhesive deposition, and sacrificial methods are described in detail. Two proof-of concept prototypes are designed, built, and tested. The experimental results illustrate the response time (1575s depending on load), high holding force density (10-30), and robustness to material type. Additionally, two drawbacks of this design are discussed: corruption of the gripped surface and a limited number of layers.},

Many stiffness tuning grippers have been developed that can grasp fragile or irregularly shaped objects without causing damage and while still accommodating large loads. In addition to limiting gripper deformation when lifting an object, increasing gripper stiffness after contact formation improves load sharing at the interface and enhances adhesion. In this study, we present a novel stiffness and adhesion tuning gripper, enabled by the thermally induced phase change of a thermoplastic composite material embedded within a silicone contact pad. The gripper operates by bringing the pad into contact with an object while in its heated, soft state, and then allowing the pad to cool and stiffen to form a strong adhesive bond before lifting the object. Pull-off tests conducted using the gripper show that transitioning from a soft to stiff state during grasping enables up to 6\,{\texttimes}\,increase in adhesion strength. Additionally, a finite element model is developed to simulate the behavior of the gripper. Finally, pick-and-place demonstrations are performed, which highlight the gripper's ability to delicately grasp objects of various shapes, sizes, and weights.},

Its structure is variable in that when it grasps irregular objects, it can adapt to different sizes by active expansion or contraction. Its expansion range is from diameter 200 to 300~mm, its four soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) can be rotated independently to adapt to different shapes, and it has high flexibility. The active compliant grasping method enables it to capture at the best position, which can improve the success rate of capture and reduce damage to the object being grasped. The experiment proves the effectiveness of the variable structure mechanism, and the proposed soft robot has low cost and a simple manufacturing process, so the mechanism has great application prospects.},

They present the challenge of optimizing the ratio vacuum/power consumption in battery-powered robots. In this paper, a CFD (computer fluid dynamics) modelling and optimization process of a robot adhesion system is carried out to determine the best performing configuration in terms of vacuum and power consumption. Analytical and numerical models were developed to predict the behaviour of the system for different configurations. The models were validated, using test rig measurements, by calibrating an arbitrary defined inlet height that simulates the leakage flow. Then, different geometric parameters were varied to determine the best performing configuration based on the vacuum/power consumption ratio value. The model presented in the paper was capable of predicting the behaviour of the system for different configurations, with a margin of error of 15\% for the vacuum prediction and 25\% for the motor power calculation. Finally, the model was used to optimize parameters of the system, like the number of blades of the impeller. The adhesion system was conceived for the modular autonomous climbing legged robot ROMERIN.},

A growing application area is the utilization of PWCRs for inspection purposes for accelerating the otherwise time consuming procedures of manual inspection, while offering the important advantage of protecting human workers from hazardous and/or unreachable environments.

The adhesive elastic membrane is lined with gecko-inspired microfiber arrays and can be inflated or deflated by controlled internal air pressure. Previous studies with the soft robotic grippers using dry adhesives showed repeatable adhesion and transfer printing of various non-planar objects with high reliability. In this study, we perform experimental characterization and theoretical analysis to better understand the influence of size and shape of the adhering curved objects on the range of internal air pressures as well as the force profile. In addition, decrease in the internal air pressure results in an increased pull-off force associated with a change in the range of gripper retraction for pulling off the membrane on various curved surfaces. An approximate analytical model dealing with the complex boundary conditions presented in this paper can provide quantitative estimates of pull-off forces for a wide variety of surface curvatures and internal air pressures, as well as qualitative understanding of how force profiles change under moderate pressure differentials.},

In contrast, synthetic switchable adhesives designs are mechanistically simple and unable to adapt to real-world surfaces. This work proposes a bio-inspired hybrid (multi-mechanistic) and adaptive device that can control adhesion and friction on both smooth and rough surfaces. A novel pneumatic smart surface is designed that both actuates (rotates) multifunctional adhesive microtopography and provides sensory feedback at multiple independent areas on the surface. It will be shown that by rotating topography, the surface can switch between sticky and non-sticky states (99.3\% reduction) and can also interlock with holes and protrusions (asperities) of rough surfaces. Through integrated and external sensory feedback combined local control, the device can sense adhesion loss, surface contact, and ultimately develop localized adhesive strategies that optimise global adhesion.},

This chapter addresses design, actuation, sensing and control of multifingered robot hands. From the design viewpoint, they have a strong constraint in actuator implementation due to the space limitation in each joint. After briefly introducing the overview of anthropomorphic end-effector and its dexterity in Sect. 15.1, various approaches for actuation are provided with their advantages and disadvantages in Sect. 15.2. The key classification is (1) remote actuation or build-in actuation and (2) the relationship between the number of joints and the number of actuator. In Sect. 15.3, actuator and sensors used for multifingered hands are described. In Sect. 15.4, modeling and control are introduced by considering both dynamic effects and friction. Applications and trends are given in Sect. 15.5. Finally, this chapter is closed with conclusions and further reading.},

  abstract = {Robotic manipulators use contact forces to grasp and manipulate objects in their environments. Fixtures rely on contacts to immobilize workpieces. Mobile robots and humanoids use wheels or feet to generate the contact forces that allow them to locomote. Modeling of the contact interface, therefore, is fundamental to analysis, design, planning, and control of many robotic tasks. This chapter presents an overview of the modeling of contact interfaces, with a particular focus on their use in manipulation tasks, including graspless or nonprehensile manipulation modes such as pushing. Analysis and design of grasps and fixtures also depends on contact modeling, and these are discussed in more detail in Chap. 28. Sections 27.2--27.5 focus on rigid-body models of contact. Section 27.2 describes the kinematic constraints caused by contact, and Sect. 27.3 describes the contact forces that may arise with Coulomb friction. Section 27.4 provides examples of analysis of multicontact manipulation tasks with rigid bodies and Coulomb friction. Section 27.5 extends the analysis to manipulation by pushing. Section 27.6 introduces modeling of contact interfaces, kinematic duality, and pressure distribution. Section 27.7 describes the concept of the friction limit surface and illustrates it with an example demonstrating the construction of a limit surface for a soft contact. Finally, Sect. 27.8 discusses how these more accurate models can be used in fixture analysis and design.},

It is found that the interdigitated array electrode can detect light with 1.6 times higher sensitivity than that in previous works and the newly fabricated microcantilevers have enough sensitivity to applied normal and shear loads.

It is considered that the sensor element constitutes an LCR circuit, and the CMC touch sensor, deformed mechanically, produces signals due to the modification of the circuit. In this study, a dome-shaped CMC sensor element similar to the shape of a human fingertip was used. This paper first examines the characteristics of the CMC sensor in terms of slip detection when the sensor system held and released an object. Next, the characteristics of the CMC element are clarified with respect to the compression force and deformation when the CMC element was compressed vertically. Finally, methods using the hybrid tactile sensor system are developed to detect the slip of an object and estimate the magnitude of deformation of the CMC element.},

  abstract = {Soft pneumatic grippers (SPGs), made of highly stretchable elastomer materials with internal fluidic channels, are a popular soft robotic gripping technology, and have been configured as soft bending fingers for passively compliant grasping applications. It is challenging, however, for current SPGs to grip both flat, concave, and convex surfaces. Controllable adhesion augmented SPGs are promising solutions. We aim to develop a composite gripper structure that could enable SPGs with the capability to lift flat, concave, and convex surfaces using pneumatic inputs only. To this end, we present PneuIVAVS, a layer-jamming induced active vacuum adhesion (VA) augmented and variable stiffness (VS) fiber-reinforced SPG. This integrated PneuIVAVS design has enabled the gripper to generate a VA force without the requirement that all suction units should work. Also, a VA force analytical model and a shape-locking model of the PneuIVAVS design were developed and experimentally validated. In addition, the PneuIVAVS gripper presented good performance on gripping both flat, concave and convex objects with a range of contacting areas. According to the load capacity test, the gripper could grasp a maximum of approximately 470 g, 683 g, and 268 g when handling flat, concave, and convex surfaces respectively. Besides, the gripper could grasp curved surfaces with a minimum radius of curvature between 30 and 40 mm. The PneuIVAVS concept, design, and results in this work have potential to promote the applications of SPGs and VA grippers in various material handling and robotics tasks.},

  abstract = {Grasping, carrying and placing of objects are the fundamental capabilities and common operations for robots and robotic manipulators. Grippers are the most essential components of robots and play an important role in many manipulation tasks, since they serve as the end-of-arm tools, as well as the mechanical interface between robots and environments/grasped objects. Gripper developments are motivated by the great number of different requirements, diverse workpieces and the desire for well adapted and reliable systems. Grippers provide temporary contact with the grasped objects in manipulations. Secure grasping not only requires contacting the objects, but also avoiding the risk of potential slip and damage while the objects are picked and placed. To offer secure grasping for objects with a wide variety of shapes, sizes and materials, various sensors and control strategies are also needed. With the developments of technologies, labor shortage caused by the population aging, as well as the requirements of high automation degree, agricultural robots will find their increasing applications in agricultural and food industries. As the end-of-arm tools for the robots, grippers can be seen as the hands of robots, almost all automatic manipulations are conducted directly by robotic grippers. This paper gives a detailed summary about the state-of-the-art robotic grippers, grasping and sensor-based control methods, as well as their applications in robotic agricultural tasks and food industries. Different from workpiece in industrial environment, agricultural products are fragile and damageable. The requirement for grasping agricultural products is higher than that of grasping of industrial workpieces, various sensors are needed to be installed to the grippers to make them less aggressive, and more flexible and controllable. Therefore, particular attention has been paid to the sensors that used in the grippers to improve their sensing and grasping capabilities. The advantages and disadvantages of the grippers are discussed and summarized. Finally, the challenges and potential future trends of grippers in agricultural robots are reported.},

Adhesive and frictional studies of these synthetic materials reveal a benefit of the hierarchical and anisotropic design for both adhesion and friction, in particular, at high matrix-fiber interfacial strengths. The presence of PS nanopillars alters the stress distribution at the contact interface of micropillars and therefore enhances the adhesion and friction of the composite micropattern. The results suggest a design principle for bioinspired structural adhesives, especially for wet environments.},

  abstract = {Rapid progress in micro- and nanotechnologies such as lab-on-a-chip (microfluidic networks, sensors, actuators, and connectors), soft lithography (replica moulding, microcontact printing and affinity contact printing), and stretchable transparent electronics has strongly benefitted from high-performance polymers like poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) that are suited for high-fidelity microsystem construction and rapid prototyping. While basic PDMS has been a unique enabling material, recent progress in tailoring PDMS to specific requirements will render this material even more valuable in the future. Basic PDMS is elastic, transparent, biocompatible, gas-permeable, and forms conformal contact with surfaces. Surface modifications of PDMS, inducing properties such as hydrophilicity, electrical conductivity, anti-fouling, energy harvesting, and energy storage (supercapacitors) are of major interest. Bulk modifications can alter PDMS properties such as elasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity. Such bulk modified PDMS composite materials can be created by embedding free molecules (e.g., dyes), nanoparticles (graphene, carbon nanotubes, and various other of organic and inorganic nature) or microparticles, or by altering the composition of the prepolymers before polymerization. Both, surface and bulk modifications of PDMS open avenues to a multitude of tuneable characteristics optimized for a diverse set of applications ranging from integrated micro- (lab-on-a-chip) to macro-systems (biomedical devices and epidermal electronics). In microfluidic systems design exploiting modified PDMS, a key aspect of this review, the unique features of these materials permit rapid, easy, and reproducible construction without the need for elaborate facilities and trained personnel as compared to other materials like silicon. This review focuses on recent progress in modification strategies to alter deliberately PDMS surface and bulk properties, especially for microfluidic, biological, flexible electronics, e-skin, and self-healing applications.},

  abstract = {To attach reliably on various inclined rough surfaces, many insects have evolved both claws and adhesive pads on their feet. However, the interaction between these organs still remains unclear. Here we designed an artificial attachment device, which mimics the structure and function of claws and adhesive pads and tested it on stiff spheres of different dimensions. The results show that the attachment forces of claws decrease with an increase of the sphere radius. The forces may become very strong, when the sphere radius is smaller or comparable to the claw radius, because of the frictional self-lock. On the other hand, adhesive pads generate considerable adhesion on large sphere diameter due to large contact areas. The synergy effect between the claws and adhesive pads leads to much stronger attachment forces, if compared to the action of claw or adhesive pads independently (or even to the sum of both). The results carried out by our insect-inspired artificial attachment device clearly demonstrate why biological evolution employed two attachment organs working in concert. The results may greatly inspire the robot design, to obtain reliable attachment forces on various substrates.},

  abstract = {The rapid control of surface attachment is a key feature of natural adhesive systems used for locomotion, and a property highly desirable for man-made adhesives. Here, we describe the challenges of adhesion control and the timescales involved across diverse biological attachment systems and different adhesive mechanisms. The most widespread control principle for dynamic surface attachment in climbing animals is that adhesion is `shear-sensitive' (directional): pulling adhesive pads towards the body results in strong attachment, whereas pushing them away from it leads to easy detachment, providing a rapid mechanical `switch'. Shear-sensitivity is based on changes of contact area and adhesive strength, which in turn arise from non-adhesive default positions, the mechanics of peeling, pad sliding, and the targeted storage and controlled release of elastic strain energy. The control of adhesion via shear forces is deeply integrated with the climbing animals' anatomy and locomotion, and involves both active neuromuscular control, and rapid passive responses of sophisticated mechanical systems. The resulting dynamic adhesive systems are robust, reliable, versatile and nevertheless remarkably simple., This article is part of the theme issue `Transdisciplinary approaches to the study of adhesion and adhesives in biological systems'.},

  abstract = {The remarkable mechanical properties of natural contact surfaces have inspired a great deal of interest and research in recent years. The underlying driver of this interest is the surprising range of surface mechanical properties such as adhesion, friction, and compliance that can be attained primarily by design of near-surface architecture using generic materials properties. A considerable literature has developed spanning the range from biological studies of structure and properties, through models to understand these properties, to development of bio-mimetic and bio-inspired structures, along with theory to understand how structure leads to development of surface mechanical properties. The literature has matured sufficiently that common architectures and principles have emerged, for which we attempt here to present a unified view. The field remains vibrant so we hope that this review can at the same time help in its further progress. Our goal in this paper is to review the field from the point of view of scientists and engineers interested to learn about the architecture, properties, and mechanisms of contacting surfaces in nature and how these might be mimicked to create new materials with unique and interesting properties. We begin with a brief description of natural systems, their architectures and properties, and follow by a discussion of the main bio-mimetic and bio-inspired materials that have been developed recently. We then discuss surface mechanical properties -- adhesion, friction, and compliance -- how these are related to materials and architectural parameters, and how these properties are measured. Where possible, we provide quantitative models for the relationship between structure and properties. We conclude the paper with a discussion of outlook and future possibilities in this field.},

  abstract = {Joining two materials with an adhesive is an extremely common activity, but is most often irreversible. However, emerging and current applications ranging from consumer and medical products to soft robotics and wearable bio-monitoring devices demand strong adhesives which can be easily removed on-demand and subsequently reused. This requires new paradigms in adhesive science and engineering, resulting in the emergence of new classes of multifunctional switchable adhesives. Here summarized is the current state of the art in switchable adhesive systems, focusing on how devices fit into the basic science of adhesion while providing performance metrics for comparison across current approaches. Using fracture mechanics as a guide, systems are classified as functioning under one of three basic mechanisms: near-interface, contact area, or mechanical. These mechanisms must be initiated or ``triggered'' by a specific input, which can include mechanical, electromagnetic, fluidic, or thermal stimuli. Triggers and adhesion switching performance are compared through the use of a ``switching ratio,'' the interfacial energy release rate, and an estimate of mechanism timing. Finally, it is discussed that how the fundamental mechanisms relate to challenges and opportunities for switchable interfaces in future applications and adhesive systems.},

However, these grippers still face challenges in grasping large objects and in achieving high-strength grasps. This work investigates the combination of fluidic elastomer actuators and gecko-inspired adhesives to both enhance existing soft gripper properties and generate new capabilities. On rocky or dirty surfaces where adhesion is limited, the gripper retains the functionality of a pneumatically actuated elastomer gripper with no measured loss in performance. Design strategies for using the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesives are presented. By modeling fluidic elastomer actuators as a series of joints with associated joint torques, we designed an actuator that takes advantage of the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesive. Experiments showed higher strength grasps at lower pressures compared to nongecko actuators, in many cases enabling the gripper to actuate more quickly and use less energy. The gripper weighs 48.7 g, uses \$7.25 of raw materials, and can support loads of over 50 N. A second gripper, using three fingers for a larger adhesive surface, demonstrated a grasping force of 111 N (25 lbf) when actuated at an internal pressure of 40 kPa.},

Such general-purpose robots may use their perception abilities to visually identify grasps for a given object. A grasp describes how a robotic end-effector can be arranged to securely grab an object and successfully lift it without slippage. Traditionally, grasp detection requires expert human knowledge to analytically form the task-specific algorithm, but this is an arduous and time-consuming approach. During the last five years, deep learning methods have enabled significant advancements in robotic vision, natural language processing, and automated driving applications. The successful results of these methods have driven robotics researchers to explore the use of deep learning methods in task-generalised robotic applications. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in regards to the application of deep learning methods to generalised robotic grasping and discusses how each element of the deep learning approach has improved the overall performance of robotic grasp detection. Several of the most promising approaches are evaluated and the most suitable for real-time grasp detection is identified as the one-shot detection method. The availability of suitable volumes of appropriate training data is identified as a major obstacle for effective utilisation of the deep learning approaches, and the use of transfer learning techniques is proposed as a potential mechanism to address this. Finally, current trends in the field and future potential research directions are discussed.},

Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10\% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.},

The emergence of soft-bodied robots brings a new perspective to solving this problem. In this paper, inspired by humans performing interaction tasks through simple behaviors, we propose a hierarchical control system for soft arms, in which the low-level controller achieves motion control of the arm tip, the high-level controller controls the behaviors of the arm based on the low-level controller, and the top-level planner chooses what behaviors should be taken according to tasks. To realize the motion control of the soft arm in interacting with environments, we propose two control methods.

We implement the hierarchical control system on a platform with the Honeycomb Pneumatic Networks Arm (HPN Arm) and validate the effectiveness of this system on a series of typical daily interaction tasks, which demonstrates this proposed hierarchical control system could render the soft arms to perform interaction tasks as simply as humans, without force sensors or accurate models of the environments. This work provides a new direction for the application of soft-bodied arms and offers a new perspective for the physical interactions between robots and environments.},

The complete model is a coupling of models which describe contact behavior with generally using the models of rigid-body kinematics and dynamics. The contact model fundamentally come down to the choice of components of contact force and moment which are transmitted through each contact. Mathematical properties of the complete model obviously bring about two primary grasp types whose physical interpretations provide insight for grasping and manipulation planning. A grasp with complete restraint avoids loss of contact and therefore is so secure. As will be mentioned, two primary limitation properties are force closure and form closure. A form closure grasp assurances the maintenance of contact as long as the links of the hand and the proposed object are also well verged on as rigid and as long as the joint actuators are sturdy enough. It should be noted that the main difference between force closure and also form closure grasps is the latter's reliance on contact friction.},

  abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has some advantages compared to other additive manufacturing techniques, such as the in situ integration of functional components, like sensors, and recyclability of parts. However, conventional filament-based FDM techniques are limited to thermoplastic elastomers with a Shore hardness above 70 A, thus it has marginal compatibility with soft robotic structures. Due to recently emerging pellet-based FDM printer technology, the fabrication of soft grippers with low Shore hardness has become possible. In this study, styrene based thermoplastic elastomers (TPS) were used to print elastic strips and soft gripper structures down to a Shore hardness of 25 A with an integrated strain sensing element (piezoresistive sensor). Printing on a soft rather than rigid substrate affects the integration of the printed thread on the substrate, because of the softness and relaxation, during the printing softness. It was seen that integrating the sensing element on a substrate with higher Shore hardness decreased the elongation at the point of fracture and the sensitivity of the sensing element. A soft compliant gripper structure with an integrated sensing layer was printed with the TPS-based elastomers successfully, and even due to the complex deformation of the compliant gripper structure, several positions could be detected successfully. Opened and closed position of the gripper, as well as, size recognition of spools of different sizes could be monitored by the piezoresistive printed sensor layer. The most sensitive sensing performance was obtained with the TPS of the lower Shore hardness (25 A), as the value of relative change in resistance was 1, followed by the gripper of Shore hardness 65 A and a relative change in resistance of 0.51. With this study, we demonstrated that pellet-based FDM printers can be used, to print potential soft robotic structures with in-situ integrated sensor structures.},

A significant result is that the load--displacement relation exhibits instabilities in which approaching bodies `jump in' to contact, whereas separated bodies `jump out' at a tensile `pull-off force'. The JKR approach has since been widely used in other geometries, but at small length scales or for stiffer materials it is found to be less accurate. In conformal contact problems, other instabilities can occur, characterized by the development of regular patterns of regions of large and small traction. All these instabilities result in differences between loading and unloading curves and consequent hysteretic energy losses. Adhesive contact mechanics has become increasingly important in recent years with the focus on soft materials (which generally permit larger areas of the interacting surfaces to come within the range of adhesive forces), nano-devices and the analysis of bio-systems. Applications are found in nature, such as insect attachment forces, in nano-manufacturing, and more generally in industrial systems involving rubber or polymer contacts. In this paper, we review the strengths and limitations of various methods for analysing contact problems involving adhesive tractions, with particular reference to the effect of the inevitable roughness of the contacting surfaces.},

  abstract = {The gecko adhesive system has inspired hundreds of synthetic mimics principally focused on replicating the strong, reversible, and versatile properties of the natural system. For geckos native to the tropics, versatility includes the need to remain attached to substrates that become wet from high humidity and frequent rain. Paradoxically, van der Waals forces, the principal mechanism responsible for gecko adhesion, reduce to zero when two contacting surfaces separate even slightly by entrapped water layers. A series of laboratory studies show that instead of slipping, geckos maintain and even improve their adhesive performance in many wet conditions (i.e., on wet hydrophobic substrates, on humid substrates held at low temperatures). The mechanism for this is not fully clarified, and likely ranges in scale from the chemical and material properties of the gecko's contact structures called setae (e.g., setae soften and change surface confirmation when exposed to water), to their locomotor biomechanics and decision-making behavior when encountering water on a substrate in their natural environment (e.g., some geckos tend to run faster and stop more frequently on misted substrates than dry). Current work has also focused on applying results from the natural system to gecko-inspired synthetic adhesives, improving their performance in wet conditions. Gecko-inspired synthetic adhesives have also provided a unique opportunity to test hypotheses about the natural system in semi-natural conditions replicated in the laboratory. Despite many detailed studies focused on the role of water and humidity on gecko and gecko-inspired synthetic adhesion, there remains several outstanding questions: (1) what, if any, role does capillary or capillary-like adhesion play on overall adhesive performance of geckos and gecko-inspired synthetics, (2) how do chemical and material changes at the surface and in the bulk of gecko setae and synthetic fibrils change when exposed to water, and what does this mean for adhesive performance, and (3) how much water do geckos encounter in their native environment, and what is their corresponding behavioral response? This review will detail what we know about gecko adhesion in wet environments, and outline the necessary next steps in biological and synthetic system investigations.},

In this work, the authors propose a suction-based soft robotic gripper where suction is created inside a self-sealing, highly conformable and thin flat elastic membrane contacting a given part surface. Such soft gripper can self-adapt the size of its effective suction area with respect to the applied load. The elastomeric membrane covering edge of the soft gripper can develop an air-tight self-sealing with parts even smaller than the gripper diameter. Such gripper shows 4 times higher adhesion than the one without the membrane on various textured surfaces. The two major advantages, underactuated self-adaptability and enhanced suction performance, allow the membrane-based suction mechanism to grip various three-dimensional (3D) geometries and delicate parts, such as egg, lime, apple, and even hydrogels without noticeable damage, which can have not been gripped with the previous adhesive microstructures-based and active suction-based soft grippers. The structural and material simplicity of the proposed soft gripper design can have a broad use in diverse fields, such as digital manufacturing, robotic manipulation, transfer printing, and medical gripping.},

The conventional robots made of hard materials have already achieved precision and accuracy, but they lack in reachability, adaptability, degree of freedom, and safe interaction. Moreover, soft robots mimic the behavior of biological creatures by mimicking their locomotive patterns. The actuation or the locomotion of the soft robots is achieved by soft actuators which are a very important part of soft robotic systems. Herein, a comprehensive review based on the evolution of six actuation methodologies is presented. Various approaches used for the design and fabrication of soft robots such as pneumatic, shape memory alloy, dielectric elastomers, chemical-reaction enforced, and pneumatic and magneto-rheological elastomers-based actuation methods reported in the last decade. Furthermore, the advancement of these approaches has been rigorously discussed in chronological order for parameters like efficiency, power requirement, frequency, and possible applications. Future challenges and directions toward the advancement in soft robotics are also discussed for achieving the remarkable performance of soft robots in a real-time environment. Furthermore, we believe, this is a complete review package for the young researchers which can help them to understand, how this field has evolved from a performance, application, and efficiency point of view.},

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus ({$<$} 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials \& fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

It will also suggest how and why soft robotics is more than simply a minor technical ``tweak'' on hard robotics and propose a unique role for chemistry, and materials science, in this field.

Bionics gives us inspiration to solve the limitation problems of conventional wall-climbing robots, and biomimetic wall-climbing robots have become a hot research area. Spiny feet and dry adhesives are two main bioinspired adhesive methods applied into wall-climbing robots, and relevant research status and development situation have been surveyed. In order to improve the adaption of biomimetic wall-climbing robots to both smooth and rough surfaces, we have developed a brand new multi-mode biomimetic wall-climbing robot employing four modes: spiny wheels, adhesive treads, spiny treads and a suction cup, which can switch different modes to conform to different terrains. The robot employs spiny wheels and spiny treads while meeting with rough surfaces and employs adhesive treads while encountering smooth surfaces. And a suction cup is applied all the time for assistive adhesive function. Design and prototype experiment about this robot have been represented.},

The variable stiffness of the SMP allows the membrane to conform to and make good contact with objects of various shapes in its soft state and then achieve high adhesive load capacity by switching to the stiff state. Release of objects is realized by switching to the soft state. The ratio between the high-adhesion and low-adhesion state is demonstrated to be {$>$}2000 on a curved substrate and {$\sim$}115 on a flat substrate. This gripper exhibits no adhesion in the unactivated state and maintains adhesion passively once actuation is complete.},

  abstract = {When considering methods for joining materials, there are many advantages that engineering adhesives can offer, compared to the more traditional methods of joining such as bolting, brazing, welding, mechanical fasteners, etc. The advantages and disadvantages of using engineering adhesives are discussed and it is shown that it is possible to identify three distinct stages in the formation of an adhesive joint. Firstly, the adhesive initially has to be in a ?liquid? form so that it can readily spread over and make intimate molecular contact with the substrates. Secondly, in order for the joint to bear the loads that will be applied to it during its service life, the ?liquid? adhesive must now harden. In the case of adhesives used in engineering applications, the adhesive is often initially in the form of a ?liquid? monomer which polymerizes to give a high molecular weight polymeric adhesive. Thirdly, it must be appreciated that the load-carrying ability of the joint, and how long it will actually last, are affected by: (a) the design of the joint, (b) the manner in which loads are applied to it and (c) the environment that the joint encounters during its service life. Thus, to understand the science involved and to succeed in further developing the technology, the skills and knowledge from many different disciplines are required. Indeed, the input from surface chemists, polymer chemists and physicists, materials engineers and mechanical engineers are needed. Hence, the science and technology of adhesion and adhesives is a truly multidisciplined subject. These different disciplines have been brought together by developing a fracture mechanics approach to the failure of adhesive joints. The advances that have been made in applying the concepts of fracture mechanics to adhesive joints have enabled a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of adhesion and the more rapid extension of adhesives technology into advanced engineering applications.},

  abstract = {ConspectusBiological systems found in nature provide excellent stimuli-responsive functions. The camouflage adaptation of cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish), rapid stiffness change of sea cucumbers, opening of pine cones in response to humidity, and rapid closure of Venus flytraps upon insect touch are some examples of nature's smart systems. Although current technologies are still premature to mimic these sophisticated structures and functions in smart biological systems, recent work on stimuli-responsive programmable matter has shown great progress. Stimuli-responsive materials based on hydrogels, responsive nanocomposites, hybrid structures, shape memory polymers, and liquid crystal elastomers have demonstrated excellent responsivities to various stimuli such as temperature, light, pH, and electric field. However, the technologies in these stimuli-responsive materials are still not sophisticated enough to demonstrate the ultimate attributes of an ideal programmable matter: fast and reversible reconfiguration of programmable matter into complex and robust shapes. Recently, reconfigurable (or programmable) matter that reversibly changes its structure/shape or physical/chemical properties in response to external stimuli has attracted great interest for applications in sensors, actuators, robotics, and smart systems. In particular, key attributes of programmable matter including fast and reversible reconfiguration into complex and robust 2D and 3D shapes have been demonstrated by various approaches.In this Account, we review focused areas of smart materials with special emphasis on the material and device structure designs to enhance the response time, reversibility, multistimuli responsiveness, and smart adhesion for efficient shape transformation and functional actuations. First, the capability of fast reconfiguration of 2D and 3D structures in a reversible way is a critical requirement for programmable matter. For the fast and reversible reconfiguration, various approaches based on enhanced solvent diffusion rate through the porous or structured hydrogel materials, electrostatic repulsion between cofacial electrolyte nanosheets, and photothermal actuation are discussed. Second, the ability to reconfigure programmable matters into a variety of complex structures is beneficial for the use of reconfigurable matter in diverse applications. For the reconfiguration of planar 2D structures into complex 3D structures, asymmetric and multidirectional stress should be applied. In this regard, local hinges with stimuli-responsive stiffness, multilayer laminations with different responsiveness in individual layers, and origami and kirigami assembly approaches are reviewed. Third, multistimuli responsiveness will be required for the efficient reconfiguration of complex programmable matter in response to user-defined stimulus under different chemical and physical environments. In addition, with multistimuli responsiveness, the reconfigured shape can be temporarily affixed by one signal and disassembled by another signal at a user-defined location and time. Photoactuation depending on the chirality of carbon nanotubes and composite gels with different responsiveness will be discussed. Finally, the development of smart adhesives with on-demand adhesion strength is critically required to maintain the robust reconfigurable shapes and for the switching on/off of the binding between components or with target objects. Among various connectors and adhesives, thermoresponsive nanowire connectors, octopus-inspired smart adhesives, and elastomeric tiles with soft joints are described due to their potential applications in joints of deformable 3D structures and smart gripping systems.},

Herein, we review recent progress on reversibility in other physicochemical properties which can also play important roles in the functionality of soft robots. We focus on the tunability of five key properties: electrical and thermal conductivities, surface wettability and adhesion, and optical properties. Materials and mechanisms are described, and performances are assessed, when possible, in terms of reversible tunability range, time response, cycling endurance, and power consumption. The potential integration of such solutions to soft robots is systematically discussed.},

One of the classifications of adhesives is based on the chemical nature, i.e. it can either be reactive or non-reactive, while the other segregates them depending upon the origin like natural or synthetic. The pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are one of the important classes following the mechanism of curing of the adhesive which do not undergo any chemical reaction or physical change during the adhesion process. PSAs are greatly replacing many conventional types of adhesive and are considered safe to use. The application of the hybrid polymers in the field of PSAs that consists of silane-curing organic compounds having wide formulation tolerance and outstanding mechanical properties is a major class in the upcoming PSA market. The present article discusses the various types of PSAs, their recent trends based on the various application properties with the structure--property relationship and their synthesis techniques.},

However, due to the complexity of their internal environments (crisscross welds, curved surfaces, etc.), high demands are placed on stable adhesion and curvature adaptability. This paper presents a novel wheeled magnetic adhesion robot with passive suspension named NuBot, which is mainly applied in nuclear power containment. Based on the kinematic model of the 3-DOF independent suspension, a comprehensive optimization model is established, and global optimal dimensions are properly chosen from performance atlases. Then, a safety adhesion analysis considering non-slip and non-overturning condition is conducted to verify the magnetic force meet the safety demand. Experiments show that the robot can achieve precise locomotion on both strong and weak magnetic walls with different inclination angles, and can stably cross the 5~mm weld seam. Besides, its maximum payload capacity reaches 3.6~kg. Results show that NuBot has good comprehensive capabilities of surface-adaptability, adhesion stability, and payload. Besides, the robot can be applied in more ferromagnetic environments with more applications and the design method offers guidance for similar wheeled robots with passive suspension.},

  abstract = {This paper presents analysis and results for a small and agile wall climbing robot's ability to regain lost adhesion due to degradation of dry fibrillar adhesives. To regain the lost adhesion, two feet are set to the surface and the robot performs a rocking motion on the side where the adhesion has dropped below a safety threshold. The rocking motion applies normal forces to preload the front and rear feet without letting the other foot detach from the surface by alternating the direction of the motor and only allowing small rotation of the leg. Experimental results show that the rocking motion is successful in regaining lost adhesion while using dry fibrillar adhesives on a smooth, vertical acrylic surface. The performance of the fibers over time limits the adhesion that can possibly be mechanically regained and as a result the fibers are over-designed, which gives rise to the need for a power efficient peeling mechanism. The peeling mechanism uses a conditionally locked ankle, implemented with magnets, and a slot to allow the axle to change a pulling force normal to the surface to be a pulling force perpendicular to the surface, which peels the fibers using the uneven loading. Experimental results illustrate that a passive peeling mechanism is successful in reducing the required power to peel. The presented advancements can be applied to other climbing robots using adhesives to allow for safer, more efficient climbing.},

A fascinating and complex interplay of adhesive and frictional forces forms the foundation of attachment of these highly diverse systems to various substrates. In this review, we present an overview of the techniques used to quantify the adhesion and friction of terrestrial animals, with the aim of informing future studies on the fundamentals of bioadhesion, and motivating the development and adoption of new or alternative measurement techniques. We classify existing methods with respect to the forces they measure, including magnitude and source, i.e., generated by the whole body, single limbs, or by sub-structures. Additionally, we compare their versatility, specifically what parameters can be measured, controlled, and varied. This approach reveals critical trade-offs of bioadhesion measurement techniques. Beyond stimulating future studies on evolutionary and physicochemical aspects of bioadhesion, understanding the fundamentals of biological attachment is key to the development of biomimetic technologies, from soft robotic grippers to gentle surgical tools.},

  abstract = {Rock climbing robots have wide application prospects in field operations and planetary exploration. Herein, a spiny gripper inspired by the beetle (Coleoptera) claw is developed, which can accomplish easy attachment, detachment and good compliance on irregular rough surfaces without complex controls. The attachment probabilities of various microspine layouts are simulated to determine the optimal design parameters for the spine tile. By referencing the structure and attachment process of the beetle claw, a spiny gripper with four bioinspired branches is designed to enable adaptive attachment and smooth detachment. The gripper employs a novel drivetrain hybridized with passive torsion springs and active tendons driven by an ingenious winch to achieve light weight, load-sharing, self-adaptation, and strong adhesion on irregular rough surfaces. The grasp sequence, grasp wrench and gripper maximum adhesion are all investigated. Tests on various surfaces verify its excellent performance. With a weight of 0.352~kg, its normal adhesion and tangential adhesion are 39.7~N and 47.5~N, respectively. In addition, the gripper is integrated into the climbing robot RockClimbo to allow it to move on extreme terrain.},

However, such growth can be followed by an equally rapid decline if concerted efforts are not made by the community. Here, we argue that for soft robotics to take root and have impact in the next decade, we must move beyond ``soft for soft's sake'' and ensure that each study makes a meaningful contribution to the field and, ideally, to robotics and engineering more broadly. We present a three-tiered categorization to help researchers and reviewers evaluate work and guide studies toward higher levels of contribution. We ground this categorization with historical examples of soft solutions outside of robotics that were transformative. We believe that the proposed self-reflection is essential if soft robotics is to be an impactful field in the next decade, advancing robotics and engineering both within and beyond academia and creating soft solutions that are quantitatively superior to the current state of the art---soft, rigid, or otherwise.},

  abstract = {Fruit harvesting is facing challenges due to the labour shortage, which has been more severe since the rapid pandemic. Robotic harvesting has been attempted in autonomous fruit harvesting tasks, such as apple harvesting. However, current apple harvesting robots show limited harvesting performance in the orchard environment due to the inefficiency of the robotic grippers. This research presents a fruit harvesting method that includes a novel soft robotic gripper and a detachment strategy to achieve apple harvesting in the natural orchard. The soft robotic gripper includes four tapered soft robotic fingers (SRF) and one multi-mode suction cup. The SRF is customised to avoid interference with obstacles during grasping, and its compliance and force exertion are comprehensively evaluated with FEA and experiments. The multi-mode suction cup can provide suction adhesion force, show active extrusion/withdrawal, and present passive compliance mode. The simultaneously twist-pulling motion is finally proposed and implemented to detach the apples from the trees. The proposed robotic gripper is compact, compliant with apple grasping and generates a large grasping force. Our proposed method is finally validated in a natural orchard and achieves a detachment, damage and harvesting rate of 75.6\%, 4.55\%, and 70.77\%, respectively.},

The soft gripper must be protected from surface contamination and liquid lubrication; hence, a hydrophobic and contamination-resistant surface is used. There is an urgent need for a soft gripper that meets the functions of hydrophobic performance and contamination resistance, but there has been little study. In this study, the two functions are well achieved by introducing a flexible superhydrophobic surface. A novel design of a flexible superhydrophobic surface-based gripper (SSBG) is proposed by the template method. After a series of testing, it was discovered that the friction coefficient between the SSBG surface and the glass plate, cardboard, and steel plate is larger than that of a standard surface gripper (SSG). At the same time, the contamination resistance of SSBG is particularly important. Because of the existence of the plastron layer, the surface was discovered to be able to repel bacterial colonization. Finally, when the usual gripping force of the SSBG is measured on a 250~ml beaker with contamination and liquid lubrication, it can be shown that the gripping ability is improved by at least 100\% and 170\% compared to the SSG, respectively. As a result, the SSBG has a high potential for utilization in industrial and therapeutic contexts.},

But the sensorization of these grippers can potentially make them unsuitable for such environments and lower their performance through the introduction of electronic components or conductive materials into their structure. This work introduces the design of a sensorized soft pneumatic gripper using hybrid optical fibers making use of rigid and hard segments to measure the bending deformation and the contact force at specific segments of the finger. Using rigid optical fibers, which has low optical loss, for optical signal transmission allows to place all electronic components outside and away from the gripper ensuring the structure of the gripper and its nearby components are non-conductive and non-magnetic. The utilization of rigid reinforcements on the soft pneumatic actuator also helps maintain the performance of the actuator close to existing non-sensorized soft pneumatic actuators. This sensorized actuator is then used in a proprioceptive soft robotic gripper capable of controlling its grasping force.},

Pressure sensors connected to its modules allow to estimate the object pose and center of mass and to detect the contact between the gripper and the SoftPad during a grasping task. A new grasp strategy that exploits such information for top-grasping objects, without using cameras or force sensors, is presented. It has been tested with objects having a wide range of sizes, shapes, and weights. The SoftPad design can easily be adapted to the set of objects that are used in a certain application.},

In this paper, we propose a pneumatic shell gripper which can be easily fabricated without demolding process and its thickness was minimized for the purpose of packaging multiple cucumbers simultaneously. The shell gripper includes multiple gripping units and each unit consists of two flat fingers configured in a parallel pattern. Each finger has a hybrid structure combining a rigid shell and a soft membrane. The membrane can be pneumatically inflated and therefore can be used to grasp objects. Inflation tests on the hybrid finger showed that the new fabrication method can provide similar inflated deformation to the fingers compared with the conventional method. Moreover, the new method yields less individual differences among fingers due to the less manual process. Durability was tested for the new fabrication method and the finger is not ruptured after 100,000 circles. Finally, tests on packaging multiple cucumbers were conducted and results demonstrated the ability and advantages of the shell gripper.},

One explanation for this limitation is the lack of controlled contact variation between the grasped object and the gripper. For instance, human hands have the ability to firmly grip object surfaces, as well as slide over object faces, an aspect that aids the enhanced manipulation of objects within the hand without losing contact. In this letter, we present a parametric, origami-inspired thin surface capable of transitioning between a high friction and a low friction state, suitable for implementation as an epidermis in robotic fingers. A numerical analysis of the proposed surface based on its design parameters, force analysis, and performance in in-hand manipulation tasks is presented. Through the development of a simple two-fingered two-degree-of-freedom gripper utilizing the proposed variable-friction surfaces with different parameters, we experimentally demonstrate the improved manipulation capabilities of the hand when compared to the same gripper without changeable friction. Results show that the pattern density and valley gap are the main parameters that effect the in-hand manipulation performance. The origami-inspired thin surface with a higher pattern density generated a smaller valley gap and smaller height change, producing a more stable improvement of the manipulation capabilities of the hand.},

One contributor to this capability is the structure of the human finger pad, where soft internal tissue is surrounded by a layer of more rigid skin. This permits conforming of the finger pad around object contours for firm grasping, while also permitting low-friction sliding over object surfaces with a light touch. These varying modes of manipulation contribute to the common ability for in-hand-manipulation, where an object (such as a car key) may repositioned relative to the palm. In this letter, we present a simple mechanical analogy to the human finger pad, via a robotic finger with both high- and low-friction surfaces. The low-friction surface is suspended on elastic elements and recesses into a cavity when a sufficient normal force is applied ( 1.2 to 2.5 N depending on contact location), exposing the high-friction surface. We implement one ``variable friction'' finger and one ``constant friction'' finger on a 2-DOF gripper with a simple torque controller. With this setup, we demonstrate how within-hand rolling and sliding of an object may be achieved without the need for tactile sensing, high-dexterity, dynamic finger/object modeling, or complex control methods. The addition of an actuator to the finger design allows controlled switching between variable-friction and constant-friction modes, enabling precise object translation and reorientation within a grasp, via simple motion sequences. The rolling and sliding behaviors are characterized with experimentally verified geometric models.},

In this work we present the design of a novel end-effector that merges the essential mechanics and control simplicity of underactuated devices, together with the high levels of manipulability usually featured in dexterous robotic hands. To obtain this enhancement, the proposed gripper considers the possibility offered by active surfaces, i.e. engineered contact surfaces able to simulate different levels of friction and to apply tangential thrust to the contacted object. The actual dexterity enhancement is evaluated by an analytical manipulability analysis and some examples of in hand manipulations and grasps are taken into account. A mechanical solution is presented, which implements the proposed idea through the adoption of one DoF active surfaces mounted on the fingers. The proposed solution presents a manipulability index one order of magnitude higher than common grippers.},

  abstract = {Soft grippers can be used to grasp objects with various geometric surface structures or stiffness but typically encounter difficulty in providing high grasping force. Although the combination of soft grippers with adhesive technology can increase their load capacity, this approach has disadvantages of compatibility and limited application range. This article has reported a bioinspired design of a soft gripper that integrates flat dry adhesive, soft actuator, and microspine to improve the comprehensive grasping ability of the soft gripper on smooth or rough surfaces. The adhesive strength of flat dry adhesives with different thickness or cross-linking ratios was investigated to ensure that a large grasping force can be provided. Soft actuators with uniform and nonuniform cross-sectional heights were compared, and results indicated that the soft actuator with a nonuniform cross-sectional height exhibited remarkable advantages for designing the integrated gripper. A microspine-spring-shape memory alloy coil structure was designed to control the retraction and protrusion of microspine and distribute the load on rough surfaces evenly. The proposed integrated gripper with the aforementioned design can lift regularly or irregularly shaped objects with smooth or rough surfaces and provide a higher adhesive force than the nonadhesive gripper. After inserting a flexible pressure film sensor into the soft gripper, the surface property of the grasped object can be measured, which is beneficial for the selection of a suitable grasping strategy in unknown environments. The designed gripper can be used in many applications, such as in unmanned aerial vehicles, industrial manipulators, and climbing robots.},

  abstract = {This article describes a set of control algorithms for in-hand object handling using a parallel jaw gripper equipped with force/tactile sensors. The control strategy is model based and relies upon the limit surface concept. The LuGre friction model is combined with the limit surface method to set up a dynamic model of soft contact. The model is exploited to estimate the relative velocity of the object with respect to the fingers, so as to control the grip force to counteract possible slipping events due to external disturbances. Force/tactile feedback, the only perception source used by the algorithms, is suitably exploited not only for safe grasping of a variety of objects with uncertain weight and inertial properties, but also for in-hand manipulation actions, like object pivoting or gripper pivoting. Since the algorithm is based on the control of the object velocity, accuracy of the desired object positioning depends on the initial grasp configuration, as well as on the accuracy of the friction model parameters. Such manipulation skills are evaluated in the execution of various pick and place tasks typical of an in-store logistic scenario.},

  abstract = {Robots use their end-effectors to grasp and manipulate objects in unstructured and dynamic environments. Robot hands and grippers can vary from rigid and complex designs to soft, inflatable, and lightweight structures. In this paper, we focus on the modeling and development of a pneumatically driven soft robotic gripper with retractable telescopic fingers and finger bases with abduction / adduction capabilities. Both the main fingers and the base actuators use a pre-folded, telescopic structure facilitating passive retraction. The efficiency of the proposed device is experimentally validated through different types of experiments: i) grasping experiments that involve different everyday objects ranging from household objects and fragile items to medical waste and consumables, ii) force exertion experiments that capture the maximum forces that can be exerted by the proposed device when utilizing the different actuators of the gripper, and iii) grasp resistance experiments that focus on the effect of the inflatable structure on resisting environmental uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed gripper is able to grasp a plethora of objects, and can exert more than 14 N of grasping force. The design is so low-cost and modular that the soft fingers and palm pad of the gripper can be used in a disposable manner, facilitating the execution of specialized tasks (e.g., grasping in contaminated environments, handling of medical waste, etc). When it is not inflated, the gripper profile is thin and compact to facilitate storage.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the development of a compliant, modular, reconfigurable, and sensorized robotic hand with multiple grasping capabilities. Each finger consists of a soft pneumatic actuator with embedded fabric force sensor and a detachable casing. The casing has a through hole for housing the actuator and special connectors for attachment to other casings. One casing each from the thumb and finger parts has a protrusion for connecting both parts together via a screw tightening system. The through-hole design allows different grasping length to be achieved and the inflated pneumatic channel of the actuator locks it in place. The modular robotic hand is capable of various versatile grasping tasks by simply changing the bending direction of the actuator, the distance between the thumb and finger parts, the grasping length of the actuator, or attaching/detaching additional fingers to the hand. (1) Hook grasping with single finger, (2) pinching with pad opposition, (3) reverse grasping for holding a pipe-like object, (4) wrap grasping with palm opposition, as well as (5) picking up an object through its handle with one thumb and two or more fingers were illustrated. These studies show the capability of the compliant modular robotic hand in performing various types of grasping by simply using different configurations of the casings. The excellent payload-to-weight ratio of the robotic hand was demonstrated. Also, the fabric force sensor that was embedded in the soft actuator indicated the difference in grasping forces that were applied to different objects during hook grasping. The modular robotic hand has the potential to broaden or substitute the usage of existing robotic hands, especially in applications where soft versatile configurable grasping is desired.},

Parametric FE analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of process and design parameters, such as rubber material, pressure, initial jaw displacement and friction. Based on the FEA results, a simple, single rubber-pocketed flexible gripper was designed and built. Feasibility experiments were performed to demonstrate and obtain an overall understanding about the capability and limitations of the gripper. It was found that objects with different shapes (cylindrical, prismatic and complex), weight (50g--20kg.), and types (egg, steel hemi-spheres, wax cylinders, etc.) could be picked and placed without any loss of control of the object. The range of positioning error for two different part shapes (i.e., prismatic or cylindrical) was found to be 20--90{$\mu$}m (translational) and 0.03--0.9{$^\circ$} (rotational).},

A new module is introduced here to compensate for the error caused by the deviation of the contact locations due to the rolling contacts between the fingertips and the handled object. On the basis of the contact kinematics, the "rolling contact" module updates the contact locations to modify the position and force references sent to each local finger controller in order to account for the motion of the contact points.},

Then we set up a whole pick-and-place experiment system to evaluate the operational performance in the real serving situations. The results indicate that for most rigid objects, our prototype with soft fingertips, the stiffness of which is over the threshold to bear maximum task load after jamming, can demonstrate higher grasping stability than rigid ones, reduce around 40\% motor drive power consumption and have a higher load capacity compared with the rigid-fingertip prototype under stable grasping, and have a relatively better operating precision of\,{\textpm}\,0.62\,mm compared to most of previous soft grippers when placing objects with equal weight. The findings can facilitate to improve the grasping precision of mechanical hands with soft fingertips.},

In this paper, only two simple sensors were used in a soft pneumatic gripper (SPG) control system to make it possess innervated-like ability. The control system was conducted with only two sensors, air pressure sensor and bending sensor where the air pressure sensor is able to detect grasping force and the bending sensor is able to detect grasping position The bending sensor was characterized by testing on pressure vs. bending and bending vs. size relationships. The principle of circular-shaped object size recognition was presented in Algorithm 1. Multi-group tests had been done on grasping different size and material objects, and test results had a strong effect on size recognition ability of the SPG. Finally, adaptive grasping control process was presented in Algorithm 2. The tests on grasping the same size objects had been done. The test results demonstrate that the SPG is able to maintain stable grasping state for a long time based on size recognition ability no matter what material the object is. At the same time, it had no effect on the grasping state at the time of existing disturbance, which had been verified by four different disturbance tests. The SPG will benefit the development of soft robotics field in picking and sorting fruits and vegetables, and an application of the SPG affixed on the home-made palletizing robot was described and conducted at last.},

In addition, the control performance of the robots has not been discussed sufficiently. This paper proposes a novel inflatable robotic arm composed of poly-laminated sheets and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sheets. The combination of the two materials provides high-pressure resistance. Several advantages are also given: high torque, high control performance, and high load capacity. Moreover, both pressure and visual feedback controls are utilized to realize precise motion control.

Soft robotic structures permits continuous and responsive localized deformation. These properties of soft robots make them suit-able for gripper arms that can be used to handle fragile and delicate objects. In this work, Pnuematic Networks (Pneu-net) are designed in the structure, which is made up of a series of channels and chambers inside an elastomer. These channels inflate when pressurized, creating motion. The material of choice was selected to be LSR220 Series silicone rubber due to its elastic properties and ease of manufacturing. The Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the actuator is initially developed and then a mold is prepared accordingly for it and we use Rapid Prototyping (RPT) to make the mold. The liquid silicone is then mixed with catalyst and poured in the mold and a plain sheet with cloth embedded in between is prepared for the strain layer. These two layers are then stuck using silicone and when air pressure is supplied, the mismatch strain in layers leads to the bending action of the actuator. Improvements from the traditional silicon-based actuators are tear resistance, uniform pressure distribution, faster and easier manufacturing.},

Various, mostly complex grippers already exist based on certain actuation concepts. However, each solution has specific limitations, especially regarding gripping different soft and delicate objects. Therefore, this paper introduces a new approach to design a simple, adaptive, and versatile soft robotic two-finger gripper that is based on compliant mechanisms. More specifically, an inherently gentle touch is realized by utilizing an optimally synthesized mechanism with distributed compliance in combination with a conventional linear actuator. It is shown by finite elements method (FEM) simulations that the gripper realizes a high force and motion transmission at the same time. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by tests with a gripper prototype that reliable, safe, and fast grasping as well as manipulation are possible for a wide variety of objects. It is shown that beside regular and stiff objects also very challenging objects can be easily gripped, e.g., small, irregular, soft, and squeezable objects like fruits, berries, and vegetables. Moreover, it is confirmed that the developed compliant two-finger gripper can be used beneficially without sensors and control for differently sized and shaped objects with a comparable weight.},

In this chapter, we introduce a hierarchically structured method that combines a dynamic controller for conducting primitive motions and a deep reinforcement learning network to generate the action sequence of the primitive motions. The primitive motions for the in-hand manipulation are defined heuristically, based on whether the motion aims at moving the object or changing the contact configuration of the hand. We test our method with a three-finger simulated hand, and the results show that the hand can move a pole-shaped object freely among all the possible poses in the workspace. Experiments also show that our method is robust to environmental errors, while stably grasping the object during the entire manipulation sequence. We also show that the method could generalize to objects of other shapes.},

  abstract = {Soft robots are a nascent field that aims to provide a safe interaction with humans and better adaptability to unstructured environments. Many tentacle-like one-dimensional soft robots that can mimic the basic motion in nature are developed owing to ease of design and fabrication. To expand the spectrum of soft robots, this paper gives a detailed introduction of a new type of sheet-like two-dimensional soft robot. This soft robot is called soft robotic surface (SRS), which is actuated by pneumatic network bending actuators. An analytical model of the SRS is constructed based on the minimum potential energy method, which considers both its geometry complexity and material nonlinearity. The comparisons among the analytical, experimental, and numerical results demonstrate that the analytical model can accurately predict the SRS deformation. The maximum root mean squared error for the surface morphing is 3.429 mm, which is less than 5\% of the maximum displacement for the free end. The effects of the actuating pressure and structural parameter on the SRS deformation are also investigated. The results reveal that the deformation shape of the SRS can be reconfigured by controlling the applied pressure. And the bending angle of the two actuators both decreases with the increase of the width and thickness of the soft surface. The SRS extends the research on soft robots and the developed analytical model also solves the fundamental problem of how to programme the surface morphing of soft robot surfaces. Finally, we fabricate a soft gripper that can grasp object objects with different sizes, shapes, and stiffness, which demonstrates the application of the SRS.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTFor stable robotic grasping, a surface with high friction is required; thus, a soft surface is preferable. In contrast, a slippery surface is preferable for inserting fingers into a narrow space or placing a grasped object on a table. Additionally, in an environment involving humans, such operations are performed under dry and wet conditions. Hence, this study aims at developing a soft robotic fingertip with a friction control system in which the surface friction is actively controllable under dry and wet conditions, whereas the external effects on friction, such as wetness, are minimized. The basic concept involves achieving high friction under both conditions by using a slit surface texture, while friction is reduced with a lubricating system by utilizing capillary action. The experimental validation shows that the proposed lubricating system embedded in a robotic finger surface successfully reduces friction under both conditions. The releasing and grasping operations reveal the efficacy of the proposed system in an actual situation. Additionally, the mechanism of the lubricating method is confirmed by introducing the spreading coefficient.GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT},

The soft robot hands can stably grip many types of objects owing to their high elasticity, causing a large friction force. However, the soft robotic hands cannot manipulate an object easily because the large contact area and frictional force inhibits motion. Sliding is required for manipulation. Hence, we herein present a novel friction variable surface utilizing contact area transition by structural deformation. The surface is termed a contact area variable surface (CAVS). The friction change can be activated passively, and the CAVS can create a soft surface, thereby maintaining the benefit of soft robotic hands.

Current manufacturing techniques, however, are incapable of massive parallel handling of objects at these scales. The lack of manufacturing techniques for massive parallel manipulation of so small objects presents a technology barrier to the eventual commercial success in fields like MEMS. The programmable and position closed-loop controllable pneumatic active surface device presented in this paper is a fundamentally new approach to automated massive small-sized parts manipulation. The appropriate choice of force generated by blowing or sucking air-flow through tubes of the pneumatic active surface device, is shown to cause objects placed on the array to be moved in manners that are useful It offers greater ability and speed and it can be employed to position, orient, identify, sort, feed, and assemble parts or objects on the active surface device. It can control several objects simultaneously. This paper first describes an experimental device and potential applications, and then it focuses on closed-loop positioning control techniques (translating) for rigid (VLSI chips, MEMS) objects and flexible (PVC polyvinyl foil, paper). The implemented control strategies have been successfully tested on the experimental device as described in the paper.},

The proposed grasper has two important qualities: versatility and less complexity. The former refers to the ability to grasp a range of objects having different geometrical shape, size, and payload and perform in-hand manipulations such as rolling and sliding, and the latter refers to the uncomplicated design, and ease of planning and control strategies. Increasing the number of functions performed by the grasper to adapt to a variety of tasks in structured and unstructured environments without increasing the mechanical complexity is the main interest of this research. The proposed grasper consists of two hybrid jaws having a rigid inner structure encompassed by a flexible, active gripping surface. The flexibility of the active surface has been exploited to achieve shape conformation, and the same has been utilized with a compact mechanism, introduced in the jaws, to vary the contact forces while grasping and manipulating an object. Simple and scalable structure, compactness, low cost, and simple control scheme are the main features of the proposed design. Detailed kinematic and static analysis are presented to show the capability of the grasper to adjust and estimate the contact forces without using a force sensor. Experiments are conducted on the fabricated prototype to validate the different modes of operation and to evaluate the advantages of the proposed concept.},

The inner cavity of pillars is pressurized positively before the contact. The effect of the cavity on the adhesion is examined for different cavity diameters and different membrane thicknesses over the cavity. The shape of the tip of the pillars is changed in accordance with the cavity dimension and the positive cavity pressure, which allows the change of an adhesive contact type from a flat-punch adhesive contact to a spherical adhesive contact that results in tunable adhesion strength of circular pillars. The results demonstrate that having an inner cavity reduces the adhesion, where the cavity diameter is more effective than the membrane thickness over the cavity on the reduction of the adhesive force. Applying pressure to the inner cavity of the pillars changes the sphericity, which alters the adhesive force accordingly. The sphericity \$\$0.1 almost has no effect on the tunable adhesion strength, where the higher sphericity results in the reduction of the adhesive force from high adhesive force to low adhesive force linearly with a tunable efficiency between 95\% and 98\%.},

  abstract = {Robotic automation continues to develop and is constantly in need for new gripping devices. Devices are needed to handle small delicate objects for pick and place applications. Traditional rigid grippers have difficulty adapting to varying objects, and pneumatic grippers require bulky pumps and compressed air. Dry adhesion devices can remove the need for rigid components or pneumatics by relying on adhesion as the main method to pick up and manipulate objects. Tunable dry adhesion refers to the ability of controlling adhesion, increasing and decreasing it as the task requires. Research continues to develop devices that offer the highest tunability ratio. Based on a subsurface stiffness modulating device proposed by Shan et al. a novel method for increase adhesion in the normal direction is proposed, using circular defects on the adhering surface of a PDMS (polydimethysiloxane) post. The fabrication process included photolithography and molding which produced high resolution defects with high placement accuracy. The proposed patterns resulted in an increased adhesion, and for certain patterns, an increase of roughly 40\%, compared to a flat PDMS post. Simulations helped explain the point of failure observed in the experimental results and provided some clarification to the increase of adhesion. Contact splitting and other mechanics offer explanations for the increase of adhesion and work continues to be done to further identify the mechanics involved. Defect patterning can be paired with subsurface stiffness modulation, previously studied by the Shan Research Group to increase the tunability ratio and develop new devices for pick and place automation.},

  abstract = {Surfaces comprised of soft elastomeric materials can adhere to a broad range of substrates and thus have applications in transfer printing, handling in automated manufacturing processes, and climbing robots. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Ecoflex-50 are among the most commonly used elastomers in soft robotics due to their manufacturability and desirable mechanical properties. Previous studies have shown that the inclusion of a stiffness tunable core in a cylindrical PDMS pillar can enhance the dry adhesion strength of the pillar to an opposing rigid surface significantly. Here, I investigate three different approaches to enhance the dry adhesion of soft gripping mechanisms integrating smart materials and adhesion mechanics. First, the effect of the cross-sectional geometry on enhancing the dry adhesion strength of soft composite elastomeric structures is examined. Second, the effect of inserting a thin serpentine channel of a low melting point alloy (LMPA) close to the interface of an elastomeric post for dynamical dry adhesion tuning is investigated. Third, a cylindrical soft homogenous elastomeric structure is designed with a hollow annular chamber embedded close to the edge of the structure to dynamically tune its dry adhesion strength with varied pneumatic pressure. The dry adhesion is tuned in all the approaches because the stress distribution at the adhered interface is altered. For the latter two approaches, dynamic dry adhesion tuning is achieved, either through subsurface stiffness modulation (SSM), or through subsurface pressure modulation (SPM). In the first approach, the dry adhesion strength of relatively stiff PDMS pillars terminated with a compliant Ecoflex layer at the tip with circular, square and rectangular cross-sections are explored through experiments and Finite Element (FE) simulations. Experiments show that the adhesion strength can be tuned up to {\textasciitilde}65 kPa via the manipulation of the thickness of the Ecoflex layer for all these three pillar cross-sectional shapes. Stress distribution simulations show that the crack initiation site shifts from the edge to the center of the adhered interface and finally to an internal point at the adhered interface as the compliant tip layer thickness decreases. In the second approach, the dry adhesion strength of the rectangular PDMS posts embedded with serpentine channel of LMPA is tuned dynamically almost two times when the LMPA layer is softened using electrical voltages. In the third approach, the dry adhesion strength of the pressure-operated device against multiple types of substrates for different sealing layer thicknesses of the device and different chamber pressures is characterized and FEA has been used to explain the mechanics behind it. Results show that the dry adhesion strength of the device can be tuned up to {\textasciitilde}1.5{$\sigma$}0, and as low as {\textasciitilde}0.05{$\sigma$}0, depending on the dimensions of the device, where {$\sigma$}0 is the adhesion strength of the device in the non-pressurized state.},

The effect of pillar geometry on the shear adhesion behavior of these nanopillar arrays is investigated via sliding experiments in a nanoindentation system. In a previous study of arrays with the same geometry, it was shown that cone-shaped nanopillars exhibit the highest adhesion under normal loading while stepwise and pencil-like nanopillars exhibit lower normal adhesion strength due to significant deformation of the pillars that occurs with increasing indentation depth. Contrary to the previous studies, here, we show that pencil-like nanopillars exhibit the highest shear adhesion strength at all indentation depths among three types of nanopillar arrays and that the shear adhesion increases with greater indentation depth due to the higher bending stiffness and closer packing of the pencil-like nanopillar array. Finite element simulations are used to elucidate the deformation of the pillars during the sliding experiments and agree with the nanoindentation-based sliding measurements. The experiments and finite element simulations together demonstrate that the shape of the nanopillars plays a key role in shear adhesion and that the mechanism is quite different from that of adhesion under normal loading.},

Understanding the interface behavior and further exploring the physical mechanism are of significance for properly designing the structure dimension with enhanced performance. However, the friction contribution to such type of adhesive structures is mostly overlooked in previous investigations. In this paper, by revisiting the detachment behavior associated with the calculation of the critical dynamic crack size making the contact interface destabilized, it is demonstrated that the friction force does work in the detachment process of mushroom-shaped micropillars. The calculated maximum pull-off forces are in good agreement with experimental results and the friction force contribution can reach up to about 41\% of the total adhesive force when the tip diameter is 2.6 times the diameter of the supporting pillar. The present model provides a deeper insight into the mushroom-shaped dry adhesives and may be helpful in future bioinspired dry adhesives designs.},

These structures enable exquisite conformation to rough surfaces, increase the number of van der Waals interactions between the structure and the target surface, and thus enhance adhesion. Biomimetic adhesives replicate this effect by patterning polymer films with micron- or sub-micron-sized protrusions. Numerical contact-mechanics models as well as experimental adhesion measurements have been reported for a variety of protrusion shapes including flat, rounded, mushroom and spatula geometries. Although superior adhesion has been reported for the mushroom and spatula tip geometries, straight, flat-tipped pillars offer the potential for much simpler mass production such as by injection moulding and are thus the focus of this review. Existing models for straight, flat-tipped pillar arrays do not fully agree with reported experimental results. Analytical models are generally limited to elastic materials, and inherently assume that neighbouring pillars behave independently. For elastic pillars in close proximity, however, pillars do in fact interact mechanically, affecting adhesion. Moreover, visco- and hyper-elastic materials are often used in practice, yet dissipative effects receive little attention in analytical models. We find that no study has conclusively investigated the limit of adhesive strength achievable by fibrillar adhesives. It also remains unclear what happens to the adhesive strength as the areal density of contacting regions approaches 100\%.},

  abstract = {Setae, fibrils located on a gecko's feet, have been an inspiration of synthetic dry microfibrillar adhesives in the last two decades for a wide range of applications due to unique properties: residue-free, repeatable, tunable, controllable and silent adhesion; self-cleaning; and breathability. However, designing dry fibrillar adhesives is limited by a template-based-design-approach using a pre-determined bioinspired T- or wedge-shaped mushroom tip. Here, a machine learning-based computational approach to optimize designs of adhesive fibrils is shown, exploring a much broader design space. A combination of Bayesian optimization and finite element methods creates novel optimal designs of adhesive fibrils, which are fabricated by two-photon-polymerization-based 3D microprinting and double-molding-based replication out of polydimethylsiloxane. Such optimal elastomeric fibril designs outperform previously proposed designs by maximum 77\% in the experiments of dry adhesion performance on smooth surfaces. Furthermore, finite-element-analyses reveal that the adhesion of the fibrils is sensitive to the 3D fibril stem shape, tensile deformation, and fibril microfabrication limits, which contrast with the previous assumptions that mostly neglect the deformation of the fibril tip and stem, and focus only on the fibril tip geometry. The proposed computational fibril design could help design future optimal fibrils with less help from human intuition.},

The adhesion strength on nano-rough surfaces invariably decreased with increasing roughness, but pillar arrays retained higher adhesion strengths than unpatterned controls in all cases. The results were analyzed with a model that focuses on the effect on adhesion of depressions in a rough surface. The model fits the data very well, suggesting that the pull-off strength for patterned PDMS is controlled by the deepest dimple-like feature on the rough surface. The lower pull-off strength for unpatterned PDMS may be explained by the initiation of the pull-off process at the edge of the probe, where significant stress concentrates. With micro-rough surfaces, pillar arrays showed maximum adhesion with a certain intermediate roughness, while unpatterned controls did not show any measurable adhesion. This effect can be explained by the inability of micropatterned surfaces to conform to very fine and very large surface asperities.},

Research on how geckos detach rapidly has inspired the design of novel adhesive surfaces with strong and reversible adhesion capabilities, which relies on further fundamental understanding of the peeling mechanisms. Recent studies showed that the peel-zone plays an important role in the peeling off of adhesive tapes or fibrillar surfaces. In this study, a numerical method was developed to evaluate peel-zone deformation and the resulting mechanical behaviour due to the deformations of fibrillar surfaces detaching from a smooth rigid substrate. The effect of the geometrical parameters of pillars and the stiffness of backing layer on the peel-zone and peel strength, and the strong attachment and easy-removal properties have been analysed to establish a design map for bio-inspired fibrillar surfaces, which shows that the optimized strong attachment and easy-removal properties can vary by over three orders of magnitude. The adhesion and peeling design map established provides new insights into the design and development of novel gecko-inspired fibrillar surfaces.},

Tilt-angle-dependent adhesion measurements showed that although the tip shape of the pillars strongly influences the pull-off force, the pull-off strength is similar for flat and mushroom-shaped tips. We found no tilt-angle dependency of adhesion for spherical tip structures and, except for high tilt angle and low preload experiments, no tilt-angle effect for mushroom-tip pillars. For flat-tip pillars, we found a strong influence of tilt angle on adhesion, which decreased linearly with increasing aspect ratio. The experiments show that for the tested aspect ratios between 1 and 5, a linear decrease of tilt-angle dependency is found. The results of our studies will help to design bioinspired adhesives for application on smooth and rough surfaces.},

Such structures provide high compliance such that the flat fibril tips can be better positioned with respect to asperities of a wavy rough substrate. We investigated the buckling and adhesion of hierarchically structured adhesives in contact with flat smooth, flat rough and wavy rough substrates. A macroscopic model for the structural adhesive was fabricated by molding polydimethylsiloxane into pillars of diameter in the range of 0.3--4.8 mm, with up to three different hierarchy levels. Both flat-ended and mushroom-shaped hierarchical samples buckled at preloads one quarter that of the single level structures. We explain this behavior by a change in the buckling mode; buckling leads to a loss of contact and diminishes adhesion. Our results indicate that hierarchical structures can have a strong influence on the degree of adhesion on both flat and wavy substrates. Strategies are discussed that achieve highly compliant substrates which adhere to rough substrates.},

  abstract = {Geckos and smaller animals such as flies, beetles, and spiders have extraordinary climbing abilities: They can firmly attach and rapidly detach from almost any kind of surface. In the case of geckos, this ability is attributed to the surface topography of their attachment pads, which are covered with fine columnar structures (setae). Inspired by this biological system, various kinds of regularly structured or ``patterned'' surfaces are being fabricated for use as responsive adhesives or in robotic systems. In this study, we theoretically analyze the correlated adhesion and friction (frictional adhesion) of patterned surfaces against smooth (unstructured) surfaces by applying well-established theories of van der Waals forces, together with the classic Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory of contact (or adhesion) mechanics, to recent theories of adhesion-controlled friction. Our results, when considered with recent experiments, suggest criteria for simultaneously optimizing the adhesion and friction of patterned surfaces. We show that both the van der Waals adhesion and the friction forces of flexible, tilted, and optimally spaced setal stalks or (synthetic) pillars are high enough to support not only a large gecko on rough surfaces of ceilings (adhesion) and walls (friction) but also a human being if the foot or toe pads---effectively the area of the hands---have a total area estimated at {$\sim$}230 cm2.},

The pillars are 35 {$\mu$}m in diameter, 90 {$\mu$}m tall, and angled at an inclination of 20{$^\circ$}. By gently pressing the tip of a pillar to a part, the pillar adheres to it through intermolecular forces. Next, by retracting quickly, the part is picked from a given donor substrate. During transferring, the adhesion between the pillar and the part is high enough to withstand disturbances due to external forces or the weight of the part. During release of the part onto a receiver substrate, the contact area of the pillar to the part is drastically reduced by controlled vertical or shear displacement, which results in reduced adhesive forces. The maximum repeatable ratio of pick-to-release adhesive forces is measured as 39 to 1. It is found that a flat tip shape and shear displacement control provide a higher pick-to-release adhesion ratio than a round tip and vertical displacement control, respectively. A model of forces to serve as a framework for the operation of this micromanipulator is presented. Finally, demonstrations of pick-and-place manipulation of micrometer-scale silicon microplatelets and a centimeter-scale glass cover slip serve as proofs of the concept. The compliant polymer micropillars are safe for use with fragile parts, and, due to exploiting intermolecular forces, could be effective on most materials and in air, vacuum, and liquid environments.},

This study is the first to systematically investigate the effect of peel angle, pillar diameter, and pillar aspect ratio on the force required for peeling. Explicit emphasis was placed on relatively large pillar structures to allow for in situ optical visualization in order to gain insights into fundamental mechanisms which dictate peeling. Traditional molding techniques were used to fabricate optical-scale mushroom terminated structures with pillar diameters of 1 mm and 400 {$\mu$}m and aspect ratios of 1, 3, and 5. Results were quantitatively compared to peel testing theory for conventional adhesives. It was convincingly demonstrated that the critical decohesion energy of a patterned surface changes as a function of angle and cannot be treated as a constant. Variability in the critical decohesion energy was linked to mechanistic differences in detachment through in situ observations and finite element analysis (FEA). Experimental results showed that smaller pillars do not necessarily lead to higher adhesion during peeling, and contact mechanics combined with optical observations were used to explain this phenomenon. Finally, unlike results from normal adhesion studies, aspect ratio was shown to play little role in peeling adhesive behavior due to the mechanics of peel testing. The results and conclusions from this study uncover the detachment mechanisms of mushroom-shape tipped dry adhesives under peel loading and serve as an outline for the design of these surfaces in peeling applications.},

Yet, most of the current studies merely focus on borrowing the concept from some finer biological contact elements but lose sight of the foundation ones that play an equally important role in the adhesion functionality. Inspired by the bending behavior of the flexible foundation element of a gecko (lamellar skin) in attachment motion, in this study, a new type of dry adhesive structure was proposed, wherein a mushroom-shaped micropillar array behaving as a strongly adhesive layer was engineered on a discretely supported thin film. We experimentally observed and analytically modeled the structural deformation and found that the energy penalty could be largely reduced because of the partial shift from pillar bending to film bending. Such behavior is very analogous in functionality to the lamellar skin in a gecko's pads and is helpful in effectively limiting the damage of the contact interface, thus generating enhanced adhesion even on a rough surface.},

We present a solution for grasping such surfaces consisting of groups of tiles coated with a controllable gecko-inspired adhesive. The tiles are loaded with two sets of tendons: one for distributing the forces evenly while grasping and the other for release. The gripper is passive and can attach and detach with little effort so that it does not disturb either the robot or the object to be grasped. The maximum gripping force in the normal direction can be over 1000 times greater than the required detaching force. The gripper is also fast, allowing a flying quadrotor to attach to a surface milliseconds after the tiles make contact.

It is desirable to predict the maximum forces and moments the gripper can exert without slipping.

  abstract = {The fragile structure of the tomato fruit body leads to susceptibility to bruising caused by the aggressiveness of harvest and postharvest processes. Thus, grasping without damaging the tomato fruits is a key barrier to the replacement of manual labour by robotic harvesting. In this study, a four-element Burger model was used to express reversible viscoelastic behaviour and deformation characteristics of tomatoes at early and middle red-ripening stages. Additionally, creep tests were conducted to obtain the viscoelastic parameters of the Burger model. The model for plastic deformation of tomato during grasping was finally developed based on input force, contact time, and viscoelastic parameters. In order to explore the least damaging grasping pattern, plastic deformation caused by three grasping patterns (denoted as Pattern I, Pattern II, and Pattern III) were investigated and compared in our study. A linear function, a Butterworth amplitude square function, and an exponential function were used to represent the velocity variations in the three grasping patterns during the robot grasping operation. This was used to solve the model of plastic deformation of tomato, and the changing rules of tomato plastic deformations under different grasping patterns were analysed under constant grasping time. The results indicate that grasping Pattern III is the optimal grasping strategy, the lowest plastic deformation of tomatoes is obtained with grasping time t0=1s and grasping velocity v0=1mms-1 and the plastic deformations correspond to 0.0026~mm and 0.0098~mm for tomatoes at early and middle red-ripening stages, respectively. A grasping control experiment was also conducted under grasping Pattern III, and the correlation coefficient of 0.99 for the simulation and measured results indicated the rationality and feasibility of grasping Pattern III as the optimal grasping strategy. Our study provides a theoretical basis to optimise agricultural robot grasping.},

  abstract = {Robotic grippers are extensively investigated as terminal actuators for gripping workpieces in robotic applications. Lately, implementing closed-loop force control for grippers to grip fragile workpieces securely is attractive. This paper aims to provide a dual-security solution combining gripping force control and stress-buffering capability. An integrated force-sensitive smart polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam containing an embedded force-sensitive resistor (FSR) was designed and directly fabricated by 3D printing technology. The real-time force measurement was fed back into the control loop with proportional-integral (PI) rectification to precisely regulate the driving air pressure. In addition, the inherent stress plateau effect of the PDMS foam structure provides a constant stress buffer to absorb potential collision energy. The results show that the dual-security gripper with smart PDMS foam is able to precisely control the applied force and reliably grip fragile objects even in the presence of disturbances, enhancing the reliability of gripping applications.},

The gripper structure is a hybrid of soft and stiff components to facilitate integration with traditional arm manipulators. Three fingers and a palm constitute the gripper, all of which are vacuum actuated. Internal wedges are used to tailor the deformation of a soft outer reinforced skin as vacuum collapses the composite structure. A computational finite-element model is proposed to predict finger kinematics. Thanks to its active palm, the gripper is capable of grasping a wide range of part geometries and compliances while achieving a maximum payload of 30 N. The gripper natural softness enables robust open-loop grasping even when components are not properly aligned. Furthermore, the grasp pose of objects with various aspect ratios and compliances can be robustly maintained during manipulation at linear accelerations of up to 15 m/s2 and angular accelerations of up to 5.23 rad/s2.},

However, even for the elastomer most commonly employed in microfluidic applications, Sylgard 184, only a very limited range of data exists regarding the variation in mechanical properties of bulk PDMS with curing temperature. We report an investigation of the variation in the mechanical properties of bulk Sylgard 184 with curing temperature, over the range 25 {$^\circ$}C to 200 {$^\circ$}C. PDMS samples for tensile and compressive testing were fabricated according to ASTM standards. Data obtained indicates variation in mechanical properties due to curing temperature for Young's modulus of 1.32--2.97 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 3.51--7.65 MPa, compressive modulus of 117.8--186.9 MPa and ultimate compressive strength of 28.4--51.7 GPa in a range up to 40\% strain and hardness of 44--54 ShA.},

Like their models in nature, many artificial mimics can effectively repel water, but fail when low-surface-tension liquids are introduced at the contact interface. A bioinspired fibrillar adhesive surface that is liquid-superrepellent even toward ultralow-surface-tension liquids while retaining its adhesive properties is proposed herein. This surface combines the effective adhesion principle of mushroom-shaped fibrillar arrays with liquid repellency based on double re-entrant fibril tip geometry. The adhesion performance of the proposed microfibril structures is retained even when low-surface-tension liquids are added to the contact interface. The extreme liquid repellency enables real-world applications of fibrillar adhesives for surfaces covered with water, oil, and other liquids. Moreover, fully elastomeric liquid-superrepellent surfaces are mechanically not brittle, highly robust against physical contact, and highly deformable and stretchable, which can increase the real-world uses of such antiwetting surfaces.},

Although MSRs possess many advantages, they are still in the nascent stage with plenty of challenges. Herein, the materials, fabrication, actuation, sensor, and control of various modular units in MSRs are introduced firstly. Then, some main connection methods between modular units are summarized.

We propose a tunable friction mechanism that relies on pneumatic actuation and is easily integrated into pre-existing soft actuators. We characterize the performance of our friction mechanism with quantitative force data for varying preload forces, substrate materials, and inflation pressures. Testing results show that our tunable friction mechanism achieves an order of magnitude differentiation in friction forces between high and low friction states. We demonstrate its potential application in a one degree-of-freedom soft crawler and a soft gripper with actuatable finger friction pads. The crawler successfully propelled itself forward by leveraging asymmetric strokes and the gripper achieved a factor of five differentiation of grip force between engaged and disengaged states of the friction tuning mechanism.},

The challenge of developing robotic grippers that can safely handle a wide variety of objects and remain stable, especially under harsh vibration, is addressed. The gripper uses a main rigid structure for maintaining the stiffness of the robot hand and soft pads under air pressurization for handling the softly and flexibly the objects. The proposed design capitalizes on the advantages of both rigid and soft grippers, by using rigid clamps to achieve robust gripping movements. Simultaneously, exploiting the soft pads' deformation to generate gripping force, this integration not only has high reliability but also guarantees safety in gripping objects. The novel concept, design, and fabrication of the gripper are introduced. Then, the gripper's ability was validated through mathematical modeling, analysis, and experiments. In particular, the geometrical kinematics of the rigid mechanism and deformation of the soft element is mathematical modeled and numerical simulation. Subsequently, the effective gripping size and contact force are analyzed. Experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and simulations, as well as to assess the capabilities of the proposed gripper design. The gripping experiment validates that the gripper can securely grasp a diverse range of objects while ensuring stability during subsequent movements, even under intense high-frequency vibration conditions. This gripper design can be applied for handling a wide range of objects with varying sizes, masses, fragility, and placement positions, specially when the gripping process necessitates both safe interaction and high reliability.},

At present, most related research often improves the grasping and manipulation performance by structural design. When soft grippers rely on compressive force and friction to achieve grasping, the influence of the surface microstructure is also significant. Three types of fingerprint-inspired textures with relatively regular patterns were prepared on a silicone rubber surface via mold casting by imitating the three basic shapes of fingerprint patterns (i.e., whorls, loops, and arches). Tribological experiments and tip pinch tests were performed using fingerprint-like silicone rubber films rubbing against glass in dry and lubricated conditions to examine their performance. In addition to the textured surface, a smooth silicone rubber surface was used as a control. The results indicated that the coefficient of friction (COF) of the smooth surface was much higher than that of films with fingerprint-like textures in dry and water-lubricated conditions. The surface with fingerprint-inspired textures achieved a higher COF in oil-lubricated conditions. Adding the fingerprint-like films to the soft robotic fingers improved the tip pinch gripping performance of the soft robotic hand in lubricated conditions. This study demonstrated that the surface texture design provided an effective method for regulating the grasping capability of humanoid robotic hands.},

By exploiting tactile filters, mechanical structures between the sensing unit and the environment, it is possible to tune the interaction dynamics with the surrounding environment. But how can we design a good tactile filter? Previously, the role of filters' geometry and stiffness on the quality of the tactile data has been the subject of several studies, both implementing static filters and adaptable filters. State-of-the-art works on online adaptive stiffness highlight a crucial role of the filters' mechanical behaviour in the structure of the recorded tactile data. However, the relation between the filter's and environment's characteristics is still largely unknown. We want to show what is the effect of the environment's mechanical properties on the structure of the acquired tactile data and the performance of a classification task, while testing a wide range of static tactile filters. Moreover, we fabricate the filters using 4 materials commonly exploited in soft robotics, to merge the gap between tactile sensing and robotic applications. We collect data from the interaction with a standard set of 12 objects of different materials, shapes and textures, and we analyze the effect of the filter's material on the structure of such data and the performance of 9 common machine learning classifiers, both considering the overall test set and the 3 individual subsets made by all objects of the same material. We show that depending on the material of the test objects, there is a drastic change in performance of the 4 tested filters, and that the filter that matches the mechanical properties of the environment always outperforms the others.},

However, the regulation of wrinkled patterns and the influence of friction property remain poorly understood, especially in the field of oxides. The epitaxial wrinkled BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are prepared by the pulsed laser deposition and water-dissolution process. The patterns, amplitude, and wavelength of the wrinkled BTO membranes are dependent on the thickness, pre-stretched mechanical stress, and heat treatment. The friction properties of the wrinkled BTO membranes exhibit various anisotropic and periodic features due to the varying wrinkled patterns as applying different mechanical stress, including anisotropy with 180{$^\circ$} angular periodicity, anisotropy with 360{$^\circ$} angular periodicity, and isotropy, corresponding to the parallel, zigzag, and labyrinth patterns, respectively. Moreover, the heat process can further alter the magnitude of the friction property, showing a downward trend with increasing temperature. These results provide a better understanding of the friction properties of wrinkled patterns and pave a novel way to alter the friction properties for extensive applications.},

  abstract = {Sensor morphology and structure has the ability to significantly aid and improve tactile sensing capabilities, through mechanisms such as improved sensitivity or morphological computation. However, different tactile tasks require different morphologies posing a challenge as to how to best design sensors, and also how to enable sensor morphology to be varied. We introduce a jamming filter which, when placed over a tactile sensor, allows the filter to be shaped and molded online, thus varying the sensor structure. We demonstrate how this is beneficial for sensory tasks analyzing how the change in sensor structure varies the information that is gained using the sensor. Moreover, we show that appropriate morphology can significantly influence discrimination, and observe how the selection of an appropriate filter can increase the object classification accuracy when using standard classifiers by up to 28{\textbackslash}\%.},

Herein, variation of supporting layer rigidity induced dynamic control of anisotropic friction of biomimetic surface with structures oriented to supporting substrate is demonstrated. The biomimetic surface with oriented hook-like spines microstructures embedded in polymeric substrate is fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing followed by transfer reproduction. Incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with excellent near-infrared (NIR)/infrared (IR) photothermogenesis in the substrate results in its variable rigidity with light on/off, which achieves the tunable anisotropic friction performance of the biomimetic surface. A proof-of-concept device with the function of Velcro type strip is demonstrated to unsnap the fastener by remote NIR/IR light, revealing its promising for designing intelligent control devices. It is believed that this novel anisotropic friction controllable system with photothermogenesis-induced supporting layer rigidity variation will provide wide and potential applications in various fields including sensors, robots, and other bionic devices.},

We investigate the wearless sliding friction between a rigid hemispherical indenter and a deformable textured surface, which is shape-tunable wrinkles. The size of the indenter is comparable to the wavelength of the wrinkles. We evaluate the effects on the friction of the aspect ratio of the wrinkles, the applied normal load, and the alignment direction of the wrinkles relative to the sliding direction. The frictional oscillations are observed during sliding in the direction perpendicular to the alignment using optical images and friction profiles. The correlation of friction force oscillation with deformation of the wrinkles is elucidated using Hertz contact theory. Within a cycle of frictional oscillation, the friction force increases as the front part of the indenter elastically plows the crests. When the normal load is high and/or the aspect ratio of the wrinkles is low, the indenter continues to squash the wrinkles and remains in contact with them during sliding. Consequently, the amplitude of friction force oscillation relative to the averaged friction force decreases.},

For their actual uses, sheets with a large area are desired. A key challenge on their fabrication is to overcome the non-uniformity of the vertical position of the textile embedded within the elastomeric sheet, which causes substantial reduction in the tunable range of friction. The defect originates from the increased difficulty, as the sheet area is scaled up, of squeezing a viscoelastic precursor liquid due to the use of a deformable elastomeric surface. Here, we report a new two-step method for a textile-embedded elastomeric sheet that avoids using the soft elastomeric surface on the squeezing process and requires post-joining to an elastomeric base sheet. The obtained sheet with a large area (180 {\texttimes} 180 mm), was uniform and showed a large change of friction on its strain-induced transformation between flat and wrinkled states. The relationship between the experimentally controllable parameters and the squeeze film hydrodynamics is theoretically discussed, which is generally applicable to precise embedding micro-objects at the elastomer surface.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve locomotion for soft robots through dynamically tunable friction to address these challenges, which is achieved by subsurface stiffness modulation of a stimuli-responsive component within composite structures. To demonstrate this, we design and fabricate an elastomeric pad made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is embedded with a spiral channel filled with a low melting point alloy (LMPA). Once the LMPA strip is melted upon Joule heating, the compliance of the composite structure increases and the friction between the composite surface and the opposing surface increases. A series of experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) have been performed to characterize the frictional behavior of these composite pads and undercover the underlying physics dominating the tunable friction. We also demonstrate that, when these composite structures are properly integrated to soft crawling robots inspired by inchworms and earthworms, the differences in friction of the two ends through subsurface stiffness modulation can potentially be used to generate translational locomotion for untethered crawling robots.},

By changing the finger geometry, the gripper effectively changes the contact type between the fingers and an object to facilitate distinct manipulation primitives. In this paper, we demonstrate the development and application of shape-shifting fingers to reorient and grasp cylindrical objects. The shape of the fingers changes based on the air pressure inside them and attains two distinct geometric forms at high and low pressure values. In our implementation, the finger shape switches between a wedge-shaped geometry and V-shaped geometry at high and low pressure, respectively. Using the wedge-shaped geometry, the fingers provide a point contact on a cylindrical object to pivot it to a vertical pose under the effect of gravity. By changing to V-shaped geometry, the fingers localize the object in the vertical pose and securely hold it. Experimental results show that the smooth transition between the two contact types allows a robot with a simple gripper to reorient a cylindrical object lying horizontally on a ground and to grasp it in a vertical pose.},

Air flow is blocked while the gate is closed and passes through while the gate is open. The opening and closing of the flap gate are controlled by the expansion of the inflatable chambers installed near the gate. The extent of expansion is determined by the upstream static pressure. Therefore, the gate can be controlled by the input airflow rate. The dimensions of the flap gate are introduced as a design parameter, and we show that the parameter contributes to the blowing and suction capacities. We also experimentally demonstrate that the proposed device is available for a variable friction system and an end effector for picking up a thin object covered with dust.},

In addition, the lightweight and simple structures of both the body and steering parts are demonstrated. Second, according to the variable friction mechanism and the crawling locomotion sequence of the body, head and tail parts, the crawling performance is tested. When the head and tail parts switch between low and medium friction, the soft robot's maximum inclined surface angles for climbing up and down are 6{$^\circ$} and 12{$^\circ$}, respectively; the corresponding values are 12{$^\circ$} and 42{$^\circ$}, respectively, when the head and tail parts switch between high and medium friction.

The application domain of this technology includes simulation enhancement in virtual reality (e.g., immersive environments, video games), balance training and, in terms of foot interactions: augmented user experience, usability and pointing performance. A foot-worn prototype featuring a friction-varying mechanism was fabricated and characterized in terms of the static coefficients of friction (COF) it could render. Perception of sliding friction was then evaluated using the prototype, giving insight as to the human sensory resolution associated with our hardware. We hypothesize that the sliding friction rendering capabilities of the prototype could be realistically discretized into two or three settings with respect to human perception. We then employed the prototype as a foot-controlled pointing device. Two interface modes, constant and variable friction, were analyzed in 1D and 2D tasks under the ISO 9241-9 standard for pointing device evaluation. A significant performance increase was found for the variable-friction modality. In comparison to other foot-controlled pointing systems, our implementation offers considerable performance advancement and equivalent error rates. This analysis confirms the potential for variable friction in foot-controlled pointing and gives further insight as to how we may better design these systems.

Motivated by these requirements, this article considers the design of variable-friction devices for use in the context of human walking on surfaces in which the coefficient of friction can be controlled dynamically. Various designs are described, aiming at rendering low-friction shoe-floor contact, associated with slippery surfaces such as ice, as well as higher-friction values more typical of surfaces such as pebbles, sand, or snow. These designs include an array of omnidirectional rolling elements, a combination of low- and high-friction coverings whose contact pressure distribution is controlled, and modulation of low-frequency vibration normal to the surface. Our experimentation investigated the static coefficient of friction attainable with each of these designs. Rolling elements were found to be the most slippery, providing a coefficient of friction as low as\,0.03, but with significant drawbacks from the perspective of our design objectives. A controlled pressure distribution of low- and high-friction coverings allowed for a minimum coefficient of friction of\,0.06. The effects of vibration amplitude and frequency on sliding velocity were also explored. Increases in amplitude resulted in higher velocities, but vibration frequencies greater than 25\,Hz reduced sliding velocities. To meet our design objectives, a novel approach involving a friction-variation mechanism, embedded in a shoe sole, is proposed.},

These systems can be constructed using passive, active, and semi-active devices. In particular, passive devices are widely accepted in the field of structural engineering, because they do not require power to operate and can be holistically integrated into the structural design process. This paper investigates the use of 3D printing technology to expand on the possibilities in passive damping, notably in the fabrication of a variable friction device. This device uses a 3D printed cam with a pre-defined surface profile to vary the normal forces applied to a traditional sliding plate friction system. It follows that these varying forces develop a variable damping force that is dependent on the device's displacement. In this work, a friction model is developed to characterize the device's behavior. This model is then validated on various cam profiles by exposing the device to a set of harmonic motions and to a nonstationary motion. Results show a high level of agreement between the experimental results and analytical model.},

  abstract = {Inspired by turtle locomotion, a novel type of robot with flippers actuated by antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) springs is presented that can crawl based on two different variable friction mechanisms. First, unlike robots incorporating a variable friction mechanism based on weight, the turtle-inspired robot bends its flippers through ``on-off'' control of the SMA springs in an open-loop system and achieves high friction based on the electromagnet. It can crawl on a vertical surface under a load with a load ratio of 78.5\% without accurate locomotion control. To achieve fast and accurate displacement for each locomotion sequence, a radial basis function (RBF) compensator based on the minimum parameter algorithm and a mechanical model of the flippers is used to control the antagonistic SMA springs. The robot can regulate the bending shape of its flippers using an RBF compensator and climb a nonmagnetic surface with an inclination angle of 72{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ when it utilizes suction units in the foot for its variable friction mechanism. The robot can crawl forward along both the X- and Y-axis directions. In conclusion, antagonistic SMA actuation with an RBF compensator provides fast and accurate performance and is a feasible alternative to the disturbance of the control of the flippers. This article can be used to develop design guidelines for crawling robots.},

  abstract = {Generally, machining of polymeric microfluidic devices is a one-step manufacturing process. It is economical compared to lithography and can be used for batch production and rapid prototyping. However, surface properties are modified during machining due to the viscoelasticity property of polymers and the mechanical nature of fractures. In this present work, the manufacturing capability of the mechanical micromachining process of polymers has been explored. Surface characteristics like surface roughness, surface energy, and burr formation are investigated. Surface quality is chosen as a contributing factor for defining the manufacturing capability as it is one of the significant factors influencing the physics of fluid flow in microchannels. In the present work, several manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, hot embossing, photolithography, and mechanical micromachining, were considered. The surface energy of various surfaces machined using the abovementioned methods is evaluated and compared. It has been observed that mechanical micromachining is the most suitable methods as they have less wettability with lower surface energy. Further investigations are carried out by machining microfluidic devices using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC) materials, as they are extensively used in biomedical applications. Surface roughness was measured on the PMMA and PC surfaces after milling. The surface roughness values and surface energies are used for evaluating the suitability of the machining process to fabricate microfluidic devices. Microfluidic devices with serpentine channels were machined on PMMA with a depth of 50~{\textmu}m and width of 200~{\textmu}m for evaluating inertial focusing in the channels. These devices were further evaluated for blood cell separation at different dilution rates. It is observed that PMMA is the preferable choice for fabricating microfluidic devices using mechanical micro-milling.},

The surface consists of an array of small, rounded bumps or ``nibs,'' for reliable traction on objects like wet dishes. When the nibs contact a surface they deflect, and capacitive sensors measure the corresponding local normal and shear stresses. A feature of the sensor is the ability to reconfigure dynamically depending on which combinations of sensing elements it samples. By interrogating different combinations of elements the sensor can detect and distinguish between linear and rotational sliding, and other dynamic events such as making contact. These dynamic events, combined with the sensed grasp and load forces, are useful for acquiring objects and performing simple in-hand manipulations. A proposed slip detection method estimates minimum required grasping force with an error less than 1.5 N and uses tactile controlled rotational slips to reorient an unknown weight/surface object with 78\% success rate.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the prominent adhesion ability of octopus suckers, many dry/wet adhesives with specific micro-structure have been fabricated for applications in smart robots, manipulators, and medical treatments. However, the reported octopus-inspired adhesive patches are either suction-assistant without tight-sealing, or suction-sealed but inefficient under both dry/wet environments. Here, a microtemplated electrowetting method is developed for the fabrication of reversible dry/wet adhesive pads consisting of extruded microsuckers with suction-enhanced microdomes and sealing-ring tips. The mechanism toward the morphology regulation of microdomes illustrates the uneven electrohydrodynamic force on the liquid--air interface that changes the liquid meniscus and achieves the precise regulation of the microdomes curvature ratio (from 0.45 to 0.74). The tip spacing can be controlled (from 0 to 50 {\textmu}m) by using different templates. Theoretical and experimental insights into the mechanism of the microdomes morphology and the tip spacing on adhesion are discussed. With optimized microdomes and maximized sealing-tips, this adhesive patch generates strong and repeatable adhesion on a silicon wafer in both air ({$\approx$} 86 kPa) and underwater ({$\approx$} 61 kPa) environments. Besides, considerable adhesion to the rough surfaces are also revealed. Its adhesion ability is demonstrated with stable transportation of various objects under air/underwater environments, providing a potential application in cross-media operation.},

  abstract = {Soft-bodied and continuum robots have shown great adaptability to the environment thanks to its flexibility of the body. They have great potential in environment exploring or rescuing mission. One of those robots is snake-like softbodied robots. A snake robot is often made by attaching passive wheels along a long body to achieve frictional anisotropy. This anisotropic structure helps to propel the body with serpentine locomotion and prevents it from sliding laterally. However, with a snake-like soft-bodied robot, attaching wheels is not only clumsy but also adding weight to the robot. In this paper, being inspired by the scales on the skin of a snake, we propose a designing scheme to achieve an all-printed wriggle soft-bodied robot by patterning high and low friction material to the ventral side of the robot. Compared to a totally flat ventral, we are able to speed-up the serpentine locomotion 2.8 times. Besides, by changing the configuration of high/low friction material, our wriggle soft-bodied robot can easily move forward or backward just by switching the controlling signal. The fabrication time is just less than 1 hour and the robot can achieve the speed of 26 mm/s.},

In this paper, we present a series of alternative uses of structural compliance for the development of simple, adaptive, compliant and/or under-actuated robot grippers and hands that can efficiently and robustly execute a variety of grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks. The proposed designs utilize only one actuator per finger to control multiple degrees of freedom and they retain the superior grasping capabilities of the adaptive grasping mechanisms even under significant object pose or other environmental uncertainties. More specifically, in this work, we introduce, discuss, and evaluate: a) a design of pre-shaped, compliant robot fingers that adapts / conforms to the object geometry, b) a hyper-adaptive finger-pad design that maximizes the area of the contact patches between the hand and the object, maximizing also grasp stability, and c) a design that executes compliance adjustable manipulation tasks that can be predetermined by tuning the in-series compliance of the tendon routing system and by appropriately selecting the imposed tendon loads. The grippers are experimentally tested and their efficiency is validated using three different types of tests: i) grasping tests that involve different everyday objects, ii) grasp quality tests that estimate the contact area between the grippers and the objects grasped, and iii) dexterous, in-hand manipulation experiments to evaluate the manipulation capabilities of the Compliance Adjustable Manipulation (CAM) hand. The devices employ mechanical adaptability to facilitate and simplify the efficient execution of robust grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks.},

These theoretical and computational foundations are often taken for granted and this leads to an intricate literature that, consequently, has rarely been the subject of a complete review. For the first time, we present here a structured overview of all the approaches proposed so far to model soft robots. The chosen classification, which is based on their theoretical and numerical grounds, allows us to provide a critical analysis about their uses and applicability. This will enable robotics researchers to learn the basics of these modeling techniques and their associated numerical methods, but also to have a critical perspective on their uses.},

We aim to remove the barriers to entry into this field by presenting existing results and future challenges using a unified language and within a coherent framework. Indeed, the main difficulty in entering this field is the wide variability of terminology and scientific backgrounds, making it quite hard to acquire a comprehensive view on the topic. Another limiting factor is that it is not obvious where to draw a clear line between the limitations imposed by the technology not being mature yet and the challenges intrinsic to this class of robots. In this work, we argue that the intrinsic effects are the continuum or multi-body dynamics, the presence of a non-negligible elastic potential field, and the variability in sensing and actuation strategies.},

Earthworm-like crawlers realize locomotion through in-plane contraction, while inchworm-like crawlers exhibit out-of-plane bending-based motions. Although in-plane contraction crawlers demonstrate effective motion in confined spaces, miniaturization is challenging because of limited actuation methods and complex structures. Here, we report a magnetically actuated small-scale origami crawler with in-plane contraction. The contraction mechanism is achieved through a four-unit Kresling origami assembly consisting of two Kresling dipoles with two-level symmetry. Magnetic actuation is used to provide appropriate torque distribution, enabling a small-scale and untethered robot with both crawling and steering capabilities. The crawler can overcome large resistances from severely confined spaces by its anisotropic and magnetically tunable structural stiffness. The multifunctionality of the crawler is explored by using the internal cavity of the crawler for drug storage and release. The magnetic origami crawler can potentially serve as a minimally invasive device for biomedical applications.},

Applying a vacuum to the central chamber provides the main actuation force, while the selective inflation of the fluidic channels controls the motion and changes the stiffness. We formulated a geometric description for the origami module to optimize the design parameters. Then, we fabricated the origami actuators from elastomeric rubber using a multistep single-material fabrication technique. Finally, we characterized the axial contraction and rotation angle and demonstrated variable stiffness and omnidirectional bending.

They are inexpensive, simple to fabricate, light in weight, and easy to actuate. This class of structure is versatile: the same principles of design lead to actuators that respond to pressurization with a wide range of motions (bending, extension, contraction, twisting, and others). Paper, when used to introduce anisotropy into elastomers, can be readily folded into 3D structures following the principles of origami; these folded structures increase the stiffness and anisotropy of the elastomeric actuators, while being light in weight. These soft actuators can manipulate objects with moderate performance; for example, they can lift loads up to 120 times their weight.

  abstract = {The human forearm produces torsional motions that are essential in daily activities such as opening doors or containers. It has a large range of motion (ROM), can produce large torques, can move bidirectionally, and can stiffen at will. Implementing such motions in a rigid robotic manipulator is easy due to the inherently rotational motions of electric motors, but pneumatic actuators do not inherently produce rotational motions. Indeed, most torsional pneumatic actuators are capable of unidirectional or bidirectional motions but do not have the antagonistic actuation capabilities necessary to have variable stiffness. Furthermore, their actuation characteristics are very different from those of the human forearm. This article proposes a torsional pneumatic actuator based on pretwisted pneumatic tubes that uses a hybrid hard-soft structure. These pneumatic tubes can be installed at an offset from the rotation axis such that antagonistic tubes can be installed on a single actuator. The actuator is capable of bidirectional torsional motions, can change its torsional stiffness, and has an actuation performance comparable to that of the human forearm. It was implemented in a soft robotic manipulator with seven degrees of freedom with a wide ROM and is capable of rotating objects while manipulating them.},

  abstract = {Soft actuators have received intensive attention in the fields of soft robots, sensors, intelligent control, artificial intelligence, and visual intelligence. By combination of tensile and torsional deformations, different types of motions can be realized, such as bending, rolling, and jumping. Soft robotics need soft actuators, such as artificial muscles to lift or move objects to perform some work. Additionally, actuation integrated with functions of sensing, signal transmission, and control is also needed in the development of advanced intelligent systems, which further stimulates the requirement of multifunctional actuators. Here different types of soft actuators that can perform tensile and torsional actuations are summarized, including twisted fiber artificial muscles, shape memory polymers, hydrogels, liquid crystal polymers, electrochemical actuators with conducting polymers, and some natural materials. Examples are also included regarding the bending or rolling deformations of the actuators for lifting objects. Then, recent interesting reports about multifunctional soft actuators combined with sensing and signal transmission performances, are summarized. Last, a summary of different ways to realize tensile and torsional actuations, different materials, and designs for lifting or moving objects, as well as construction of multifunctional actuators with actuation and sensing functions is provided.},

Biofouling is a major economic burden on navy and commercial ships, as well as civil structures, piping systems, sensors, and power generating facilities. Due to the vast variety of marine organisms that colonize submerged surfaces, no surface has been found that is completely resistant to marine biofouling. The development of bioinspired and textured surfaces and their effects on marine biofouling are reviewed here. Different parameters such as mechanical properties, wettability, and surface topography are shown to have an influence on the settlement, attachment, and growth of marine organisms on marine surfaces. The effect of texturation is especially investigated with a special focus on how marine animals are affected. Techniques for creating artificial textures and methods to characterize them are introduced. Bioinspired textures are currently developed using mostly photolithographic technique with patterns showing a high efficiency on single marine species through laboratory bioassays. The efficiency of a texture with spaced features appears clearly dependent on its dimensions in regard of the size of the targeted organisms. On the grounds of how marine species fight against biofoulers, further research on the development of multistrategies antifouling solutions should be conducted.},

Our 16-cm-diameter noise-free prototype could control the fluid flow to propel while manipulating objects to be kept beneath its body without physical contact, thereby enabling safer interactions. Its against-gravity speed was up to 6.1~cm/s, substantially quicker than other examples in literature, while only requiring a low input power of around 100~mW. Moreover, using the platform, we demonstrated contact-based object manipulation, fluidic mixing, shape adaptation, steering, wireless swimming, and cooperation of two to three robots.

To understand what limits their performance and hinders their transition from laboratory to real-world conditions, future studies should focus on understanding the principles behind the design and operation of soft robots. Such studies should also consider the major challenges with regard to complex materials, accurate modeling, advanced control, and intelligent behaviors. As a starting point for such studies, this review provides a current overview of the field by examining the working mechanisms of advanced actuation and sensing modalities, modeling techniques, control strategies, and learning architectures for soft robots. Next, we summarize how these approaches can be applied to create sophisticated soft robots and examine their application areas. Finally, we provide future perspectives on what key challenges should be tackled first to advance soft robotics to truly add value to our society.},

  abstract = {The compliance of soft robots makes them particularly well suited for grasping applications where target objects are fragile, compliant, or topologically complex, as well as scenarios where target objects have an uncertain size or location. This thesis is an exploration of soft robotic design and fabrication that enables three modes in which characteristics of the contact interface between soft grippers and their target objects can be strategically tuned. First, passive digit structures and materials can be used to reduce contact stress concentrations and adapt to varying object sizes. Second, active surface structures can be used to increase dexterity of soft grippers by modulating contact friction. Third, a new grasping strategy of randomly distributed contacts can be used to achieve grasps that are individually gentle and collectively strong. We call this strategy entanglement grasping and present novel manufacturing methods to create the high aspect ratio soft actuators and large arrays that are the basis for this technique. The structural compliance of high aspect ratio large collectives enable passive, stochastic adaptation to compliant target structures and complex topologies. For each modality of contact tuning, passive, active, and distributed, I present novel mechanisms, fabrication methods, and design tools to create soft grippers for gentle grasping and manipulation.},

The goal of the development is to demonstrate vertical mobility in glacier crevasses and moulins which motivates the unique design requirements and capabilities of EELS. The robot is comprised of a proprioception head, ten identical actuation modules and a power conditioning tail, which is connected to electronics ground support equipment (GSE) that provides power to the robot and houses the control computer. The design of each of these subsystems is motivated and discussed in detail. The primary focus of this paper is the actuation system. The actuation system is comprised of shape actuators, which control the shape of the robot, and screw actuators, which control a multitude of propulsion screws along the surface of the robot. The actuation system design is outlined and experimentally characterized. Detailed component level analysis is presented. Implementation challenges related to the unique architecture and their resolutions are outlined. Each of the actuation modules houses all the motor control electronics in a self-contained, integrated avionics compartment. Unlike the snake robots previously introduced in the academic literature, EELS is the first large scale robot (weighing about 83Kg and 4.4m in length) which has unparalleled ability to exert large forces to the environment and support its own weight, thanks to its unique high torque dense shape actuators. The paper concludes with detailed screw actuation analysis focusing on vertical mobility for EELS.},

This paper addresses designing and analysing anisotropic frictional skin to enhance the locomotion of holonomic snake robots in flat, variably friction environments. Two distinct frictional skins are developed and analysed through a peristaltic dynamic model. Moreover, comprehensive testing is conducted on various substrates to assess the effectiveness of the designed snakeskins. Experimental results indicate that a snake robot equipped with an interlocking-based skin on an Expanded Polystyrene substrate achieves small forward locomotion, while a Molecular Interaction-based skin enables sideways motion. This study provides insights into preliminary skin designs and locomotion tests conducted on flat surfaces, emphasising the need for further refinement to meet the demands of SAR applications.},

This work illustrates the design, fabrication, and testing of a snake-inspired skin based on kirigami techniques that, when attached to a soft snake robot, improves the robot's locomotion capabilities when implementing a lateral undulation gait. Examination of snake scales in nature informed the shape and texture of the synthetic scales, which are activated through the buckling of kirigami lattices. Biological snakes have microornamentation on their scales, which is replicated by scoring ridges into the plastic skin. This microornamentation contributes to the lateral resistance necessary for lateral undulation. The skin's frictional properties were experimentally determined, as were their contributions to the locomotion of the robot across a flat, hard, textured surface. Contributions to locomotion from scale profile geometry, scale microornamentation, and scale angle of attack were identified. The range of longitudinal COF ratios was 1.0 to 3.0 and the range of lateral COF ratios was 0.9 to 3.3. The highest performing skin was the triangular scale profile with microornamentation, producing a velocity of 6 mm/s (0.03 BL/s) which is an increase of 335\% over the robot with no skin when activated to maximum achievable curvature.},

The bellies of snakes are covered in a series of flexible scales that can be activated by the snake to prevent sliding. It is previously shown that conscious snakes can use this ability to double their friction coefficient relative to unconscious snakes. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we give further evidence that snakes actuate their belly scales. We perform experiments where we slide snakes backwards atop an array of pillars. Our theoretical model suggests that snakes that do not apply an opening moment to their scales should have quite short contact with these pillars. In our experiments, snakes slide their ventral scales down the pillars, prolonging contact. Our modeling suggests that this phenomenon can only occur if snakes apply a moment at the scale base. We hope this result encourages further research in actively-generated friction.},

To address these limitations, the letter proposes a crawling robot with alterable angle scales, a soft actuator, and an autonomous vibrating valve. All scales are strung on a spring wire and can rotate freely, and an airbag can easily control the rotation. The robot can crawl backward after flipping the scales' orientation. A piston located inside the vibrating valve can be periodically pushed by a reset spring and air pressure to achieve reciprocating motion, which results in periodic inflating and deflating of the soft actuator. Such that the crawling robot can move automatically. The locomotion mechanism was analyzed, and a dynamic model was built. The locomotion performance was tested by experiments. The experimental results show that both the forward and backward locomotion speed can be improved by increasing the driving pressure. When the driving pressure is 195 kPa, the robot can crawl forward and backward at the speed of 49.0 mm/s and 38.2 mm/s, respectively.},

  abstract = {Since the ventral body side of snakes is in almost continuous contact with the substrate during undulating locomotion, their skin is presumably adapted to generate high friction for propulsion and low friction to slide along the substrate. In this study, the microstructure of ventral scales was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscope and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Dynamic friction was investigated by a microtribometer. The ventral scales demonstrated anisotropic frictional properties. To analyze the role of the stiffness of underlying layers on the frictional anisotropy, two different types of scale cushioning (hard and soft) were tested. To estimate frictional forces of the skin surface on rough substrates, additional measurements with a rough surface were performed. Frictional anisotropy for both types of scale cushioning and rough surfaces was revealed. However, for both types of surface roughness, the anisotropy was stronger expressed in the soft-cushioned sample. This effect could be caused by (1) the stronger interaction of the microstructure with the substrate in soft-cushioned samples due to larger real contact area with the substrate and (2) the composite character of the skin of this snake species with embedded, highly ordered fiber-like structures, which may cause anisotropy in material properties.},

To further increase the motion adaptability of the soft crawling robots and expand their application space, in this letter, inspired by the movement mechanism of the snake scales, we present a pneumatic soft crawling robot with multi-modal locomotion based on a deployable and foldable (D-F) mechanism. The robot adopts a four-chamber bellows actuator to further enhance the robot's movement adaptability in motion space. The head and tail parts of the robot are provided with a D-F mechanism imitating snake scales, which can be opened and closed through the extension and contraction of the bellows actuator. By adopting different actuation strategies and utilizing the anisotropy of friction and the alteration of the center of gravity, the robot can achieve multi-modal locomotion such as straight walking, steering, rolling and obstacle crossing to satisfy the requirements of varied surroundings. An open-loop control system of the robot is developed to assess its motion performance. The mathematical model of the robot is established using cosserat-rod theory to clarify the relationship between actuating pressure and robot's motion variables under various motion strategy combinations. The experimental results show that the soft crawling robot designed in this study can efficiently adapt to moving surfaces with different material properties and achieve diverse motion modes under different actuation strategies. Additionally, it can adapt to exploratory tasks in unstructured environment.},

In this letter, we present a novel shape-conformable suction mechanism to achieve highly-adaptive suction on complex surfaces. The shape-conformable adaptive suction is obtained by squeezing a soft multi-layer structure on the substrate, to form a shape-to-roughness sealed suction region. Based on this mechanism, two shape-conformable suction cups (SCSCs) -- a displacement-driven shape-conformable suction cup ({\textbackslash}textS\_{\textbackslash}textDisp) and a force-driven shape-conformable suction cup ({\textbackslash}textS\_{\textbackslash}textForce) -- are designed. They both achieve highly-adaptive suction on challenging surface topographies including highly-curved, cornered, textured, uneven and tilted surfaces. Particularly, {\textbackslash}textS\_{\textbackslash}textDisp has better adaptation (e.g., on a 90{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ corner and a balloon) and {\textbackslash}textS\_{\textbackslash}textForce is more lightweight (26 g) and compact ({\textbackslash}varnothing 46{\textbackslash}times 35 mm), and exhibits quicker suction response (0.4 s). We analyse the underlying adaptive suction mechanism by the physical model, and demonstrate its adaptive suction capability by qualitatively comparing it with previous suction cups. We finally conclude design principles for improving suction adaptation. We believe the proposed shape-conformable suction mechanism provides a novel solution to realize adaptive suction on complex surfaces in next-generation robotic gripping, anchoring, and manipulation.},

The novelty of the gripper lies in two sets of fingers and two sets of compact force transmission mechanisms with large mechanical gain. In order to achieve the above functions of the gripper, link-type fingers and sucker-type fingers are integrated together so the gripper has multiple grasping modes. At the same time, the force transmission system was redesigned, and the kinematic model of the force transmission system is established by means of D-H (Denavit-Hartenberg) method. Secondly, workspace, mechanical gain and linkage length are taken as the objective functions to obtain these optimized structural parameters of the gripper. For the purpose of further validating optimization results, the comparison of results of the proposed optimization procedure with these in commercial software. And compared results indicate that the proposed optimization procedure can acquire a larger workspace and greater mechanical gain. Finally, according to the optimized parameters, a generalized gripper is manufactured. The design experiments prove that the gripper can realize multiple grasping modes.},

  abstract = {Suction is a highly evolved biological adhesion strategy for soft-body organisms to achieve strong grasping on various objects. Biological suckers can adaptively attach to dry complex surfaces such as rocks and shells, which are extremely challenging for current artificial suction cups. Although the adaptive suction of biological suckers is believed to be the result of their soft body's mechanical deformation, some studies imply that in-sucker mucus secretion may be another critical factor in helping attach to complex surfaces, thanks to its high viscosity. Inspired by the combined action of biological suckers' soft bodies and mucus secretion, we propose a multiscale suction mechanism which successfully achieves strong adaptive suction on dry complex surfaces which are both highly curved and rough, such as a stone. The proposed multiscale suction mechanism is an organic combination of mechanical conformation and regulated water seal. Multilayer soft materials first generate a rough mechanical conformation to the substrate, reducing leaking apertures to micrometres ({\textasciitilde}10 {\textmu}m). The remaining micron-sized apertures are then sealed by regulated water secretion from an artificial fluidic system based on the physical model, thereby the suction cup achieves long suction longevity on complex surfaces but minimal overflow. We discuss its physical principles and demonstrate its practical application as a robotic gripper on a wide range of complex dry surfaces. We believe the presented multiscale adaptive suction mechanism is a powerful unique adaptive suction strategy which may be instrumental in the development of versatile soft adhesion.},

We describe the design and fabrication methods used to create underactuated, multimaterial structures that conform to surfaces over a range of length scales from centimeters to micrometers. At the finest scale, the undersides of Stickybot's toes are covered with arrays of small, angled polymer stalks. Like the directional adhesive structures used by geckos, they readily adhere when pulled tangentially from the tips of the toes toward the ankles; when pulled in the opposite direction, they release.

  abstract = {Soft robots have the appealing advantages of being highly flexible and adaptive to complex environments. However, the low-stiffness nature of the constituent materials makes soft robotic systems incompetent in tasks requiring relatively high load capacity. Despite recent attempts to develop stiffness-tunable soft actuators by employing variable stiffness materials and structures, the reported stiffness-tunable actuators generally suffer from limitations including slow responses, small deformations, and difficulties in fabrication with microfeatures. This work presents a paradigm to design and manufacture fast-response, stiffness-tunable (FRST) soft actuators via hybrid multimaterial 3D printing. The integration of a shape memory polymer layer into the fully printed actuator body enhances its stiffness by up to 120 times without sacrificing flexibility and adaptivity. The printed Joule-heating circuit and fluidic cooling microchannel enable fast heating and cooling rates and allow the FRST actuator to complete a softening--stiffening cycle within 32 s. Numerical simulations are used to optimize the load capacity and thermal rates. The high load capacity and shape adaptivity of the FRST actuator are finally demonstrated by a robotic gripper with three FRST actuators that can grasp and lift objects with arbitrary shapes and various weights spanning from less than 10 g to up to 1.5 kg.},

Among various gripper technologies, the vacuum suction grippers provide design simplicity, yet versatility at low cost; however, their application is limited to their fixed shape and size. Here, we present an origami-inspired reconfigurable suction gripper to address adaptability with robotic suction grippers. Constructed from rigid and soft components and driven by compact shape memory alloy actuators, the gripper can effectively self-fold into three shape modes to pick large and small flat, narrow cylindrical, triangular and spherical objects. The 10-g few centimeters gripper lifts loads up to 5 N, 50 times its weight. We also present an underactuated prototype, demonstrating the versatility of our design and actuation methods.},

The well-known attachment features of this animal result from the softness of the sucker tissues and the surface morphology of the portion of the sucker that is in contact with objects or substrates. Unlike artificial suction cups, octopus suckers are characterized by a series of radial grooves that increase the area subjected to pressure reduction during attachment. In this study, we constructed artificial suction cups with different surface geometries and tested their attachment performances using a pull-off setup. First, smooth suction cups were obtained for casting; then, sucker surfaces were engraved with a laser cutter. As expected, for all the tested cases, the engraving treatment enhanced the attachment performance of the elastomeric suction cups compared with that of the smooth versions. Moreover, the results indicated that the surface geometry with the best attachment performance was the geometry most similar to octopus sucker morphology. The results obtained in this work can be utilized to design artificial suction cups with higher wet attachment performance.},

  abstract = {Remora suckerfish can attach to a wide diversity of marine hosts, however, their detachment mechanism remains poorly understood. Through analyzing high-speed videos, we found that the detachment of the live remora (Echeneis naucrates) is a rapid behavior that can happen within 240 ms. We separate this remarkable behavior into three stages: 1) lamellae folding down and soft lip curling, 2) disc raising and 3) complete detachment. To quantitatively investigate the detachment behavior, we fabricated a multi-material biomimetic disc and utilized it to study each stage of the detachment process. In stage one, we found that folding down lamellae is essential for decreasing the detachment resistance (vertical interfacial force and friction force) of the suction disc. Also, curling up the soft lip to breaking the adhesive seal reduced the vertical pull-off force up to 94 times. During disc raising in stage 2, we found that the partially flexible base (Young's modulus: {$\sim$}3 MPa) of the disc can lead to a 30\% power-use reduction compared to a rigid base (Young's modulus: {$\sim$}3 GPa). After completing full detachment in stage 3, the corresponding drag wake flow decreased by 44\% compared to an attached state due to lamellae folding and the entire soft lip uncurling. We developed a bio-inspired remora suckerfish robot propelled by a water jet to demonstrate a complete detachment which covers all three stages within 200 ms. We also demonstrated that an ROV has both hitchhiking and pick-and-place capabilities by integrating remora-inspired discs at appropriate locations. This study may shed light on future research in bio-inspired adhesives and lay a foundation for developing an untethered, multimodal, underwater hitchhiking robot.},

In nature, the northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus) has evolved the impressive ability to adhere onto substrates of various shapes and roughnesses, while subject to strong intertidal surges. The suction disc of the clingfish relies on suction and friction to achieve and maintain adhesion. Inspired by this mechanism of attachment, we designed an artificial suction disc and evaluated its adhesive stress on rough surfaces and non-planar geometries. The artificial suction disc achieved adhesion strengths of 10.1 {\textpm} 0.3 kPa in air on surfaces of moderate roughness (grain size, 68 {\textmu}m), and 14.3 {\textpm} 1.5 kPa underwater on coarse surfaces (grain size, 269 {\textmu}m). By comparison, a commercially available suction cup failed to exhibit any significant adhesion in both scenarios. The roughly 2 g heavy clingfish-inspired suction discs gripped concave surfaces with small radii of curvature (12.5 mm) and supported payloads up to 0.7 kg. We correlated the effect of key bioinspired features (i.e. slits, a soft outer layer, and body geometry) to adhesion performance using contact visualization techniques and finite element analysis (FEA). The suction discs were then tested on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to demonstrate their utility in the soft manipulation of fragile objects.},

Both the nanopillars and the terminating layer are fabricated concurrently by replica molding using a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide membrane as the mold. These Teflon AF hierarchical nanostructures are shown to have an exceptional capacity to generate strong adhesion in both dry conditions and under water because of combined actions of van der Waals forces, electrostatic attractions, and hydrophobic effects. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Surface patterning with low aspect ratios and low surface energy leads to superhydrophobicity and low adhesion while surface patterning with high aspect ratios leads to high adhesion. The condition of high aspect ratio and/or high number density creates the risk of fibril bundling owing to the adhesion between fibrils. A thin film-terminated structure can help overcome this problem and increase adhesion. In contrast to the spatular contacts, the conformal adhesion at interface can be enhanced significantly by creating micropatterns; the enhancement monotonically increases with the aspect ratios, where the side-wall friction plays an important role.},

The last few years have seen transformative advances in achieving strong hydrogel adhesion, which is a supramolecular phenomenon. Two adherends connect through covalent bonds, noncovalent complexes, polymer chains, polymer networks, or nanoparticles. Separating the adherends dissipates energy through cascading events across length scales, including bond cleavage, chain retraction, and bulk hysteresis. A unifying principle has emerged: strong hydrogel adhesion requires the synergy of chemistry of bonds, topology of connection, and mechanics of dissipation. This synergy characterizes hydrogel adhesion to various materials (another hydrogel, tissue, elastomer, plastic, metal, glass, and ceramic) in various operations (cast, coat, print, attach, pierce, and glue). Strong adhesion can be made permanent, reversible, degradable, or on-demand detachable. The development of hydrogel adhesion and its applications adheres disciplines, discovers interlinks, and forges cohesion. Discussed throughout the review are immediate opportunities for fundamental studies and practical applications.},

The gripper can pick a wide variety of objects, such as delicate fruits, small parts, and parts with uneven loads, with high pull-off forces (over 7.4 N with ∅ 20 mm/55 kPa). The achieved pull-off forces are significantly higher than the previously reported suction cup grippers with films and more comparable with commercial vacuum grippers. The pull-off forces show no significant differences with surfaces of varying roughness (up to root-mean-square roughness of 5.66 {$\mu$}m) and the gripper is able to pick and release target objects repeatedly. The gripper is also compared with a commercial vacuum gripper with comparable dimensions. It outperforms the commercial gripper in the case of fragile objects, objects smaller than the gripper diameter, and objects with uneven loads. It can apply high pull-off forces while having controllable release, and is suitable for gripping a wide variety of real-world objects, including heavy, rough, small, thin, and fragile ones.},

However, achieving stable and switchable attachment to objects with curved, rough, and irregular surfaces remains difficult, particularly in dry and underwater environments. Here, a highly adaptive soft microstructured switchable adhesion device is presented, which is inspired by the geometric and material characteristics of the tiny denticles on the surface of an octopus sucker. The contact interface of the artificial octopus sucker (AOS) is imprinted with soft, microscale denticles that interact adaptably with highly rough or curved surfaces. Robust and controllable attachment of the AOS with soft microdenticles (AOS-sm) to dry and wet surfaces with diverse morphologies is achieved, allowing conformal attachment on curved and soft objects with high roughness. In addition, AOS-sms assembled with an octopus-arm-inspired soft actuator demonstrate reliable grasping and the transport of complex polyhedrons, rough objects, and soft, delicate, slippery biological samples.},

In emerging applications such as remote surgery and soft robotics, thin fluid films between solid surfaces lead to a multiphysics coupling between solid deformation and fluid dissipation. Here, we report a scaling law that governs the peak friction values of elastohydrodynamic lubrication on patterned surfaces. These peaks, absent in smooth tribopairs, arise due to a separation of length scales in the lubricant flow. The framework is generated by varying the geometry, elasticity and fluid properties of soft tribopairs and measuring the lubricated friction with a triborheometer. The model correctly predicts the elastohydrodynamic lubrication friction of a bioinspired robotic fingertip and human fingers. Its broad applicability can inform the future design of robotic hands or grippers in realistic conditions, and open up new ways of encoding friction into haptic signals.},

However, the low-stiffness nature of the soft material and the multi-finger gripping mechanism make soft grasping systems suffer in applications requiring relatively high load capacity and broad grasping adaptability. Despite extensive efforts to develop soft grippers with tunable stiffness by constructing smart materials and structures, the resultant load capacity is often compromised by sacrificing working efficiency or surface adaptability. In this work, we report a paradigm to design a versatile, high-load ({$>$}2 kg), and fast-response ({$<$}1 s) pneumatic soft gripper by strengthening the contact interface via bio-inspired controllable adhesion. A mushroom-shaped micropatterned dry adhesive surface is integrated with a soft pneumatic bidirectionally bendable actuator via a vacuum-assisted equal load-sharing design. This gripper extends the adaptable object diameter from 15 mm to infinity and significantly increases the load capacity to over 2 kg without compromising the original compliance. The multifunctional grasping modes and high load capacity are successfully demonstrated by grasping objects with diverse material components, various surface shapes.},

To realize rapid and non-contact driving, a novel magneto-active soft gripper is developed in this paper. The gripper is embedded with magneto-active elastomer (MAE) actuators that are made from a mixture of a soft material substrate and hard magnetic fillers. Firstly, the MAE actuators doped with different contents of magnetic fillers are manufactured and magnetized by applying an external magnetic field. An experiment is designed to measure the magnetically induced deformation of MAE actuators under different external magnetic fields. On basis of the experimental study of MAE actuators, the magneto-active soft gripper is then designed and successfully fabricated. The gripping function and efficiency of the magneto-active soft gripper is demonstrated through an experimental study. Meanwhile, the maximum gripping force of grippers is measured and the effects of applied magnetic field and mass faction of magnetic fillers are examined. It is found that the gripping force increases as either magnetic field strength or magnetic fillers' concentration increases but tends to be stable when the magnetic field is greater than 80 mT. When executing a gripping motion, the magneto-active soft gripper has a significantly short response time than the existing ones with other driving methods.},

In this study, we analyzed the degree to which fingerprints and sweat present on a person's hand can affect the friction force between the hand and the gripping object. We fabricated an anthropomorphic robot hand with a fingerprint structure to set up an environment similar to that of the human hand, and performed object-holding and friction-change experiments by changing the amount of sweat to verify that this phenomenon can be applied to a robot hand. Furthermore, we for the first time proposed and developed a variable friction system using fluids and microstructures to solve the difficulty of anthropomorphic robot hand force control.

Previous studies have suggested that humans might take advantage of partial slip, localized loss of grip between the skin and the object, to gauge the stability of a contact and react appropriately when it is compromised, that is, when slippage is about to happen. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to perform point-to-point movements using a manipulandum. Through optical imaging, the device monitored partial slip at the contact interface, and at the same time, the forces exerted by the fingers. The level of friction of the contact material was changed every five trials. We found that the level of grip force was systematically adjusted to the level of friction, and thus partial slip was limited to an amount similar across friction conditions. We suggest that partial slip is a key signal for dexterous manipulation and that the grip force is regulated to continuously maintain an upper bound on partial slip across friction conditions.},

For soft fingertips, both the friction and surface deformation contribute to the stability. Therefore, we investigate the maximum resistible force, which is defined as the maximum tangential force at which the fingertip can maintain contact when applying and increasing the tangential/shear force. We investigate the slit textures with primitive patterns and demonstrate that the nonpattern performs the best under dry conditions, whereas the horizontal slit pattern performs the best under wet (oily) conditions. Based on this, a concentric hybrid texture of the two patterns is proposed, and its effectiveness is verified by a grasping test.},

  abstract = {Compared to traditional grippers, soft grippers can typically grasp a wider range of objects, including ones that are soft, fragile, or irregularly shaped, but at the cost of a relatively low gripping force. To increase gripping force for soft grippers, this research presents a gripper with an integrated electrostatic and gecko-inspired adhesive. Synthetic gecko-inspired, microstructured adhesives are controllable (i.e. they can be turned on and off) and work on a wide range of substrates and materials; however, they are not typically effective on rough surfaces. In contrast, electrostatic adhesives, also controllable, have a higher tolerance to rough surfaces. By combining the two, it is possible to create an adhesive that is effective on a wider range of materials and roughness, including fabric. To increase the gripping force, parameters that affect electrostatic adhesion, including the electrode gap, electrode width, relative permittivity of gecko-inspired layer, and air gap between the adhesive and substrate were studied with Comsol Multiphysics software and experimentally validated. Results show that adding the two adhesives improves the gripping capabilities across acrylic, Tyvek fabric, and Kapton hemispheres of different diameters on an average of 100, 39, and 168\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Bio-inspired reversible adhesion has significant potential in many fields requiring flexible grasping and manipulation, such as precision manufacturing, flexible electronics, and intelligent robotics. Despite extensive efforts for adhesive synthesis with a high adhesion strength at the interface, an effective strategy to actively tune the adhesion capacity between a strong attachment and an easy detachment spanning a wide range of scales has been lagged. Herein, we report a novel soft-hard-soft sandwiched composite design to achieve a stable, repeatable, and reversible strong adhesion with an easily scalable performance for a large area ranging from {$\sim$}1.5 to 150 cm2 and a high load ranging from {$\sim$}20 to 700 N. Theoretical studies indicate that this design can enhance the uniform loading for attachment by restraining the lateral shrinkage in the natural state, while facilitate a flexible peeling for detachment by causing stress concentration in the bending state, yielding an adhesion switching ratio of {$\sim$}54 and a switching time of less than {$\sim$}0.2 s. This design is further integrated into versatile grippers, climbing robots, and human climbing grippers, demonstrating its robust scalability for a reversible strong adhesion. This biomimetic design bridges microscopic interfacial interactions with macroscopic controllable applications, providing a universal and feasible paradigm for adhesion design and control.},

From nanoscale to macroscale, each type of adhesive organ has its own underlying mechanisms. Many biological adhesive mechanisms have been studied and can be incorporated into robot designs. This paper presents a systematic review of reversible biological adhesive methods and the bioinspired attachment devices that can be used in robotics. The study discussed how biological adhesive methods, such as dry adhesion, wet adhesion, mechanical adhesion, and sub-ambient pressure adhesion, progress in research. The morphology of typical adhesive organs, as well as the corresponding attachment models, is highlighted. The current state of bioinspired attachment device design and fabrication is discussed.

Despite the recent achievements in bionic research and robotics, the bionic robots are almost simple morphology imitation. While the imitation of functional texture and microstructures are also important, which always makes a significant difference to the performance of robot. In this work, we proposed a starfish inspired milli soft robot with excellent locomotive performance and great environmental adaptability. Different from the simple imitation of locomotion mode in the previous literature, we introduce the micro tube feet structures of starfish into the robot design. The magnetization measurement and friction test result indicate that the microstructures of tube feet can strengthen the driving performance of robot, reduce the motion resistance from ground, and enhance the obstacle-climbing ability. Benefit from the radial symmetry shape of the starfish, the milli soft robot can achieve omnidirectional movement under the actuation of magnetic field. Moreover, the large deflection modeling of the variable cross section antenna is built by analyzing the infinitesimal element, and two motion states of milli soft robot are compared. The successful locomotion demonstrations, including moving with ``S'' trajectory, adapting to wet surface and gravel surface, overcoming obstacles, indicate the potential application of the starfish inspired milli soft robot in harsh environment.},

  abstract = {Geckos are the largest animals capable of unassisted vertical climbing. They can effectively exploit the adhesive area (approximately 0.16 cm2) of each foot to support relatively heavy weight (approximately 0.06 kg) with at least two feet during locomotion on different slopes and walls. Over the last few decades, researchers have developed gecko-inspired dry adhesive materials based on the van der Waals force and used them as the feet for climbing robots. However, to date, these robots have not fully exploited the performance of the material. Therefore, the dry adhesive material areas on each foot need to be large (3 - 16 cm2) to support their light weight (up to approximately 0.17 - 0.45 kg) with at least two feet during locomotion. To improve the utilization of the adhesive material for heavier payloads, we propose a hybrid soft-rigid foot with a sandwich structure. This compact foot consists of three main parts or layers (rigid, soft, and dry adhesive material parts). The rigid part is used to generate sufficient pressure to achieve an omni-directional adhesive force. The soft part allows the foot to gain the maximum advantage from the adhesive material by maximizing adhesive area. The material part essentially provides strong adhesion. Aside from the foot design, we also propose gecko-inspired attaching and detaching strategies for the foot to achieve the largest adhesive force possible while requiring a low peeling force. Experimental results demonstrate that a foot with an adhesive area of approximately 12.56 cm2 and proper softness can support a weight of approximately 1.6 kg (or approximately 3.2 kg with at least two feet). In conclusion, this study provides a solution to enhance payload capacity and a guideline for further foot design with hybrid soft-rigid layers of climbing robots.},

  abstract = {Although there have been notable advances in adhesive materials, the ability to program attaching and detaching behavior in these materials remains a challenge. Here, we report a borate ester polymer hydrogel that can rapidly switch between adhesive and nonadhesive states in response to a mild electrical stimulus (voltages between 3.0 and 4.5 V). This behavior is achieved by controlling the exposure and shielding of the catechol group through water electrolysis--induced reversible cleavage and reformation of the borate ester moiety. By switching the electric field direction, the hydrogel can repeatedly attach to and detach from various surfaces with a response time as low as 1 s. This programmable attaching/detaching strategy provides an alternative approach for robot climbing. The hydrogel is simply pasted onto the moving parts of climbing robots without complicated engineering and morphological designs. Using our hydrogel as feet and wheels, the tethered walking robots and wheeled robots can climb on both vertical and inverted conductive substrates (i.e., moving upside down) such as stainless steel and copper. Our study establishes an effective route for the design of smart polymer adhesives that are applicable in intelligent devices and an electrochemical strategy to regulate the adhesion.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in robotics is to create efficient methods for grasping objects with diverse shapes, sizes, poses, and properties. Grasping with hand-like end effectors often requires careful selection of hand orientation and finger placement. Here, we present a fingerless soft gripper capable of efficiently generating multiple grasping modes. It is based on a soft, cylindrical accordion structure containing coupled, parallel fluidic channels, which are controlled via pressure supplied from a single fluidic port. Inflation opens the gripper orifice for enveloping an object, while deflation allows it to produce grasping forces. The interior is patterned with a gecko-like skin that increases friction, enabling the gripper to lift objects weighing up to 20 N. Our design ensures that fragile objects, such as eggs, can be safely handled, by virtue of a wall buckling mechanism. In reverse, the gripper can be deflated to reach into an opening or orifice then inflated to grasp objects with handles or cavities. The gripper may also integrate a lip that enables it to form a seal and, upon inflating, to generate suction for lifting objects with flat surfaces. In this article, we describe the design and fabrication of this device and present an analytical model of its behavior when operated from a single fluidic port. In experiments, we demonstrate its ability to grasp diverse objects, and show that its performance is well described by our model. Our findings show how a fingerless soft gripper can efficiently perform a variety of grasping operations. Such devices could improve the ability of robotic systems to meet applications in areas of great economic and societal importance.},

  abstract = {Claws are the most widespread attachment devices in animals, but comparatively little is known about the mechanics of claw attachment. A key morphological parameter in determining attachment ability is claw sharpness; however, there is a conflict between sharpness and fracture resistance. Sharper claws can interlock on more surfaces but are more likely to break. Body size interacts with this conflict such that larger animals should have much blunter claws and consequently poorer attachment ability than smaller animals. This expected size-induced reduction in attachment performance has not previously been investigated, and it is unclear how animals deal with this effect, and whether it indeed exists. We explored the scaling of claw sharpness with body size using four insect species (Nauphoeta cinerea, Gromphadorhina portentosa, Atta cephalotes and Carausius morosus) each covering a large size range. The scaling of claw sharpness varied significantly between species, suggesting that they face different pressures regarding claw function. Attachment forces were measured for A. cephalotes and G. portentosa (which had different scaling of claw sharpness) on several rough surfaces using a centrifuge setup. As expected, attachment performance was poorer in larger animals. Firstly, larger animals were more likely to slip, although this effect depended on the scaling of claw sharpness. Secondly, when they gripped, they attached with smaller forces relative to their weight. This size-induced reduction in attachment performance has significant implications for the attachment ability of larger animals on rough surfaces.},

Leveraging recent findings on how birds take off, land, and grasp, we developed a biomimetic robot that can dynamically perch on complex surfaces and grasp irregular objects. To accommodate high-speed collisions, the robot's two legs passively transform impact energy into grasp force, while the underactuated grasping mechanism wraps around irregularly shaped objects in less than 50 milliseconds. To determine the range of hardware design, kinematic, behavior, and perch parameters that are sufficient for perching success, we launched the robot at tree branches. The results corroborate our mathematical model, which shows that larger isometrically scaled animals and robots must accommodate disproportionately larger angular momenta, relative to their mass, to achieve similar landing performance. We find that closed-loop balance control serves an important role in maximizing the range of parameters sufficient for perching. The performance of the robot's biomimetic features attests to the functionality of their avian counterparts, and the robot enables us to study aspects of bird legs in ways that are infeasible in vivo. Our data show that pronounced differences in modern avian toe arrangements do not yield large changes in perching performance, suggesting that arboreal perching does not represent a strong selection pressure among common bird toe topographies. These findings advance our understanding of the avian perching apparatus and highlight design concepts that enable robots to perch on natural surfaces for environmental monitoring.},

First, to guarantee reliable attachment of the robot on rough ceilings, a spiny gripper inspired by the opposed gripping prolegs of caterpillars is designed, and a gripping model of the interaction between spines and the ceiling asperities is established and analyzed. Second, a spiny track is developed by assembling dozens of spiny grippers to enable continuous attachment. A cam mechanism is introduced in the robot design without extra actuators to achieve stable attachment and easy detachment during continuous climbing. Finally, climbing experiments are conducted on different surfaces, using a SpinyCrawler prototype. Experimental results demonstrated stable climbing ability on various rough inverted and vertical surfaces, including concrete walls, crushed stone walls, sandpaper walls, brick walls, and brick ceilings.},

Inspired by the forelegs of climbing animals, a passively adaptive soft gripper (ASG), with six claws and a compliant mechanism, is developed for grasping objects and attaching to rough surfaces. The design method, grasp adaptability, form closure, and force equilibrium of the ASG are presented and analyzed in this paper. Due to the compliance at each claw root, the ASG possesses a high passive adaption to various objects. With sharp hooks, a form closure may be achieved easily when the ASG grasps rough objects with structured or unstructured shapes. The ASG grasping an object constitutes an under-actuated system, the solution to which is difficult to obtain. The Monte Carlo method is suggested to achieve effective solutions for such systems, and the in-hull rate is proposed to evaluate the difficulty of finding solution. Tests and experiments with the ASG grasping various objects have verified the adaptability and reliability of the ASG. The analytic and experimental results show that the novel ASG may be used as a universal gripper for soft manipulators and a prospective attaching device for biped climbing soft robots.},

By combining approaches of finite element analysis, quasi-static analytical modeling, and experimental measurements, the deformation of the single soft actuator as a function of air pressure input in free space was analyzed. To investigate the effect of the effective actuator length on the gripping performance of the gripper, we conducted systematical experiments to evaluate the pull-off force, the actuation speed, the precision and error tolerance of the soft gripper while grasping objects of various sizes and shapes. A combination of depressurization and pressurization in actuation as well as applying variable effective actuator length enhanced the gripper's performance significantly, with no sensors. For example, with tunable effective actuator length, the gripper was able to grasp objects ranging from 2 mm -- 170 mm robustly. Under the optimal length, the gripper could generate the maximum pull-off force for the corresponding object size; the precision and the error tolerance of the gripper were also significantly improved compared to those of the gripper with full-length. Our soft robotic prototype exhibits a simple control and low-cost approach of gripping a wide range of objects and may have wide leverage for future industrial operations.},

We propose an online impedance strategy for controlling peeling angle to realize compliant movement. Variable compliant motions are achieved by online tuning the stiffness and damping parameters of proportional-derivative control, which realizes compliant detachment with a peeling angle of {$\pi$}, the adhesion strength to adjust to a minimum and basically eliminated the instant change in normal adhesion strength at the detachment end state. The proposed controller was validated using a vertical climbing robot. The results showed that, with the proposed controller, the sudden change in the normal adhesion force during peeling was significantly reduced. Besides, there is no correlation between the sudden change in the normal adhesion force at the detachment end state and the adhesion state. Regardless of the adhesion states, the compliant detachment can be accomplished reliably.},

  abstract = {Grasping and manipulation are fundamental ways for many creatures to interact with their environments. Different morphologies and grasping methods of ``grippers'' are highly evolved to adapt to harsh survival conditions. For example, human hands and bird feet are composed of rigid frames and soft joints. Compared with human hands, some plants like Drosera do not have rigid frames, so they can bend at arbitrary points of the body to capture their prey. Furthermore, many muscular hydrostat animals and plant tendrils can implement more complex twisting motions in 3D space. Recently, inspired by the flexible grasping methods present in nature, increasingly more bio-inspired soft grippers have been fabricated with compliant and soft materials. Based on this, the present review focuses on the recent research progress of bio-inspired soft grippers based on impactive gripping. According to their types of movement and a classification model inspired by biological ``grippers'', soft grippers are classified into three types, namely, non-continuum bending-type grippers, continuum bending-type grippers, and continuum twisting-type grippers. An exhaustive and updated analysis of each type of gripper is provided. Moreover, this review offers an overview of the different stiffness-controllable strategies developed in recent years.},

This method of grasping is effective for objects small enough for a given gripper to partially encompass. However, to grasp larger objects, significant grip forces and a high coefficient of friction are required. We present a new grasping method for convex objects, using almost exclusively shear forces. We achieve shear grasping with a gripper that utilizes thin film gecko-inspired fibrillar adhesives that conform to the curvature of the object. We present a verified model for grasping a range of curvatures and results that demonstrate the thin film fibrillar adhesives' increased contact area on textured surfaces when loaded in shear. Finally, the gripper is implemented on a robotic arm and grasps a variety of convex objects (at rest and ballistic).},

  abstract = {Geckos, which can walk upside down on smooth or rough surfaces, owe this ability to the hierarchical structures under their toes. These structures are responsible for substantial adhesion and, at the same time, for quick attachment/detachment by mechanical stimulus of toe muscles. Inspired by such stimuli-responsive systems in nature, an active adhesive soft gripper for rough surfaces is proposed in this study, consisting of the mushroom-like morphology acting as adhesive structures and the pressure controllable deformation working as toe muscles. Through tunable pressure, the adhesive force can be increased and reduced by roughly 20-fold for a ground glass, in which it can quickly reach high adhesion with positive pressure and reduce to small adhesion under negative pressure. This gecko inspired soft gripper is tested and found successful as a pick-up and drop-down system for transporting a surface with different features, composed of rough acrylic plate, steel ball, flexible photo paper, heavy glass block/plate, etc., which will have great potential for applications in industrial line and daily life as well as providing a novel perspective for the design of soft grippers.},

  abstract = {Wall-climbing robots have been widely applied in the inspection of smooth walls. However, only a few adhesion methods have been developed for robots that will allow them to climb cliffs and dusty, high-altitude, rough walls (constructed using coarse concrete, bricks, and stones, etc.) that may be subjected to vibrations. This paper proposes a suitable adhesion method that employs grappling-hook-like claws arranged in a cross shape. First, we address the implementation mechanism required. Then, a method of extracting the characteristic parameter is revealed rough wall was devised, 3D profiles of rough walls were simulated, and the discriminant conditions necessary for the claws to stably grasp the wall were provided. A method of triangulation is proposed to judge which regions of a 3D wall can be gripped, and we subsequently present a grasping discrimination algorithm for the interaction between the miniature claws and 3D wall profile. Finally, a prototype of the grappling-hook-like claw system was fabricated. A test platform was built to test the robot which incorporates an electromagnetic vibration shaker to simulate a vibrating wall. Experiments were then carried out on the robot using the vibrating wall and a random outdoor wall. The results verified the feasibility of the proposed claws and the validity of the discriminant algorithm for gripping 3D walls. Compared with traditional adhesion approaches, the proposed method (based on hook-like claws) is more adaptable to suit various types of wall. It also has higher resistance to disturbances and so provides a more reliable method of adhesion for robots on rough walls.},

However, most of existing octopus-inspired adhesives are either passive without an actuation strategy or active but not energy efficient. Here, a novel design of a magnetically actuated, energy-efficient smart adhesive with rapidly tunable, great switchable, and highly reversible adhesion strength inspired by the elastic energy storage mechanism in octopus suckers is reported. The smart adhesive features two cavities separated by an elastic membrane with the upper cavity filled with magnetic particles while the lower one empty. The deformation of the elastic membrane can be actively controlled by an external magnetic field to change the cavity volume, thus generating a cavity-pressure-induced adhesion. Systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal the fundamental aspects of design and operation of the smart adhesive and give insights into the underlying adhesion mechanisms. Demonstrations of this smart adhesive in transfer printing and manipulation of various surfaces in both dry and wet environments illustrate the potential for deterministic assembly and industrial or robotic manipulation.},

  abstract = {In this article, we have proposed a novel robotic finger design principle aimed to address two challenges in soft pneumatic grippers-the controllability of the stiffness and the controllability of the bending position. The proposed finger design is composed of a 3D printed multimaterial substrate and a soft pneumatic actuator. The substrate has four polylactic acid (PLA) segments interlocked with three shape memory polymer (SMP) joints, inspired by bones and joints in human fingers. By controlling the thermal energy of an SMP joint, the stiffness of the joints is modulated due to the dramatic change in SMP elastic modulus around its glass transition temperature (Tg). When SMP joints are heated above Tg, they exhibit very small stiffness, allowing the finger to easily bend around the SMP joints if the attached soft actuator is actuated. When there is no force from the soft actuator, shape recovery stress in SMP contributes to the finger's shape restoration. Since each joint's rotation can be individually controlled, the position control of the finger is made possible. Experimental analysis has been conducted to show the finger's variable stiffness and the result is compared with the analytical values. It is found that the stiffness ratio can be 24.9 times for a joint at room temperature (20{$^\circ$}C) and at an elevated temperature of 60{$^\circ$}C when air pressure p of the soft actuator is turned off. Finally, a gripper composed of two fingers is fabricated for demonstration.},

The appearance of mussels-inspired dopamine chemistry has provided the feasibility to fabricate underwater adhesives; however, for such a system, imitating the reversible and fast dynamic attachment/detachment mechanism of gecko feet still remains unsolved. Here, by synthesizing a thermoresponsive copolymer of poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl-acrylate-co-N-isopropyl acrylamide) and then decorating it onto mushroom-shaped poly(dimethylsiloxane) pillar arrays, a novel underwater thermoresponsive gecko-like adhesive (TRGA) can be fabricated, yielding high adhesion during the attachment state above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the copolymer, yet low adhesion during the detachment state below the LCST of the copolymer. By integrating the Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the TRGA, TRGAs responsive to near-infrared laser radiation can be engineered, which can be successfully used for rapid and reversible remote control over adhesion so as to capture and release heavy objects underwater because of the contrast force change of both the normal adhesion force and the lateral friction force. It is also demonstrated that the material can be assembled on the tracks of an underwater mobile device to realize controllable movement. This opens up the door for developing intelligent underwater gecko-like locomotion with dynamic attachment/detachment ability.},

Here, deformable cupped microstructures (diameter typically 100 {\textmu}m, rim thickness 5 {\textmu}m) are reported that can switch between high ({$\approx$}1 MPa) and low ({$<$}0.2 MPa) adhesion strength by adjusting the retraction velocity from 100 to 0.1 {\textmu}m s--1. The velocity at which the switch occurs is determined by specific design parameters of the cupped microstructure, such as the cup width and angle. The results are compared with theoretical estimates of water penetration into the contact zone and expansion of the cup during retraction. This work paves the way for controlling wet adhesion on demand and may inspire further applications in smart adhesives.},

  abstract = {It is highly desired yet challenging to construct soft robots resembling the dexterous motor skills and powerful tactile sensations of human hands. Herein, a bioinspired design to create soft--rigid hybrid mechanoreceptive actuators (HMAs) and grippers is reported, imitating the musculoskeletal structure and embedded mechanoreception of human fingers, via careful ink preparation and a multimodality all-3D-printing technology. The HMAs consist of multiple rigid segments between joints, imitating phalanges, to mount flexible mechanoreceptive sensors in a flexible-on-rigid (FOR) design, yielding a bending-insensitive unambiguous mechanoreception. The printed sensors exhibit a humanoid high sensitivity for low contact force and a wide low-sensitivity linear detection range, combined with excellent long-term stability and low hysteresis. As a result, the HMA gripper not only shows greatly enhanced output force due to the soft--rigid hybrid design, but also enables multifunctional mechanoreceptive sensing including contact identification, gentle grabbing, and the estimation of size, weight, and stiffness of the grasped objects. This integrated approach of constructing soft robots with mechanoreception can provide a pathway toward feedback control, integrative biomimetic functions, and human--machine interface for all soft devices.},

  abstract = {A surface microstructure that mimics the surface of a gecko's foot can exert a large gripping force with a small contact force. If such a structure is applied to the fingertips of a two-fingered parallel gripper, stable grasping can be achieved independent of the wetting and frictional state of the contact surface. However, the adhesive force of the microstructure is large while releasing the object, which hinders the release of the object. In this study, we developed a release method using a conveyor mechanism that easily peels off in the direction of rotation with a focus on the characteristics of the micro-protrusion structure. This mechanism is driven in conjunction with the gripper's grasping and releasing motions. Our experiments confirmed that the gripper can stably release the object using the proposed mechanism. The proposal in this paper is a mechanism that dynamically changes the adhesive force on a fingertip by mechanically switching the surface state in accordance with the gripper's grasping and releasing states. This idea can be applied to not only surface microstructure such as gecko-inspired surfaces but also adhesive surfaces such as adhesive tape, and provides novel knowledge in the field of robotics as a method of mechanically changing the fingertip adhesive force.},

Herein, a multibionic soft gripper with multiscale microstructures is demonstrated, featuring light weight (12 mg), versatility, and endurance to heavy dust. The multibionic gripper mimics the grasping structure of eagle claws, the friction-increasing structure of gecko feet, and the shining structural color on butterfly wings. External laser stimuli allow the grasping of various objects and precise measurement of the target sizes.

These hairy adhesive pads consist of fine and long surface outgrowths (setae), terminated by thin plate-like tips of different shapes. Besides structural adaptations, recent work revealed material gradients along the length of the setae with spatula-shaped and pointed tip structures. It was shown that these setae have a rigid base and soft setal tips, which is assumed to enhance the adaptability to rough surfaces and prevent clustering of the setae. Here, we show a not yet described type of material gradient found in discoidal (or mushroom-shaped) setae of male leaf beetles. In contrast to the previously shown gradient, the setal tips and the basal and central seta sections are composed of relatively stiff chitinous materials, whereas the transition zones between the central seta sections and the setal tips contain large proportions of the rather soft and elastic protein resilin, forming a joint-like element. Having performed adhesion measurements with artificial macroscopic mushroom-shaped adhesive structures with different implemented joint-like elements, we show that the main functional role of these joint-like elements is to facilitate the adaptability to uneven and non-parallel substrates, rather than to provide detachment tolerance towards pull-off forces applied under various tilt angles.},

Important progress has been made, and the basic mechanics of how 'hairy' adhesives work have been faithfully reproduced, advancing theory in surface science and portending diverse practical applications. However, after 15\>years, no synthetic mimic can yet perform as well as a gecko and simultaneously meet of all the criteria listed above. Moreover, processes for the production of inexpensive and scalable products are still not clearly in view. Here, we discuss our perspective on some of the gaps in understanding that still remain; these gaps in our knowledge should stimulate us to turn to deeper study of the way in which free-ranging geckos stick to the variety of surfaces found in their natural environments and to a more complete analysis of the materials composing the gecko toe pads.},

These stimulus-responsive dry adhesives exhibit some unique capabilities, as their ability to adhere to and detach from surfaces can be controlled with the help of an external stimulus. For example, studies have developed magnetic field-responsive dry adhesives and show that the adhesion of these materials can be turned on and off by controlling the applied magnetic field. Light-responsive adhesives have also been developed and shown to reverse their adhesion using infrared light as the stimulus. Such materials show tremendous promise in pick-and-place systems for handling delicate objects and microelectronic products. The focus of this article is to review the stimulus-responsive materials that have been used to develop dry adhesives. The mechanisms adopted by these stimulus-responsive materials to switch their adhesion are discussed. Applications of stimulus-responsive dry adhesives are presented, and last, the future perspective of these materials is discussed.},

  abstract = {The contact splitting hypothesis (CSH) has been proposed for around 20 years, which suggests that the patterned or fibrillar surfaces enable very efficient biological attachment systems (e.g., Geckos' seta). However, there is still a debate in academic community on the necessity of the CSH in man-made adhesives, since experiments have indicated that the non-fibrillar surface can also show strong adhesion. This study demonstrates that the surface roughness plays a key role in evaluating the influence of CSH on adhesion by a simple finite element (FE) model. The highly split structures are essentially required for strong adhesion on highly rough surface, but may in turn cause slight adhesion reduction on smooth surface due to the areal loss in the splitting process. With our results, the debate in CSH is explained as an incomplete understanding of an adhesive contact problem, in which the surface roughness is overlooked. Our results further sheds light on the natural selection that climbing animals with heavier body usually evolve finer adhesive structures on their pads, by considering both the surface roughness and its length scale dependence.},

Adhesion properties were determined with a flat probe as a function of preload. For low and moderate applied compressive preloads, measured adhesion was 7.5 times greater than on flat controls whereas for high applied preloads adhesion dropped to very low values. In situ imaging shows that the increased preload caused the pillars to deform by bending and/or buckling and to lose their adhesive contact. The elasticity of PDMS aids the pillar recovery to the upright position upon removal of preload enabling repeatability of the switch.},

It consists of a patterned surface with an array of mushroom-shaped pillars having two distinct heights. The different pillar heights allow control of the pull-off force in two steps by application of a low and a high preload. For low preload, only the long pillars form contact, resulting in a low pull-off force. At higher preload, all pillars form contact, resulting in high pull-off force. Even further loading leads to buckling induced detachment of the pillars which corresponds to extremely low pull-off force. To achieve the respective samples a new fabrication method called double inking is developed, to achieve multiple-height pillar structures. The adhesion performance of the two-step switchable adhesive is analysed at varying preload and for different pillar aspect ratios and height relations. Finally, the deformation behavior of the samples is investigated by in situ monitoring.},

Many research groups have made fruitful achievements in fabricating and designing various dry adhesives. However, most of these studies focus on imitating bioinspired geometry to achieve this smart adhesion, neglecting the contact interface control through their peeling motion. Here, we present an alternative design to achieve this switchable adhesion on the basis of controlling contact areas. This unique design includes micropillars array with large overhanging caps and a ``step'' located at the center line of the cap. When dragging the pillars in the direction of the upper surface of the step, the lower surface is brought into contact, rapidly yielding stronger adhesion (switched-on state). Alternatively, when dragging the pillars in the direction of the lower surface of the step, the contact areas decrease sharply, leading to weak adhesion (switched-off state). Such switchable property under strong adhesion force is exactly what many practical applications need, and the ability to achieve this property by controlling the adhesion area size presented here opens a new way to dry adhesives design.},

By far the most common type of test for directional adhesives, the load-drag-pull (LDP) test is useful but can miss substantial information on the exact behavior of gecko-inspired adhesives in a variety of loading conditions. Other test techniques, including angled approaches and pull-offs, have been employed by a few groups but they are not as widely adopted; peel tests can be employed but require a larger amount of adhesive material to use in the test, which is not always practical given some current manufacturing constraints. Very few tests have looked at the effect of off-main axis loads on the performance of directional adhesives, however, and this quality of performance may be very important in applications where direct control over displacements or angle of pull-off in pitch and yaw of the peeling interface may not be practical or possible. To address this overlooked area of characterization, we introduce a new test concept for anisotropic adhesives, the adhesion circle, and also compare how the radial normal adhesion performance is altered depending on whether the pull-off comes after a displacement drag or when pulled at a constant angle from vertical after a preload. Testing directional adhesive designs made with different geometries shows that unexpected behaviors at pull-off angles not in the direction of the strong--weak axis can sometimes be seen. The complete adhesion circle tests should help better design directional adhesives for scaled up performance, and can be completed with relatively simple hardware that is typically used in most current directional adhesive tests.},

Their reversible adhesion to various materials and surfaces has been reported over more than a decade. Switching between a strong and a weak adhesive state can be introduced by elastic buckling instabilities of the microstructure. In this work, we report on novel adhesive pads that exhibit micropatterned pillars on both sides. In double-sided PDMS micropatterns, the dimensions of the pillar structures were tuned by modulating the critical force for buckling during compressive loading. In this way, selective detachment of glass substrates was induced from one side of the pad. Our results indicate a significant switching efficiency of up to 83\% between the strong and weak adhesive state. The new structures have high potential for emerging applications where temporary, double-sided fixations in combination with a predetermined detachment location are required.},

In the present approach, micropillar-patterned PDMS surfaces with superior adhesion to glass substrates with different roughnesses are designed and analyzed.

  abstract = {At the molecular scale, there are strong attractive interactions between surfaces, yet few macroscopic surfaces are sticky. Extensive simulations of contact by adhesive surfaces with roughness on nanometer to micrometer scales are used to determine how roughness reduces the area where atoms contact and thus weakens adhesion. The material properties, adhesive strength, and roughness parameters are varied by orders of magnitude. In all cases, the area of atomic contact is initially proportional to the load. The prefactor rises linearly with adhesive strength for weak attractions. Above a threshold adhesive strength, the prefactor changes sign, the surfaces become sticky, and a finite force is required to separate them. A parameter-free analytic theory is presented that describes changes in these numerical results over up to five orders of magnitude in load. It relates the threshold adhesive strength to roughness and material properties, explaining why most macroscopic surfaces do not stick. The numerical results are qualitatively and quantitatively inconsistent with classical theories based on the Greenwood-Williamson approach that neglect the range of adhesion and do not include asperity interactions.},

Over the last two decades, many design principles have been explored that helped to understand the underlying mechanics and to optimize such adhesives for certain applications. An aspect that has been overlooked so far is the influence of longer hold times on the adhesive contacts. Exemplarily, the pull-off stress and work of separation of a micropatterned adhesive specimen are enhanced by factors 3 and 6, respectively, after 1000 min in contact with a glass substrate. In addition to such global measures, the increase of adhesion of all individual micropillars is analyzed. It is found that contact aging varied across the microarray, as it drastically depends on local conditions. Despite great differences on the micropillar scale, the adhesion of entire specimens increased with very similar power laws, as this is determined by the mean contact ageing of the individual structures. Overall, contact aging must be critically evaluated before using micropatterned adhesives, especially for long-term fixations and material combinations that are chemically attractive to each other.},

Toward this aim, we introduce cylindrical two-phase single pillars, which are composed of a mechanically stiff stalk and a soft tip layer. Adhesion to smooth and rough substrates is shown to exceed that of conventional pillar structures. The adhesion characteristics can be tuned by varying the thickness of the soft tip layer, the ratio of the Young's moduli and the curvature of the interface between the two phases. For rough substrates, adhesion values similar to those obtained on smooth substrates were achieved. Our concept of composite pillars overcomes current practical limitations caused by surface roughness and opens up fields of application where roughness is omnipresent.},

In this work, the impact of misalignment on the performance of fibrillar adhesive patches contacting smooth flat surfaces is examined, demonstrating that the conditions for circumferential detachment are extremely limited. For an array of fibrils on a backing layer of varying thickness, normal adhesion tests are performed against a flat surface that maintains a fixed angle of misalignment with respect to the adhesive surface. In the aligned state the detachment is circumferential and the detachment force is highest for the thinnest, least compliant backing layer. However, for misalignment angles on the order of just 0.1{$^\circ$}, peel-like detachments are observed. The thickest backing layer, being 210\% more compliant than the thinnest, yields a 43\% increase in the adhesive strength at a misalignment angle of 0.4{$^\circ$}. This suggests that out-with conditions of precise alignment, backing-layer compliance is beneficial to strength under normal loading. A mechanical model is presented, revealing the mechanism behind enhanced resistance to peel propagation is deformation of the backing layer at the detachment front which reduces differential stretching of fibrils.},

Despite much progress over the last decade, the current understanding of these adhesives is limited to single contact pillars and the behavior of whole arrays is largely unexplored. In the study reported here, a novel approach is taken to gain insight into the detachment mechanisms of whole micropatterned arrays. Individual contacts are imaged by frustrated total internal reflection, allowing in situ observation of contact formation and separation during adhesion tests. The detachment of arrays is found to be governed by the distributed adhesion strength of individual pillars, but no collaborative effect mediated by elastic interactions can be detected. At the maximal force, about 30\% of the mushroom structures are already detached. The adhesive forces decrease with reduced air pressure by 20\% for the smooth and by 6\% for the rough specimen. These contributions are attributed to a suction effect, whose strength depends critically on interfacial defects controlling the sealing quality of the contact. This dominates the detachment process and the resulting adhesion strength.},

On the particle-depleted side (PDS), WoA does not depend on particle concentration and on the magnetic field. Adhesion and friction are coupled in MAEs. No statistically significant difference in the friction coefficient, determined from the extended Amontons{\textasciiacute} law, depending on sample side, CIP concentration, or presence of magnetic field is found. However, the PDS in the magnetic field demonstrates significantly higher critical shear stress compared to that for the PES or PDS in the absence of magnetic field. Correlations between different surface properties are discussed. Obtained results are useful for the development of magnetically controllable soft robots.},

  abstract = {A substrate mimicking the surface topography and temperature sensitivity of skin goosebumps is fabricated. Close-packed arrays of thermoresponsive microgel particles undergo topographical changes in response to temperature changes between 25 and 37 {$^\circ$}C, resembling the goosebump structure that human skin develops in response to temperature changes or other circumstances. Specifically, positively charged poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride] (PMETAC) brushes serve as an anchoring substrate for negatively charged poly(NIPAm-co-AA) microgels. The packing density and particle morphology can be tuned by brush layer thickness and pH of the microgel suspension. For brush layer thickness below 50 nm, particle monolayers are observed, with slightly flattened particle morphology at pH 3 and highly collapsed particles at pH above 7. Polymer brush films with thickness above 50 nm lead to the formation of particle multilayers. The temperature responsiveness of the monolayer assemblies allows reversible changes in the film morphology, which in turn affects underwater adhesion and friction at 25 and 37 {$^\circ$}C. These results are promising for the design of new functional materials and may also serve as a model for biological structures and processes.},

To mimic this earthworm-like lubricating capability, an attempt to create a textured structure on the surface of liquid-releasable polymer coatings by a ``breath figure'' process is described herein. The resulting coatings exhibit fast and site-specific release behavior under external triggers such as solid-based friction. The released oil is then stabilized by the surface texture to form thick lubricating layers, reducing friction and enhancing wear resistance. Moreover, the coatings also exhibit excellent antifouling property in a sticky soil environment. Because the lubricating layer can be regenerated after consumption, the potential of this self-replenished lubricating mechanism in preparing friction-reduction, antiwear, and antifouling coatings used in solid-based environments is therefore envisioned.},

The effect of this change in topography on friction is investigated with a fixed surface chemistry at the sliding interface to ensure a consistent value of adhesive shear strength per unit area of contact. With a wrinkled surface, a shorter stick--slip period and corresponding lower average force of friction are observed when compared to a flat PDMS surface. Based on the framework of Bowden--Tabor's adhesive friction model, this result is attributed to a decrease in the contact area caused by an increase in the effective modulus and the distribution of interfacial contacts on the wrinkles. These results therefore imply that a shape-tunable microstructure is an effective approach to developing surfaces with dynamically tunable tribological properties.},

Applying the specific properties of the epoxy-based SMP, fast switching friction can be achieved by adjusting the topography and stiffness of the microstructures on the surface. In addition, the photothermogenesis effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles induces changes in the asymmetric topography and stiffness on the SMP surface under the irradiation of near-infrared (NIR) light, thereby inducing a rapid switching of the friction force. Furthermore, a microbot is created to demonstrate remotely controlled locomotion, such as unidirectional and round-trip movements, and braking by switching the friction force under NIR light. These results are promising for the design of new intelligent surfaces and interfaces; additionally, they may facilitate the investigation of biological structures and processes.},

Supplementing the robot experiments, we investigated tribological properties of the shark skin as well as its mechanical stability. It shows high frictional anisotropy due to an array of sloped denticles. The orientation of the denticles to the underlying collagenous material also strongly influences their mechanical interlocking with the substrate. This study not only opens up a new way of achieving energy-efficient legged robot locomotion but also provides a better understanding of the functionalities and mechanical properties of anisotropic surfaces. That understanding will assist developing new types of material for other real-world applications.},

This marked variation is due to the effect of recovery stress caused by the shape memory effect of polymer networks. Additionally, the recovery stress would increase with the increase of crosslinked density and test temperature above Tg, leading to a higher COF. The polymer networks also show excellent mechanical strength with tensile modulus and elongation at break over 60 MPa and 100 \%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paradigm about tunable friction properties realized by shape memory polymer.

Geckos and other climbing organisms demonstrate just this ability: to hold large loads (on-state) due to specialized digits and microstructures, yet they are also able to quickly peel their feet from a surface while climbing (off-state). Inspired by the simplicity of the gecko's geometric switching mechanism, we have investigated the use of origami design methods to create geometries that can transition from a stiff configuration to a more flexible and easily peeled configuration. Specifically, we examined three different origami designs (Kresling, Waterbomb and Ron Resch) fabricated in polycarbonate and supplemented with 3D printed structures. Although the polycarbonate could be coated with a commercial adhesive, we investigated the devices in contact with polydimethylsiloxane adhesive pads in order to chemically control interfaces and create a range of differing adhesion levels. We show that the devices are capable of moderate switching ratios (               F               on               /               F               off               up to {$\sim$}50).

  abstract = {Gecko adhesion has inspired the fabrication of various dry adhesive surfaces, most of which are developed to be used under atmospheric conditions. However, applications of gecko-inspired surfaces can be expanded to vacuum and even space environment due to the characteristics of van der Waals interactions, which are always present between materials regardless of the surrounding environment. In this paper, a controllable, anisotropic dry adhesion in vacuum is demonstrated with gecko-inspired wedged dry adhesive surfaces fabricated using an ultraprecision diamond cutting mold. The adhesion and friction properties of the wedge-structured surfaces are systematically characterized in loading--pulling mode and loading--dragging--pulling mode. The surfaces show significant anisotropic adhesion (P ad {$\approx$} 10.5 kPa vs P ad {$\approx$} 0.7 kPa) and friction (P f {$\approx$} 50 kPa vs P f {$\approx$} 30 kPa) when actuated in gripping and releasing direction, respectively. The wedge-structured surfaces in vacuum show comparable properties as exposed in atmosphere. A three-legged gripper is designed to pick up, hold, and release a patterned silicon wafer in vacuum. The study demonstrates a green, high-yield, and low-cost method to fabricate a reliable and durable mold for gecko inspired anisotropic dry adhesive surfaces and the potential application of dry adhesive surface in vacuum. A green, high-yield, and low-cost method based on ultraprecision diamond cutting~ is proposed to fabricate gecko-inspired wedge-structured adhesive surface. Controllable anisotropic dry adhesion of the surfaces is successfully demonstrated to pick up, hold, and release the patterned or unpatterned silicon wafers both under atmospheric conditions and in vacuum.},

  abstract = {Gentle suction flow at the fingertips of a compliant hand can enhance object acquisition and increase the robustness of pinch grasps under water. The approach adds a low-pressure pump and flexible tubes that terminate at the distal phalanges. The light flow rate does not create a powerful suction force, nor does it stir up significant sediment. The method works on porous and rough objects in addition to smooth objects as it does not require forming a seal. It changes contact conditions---normal force and coefficient of friction---and enlarges the acquisition region when grasping free objects under water. A simple hydrodynamic model matches empirical force measurements adequately for incorporation in a dynamic simulation to explore the effects of flow rate and object mass. Simulations and experiments show that effects of fingertip suction flow are most pronounced for acquiring objects on the order of 1 kg or less and when pinching large objects. Gentle suction flow is an effective, versatile, and convenient addition for robots that must grasp and manipulate objects under water.},

  abstract = {Summary Snakes have long captivated robotics researchers due to their effective locomotion, flexible body structure, and ability to adapt their skin friction to different terrains. While extensive research has delved into serpentine locomotion, there remains a gap in exploring rectilinear locomotion as a robotic solution for navigating through narrow spaces. In this study, we describe the fundamental principles of rectilinear locomotion and apply them to design a soft crawling robot using origami modules constructed from laminated fabrics. The modules incorporate pneumatic actuation and anisotropic friction modulation, drawing inspiration from both origami principles and insights gained from the locomotion of snakes. We performed a comprehensive process of design, fabrication, characterization, and analysis of the robot and tested its performance across a variety of terrains with an emphasis on its potential applications in search and rescue and field inspection. Graphical abstract Highlights A soft robot imitates the non-wavy movement snakes use to move in a straight line The robot's body and actuation system are made of lightweight outdoor fabric A breathable textile air pouch is designed using origami for pneumatic actuation The robot can crawl on surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, and a synthetic track The bigger picture Snakes have long captured the interest of robotics researchers because of their versatile and efficient locomotion, adaptive body structure, and ability to adjust their skin friction on diverse terrains. While considerable research has focused on snakes' wave-like motions, a gap exists in exploring the unique way snakes move in a straight path for maneuvering through narrow spaces. We present a modular soft robot made of outdoor fabric that performs rectilinear locomotion. The design captures the flexibility of snakes with an emphasis on the role of skin in propulsion, providing a weight-, material cost-, and energy-effective approach for a robot to move through confined spaces. Integrating insights from snake biology into soft robotic designs holds promise for creating more sophisticated, adaptable, and efficient robotic systems, with potential applications ranging from search-and-rescue operations to field inspection and space exploration. Integrating insights from snake biology into soft robotics holds promise for developing adaptive autonomous robots. These innovations can have applications in areas such as search-and-rescue missions, field inspection operations, and space exploration, especially in scenarios demanding navigation through confined spaces where body flexion is not feasible. In this work, the authors learned snakes' rectilinear locomotion and leveraged origami to design textile-based actuators to create a lightweight, soft robot for friction-assisted locomotion across diverse terrains.},

However, this does not explain their forward locomotion and sidewinding on a flat surface. Recent studies have shown that the snake's forward locomotion and sidewinding are aided by a nonuniform ground-contact distribution. In this article, we propose a novel control strategy to achieve nonuniform ground contacts for a robotic snake locomotion using body compliance and uniform body tension. First, we present a set of mechanical analyses for a continuum snake model. Then, we demonstrate that the deflection under gravity resulting from body compliance and uniform body tension naturally yields the contact distributions required for forward and backward locomotion and sidewinding. Finally, a simple control strategy is suggested for a robotic snake locomotion, which was validated through dynamic simulations and physical experiments.},

  abstract = {The hook as a shape occurs very early on the evolutionary scale. Cellulose appears as a biological building block in the Cambrian age from fossil records, and hooks have been found in chitinous organisms as mandibles, maxillae as well as tarsi. Hook separation forces associated with plant seed and fruit dispersal have been studied in four species by SN Gorb. A fifth, Arctium minus (or Burdock as it is commonly known) is purported to have been the source of engineering design inspiration for George de Mestral (see Velcro). There are marked differences in the shape and functionality of natural A. minus hooks, and the probabilistic fastener that he designed and developed, namely the needle-like profile for insertion of the A. minus hooks, their lack of reusability and their physical size. In functionality, Velcro resembles that of Circaea lutetiana, not A. minus. From the study of SN Gorb's data, it is concluded that there are additional indicators for structural behaviour as well as the morphological variables indicated by Gorb, and these are flexible versus fixed bases to the shafts and degrees of resilience (stiffness, the inverse of Young's modulus) of the component material. The natural substrate properties are presented as being indicative of the receptiveness of the hooks to a range of substrates. Field testing consisted of tensile testing mounted A. minus hooks in an Instron tensile tester in a laboratory to note the fracture strength (contact separation force) and mode of failure which was characteristic of a composite biomaterial. The study indicates that contrary to Gorb, the reduction in the size rendered the bending moment due to the hook span to be negligible and of little effect. Note that an early original botanical paper on A. minus is missing presumed lost from the British Library and that finite element analysis follows in paper III, and an experiment into the use of confocal microscopy (shape acquisition) in paper II. Results indicate that the contact separation force is independent of bending moment and the ``span'' of the hook, a scaling effect that is important for the design for manufacture (DFM) of micron range-sized hooks.},

In this part 3, consideration is given to the development of a behaviour-optimised bioinspired probabilistic attachment system that is thermodynamically inert due to attachment substructures, such as interlocking setae, that act as arrestors and temporary interlocking devices. The three devices of part 2 are considered for their relative merits, and one part is modelled for a rapid prototyping device. If one is considering the question of shape versus material, then it is at this stage that it is a very important issue since one is considering fundamental, simple shapes and the materials used to form them are of finite variety.

  abstract = {For robot arms to perform everyday tasks in unstructured environments, these robots must be able to manipulate a diverse range of objects. Today's robots often grasp objects with either soft grippers or rigid end-effectors. However, purely rigid or purely soft grippers have fundamental limitations: soft grippers struggle with irregular, heavy objects, while rigid grippers often cannot grasp small, numerous items. In this paper we therefore introduce RISOs, a mechanics and controls approach for unifying traditional RIgid end-effectors with a novel class of SOft adhesives. When grasping an object, RISOs can use either the rigid end-effector (pinching the item between non-deformable fingers) and/or the soft materials (attaching and releasing items with switchable adhesives). This enhances manipulation capabilities by combining and decoupling rigid and soft mechanisms. With RISOs robots can perform grasps along a spectrum from fully rigid, to fully soft, to rigid-soft, enabling real time object manipulation across a 1 million times range in weight (from 2 mg to 2 kg). To develop RISOs we first model and characterize the soft switchable adhesives. We then mount sheets of these soft adhesives on the surfaces of rigid end-effectors, and develop control strategies that make it easier for robot arms and human operators to utilize RISOs. The resulting RISO grippers were able to pick-up, carry, and release a larger set of objects than existing grippers, and participants also preferred using RISO. Overall, our experimental and user study results suggest that RISOs provide an exceptional gripper range in both capacity and object diversity.

For decades, they have been committed to exploring sub-fields of soft robotics (e.g., cutting-edge techniques in design and fabrication, accurate modeling, as well as advanced control algorithms). Although scientists have made many different efforts, they share the common goal of enhancing applicability. The presented paper aims to brief the progress of soft robotic research for readers interested in this field, and clarify how an appropriate control algorithm can be produced for soft robots with specific morphologies. This paper, instead of enumerating existing modeling or control methods of a certain soft robot prototype, interprets for the relationship between morphology and morphology-dependent motion strategy, attempts to delve into the common issues in a particular class of soft robots, and elucidates a generic solution to enhance their performance.},

In particular, the rolling motion of spheres on microstructured surfaces in fluid environments is important for the transport of particles in microfluidic devices or in tribology. Here, we characterize the motion of smooth silicon nitride spheres (diameters 3--5 mm) as they roll down inclined planes decorated with hexagonal arrays of microwells and micropillars. For both types of patterned surfaces, we vary the area fraction of the micropatterned features from 0.04 to 0.96. We measure directly and independently the rotational and translational velocities of the spheres as they roll down planes with inclination angles that vary between 5 and 30{$^\circ$}. For a given area fraction, we find that spheres have a higher translational and rotational velocity on surfaces with microwells than on micropillars. We rely on the model of Smart and Leighton [Phys. Fluids A 5, 13 (1993)] to obtain an effective gap width and coefficient of friction for all microstructured surfaces investigated. We find that the coefficient of friction is significantly higher for a surface with micropillars than that for one with microwells, likely due to the presence of interconnected drainage channels that provide additional paths for the fluid flow and favor solid--solid contact on the surface with micropillars. We find that while the effective gap width at a very low solid fraction is equal to the height of the patterned features, the effective separation decreases exponentially as the surface coverage of microstructures increases, with little measured differences between the two geometries. Superposition of resistance functions is used to relate the rapid decrease in the effective gap height with increase in the surface coverage observed in experiments.},

They can highly enhance the performance of individual continuum arms by providing extra stiffness, leading to increased accuracy, payload capacity, and dynamic stability of the robot. This study aimed to investigate the stiffness analysis of tendon-driven supportive-type CCRs (S-CCRs). For this purpose, first, a generalized framework for the dynamic mathematical formulation and numerical solution of S-CCRs was proposed, their dynamic response to complex scenarios was obtained, and the accuracy of the model was experimentally evaluated. Then, the capability of stiffness modulation of S-CCRs was studied. Tendon-driven S-CCRs are potentially capable of changing the stiffness with structural configuration, providing active stiffness control at the design level. Hence, in this study, the effects of the connection point location/angle of the supportive arms to the operative arm, as well as the imposed tendon limitations of the supportive arm on the stiffness of the robot, and consequently on the dynamic payload manipulation, were studied and practical solutions were proposed to develop a simple but effective stiffness control mechanism. This study showed that a typical S-CCR can increase its stiffness, just by a modular connector design up to 84\% during manipulation, bringing a novel opportunity for stiffness modulation of CCRs.},

Accordingly, a new type of functionally graded adhesive is introduced, which is composed of an array of elastic micropillars at the base, a thin elastic intermediate layer and a viscoelastic top layer. A systematic investigation of this bioinspired graded adhesive structure was performed in comparison with three control adhesive materials: a viscoelastic film, a viscoelastic film coated on a soft elastomer, and elastic film-terminated micropillars. The results showed that this graded structure bestows remarkable adhesive properties in terms of pull-off force, work of adhesion, and structural integrity (i.e., inhibited cohesive failure). Moreover, an extraordinary compliance was observed, which is attributed to the polymer slippage at the top layer. Overall, we attribute the improved adhesive properties to the synergetic interplay of top viscous--elastic layers with the base biomimetic micropillars.},

  abstract = {Geckos can run rapidly on walls and ceilings, requiring high friction forces (on walls) and adhesion forces (on ceilings), with typical step intervals of {$\approx$}20 ms. The rapid switching between gecko foot attachment and detachment is analyzed theoretically based on a tape model that incorporates the adhesion and friction forces originating from the van der Waals forces between the submicron-sized spatulae and the substrate, which are controlled by the (macroscopic) actions of the gecko toes. The pulling force of a spatula along its shaft with an angle {\texttheta} between 0 and 90{$^\circ$} to the substrate, has a ``normal adhesion force'' contribution, produced at the spatula-substrate bifurcation zone, and a ``lateral friction force'' contribution from the part of spatula still in contact with the substrate. High net friction and adhesion forces on the whole gecko are obtained by rolling down and gripping the toes inward to realize small pulling angles {\texttheta} between the large number of spatulae in contact with the substrate. To detach, the high adhesion/friction is rapidly reduced to a very low value by rolling the toes upward and backward, which, mediated by the lever function of the setal shaft, peels the spatulae off perpendicularly from the substrates. By these mechanisms, both the adhesion and friction forces of geckos can be changed over three orders of magnitude, allowing for the swift attachment and detachment during gecko motion. The results have obvious implications for the fabrication of dry adhesives and robotic systems inspired by the gecko's locomotion mechanism.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Smooth adhesive pads are found among the arthropods, amphibians (particularly tree frogs), and in some mammals. They are used for dynamic adhesion when an animal is climbing steep or overhanging smooth surfaces. There is a need for strong attachment to avoid falling and easy detachment to enable the animal to move. This article describes the morphology and physical properties of smooth adhesive pads, stressing how there is little variation in structure, within tree frogs at least, even among pads that have evolved independently. This is clear evidence of an optimum design; best adhesion occurs when there is a continuous, thin film of fluid between the pad and the surface. Smooth adhesive pads adhere by wet adhesion, the main force component being capillarity, produced by the air/liquid interface (meniscus) around the edge of each pad. Smooth adhesive pads also produce substantial friction forces, probably because of actual contact between the pad surface and substrate (tree frogs) or non-Newtonian properties of the secreted fluid (insects). This is possible because the fluid layer beneath the pad has an average thickness of only a few nanometers. The article also discusses the scaling of adhesive force with size and, finally, implications for biomimetics.},

Strategies are divided according to how they take account of adhesion forces. Micromanipulation refers to handling of objects that have dimensions below hundreds of micrometers with handling accuracy down to submicrometers. The line between micro- and nanomanipulation is not definite but typically the object size in nanomanipulation is considered to reach from atomic and molecular scale to hundreds of nanometers. In contact micromanipulation, the tool physically touches the manipulated objects during handling. Scaling-effect-induced adhesion forces severely complicate micromanipulation when compared to conventional macromanipulation. At microscale, the most important adhesive forces are van der Waals force, electrostatic force, and capillary force. Adhesion forces are also the reason behind the fairly low level of automation in microassembly systems. Improved success rate of micromanipulation operations requires that the special features of microscale phenomena be taken into consideration.},

This review therefore presents a critical assessment of the common understanding in this rapidly developing research field. First, the effects of surface textures under the operative lubrication regimes in the Stribeck curve, with a clear distinction between conformal- and non-conformal contacts, will be discussed. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of various fabrication methods will be described, giving a summary of the fabrication methods with respect to their typical feature sizes, costs, and applicable materials. Special attention will be paid to the friction reducing mechanisms and their implications for the wear under different frictional regimes.},

The current study majorly focuses on the recent advancements in the tribological behavior of bioinspired surfaces and bio-inspired materials. The miniaturization of technological devices has increased the need to understand micro- and nano-scale tribological behavior, which could significantly reduce energy wastage and material degradation. Integrating advanced research methods is crucial in developing new aspects of structures and characteristics of biological materials. Depending upon the interaction of the species with the surrounding, the present study is divided into segments depicting the tribological behavior of the biological surfaces inspired by animals and plants. The mimicking of bio-inspired surfaces resulted in significant noise, friction, and drag reduction, promoting the development of anti-wear and anti-adhesion surfaces. Along with the reduction in friction through the bioinspired surface, a few studies providing evidence for the enhancement in the frictional properties were also depicted.},

  abstract = {Nature often exhibits various interesting and unique adhesive surfaces. The attempt to understand the natural adhesion phenomena can continuously guide the design of artificial adhesive surfaces by proposing simplified models of surface adhesion. Among those models, a peeling model can often effectively reflect the adhesive property between two surfaces during their attachment and detachment processes. In the context, this review summarizes the recent advances about the peeling model in understanding unique adhesive properties on natural and artificial surfaces. It mainly includes four parts: a brief introduction to natural surface adhesion, the theoretical basis and progress of the peeling model, application of the peeling model, and finally, conclusions. It is believed that this review is helpful to various fields, such as surface engineering, biomedicine, microelectronics, and so on.},

  abstract = {Soft materials that are subjected to large deformations exhibit an extremely rich phenomenology, with properties lying in between those of simple fluids and those of elastic solids. In the continuum description of these systems, one typically follows either the route of solid mechanics (Lagrangian description) or the route of fluid mechanics (Eulerian description). The purpose of this review is to highlight the relationship between the theories of viscoelasticity and of elasticity, and to leverage this connection in contemporary soft matter problems. We review the principles governing models for viscoelastic liquids, for example solutions of flexible polymers. Such materials are characterized by a relaxation time {$\lambda$}, over which stresses relax. We recall the kinematics and elastic response of large deformations, and show which polymer models do (and which do not) correspond to a nonlinear elastic solid in the limit {$\lambda$}\,{$\rightarrow$}\,{$\infty$}. With this insight, we split the work done by elastic stresses into reversible and dissipative parts, and establish the general form of the conservation law for the total energy. The elastic correspondence can offer an insightful tool for a broad class of problems; as an illustration, we show how the presence or absence of an elastic limit determines the fate of an elastic thread during capillary instability.},

  abstract = {We develop two new continuum contact models for coupled adhesion and friction, and discuss them in the context of existing models proposed in the literature. Our new models are able to describe sliding friction even under tensile normal forces, which seems reasonable for certain adhesion mechanisms. In contrast, existing continuum models for combined adhesion and friction typically include sliding friction only if local contact stresses are compressive. Although such models work well for structures with sufficiently strong local compression, they fail to capture sliding friction for soft and compliant systems (like adhesive pads), for which the resistance to bending is low. This can be overcome with our new models. For further motivation, we additionally present experimental results for the onset of sliding of a smooth glass plate on a smooth elastomer cap under low normal loads. As shown, the findings from these experiments agree well with the results from our models. In this paper we focus on the motivation and derivation of our continuum contact models, and provide a corresponding literature survey. Their implementation in a nonlinear finite element framework as well as the algorithmic treatment of adhesion and friction will be discussed in future work.},

We first analyze in detail the behavior of friction at interfaces between macroscopic hard rough solids, whose main dynamical features are well described by the Rice--Ruina rate and state-dependent constitutive law. We show that it results from two combined effects: (i) the threshold rheology of nanometer-thick junctions jammed under confinement into a soft glassy structure and (ii) the geometric aging, i.e. slow growth of the real area of contact via asperity creep interrupted by sliding. Closer analysis leads to identifying a second aging-rejuvenation process, at work within the junctions themselves. We compare the effects of structural aging at such multicontact, very highly confined, interfaces with those met under different confinement levels, namely boundary lubricated contacts and extended adhesive interfaces involving soft materials (hydrogels, elastomers). This leads us to propose a classification of frictional junctions in terms of the relative importance of jamming and adsorption-induced metastability.},

  abstract = {For biologically inspired dry adhesives, the fibrillar structure of the surface requires sufficient flexibility to form contacts and meanwhile high rigidity to maintain stability. This fundamental conflict has greatly hindered the advance of synthetic adhesives toward mass-scale and practical applications, where adhesion is desired to be simultaneously strong, durable, directional, and roughness-adaptive. In this work, we overcome such a long-term challenge by developing fibrillar structures that combine both slanted geometry and gradient material of micropillars. The termed slanted functional gradient pillars (s-FGPs), fabricated by a magnetically assisted mold replication technique, exhibit flexible tips for contacts, gradually stiffened stalks for reinforcement, slanted structure to give rise to anisotropy, and high aspect ratio (AR) to facilitate surface adaptation. We demonstrate that the material and structure of the s-FGPs complement each other, synergetic effects of which result in a multifunctional combination of adhesion properties including high strength ({$\sim$}9 N/cm2 in shear), ultradurability (over 200 cycles of attachment/detachment without adhesion degradation), super anisotropy (anisotropic ratio of {$\sim$}7), and good adaptability to rough surfaces. The s-FGPs not only step forward the bioinspired adhesion toward optimized designs and performances for practical applications but may also open up other concepts for various high-AR and structurally stable fibrillar surfaces with emerging functionalities and applications in the fields of self-cleaning, superhydrophobicity, biosensors, energy harvesting, etc.},

However, such adhesives are usually monofunctional and cannot yield real-time detection on the adhesion status, which is important for both biological systems (e.g., Gecko) and engineered mimics. This study reports a new hierarchical structure with the monolithic integration of adhesion and sensing functions, namely, contact-sensible adhesive (CSA). The proposed CSA is composed of mushroom-shaped microstructures on the top layer for providing strong adhesion, and a pillar array sandwiched by a pair of foil electrodes on the bottom layer as a compliant backing and a capacitive sensor. The CSA is not only sensitive to the external pressure, tension, and shear loads, but also shows enhanced adhesion on uneven surfaces, due to the high compliance of the hierarchical system. As a proof of concept, the as-prepared CSA is applied as a contact interface in a gripper to complete the grasping task.},

Combing the advantages of gecko seta and creeper root, a switchable fibrillar adhesive composed of polyurethane (PU) as the backing layer and graphene/shape memory polymer (GSMP) as the pillar array is developed. The photothermal effect of graphene (under UV irradiation) changes GSMP micropillars into the viscoelastic state, allowing easy and intimate contact on surfaces with a wide range of roughness. By controlling the phase state of GSMP via UV irradiation during detachment, the GSMP micropillar array can be switched between the robust-adhesion state (UV off) and low-adhesion state (UV on). The state of GSMP micropillars determines the adhesion force capacity and the stress distribution at the detaching interface, and therefore the adhesion performance. The PU-GSMP adhesive achieves large adhesion strength (278 kPa), high switching ratio (29), and fast switching (10 s) at the same time. The results suggest a design principle for bioinspired structured adhesives, especially for reversible adhesion on surfaces with a wide range of roughness.},

In practice, geckos' capability of walking upside down on both flat and nonflat surfaces comes from the combined action of adhesive structures for passive adhesion and toe muscles for stiffness modulation. Inspired by this behavior, this study proposes a hierarchal adhesive structure for high and switchable adhesion on nonflat surfaces. The three-layer adhesive consists of a mushroom-shaped structure top layer, stiffness modulation thermoplastic polyurethane (middle layer), and an electrothermal film (bottom layer) that mimics the epidermal adhesive structures, toe muscles, and electromyographic signals, respectively. Through the tunable structural stiffness controlled by adjusting the voltage, the adhesive force can be increased by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude compared to the conventional adhesive structures and further used for attachment and detachment functions. The gecko-inspired soft gripper is successfully tested as a pick-up and drop-down system for transporting a surface with different features, which has great application potential in industrial lines and daily life.},

  abstract = {Smart adhesives with the ability to rapidly switch, achieve high adhesion tuning ratios, and provide precise control hold tremendous potential in various fields ranging from micromanipulation to manufacturing. Despite significant progress, an efficient and robust adhesive switch remains a rarity. In this study, a design strategy for magnetically actuated adhesives that exhibit switchable adhesion between high and low levels exceeding 50 times is proposed. The non-contact actuation of the magnetic field induces a pre-designed deformation of the magnetic tentacles, resulting in both interface cracks at the adhesion interface and a push force on the target object. Consequently, the pull-off force can be precisely adjusted according to the strength of the magnetic field. This proposed adhesive also exhibits ultrafast detachment ({$<$}1.0 s). Tentative experiments are conducted for transfer-print technology and on-demand detachment, which demonstrate the advantages of magnetically actuated adhesives in a non-contact manner. The proposed strategy of switching adhesion may be particularly useful for practical applications that require highly precise and swiftly controlled movements.},

To their credit, tissue adhesives have made an indelible impact on almost all wound-related surgeries. Their unique properties include minimal damage to tissues, low chance of infection, ease of use and short wound-closure time. In contrast, classic closures, like suturing and stapling, exhibit potential additional complications with long operation times and undesirable inflammatory responses. Although tremendous progress has been made in the development of tissue adhesives, they are not yet ideal. Therefore, highlighting and summarizing existing adhesive designs and synthesis, and comparing the different products will contribute to future development. This review first provides a summary of current commercial traditional tissue adhesives. Then, based on adhesion interaction mechanisms, the tissue adhesives are categorized into three main types: adhesive patches that bind molecularly with tissue, tissue-stitching adhesives based on pre-polymer or precursor solutions, and bioinspired or biomimetic tissue adhesives. Their specific adhesion mechanisms, properties and related applications are discussed. The adhesion mechanisms of commercial traditional adhesives as well as their limitations and shortcomings are also reviewed. Finally, we also discuss the future perspectives of tissue adhesives.},

These adhesives, mostly of monolithic construction, perform on par with their natural analogues on smooth surfaces but exhibit far inferior adhesive performance on rough surfaces. In this paper, we report on the adhesive performance of functionally graded microfibrillar adhesives based on a microfibre with a divergent end and a thin soft distal layer on rough surfaces. Monolithic and functionally graded fibre arrays were fabricated from polyurethanes and their adhesive performance on surfaces of varying roughness were quantified from force--distance data obtained using a custom adhesion measurement system. Average pull-off stress declined significantly with increasing roughness for the monolithic fibre array, dropping from 77\,kPa on the smoothest (54\,nm RMS roughness) to 19\,kPa on the roughest (408\,nm RMS roughness) testing surface. In comparison, pull-off stresses of 81\,kPa and 63\,kPa were obtained on the same respective smooth and rough surfaces with a functionally graded fibre array, which represents a more than threefold increase in adhesion to the roughest adhering surface. These results show that functionally graded fibrillar adhesives perform similar on all the testing surfaces unlike monolithic arrays and show potential as repeatable and reusable rough surface adhesives.},

  abstract = {In the early twenty-first century, extensive research has been conducted on geckos' ability to climb vertical walls with the advancement of microscopy technology. Unprecedented studies and developments have focused on the adhesion mechanism, structural design, preparation methods, and applications of bioinspired dry adhesives. Notably, strong adhesion that adheres to both the principles of contact splitting and stress uniform distribution has been discovered and proposed. The increasing popularity of flexible electronic skins, soft crawling robots, and smart assembly systems has made switchable adhesion properties essential for smart adhesives. These adhesives are designed to be programmable and switchable in response to external stimuli such as magnetic fields, thermal changes, electrical signals, light exposure as well as mechanical processes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the development history of bioinspired dry adhesives from achieving strong adhesion to realizing switchable adhesion.},

  abstract = {The touching of fibrillar surfaces elicits a broad range of affective reactions, which range from the adverse stinginess of a stiff bristle brush to the pleasant feel of velvet. To study the tactile perception of model fibrillar surfaces, a unique set of samples carrying dense, regular arrays of cylindrical microfibrils with high aspect ratio made from different elastomer materials have been created. Fibril length and material compliance are varied independently such that their respective influence on tactile perception can be elucidated. This work finds that the tactile perception of similarity between samples is dominated by bending of the fibrils under sliding touch. The results demonstrate that variations of material stiffness and of surface structure are not necessarily perceived independently by touch. In the case of fibrillar elastomer surfaces, it is rather the ratio of fibril length and storage modulus which determines fibril bending and becomes the dominant tactile dimension. Visual access to the sample during tactile exploration improves the tactile perception of fibril bendability. Experiments with colored samples show a distraction by color in participants' decisions regarding tactile similarity only for yellow samples of outstanding brightness.},

  abstract = {Enhanced adhesion on rough surfaces is highly desired for a wide range of applications. On the other hand, surface roughness compatibility and structure stability are two critical but competing factors for biologically-inspired dry adhesives in the real world. Inspired by ladybug, a hierarchical structural composite dry adhesive (denoted as PP-M) with enhanced robustness on surface roughness is developed, which is composed of a thin compliant contact layer (a thin soft PDMS film supported discretely by PDMS micropillars) and a rigid bottom layer (MREs). The PP-M shows a high pull-off strength of 8.2 N/cm2 on a smooth surface and nano-scale rough surface at a mild preload (2 N/cm2). For micro-scale rough surfaces, the PP-M exhibits better surface adaptability compared to the double-layered adhesive (PDMS on MRE) without micropillar support. The increased compliance of the contact layer also leads to a 2.11-fold superior pull-off strength at a wider range of roughness (Sq{$>$} 2.23{$\mu$}m). Element Analysis confirms PP-M's enhanced adaptability, attributed to deeper indentation and lower contact stress. This hierarchical composite structure in PP-M, characterized by a "soft on top and hard on bottom" stiffness distribution, synergizes the flexible contact layer with the stiff MRE bottom layer, leading to superior bonding properties. The results provide a new reference for achieving enhanced adhesion on rough surfaces.},

The present model aims to bridge the limiting cases of very rigid fibrils and extremely soft fibrils.

With the existence of surface tension, we reconsider the optimal shape of the fiber, critical condition for spontaneous adhesion, saturation of adhesion strength and flaw-tolerant capability. The results indicate that the critical fiber radius for spontaneous adhesion and threshold value for crack size can be significantly enhanced due to surface tension. Meanwhile, the adhesion strength can approach the maximum value faster with fiber radius decreasing ascribed to surface tension, compared with the situation with the absence of surface tension.

  abstract = {The adhesive systems of climbing animals have served as inspiration for a new class of temporary adhesive utilizing surface microstructure in place of intrinsically soft and viscoelastic materials. These have the potential to address requirements for robust, releasable, and reusable bonding. Efforts to characterize synthetic dry adhesives, as well as to scale adhesive patches to large areas while maintaining performance, necessitate consideration of features of the system across length scales. This work addresses two topics which require that the behavior of individual microfibrils be accounted for explicitly within large-scale loading configurations. Under ideal conditions the strength of fibril arrays is known to be controlled by an array edge load concentration associated with compliance of the backing layer. Laboratory experiments have revealed that the strength is sensitive to the alignment of the adhesive and substrate surfaces, however no systematic investigation of the response to these perturbations in the loading configuration has been performed. A contact mechanics model is developed, considering the role of backing layer compliance in addition to misalignment. A monotonic decay in the adhesive strength of the array with increasing misalignment angle is confirmed. More interestingly, regimes of dominance of backing layer compliance and misalignment in control of the adhesive strength are revealed. Where circumferential detachment gives way to peel-like detachment, compliance of the backing layer is found to be beneficial to performance. This is the result of shielding of the peel-front load concentration by backing layer deformation. Subsequent experimental characterization of a mushroom-tipped synthetic fibril array shows that this regime is dominant for misalignment angles of just {\textasciitilde} 0.2{$^\circ$} over a patch size of 2 mm. These results can be utilized to anticipate the performance of fibrillar adhesive patches on flat surfaces without precise control of alignment, or of sub-arrays within a larger hierarchy where surface undulations may lead to local misalignment. While the potential importance of the variability in fibril adhesive strength in controlling the performance of microstructure arrays has been highlighted in past work, there has been no effort to systematically characterize the strength distribution or understand its effect on performance further. The capabilities of an experimental platform with in-situ contact visualization are leveraged to provide strength data on a fibril-by-fibril basis. A framework is developed, based upon the statistical theory of fracture, allowing for the decoupling of two defect populations and assessment of the impact of fabrication imperfections on performance. A subsequent theoretical investigation is performed with a view to understanding the combined effect of variability in fibril adhesive strength and load concentrations at the array scale. It is shown that, dependent on the severity of the load concentration, increased variability in fibril adhesive strength can modulate the influence of load concentrations and lead to independence of the adhesive strength of the array from properties such as backing layer compliance or substrate curvature. This is highly significant, given that the severity of load concentrations is a key factor in designing hierarchical structures for adhesive strength.},

  abstract = {The gecko has inspired numerous synthetic adhesive structures, yet under shear loading conditions, general design criteria remains underdeveloped. To provide guidance for bio-inspired adhesives under shear, a simple scaling theory is used to investigate the relevant geometric and material parameters. The total compliance of an elastic attachment feature is described over many orders of magnitude in aspect ratio through a single continuous function using the superposition of multiple deformation modes such as bending, shear deformation, and tensile elongation. This allows for force capacity predictions of common geometric control parameters such as thickness, aspect ratio, and contact area. This superposition principal is extended to develop criteria for patterned interfaces under shear loading. Importantly, the adhesive patterns under shear are controlled through the compliance in the direction of loading. These predictions are confirmed experimentally using macroscopic building blocks over an extensive range of aspect ratio and contact area. Over 25 simple and complex patterns with various contact geometries are examined, and the effect of geometry and material properties on the shear adhesion behavior is discussed. Furthermore, all of these various attachment features are described with a single scaling parameter, offering control over orders of magnitude in adhesive force capacity for a variety of applications.},

However, robust and switchable adhesion on rough surfaces with on-demand attachment and detachment remains highly challenging.

TRH is composed of a polymeric hydrogel and saturated sodium acetate (NaAc) and is prepared by one-pot synthesis. At room temperature, TRH remains in an amorphous and soft state, which allows it to conformally adapt to rough surfaces. The contact with the target surface triggers the crystallization of NaAc, which increases the modulus of TRH by an order of magnitude and interlocks with the target surfaces, achieving an adhesion of up to 204.84 {\textpm} 53.98 kPa. Upon heating, TRH returns to a soft state, facilitating easy detachment with adhesion of 5.12 {\textpm} 1.34 kPa. Meanwhile, the detached TRH is ready for the next adhesion without the need to be maintained at high temperature. TRH finds applications as a smart material for light-triggered adhesion switching, information encryption, and temperature sensors.},

  abstract = {The hook-loop like adhesion is a common phenomenon in nature, widely used in our daily life with robust adhesion ability, i.e. the Velcro on our clothes. In general, the hook-loop adhesion can be divided into two stages, i.e., the loop hooked up and pull-out stages. At present, the intrinsic factors that affect the hook-loop adhesion are still unknown, and quantitative models describing the two stages are still lacked. Herein, these issues are rationalized through combining experiments, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations. The theoretical models for fibrous loops hooked on single hook and pull-out of one loop on curved hook are developed. Furthermore, the loop hooked up stage is further simulated by introducing a spring-sandwich element to describe the resilience and compaction effects of fibrous loops. The results show good agreements among theoretical predictions, numerical simulations, and experiments. It is shown that the number of hooked loops is mainly determined by the length of hook-arm and hook angle, friction coefficient, and expulsion displacement of fibrous loops. While, the pull-out force of single loop on hook mainly depends on the bending stiffness, hook arc angle and arc length. Combining with hooked loop number and pull-out force, a general algorithm is proposed to optimize the adhesion property of Velcro, by considering the parameters of hook interspace, hook arc angle and arc length. The results presented in this work not only explore the adhesion mechanism of hook-loop adhesion, but also provide quantitative models to predict its adhesion behaviors, which may offer a rational design strategy for high-performance hook-loop adhesive.},

In many applications, directional adhesion is desired where interface separation along different directions requires different fracture energy. In this work, we numerically investigate a strategy to attain enhanced and directional adhesion using an interface that contains asymmetric complementary patterns. Finite element analyses were performed to calculate the energy release rate at different crack lengths on the patterned interface, and the results were compared to those for a flat control. Our results show that the adhesion is stronger on the patterned interface and the adhesion enhancement is greater along one direction than the other, suggesting directional adhesion. Different degrees of directional adhesion can be achieved by modulating the aspect ratio of the pattern on the interface without modifying surface chemistry, which bears great potential in applications where different levels of adhesion and directional adhesion are desired for different purposes.},

The shear lag model identifies a length, called the shear lag length Ls. The energy release rate of a debond crack is affected by the elasticity of both the adhesive and adherends. Their relative importance is characterized by the ratio of the length of the remaining joint, L, to the shear lag length, Ls. In the short-joint limit, L/Ls{$\rightarrow$}0, the adherends do not deform, and the elasticity of the adhesive gives the energy release rate. In the long-joint limit, L/Ls{$\rightarrow\infty$}, the interior of the adhesive does not deform, and the elasticity of the adherends gives the energy release rate. The shear lag model gives an approximate expression of the energy release rate for all values of L/Ls.

Fibrils had two different tip shapes of end-flaps and round edges. A preload-induced mechanical buckling instability of the fibrils was used to switch between the states of adhesion and non-adhesion. Non-adhesion in fibrils with round edges was reached at preloads that caused fibril buckling, whereas fibrils with end-flaps showed adhesion loss only at very high preloads. The round edge acted as a circumferential flaw prohibiting smooth tip contact recovery leading to an adhesion loss. In situ observations showed that, after reversal of buckling, the end-flaps unfold and re-form contact under prevailing compressive stress, retaining adhesion in spite of buckling. At very high preloads, however, end-flaps are unable to re-form contact resulting in adhesion loss. Additionally, the end-flaps showed varying contact adaptability as a function of the fibril--probe alignment, which further affects the preload for adhesion loss. The combined influence of preload, tip shape and alignment on adhesion can be used to switch adhesion in bioinspired fibrillar arrays.},

  abstract = {The ability to climb with adhesive pads conveys significant advantages and is widespread in the animal kingdom. The physics of adhesion predict that attachment is more challenging for large animals, whereas detachment is harder for small animals, due to the difference in surface-to-volume ratios. Here, we use stick insects to show that this problem is solved at both ends of the scale by linking adhesion to the applied shear force. Adhesive forces of individual insect pads, measured with perpendicular pull-offs, increased approximately in proportion to a linear pad dimension across instars. In sharp contrast, whole-body force measurements suggested area scaling of adhesion. This discrepancy is explained by the presence of shear forces during whole-body measurements, as confirmed in experiments with pads sheared prior to detachment. When we applied shear forces proportional to either pad area or body weight, pad adhesion also scaled approximately with area or mass, respectively, providing a mechanism that can compensate for the size-related loss of adhesive performance predicted by isometry. We demonstrate that the adhesion-enhancing effect of shear forces is linked to pad sliding, which increased the maximum adhesive force per area sustainable by the pads. As shear forces in natural conditions are expected to scale with mass, sliding is more frequent and extensive in large animals, thus ensuring that large animals can attach safely, while small animals can still detach their pads effortlessly. Our results therefore help to explain how nature's climbers maintain a dynamic attachment performance across seven orders of magnitude in body weight.},

  abstract = {Dynamically tunable interfacial dry adhesion plays a significant role in numerous biological functions and industrial applications. Among various strategies, pneumatics-activated adhesive devices draw much attention due to their distinct advantages such as fast speed, reliable performance, large adhesion tunability and easily accessible materials. To understand and predict adhesion strength of pneumatics-activated adhesives, it is necessary to examine their interfacial mechanics that is nonlinearly coupled with the large deformation of the devices under pressure. However, previous studies have only focused on axisymmetric cases in which the outline of the contact area is circular, whereas the tunable adherence of non-circular contact controlled by pneumatics remains elusive. In this work, through a combination of experiments and simulations, we study the effect of non-circular contact geometry on tunable dry adhesion of pressure-activated soft hollow pillars. Specifically, elliptical, square, and rectangular contact shapes are considered and their effects on tunable adhesion of the soft hollow pillars are compared to that of circular contact geometry thoroughly. The results show that soft hollow pillars with elliptical, square, and rectangular contact surfaces demonstrate rich interfacial delamination behaviors that depend on the contact outline geometry and internal pressure. Among all contact geometries, elliptical contact has the highest adhesion tunability yet requires lowest activating pressure owing to the non-uniform curvature distribution of the contact outline. However, when the eccentricity increases, the elliptical contact has reduced tunability of adhesion caused by the contact of opposing sides of the sidewall upon buckling. For square and rectangular contacts, they have the lowest adhesion tunability and need higher activating pressure than those of circular and elliptical contact since the 90-degree edges of the sidewall prohibit buckling instability. Our findings greatly broaden the design space of pneumatics-activated adhesive devices by adding the contact geometry of the soft hollow pillars as a new design parameter, which can provide valuable guidance for tunable adhesive design for various applications in manufacturing and robotics.},

However, modelling of adhesion, such as in single or multiple peeling theories, has in most cases been limited to ideal cases, and due consideration of the role of substrate geometry and mechanical properties has been limited. In this paper, we propose a numerical model to evaluate these effects, including substrate roughness, patterning, curvature, and deformability. The approach is validated by comparing its predictions with classical thin film peeling theoretical results, and is then used to predict the effects of substrate properties. These results can provide deeper insight into experiments, and the developed model can be a useful tool to design and optimize artificial adhesives with tailor-made characteristics.},

Inspired by the gecko's adhesive switching, a method of mechanically switching between low and high adhesive states is reported. In particular, the first switching of an adhesive system using only a change in system compliance is demonstrated. Mechanical clamping and a novel magnetic clamping system are used to switch an iron/PDMS composite adhesive between a soft and rigid state. The switch in compliance directly influences the maximum load of the adhesive as measured in lap-shear. Notably, contact area and the contact chemistry remain unaltered despite significant changes in force capacity. The demonstration of a compliance-only switching mechanism has broad implications for understanding natural adhesive systems---especially in organisms that can dynamically alter their rigidity (e.g. cells). {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, switchable adhesives often display a binary response (on or off) with a narrow adhesion range, lack post-fabrication adhesion tunability, or switch slowly due to diffusion-controlled processes. Here, pneumatically controlled shape and rigidity tuning is coupled to rapidly switch adhesion ({$\approx$}0.1 s) across a wide range of programmable adhesion forces with measured switching ratios as high as 1300x. The switchable adhesion system introduces an active polydimethylsiloxane membrane supported on a compliant, foam foundation with pressure-tunable rigidity where positive and negative pneumatic pressure synergistically control contact stiffness and geometry to activate and release adhesion. Energy-based modeling and finite element computation demonstrate that high adhesion is achieved through a pressure-dependent, nonlinear stiffness of the foundation, while an inflated shape at positive pressures enables easy release. This approach enables adhesion-based gripping and material assembly, which is utilized to pick-and-release common objects, rough and porous materials, and arrays of elements with a greater than 14 000x range in mass. The robust assembly of diverse components (rigid, soft, flexible) is then demonstrated to create a soft and stretchable electronic device.},

We carried out adhesion tests on both complementary and mismatched microchannel/micropillar surfaces. Adhesion, as measured by the energy release rate required to propagate an interfacial crack, can be enhanced by up to 40 times by complementary interfaces, compared to a flat control, and slightly enhanced for some special noncomplementary samples, despite the nearly negligible adhesion for other mismatched surfaces. For each complementary surface, we observe defects in the form of visible striations, where pillars fail to insert fully into the channels. The adhesion between complementary microchannel surfaces is enhanced by a combination of a crack-trapping mechanism and friction between a pillar and channel and is attenuated by the presence of defects.},

The DSAs, constructed by dual-angled (i.e. angled base and angled tip) micro-pillars on both sides of the backplane substrate, are fabricated by combinations of angled etching, mould replication, tip modification, and curing bonding. Two types of DSA, symmetric and antisymmetric (i.e. pillars are patterned symmetrically or antisymmetrically relative to the backplane), are fabricated and studied in comparison with the single-sided adhesive (SSA) counterparts through both non-conformal and conformal tests. Results indicate that the DSAs show controllable and bidirectional adhesion. Combination of the two pillar-layers can either amplify (for the antisymmetric DSA, providing a remarkable and durable adhesion capacity of 25.8 {\textpm} 2.8 N cm-2 and a high anisotropy ratio of {$\sim$}8) or counteract (for the symmetric DSA, generating almost isotropic adhesion) the adhesion capacity and anisotropic level of one SSA (capacity of 16.2 {\textpm} 1.7 N cm-2 and anisotropy ratio of {$\sim$}6). We demonstrate that these two DSAs can be utilized as a facile fastener for two individual objects and a small-scale delivery setup, respectively, complementing the functionality of the commonly studied SSA. As such, the double-sided patterning is believed to be a new branch in the further development of biomimetic dry adhesives.},

The frictional force of the fibrillar array fabricated with Fe3O4/PDMS composite decreases initially, then increases as the particle content increases. For silica/PDMS composite pillars, the frictional force is independent of the particle density. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy shows that Fe3O4 particles are distributed uniformly in the PDMS matrix at low concentration, but heterogeneous distribution is observed at high particle loading, with particles being hindered from penetrating into the pillars. For silica/PDMS composite pillars, the particles distribute homogeneously inside the pillars, which is attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding between silica particles and PDMS. The difference in particle distribution behavior is used to explain the observed difference in the friction response of these two composite systems.},

Biomimetic materials design brings numerous benefits, especially the possibility of implementing promising interdisciplinary projects based on effective existing solutions that have emerged in the course of natural evolution. A major aspect of biomimetic materials design, especially relevant to protective gloves, is the identification of an optimum combination of the physicochemical properties and microstructural characteristics of a surface with a view to its potential applications. Properties such as wetting and adhesion can be adjusted by modifications of the surface morphology both on micro- and nanoscales. From the standpoint of the occupational safety performance of polymeric protective gloves, biomimetic materials should exhibit two crucial properties: reversible adhesion (via a large number of contact points) and hydrophobicity (water repellence). This review analyzes the superhydrophobic and reversible adhesion patterns found in nature that can be used to improve the properties of polymeric protective gloves with major commercial implications.},

As a property, one expects adhesion to be represented by an energy per unit area that is usually sensitive to the combination of shear and normal stresses at the crack front but is otherwise dependent only on the two elastic materials that meet at the interface. More specifically, one would expect that adhesion measured by indentation (a popular and convenient technique) could be used to predict adhesion hysteresis in the more practically important rolling geometry. Previously, a structure with a film-terminated fibrillar geometry exhibited dramatic enhancement of adhesion by a crack-trapping mechanism during indentation with a rigid sphere. Roughly isotropic structures such as the fibrillar geometry show a strong correlation between adhesion enhancement in indentation versus adhesion hysteresis in rolling. However, anisotropic structures, such as a film-terminated ridge-channel geometry, surprisingly show a dramatic divergence between adhesion measured by indentation versus rolling. We study this experimentally and theoretically, first comparing the adhesion of the anisotropic ridge-channel structure to the roughly isotropic fibrillar structure during indentation with a rigid sphere, where only the isotropic structure shows adhesion enhancement. Second, we examine in more detail the anomalous anisotropic film-terminated ridge-channel structure during indentation with a rigid sphere versus rolling to show why these structures show a dramatic adhesion enhancement for the rolling case and no adhesion enhancement for indentation.},

The device was validated using an experimental setup involving a rigid, nominally smooth acrylic cylinder rolling against a flat polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, the results of which matched favorably with accepted contact mechanics theories. The second test involved an indenter with a rigid core and thin (3 mm) smooth shell of a highly deformable polyvinyl chloride rolling on the same PDMS substrate. This test deviated significantly from analytical predictions, highlighting the effects of finite-thickness and rate-dependent phenomena. This device will facilitate experimental investigations of the rolling contact mechanics between textured surfaces and soft tissue-like materials, which is an important fundamental problem in medical robotics.},

  abstract = {Grasping analysis is concerned with relating the characteristics of the grasped object to the requirements of the gripper structure. When a gripper presses a flexible specimen with a size larger than that of the gripping surface, complex deformations are produced (compression, shearing, bending and tension). The boundary conditions are complex too because of the changing compressed region and, for many grippers, a changeable contact area. In this paper a mathematical predictive model is presented for simulating these complex deformations, relating a flat gripper's performance to the properties of flexible gripped materials using elasticity theory. In particular, the distributions of stress and strain within the materials are derived when the gripper presses them. The main variables in the picking-up action have been identified. Moreover, a contact solution has been derived for calculating the contact length between a sample and a rigid support table. The change in the compressed region within a sample as a function of external load has been calculated. In order to match experimental behaviour the non-linear elastic response of the flexible material and the large deformations have to be incorporated in the model. The model predictions have been tested against experimental data and the results of finite element analysis and reasonably good agreement has been obtained.},

  abstract = {Gripping is an everyday task which is taken for granted by many. The current paper examines extant knowledge of howobjects are gripped for manipulation, and the relationship, the coefficient of friction, between finger and object, has on various grip parameters. It is found that friction is an essential part of the feedback and feedforward control system for grip. The friction of the finger-object contact can be measured in several different ways, using methods of either a probe moving on a finger or a finger moving on a flat surface. These friction measurements can then be used to gain information about the effect of normal force, sliding speed, contact area, and level of moisture present. They also can provide information about the changes between test subjects, for example, the effects of age, gender, and race. Knowing the effect of these parameters can help to improve the manoeuvrability of everyday items through inclusive design; designing products to be used by the whole population regardless of age or ability. The current paper also suggests areas of further investigation so that knowledge of skin friction can be expanded and applied to a larger range of materials and applications.},

  abstract = {Flexible surface textures are often utilized in the design of robots that need to manipulate objects requiring a strong frictional force. In this study, we designed and prepared flexible silicone rubber films with surface textures inspired by groove patterns found at the tips of human fingers. These designs included loop, whorl, and arch patterns, as well as horizontal and vertical stripe textures as a control group. On the basis of surface morphology analysis, we established a relative sliding test platform to collect coefficient of friction (COF) through relative sliding tests of soft surface textures and rigid plane contact pairs. The friction coefficient guides the characterization of the contact properties in the finite element simulation process. According to the results of friction testing, the loop, whorl, and horizontal stripe exhibit a higher friction coefficient under variable contact stress, while the arch and vertical stripe display a lower coefficient. The variation patterns of the contact surfaces between a rigid surface and five distinct types of soft surface textures were analyzed by simulating the friction process using Abaqus explicit dynamic analysis. The deformation of the soft surface textures under different contact stresses is subsequently described in terms of elastic strain energy. Compared to the vertical stripe texture, loop, whorl, and arch exhibit greater recoverable strain energy during the relative sliding stage, which means a larger average elastic displacement. Subsequently, different soft surface textures are integrated onto the fingertip of a soft robotic hand, and the grasping ability is evaluated within lubrication-related medical scenarios. The texture perpendicular to the movement direction exhibits a higher friction-producing capability compared to the texture aligned parallel to it. Due to the intricate surface texture patterns, it demonstrates greater adaptability for relative motion in all directions. This research proposes a soft robotic hand incorporating a surface texture resembling fingerprint-like surface texture. By employing experimentation and finite element simulation, this study utilizes surface engineering design to comprehend the contact characteristics involved in the grasping process of a soft robotic hand.},

This study builds upon these results by using a previously investigated sawtooth structure as a model surface on a legged robot to systematically examine the influences of different material and surface properties on the resulting friction coefficients and the walking behavior of the robot. By employing different surfaces and by varying the stiffness and orientation of the anisotropic structures, we conclude that with having prior knowledge about the walking environment in combination with the tribological properties of these structures, we can greatly improve the robot's locomotion efficiency.},

The aim is to explore the potential of these materials in creating versatile and adaptive skin structures for both, hard and soft robotics applications. These soft skins were used to cover a snake--arm robot conformed by compliant vertebrae and controlled with cables. The impact of the soft elastomeric skins on the mobility of the snake-arm robot during planar bending motion was assessed by measuring the bending angle and monitoring the current consumption of the motors. These measurements aimed to evaluate how the presence of the elastomeric skins affected the robot's flexibility and energy efficiency. It was found that not only the presence or absence of a kirigami pattern changes the effect of the skin over the robot, but also its weight. These results open the path to the development of a waterproof skin for a snake-like aquatic robot in future work.},

This gripper is driven by seven actuators and capable of grasping a wide range of objects in different working scenarios. A combination of a four-bar mechanism and parallelograms ensures that each finger can provide the basic pinch grasp and power grasp. Detailed fingertip grasping force analysis shows the large payload of this gripper. To fulfill multiple challenging grasping tasks, the fingertip orientation of each finger was designed to be decoupled from the finger flexion motion. Particular emphasis is placed on the environmental contact-based grasp and active transition from the pinch grasp to the power grasp. Detailed analysis shows that the contact-based fingertip grasp could be used to grasp thin objects lying on a flat surface with widths less than 168 mm safely and stably. To prevent over-squeezing of the grasped object in the active transition, the fingertip orientation and finger flexion motion were controlled coordinately. Moreover, a combination of the contact-based grasp and the direct power grasp was also allowed to grasp objects lying on a flat surface and having smooth surfaces robustly. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed gripper in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Most geckos can rapidly attach and detach from almost any kind of surface. This ability is attributed to the hierarchical structure of their feet (involving toe pads, setal arrays, and spatulae), and how they are moved (articulated) to generate strong adhesion and friction forces on gripping that rapidly relax on releasing. Inspired by the gecko's bioadhesive system, various structured surfaces have been fabricated suitable for robotic applications. In this study, x--y--z asymmetric, micrometer-sized rectangular flaps composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were fabricated using massively parallel micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) techniques with the intention of creating directionally responsive, high-to-low frictional-adhesion toe pads exhibiting properties similar to those found in geckos. Using a surface forces apparatus (SFA), the friction and adhesion forces of both vertical (symmetric) and angled/tilted (x--y--z asymmetric) microflaps under various loading, unloading and shearing conditIons were investigated. It was found that the anisotropic structure of tilted microflaps gives very different adhesion and tribological forces when articulated along different x--y--z directions: high friction and adhesion forces when articulated in the y--z plane along the tilt (+y) direction, which is also the direction of motion, and weak friction and adhesion forces when articulated against the tilt (--y) direction. These results demonstrate that asymmetric angled structures, as occur in geckos, are required to enable the gecko to optimize the requirements of high friction and adhesion on gripping, and low frictional-adhesion on releasing. These properties are intimately coupled to a (also optimum) articulation mechanism. We discuss how both of these features can be simultaneously optimized in the design of robotic systems that can mimic the gecko adhesive system.},

If the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the active flexor tendon and the route and stiffness of a passive extensor tendon in order to achieve this behavior. We show how the resulting gripper can also execute fingertip grasps for picking up small objects off a flat surface, using contact with the surface to its advantage through passive adaptation. Finally, we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common household objects.},

The multijointed closed-chain mechanism is employed to perform power, shape-adaptive grasping, and a multijointed double parallelogram mechanism is used to perform scooping, parallel, and pinch grasping. For stable shape-adaptive/power grasping, the proposed design allows more contact points between the object and the contact surface of fingers as compared to previous gripper mechanisms. Moreover, a complete mathematical model relating the contact forces at the links of each finger to the linear actuation force and spring torque is developed to conduct stability analysis of the proposed gripper design. Finally, simulations and several experiments are performed using real objects in a reconfigurable environment to demonstrate and validate the stable grasping capabilities of the proposed gripper.},

The proposed gripper can switch between large and small fingers via lengthening and shortening actions, which improves its ability to pick up objects with various sizes and weights, as well as in narrow workspaces. This function also enables the gripper to perform three-face grasping, wherein three faces of a grasped object are securely in contact with the gripper, thereby improving the robustness of grasping. The gripper can also perform in-hand manipulations using a stand. We analyze the grasping force of the three-face grasp and show that it is more robust against external forces that generate the moment about the normal of the finger surface than the traditional two-face grasp. Finally, we demonstrate the improved abilities of the developed gripper and the robustness of the three-face grasp through the experimental results. The possible applications of this gripper include tasks in which the sizes, weights, and arrangements of the objects are not optimized for robot hands.},

  abstract = {The robotic gripper is an essential component for handling, manipulating, and transporting objects. However, the parallel rigid gripper, which is one of the most widely used grippers in robotics, has limitations in handling fragile objects with a proper gripping force. We present a shape-adaptive universal soft gripper that can grip complex-shaped fragile objects with a high holding force. The shape-adaptive skin of the gripper has extremely low stiffness ({\textbackslash}sim46 kPa), even lower than that of tofu ({\textbackslash}sim57 kPa); hence, it can inherently prevent damage to the object. In addition, only the area pressed by the object is selectively deformed, so the contact surface of the gripper can be deformed to match the target object contour. A stiffness transition in the gripper from a soft to hard state follows to achieve effective holding of the object, not just weak object hanging as the previous soft gripper. These characteristics are enabled by a sheet-shaped shape retention layer, a honeycomb-shaped soft supporting layer, and a four-sided wall structure to increase shear modulus. We present applications to show the performance of the gripper, including gripping tofu, preparing a cocktail with a squeezed lemon, and whole chicken soup.},

  abstract = {We present an inflatable finger pad that allows regular parallel-jaw grippers to vary their grasp stiffness while maintaining a contact force and contact to non-planar surfaces. An eversible radial bellows structure made of silicone rubber allows the pad to extend to four times its original height and to retract into a rigid pod when not needed. The bellows act as passive universal joints when everted, enabling aerial contact with surfaces inclined by up to 45 degree. The bellow geometry is intentionally nonlinear but avoids bistable configurations to facilitate control. We find that the nonlinear stiffness behavior allows a pair of opposing pads to increase the compliance of a grasp twenty fold, resulting in a total of two orders of magnitude difference between the most stiff and most compliant configuration. Crucially, high compliance can be achieved while exerting a contact force between 0.7 N and 5 N, allowing for compliant but firm grasps. Pads are manufactured using printed molds and sacrificial-mold casting.},

  abstract = {Finger dexterity and tactile perception are key capabilities for humans to manipulate objects within hand, as well as robots. Inspired by the thumb-forefinger dexterous manipulative movement, we devised a novel robotic finger with an active rotational tactile sensor (i.e. TacRot), and mounted the finger on a parallel-jaw gripper. By processing the high-resolution images of the vision-based tactile sensor, we achieved depth reconstruction of the surface and localization of the contact area. To improve gripping flexibility and stability, we applied a self-adaptive grasping strategy with real-time contact detection feedback, which performed 94\% success rate in experiment. Based on the rotational actuator at the fingertip, we proposed two in-hand manipulation primitives: (1) pivot: fingertips co-rotating for object reorientation; (2) twist: fingertips contra-rotating for object spin. The primitives are theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified in two practical tasks: pivoting a paper cup under vertical constraints and twisting a screw with spin angle estimation. Our design and experiments demonstrate a feasible way to enhance the active tactile manipulation ability for common parallel-jaw grippers.},

  abstract = {Hand dexterity is tremendously valuable to robots for task-dependent manipulation and interacting with the world. In this work, we present a novel soft pneumatic dexterous hand, which demonstrates highly dexterous and versatile anthropomorphic properties. Inspired by human hand, the proposed hand possesses 21 degrees of freedoms (DOFs), is implemented in anthropomorphic fingers, soft parallel palm and the ability to spread the fingers with a modular design. The anthropomorphic fingers are designed in accordance with the joint distribution of the human fingers. By using a layered design, each independent actuator is divided into an actuating layer and a contact layer, which allows the grasping mode and the contact mode to be adjusted in real-time. To streamline the creation of the palm and improve the dexterity of the hand, the soft parallel palm is actuated by bellow actuators, designed by using the characteristics of a compact structure and stable movement of the parallel mechanism. Additionally, the bellow actuators are also used to realize the ability to spread the fingers and assist the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint bending of the thumb through the passive deformation of the flexible joint. Through series of experiments, we evaluate the hand by demonstrating its ability to achieve the highest possible score in the Kapandji test for thumb dexterity, to realize all 33 grasp types of the comprehensive GRASP taxonomy, and to interact with humans in the real world.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of a novel bioinspired rigid-soft hybrid robotic gripper with versatile grasping primitives and enhanced robustness. It achieves variable joint/tissue stiffness by resorting to hybrid ratchet joints and phalanges. For the first time, the proposed hybrid ratchet joint (HRJ) can selectively switch to four modes to generate tunable flexion/extension locking torque by activating specific clutching ratchets with soft-cell structures. The multi-layer hybrid phalanx can exert suction-lift grasp and adjustable contact stiffness, which are theoretically modeled and experimentally validated by mounting them on articulated fingers. With the proposed HRJs and hybrid phalanges, a tendon-based hybrid gripper is designed and fabricated to evaluate the grasping performance for universal picking and manipulation. Extensive grasping tests are conducted in six representative primitives (including suction-lift and suction-pinch), demonstrating the multi-mode grasping capability in extremely thin and wide objects. Compared with conventional gripper configurations, the proposed hybrid phalanges and HRJs improve the grasping force and enveloping stiffness by 205.1\% and 97.9\%, respectively. Note to Practitioners---For automated grasping of diverse objects, a bioinspired robotic gripper is proposed to enable adjustable compliant stiffness and suction-lift motion. With the same mobility as conventional tendon grippers, the reported hybrid gripper exhibits wide-range adjustable stiffness and demonstrates versatile adhesive primitives and enhanced robustness in grasping tasks. Experimental investigation is conducted to verify the tissue suction effect and stiffness modulation, demonstrating their contributions to grasping operations in terms of suction-augmented primitives and improved grasping stability. With the characteristics of HRJs and hybrid phalanges, the gripper actuation strategies are elaborated via six representative primitives, including parallel grasp, suction-lift, and newly defined suck-pinch. Extensive grasping trials are demonstrated to pick thin, large, and tiny objects (e.g., wide plates, toolboxes, and tweezers). The experimental results validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed hybrid gripper design by fusing intrinsic dexterity, manipulability, and compliance from rigid and soft mechanisms.},

  abstract = {A new approach for climbing hard vertical surfaces has been developed that allows a robot to scale concrete, stucco, brick and masonry walls without using suction or adhesives.The approach is inspired by the mechanisms observed in some climbing insects and spiders and involves arrays of microspines that catch on surface asperities. The arrays are located on the toes of the robot and consist of a tuned, multi-link compliant suspension. The fundamental issues of spine allometric scaling versus surface roughness are discussed and the interaction between spines and surfaces is modeled. The toe suspension properties needed to maximize the probability that each spine will find a useable surface irregularity and to distribute climbing loads among many spines are detailed. The principles are demonstrated with a new climbing robot, SpinybotII, that can scale a wide range of flat exterior walls, carry a payload equal to its own weight, and cling without consuming power. The paper also reports how toe parameters scale with robot mass and how spines have also been used successfully on the larger RiSE robot.},
