  abstract = {In the course of evolution nature has arrived at startling materials solutions to ensure survival. Investigations into biological surfaces, ranging from plants, insects and geckos to aquatic animals, have inspired the design of intricate surface patterns to create useful functionalities. This paper reviews the fundamental interaction mechanisms of such micropatterns with liquids, solids, and soft matter such as skin for control of wetting, self-cleaning, anti-fouling, adhesion, skin adherence, and sensing. Compared to conventional chemical strategies, the paradigm of micropatterning enables solutions with superior resource efficiency and sustainability. Associated applications range from water management and robotics to future health monitoring devices. We finally provide an overview of the relevant patterning methods as an appendix.},

  abstract = {Many areas of robotics, particularly locomotion and grasping, can benefit from the ability to modulate friction on surfaces that come into contact with objects in the environment. Previous research has tried to address the challenge of tunable friction; however, those efforts only provide modest gains or are difficult to integrate. We propose a tunable friction mechanism that relies on pneumatic actuation and is easily integrated into pre-existing soft actuators. We characterize the performance of our friction mechanism with quantitative force data for varying preload forces, substrate materials, and inflation pressures. Testing results show that our tunable friction mechanism achieves an order of magnitude differentiation in friction forces between high and low friction states. We demonstrate its potential application in a one degree-of-freedom soft crawler and a soft gripper with actuatable finger friction pads. The crawler successfully propelled itself forward by leveraging asymmetric strokes and the gripper achieved a factor of five differentiation of grip force between engaged and disengaged states of the friction tuning mechanism.},

Herein, we review recent progress on reversibility in other physicochemical properties which can also play important roles in the functionality of soft robots. We focus on the tunability of five key properties: electrical and thermal conductivities, surface wettability and adhesion, and optical properties. Materials and mechanisms are described, and performances are assessed, when possible, in terms of reversible tunability range, time response, cycling endurance, and power consumption. The potential integration of such solutions to soft robots is systematically discussed.},

A flexible gripper based on the use of compliant materials (i.e., rubber) with pneumatic inflation was designed, analyzed, built and tested. Parametric FE analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of process and design parameters, such as rubber material, pressure, initial jaw displacement and friction. Based on the FEA results, a simple, single rubber-pocketed flexible gripper was designed and built. Feasibility experiments were performed to demonstrate and obtain an overall understanding about the capability and limitations of the gripper. It was found that objects with different shapes (cylindrical, prismatic and complex), weight (50g--20kg.), and types (egg, steel hemi-spheres, wax cylinders, etc.) could be picked and placed without any loss of control of the object. The range of positioning error for two different part shapes (i.e., prismatic or cylindrical) was found to be 20--90{$\mu$}m (translational) and 0.03--0.9{$^\circ$} (rotational).},

These stimulus-responsive dry adhesives exhibit some unique capabilities, as their ability to adhere to and detach from surfaces can be controlled with the help of an external stimulus. For example, studies have developed magnetic field-responsive dry adhesives and show that the adhesion of these materials can be turned on and off by controlling the applied magnetic field. Light-responsive adhesives have also been developed and shown to reverse their adhesion using infrared light as the stimulus. Such materials show tremendous promise in pick-and-place systems for handling delicate objects and microelectronic products. The focus of this article is to review the stimulus-responsive materials that have been used to develop dry adhesives. The mechanisms adopted by these stimulus-responsive materials to switch their adhesion are discussed. Applications of stimulus-responsive dry adhesives are presented, and last, the future perspective of these materials is discussed.},

  abstract = {For robot arms to perform everyday tasks in unstructured environments, these robots must be able to manipulate a diverse range of objects. Today's robots often grasp objects with either soft grippers or rigid end-effectors. However, purely rigid or purely soft grippers have fundamental limitations: soft grippers struggle with irregular, heavy objects, while rigid grippers often cannot grasp small, numerous items. In this paper we therefore introduce RISOs, a mechanics and controls approach for unifying traditional RIgid end-effectors with a novel class of SOft adhesives. When grasping an object, RISOs can use either the rigid end-effector (pinching the item between non-deformable fingers) and/or the soft materials (attaching and releasing items with switchable adhesives). This enhances manipulation capabilities by combining and decoupling rigid and soft mechanisms. With RISOs robots can perform grasps along a spectrum from fully rigid, to fully soft, to rigid-soft, enabling real time object manipulation across a 1 million times range in weight (from 2 mg to 2 kg). To develop RISOs we first model and characterize the soft switchable adhesives. We then mount sheets of these soft adhesives on the surfaces of rigid end-effectors, and develop control strategies that make it easier for robot arms and human operators to utilize RISOs. The resulting RISO grippers were able to pick-up, carry, and release a larger set of objects than existing grippers, and participants also preferred using RISO. Overall, our experimental and user study results suggest that RISOs provide an exceptional gripper range in both capacity and object diversity.

  abstract = {Geckos, which can walk upside down on smooth or rough surfaces, owe this ability to the hierarchical structures under their toes. These structures are responsible for substantial adhesion and, at the same time, for quick attachment/detachment by mechanical stimulus of toe muscles. Inspired by such stimuli-responsive systems in nature, an active adhesive soft gripper for rough surfaces is proposed in this study, consisting of the mushroom-like morphology acting as adhesive structures and the pressure controllable deformation working as toe muscles. Through tunable pressure, the adhesive force can be increased and reduced by roughly 20-fold for a ground glass, in which it can quickly reach high adhesion with positive pressure and reduce to small adhesion under negative pressure. This gecko inspired soft gripper is tested and found successful as a pick-up and drop-down system for transporting a surface with different features, composed of rough acrylic plate, steel ball, flexible photo paper, heavy glass block/plate, etc., which will have great potential for applications in industrial line and daily life as well as providing a novel perspective for the design of soft grippers.},

  abstract = {This research paper proposes a novel robotic gripper that combines rigid and soft components. The challenge of developing robotic grippers that can safely handle a wide variety of objects and remain stable, especially under harsh vibration, is addressed. The gripper uses a main rigid structure for maintaining the stiffness of the robot hand and soft pads under air pressurization for handling the softly and flexibly the objects. The proposed design capitalizes on the advantages of both rigid and soft grippers, by using rigid clamps to achieve robust gripping movements. Simultaneously, exploiting the soft pads' deformation to generate gripping force, this integration not only has high reliability but also guarantees safety in gripping objects. The novel concept, design, and fabrication of the gripper are introduced. Then, the gripper's ability was validated through mathematical modeling, analysis, and experiments. In particular, the geometrical kinematics of the rigid mechanism and deformation of the soft element is mathematical modeled and numerical simulation. Subsequently, the effective gripping size and contact force are analyzed. Experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the mathematical model and simulations, as well as to assess the capabilities of the proposed gripper design. The gripping experiment validates that the gripper can securely grasp a diverse range of objects while ensuring stability during subsequent movements, even under intense high-frequency vibration conditions. This gripper design can be applied for handling a wide range of objects with varying sizes, masses, fragility, and placement positions, specially when the gripping process necessitates both safe interaction and high reliability.},
