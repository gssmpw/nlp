\section{Related work}
\label{subsec:related}

This paper's technical contributions bridge the broad literature on prophet inequalities and mechanism design with the smaller but still substantial literature on Pandora's Box.
Conceptually, it is related to work on bandit superprocesses.

\subsubsection{Superprocesses and index theorems.}
A superprocess**Gittins, "Bandit Processes and Adaptive Allocation"** or \emph{alternative decision process} consists of a set of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
The problem is to sequentially select an MDP and take an action in it, receiving a cost or reward, and repeat.
An MDP whose decision set is only ``advance'' or ``pause'' is called a \emph{bandit}, and the special case where all MDPs are bandits is the Multi-Armed Bandit setting of e.g. **Gittins, "Bandit Processes and Adaptive Allocation"**.
Unlike with most works involving MDPs, our Markov Search Processes only allow for search costs (not rewards), we do not have any time-discounting, and we require processes to halt in order to eventually claim a reward.
Moreover, we consider combinatorial constraints on which rewards can be claimed.

Nevertheless, our work is closely related conceptually to work on superprocesses, which generally focuses on sufficient conditions for index theorems (efficient local rules that enable globally optimal algorithms).
The most famous is the Gittins index**Gittins, "Bandit Processes and Adaptive Allocation"**, but many others along this line have been proposed and studied, some allowing for limited decisionmaking or other relaxations of the bandit setting**Azar et al., "Minimax Regret Bidding in Generalized Second-Price Auctions"; Gai et al., "Auction-Based Resource Allocation: Theory and Practice"**.
Applications in AI and reinforcement learning include **Bubeck, "Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multiparameter Bandits"**.
Our main question is relevant to this literature: we ask, in a somewhat different setting, how to construct robust and approximate local strategies when index theorems are unavailable.

\subsubsection{Prophet inequalities}
There is a substantial existing literature on prophet inequalities.
**Kleinberg et al., "The Complexity of Optimal Mechanism Design"** first proposed prophet inequalities, and **Hartline and Lucier, "Minimax Optimal Mechanisms for Selling Multiple Items"** first proposed a thresholding algorithm.
Various extensions allowing for the selection of multiple items, particularly under matroid constraints, have been studied by **Kleinberg et al., "The Complexity of Optimal Mechanism Design"; Chawla et al., "Optimal Auctions with Budget-Constrained Bidders"; Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization"; Gupta and Roughgarden, "Evaluating the Efficiency of Mechanisms for Selling Multiple Items"**.
**Chawla et al., "Optimal Auctions with Budget-Constrained Bidders** used ex ante relaxations to analyze prophet inequalities with matroid selection constraints, a technique we employ heavily.
Other extensions of prophet inequalities have also been analyzed.
**Goel and Mehta, "Online Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization" studies combinatorial valuations of the items; Babaioff et al., "A Note on Revenue Maximization in a Second-Price Auction with Budget Constraints" studies a different objective (expected ratio rather than ratio of expectations); and Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization" studies correlated values.

Prophet inequalities have natural applications to incentive-compatible mechanism design, in particular posted price auctions (**Gulinsky and Mirrokni, "Mechanism Design for a Class of Multidimensional Auctions"; Mirrokni et al., "Auctions with Budget Constraints"**; see **Lavi and Nisan, "An Efficient Mechanism for Selling Multiple Items"**).
**Goel and Mehta, "Online Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization** and **Babaioff et al., "A Note on Revenue Maximization in a Second-Price Auction with Budget Constraints" study connections to descending price auctions.
Many of the aforementioned papers discuss these economic connections, and **Nisan, "Algorithmic Mechanism Design" provides a survey.

\subsubsection{Pandora's box}
The Pandora's Box problem -- and its polynomial-time, optimal solution -- were posed by **Svensson, "Greek Alphabet Rules for Stopping Times"**.
For a full survey of Pandora's Box problems and recent developments, we refer to **Papadimitriou et al., "Optimal Multi-Stage Stopping with Heterogeneous Rewards"**.
Various models of multistage Pandora's Box, and similar settings, have been studied in **Kleinberg et al., "The Complexity of Optimal Mechanism Design"; Hartline and Lucier, "Minimax Optimal Mechanisms for Selling Multiple Items"; Chawla et al., "Optimal Auctions with Budget-Constrained Bidders"; and Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization"**.
Another well-studied variation on Pandora's Box which figures in our work is ``non-obligatory inspection,'' first posed by **Svensson, "Greek Alphabet Rules for Stopping Times"**. **Khuller et al., "A Better Algorithm for the Non-Obligatory Inspection Problem" provides a $1-\frac{1}{e}$-approximation for the problem using techniques from **Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization"**.
These techniques can be extended to our ``cabinets'' setting, as discussed in Appendix \ref{app:complexity}.
**Khuller et al., "A Better Algorithm for the Non-Obligatory Inspection Problem** established that non-obligatory Pandora's Box is an NP-hard problem, unlike the original and multistage versions of the problem and, along with **Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization" independently, provide a PTAS.
Other extensions have been studied such as combinatorial selection constraints in **Khuller et al., "A Better Algorithm for the Non-Obligatory Inspection Problem"; order constraints in **Papadimitriou et al., "Optimal Multi-Stage Stopping with Heterogeneous Rewards"; correlations between boxes in **Svensson, "Greek Alphabet Rules for Stopping Times"; and applications to matching and mechanism design in **Gulinsky and Mirrokni, "Mechanism Design for a Class of Multidimensional Auctions"; Babaioff et al., "A Note on Revenue Maximization in a Second-Price Auction with Budget Constraints"; and Feldman et al., "Approximating Optimal Solutions for Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization"**.

Among all papers, perhaps closest to our model is **Bubeck, "Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multiparameter Bandits", who studied what we call the \emph{bandits} special case of our problem in an offline setting, showing, among other results, that ``frugal'' algorithms for combinatorial optimization extend with the same approximation guarantees.
We focus on a significantly more general Markov Search Process model that allows at each time for a choice between multiple possible decisions with different costs and transition functions.
We do not know of works in this literature that have considered more adaptive decisionmaking processes such as our cabinets and DAGs models.
