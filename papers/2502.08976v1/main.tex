\begin{abstract}
  A decisionmaker faces $n$ alternatives, each of which represents a potential reward.
  After investing costly resources into investigating the alternatives, the decisionmaker may select one, or more generally a feasible subset, and obtain the associated reward(s).
  The objective is to maximize the sum of rewards minus total costs invested.
  We consider this problem under several increasingly general models of an alternative as a costly search problem: a simple advance-or-halt ``bandit''; a ``cabinet'' with a choice of which ``drawer'' to open; and finally a general \emph{Markov Search Process}, a type of undiscounted Markov Decision Process on a finite acyclic graph.
  Even simple cases of our setting, such as cabinets with two drawers, generalize NP-hard problems such as Pandora's Box with nonobligatory inspection.

  Despite the apparently adaptive and interactive nature of the problem, we prove prophet inequalities for all of these problems under a variety of combinatorial constraints.
  That is, we give approximation algorithms that interact with the alternatives sequentially, where each must be fully explored and either selected or else discarded before the next arrives.
  We prove these results by a series of algorithmic reductions, starting from classic prophet inequalities with combinatorial constraints and moving to each more-general model in turn.
  In particular, a standard ex-ante prophet inequality for any downward-closed constraint implies a prophet inequality with the same approximation guarantee for the Markov Search Process setting, albeit inefficiently.
  A key lemma is an efficient algorithm for greedily optimizing ``net utility'' on a Markov Search Process subject to a threshold.
  This yields, in particular, a computationally efficient $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$ prophet inequality for Combinatorial Markov Search subject to any matroid constraint.
  These results imply incentive-compatible mechanisms with constant Price of Anarchy for serving single-parameter agents when the agents strategically conduct independent, costly search processes to discover their values.
