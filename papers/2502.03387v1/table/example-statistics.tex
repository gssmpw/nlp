    \caption{
    Statistical analysis of models trained with examples of varying data quality. This table presents three key metrics: average token count per response, average line count per response, and frequently occurring keywords in model-generated responses. Keywords associated with reasoning transitions and uncertainty are highlighted in \textbf{bold}, with common stop words (e.g., ``a", ``the") excluded to focus on substantive language patterns. Notable differences in response length and keyword usage patterns suggest varying levels of reasoning complexity.}
