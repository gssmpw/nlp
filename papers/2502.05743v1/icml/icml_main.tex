\begin{abstract}

This work addresses the critical question of why and when diffusion models, despite being designed for generative tasks, can excel at learning high-quality representations in a self-supervised manner. To address this, we develop a mathematical framework based on a low-dimensional data model and posterior estimation, revealing a fundamental trade-off between generation and representation quality near the final stage of image generation. Our analysis explains the unimodal representation dynamics across noise scales, mainly driven by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Building on these insights, we propose an ensemble method that aggregates features across noise levels, significantly improving both clean performance and robustness under label noise. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings.

% Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models, despite being designed for generative tasks, also excel at learning high-quality representations in a self-supervised manner. Understanding this dual capability is crucial for advancing their applications beyond generative modeling, such as classification. In this work, we study when and why diffusion models can generate good representations. To answer this question, we study the denoising objective of diffusion models using a low-dimensional data model. Our analysis reveals a trade-off between generation quality and representation quality and provides a theoretical explanation for the unimodal representation learning dynamics across varying noise scales, governed by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings. 

% This work addresses the critical question of why and when diffusion models, despite being designed for generative tasks, can excel in learning high-quality representations in a self-supervised manner. We reveal that their success in representation learning is primarily driven by their denoising objective rather than the diffusion process, with their superiority over traditional denoising autoencoders stemming from an inherent weight-sharing mechanism. Using a low-dimensional mixture of low-rank Gaussians data assumption, we identify a trade-off between generation quality and representation quality and provide a theoretical explanation for the unimodal representation learning dynamics across varying noise scales, governed by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings. \xiao{change} \qq{needs to be rewritten, too dry}

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for analyzing the representation dynamics of diffusion models. By introducing the concept of \CSNR~and leveraging a low-dimensional mixture of low-rank Gaussians, we characterize the trade-off between generative quality and representation quality. Our theoretical analysis explains how the unimodal representation learning dynamics observed across noise scales emerge from the interplay between data denoising and class specification.

Beyond theoretical insights, we propose an ensemble method inspired by our findings that enhances classification performance in diffusion models, both with and without label noise. Additionally, we empirically uncover an inherent weight-sharing mechanism in diffusion models, which accounts for their superior representation quality compared to traditional DAEs.Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings.
