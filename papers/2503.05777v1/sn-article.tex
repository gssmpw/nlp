\section{LLM Hallucinations in Medicine}\label{sec2}

Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) can undermine the reliability of AI-generated medical information, particularly in clinical settings where inaccuracies may adversely affect patient outcomes. In non-clinical contexts, errors introduced by LLMs may have limited impact or could be more easily detected, particularly because users often possess the background knowledge to verify or cross-reference the information provided, unlike in many medical scenarios where patients may lack the expertise to assess the accuracy of AI-generated medical advice. However, in healthcare, subtle or plausible-sounding misinformation can influence diagnostic reasoning, therapeutic recommendations, or patient counseling \citep{miles-jay2023longitudinal, xia2024multicenter, mehta2018machine, mohammadi2023viral}. In this section, we define hallucination in a clinical context.

\subsection{LLMs in Medicine: Capabilities and Adaptations}

Recent advancements in transformer-based architectures and large-scale pretraining have elevated LLM performance in tasks requiring language comprehension, contextual reasoning, and multimodal analysis \citep{vaswani2017attention, kaplan2020scaling}. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and Meta’s Llama family. In medicine, researchers adapt these models using domain-specific corpora, instruction tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with the goal of aligning outputs more closely to clinical practice \citep{wei2022chain, lewis2020retrieval}.

Several specialized LLMs have demonstrated promising results on medical benchmarks. Med-PaLM and Med-PaLM~2, for instance, exhibit strong performance on tasks such as MedQA \citep{Jin2021medqa}, MedMCQA \citep{pal2022medmcqa}, and PubMedQA \citep{jin2019pubmedqa} by integrating biomedical texts into their training regimes \citep{singhal2022large}. Google’s Med-Gemini extends these methods by leveraging multimodal inputs, leading to improved accuracy in clinical evaluations \citep{saab2024capabilities}. Open-source initiatives such as Meditron \citep{chen2023meditron} and Med42 \citep{christophe2024med42} release models trained on large-scale biomedical data, offering transparency and fostering community-driven improvements. Despite these tailored efforts, LLMs can generate outputs that appear plausible yet lack factual or logical foundations, manifesting as hallucinations in a clinical context.

A recent survey \citep{alnazi2024} reinforces these observations, offering a comprehensive review of LLMs in healthcare. In particular, it highlights how domain-specific adaptations such as instruction tuning and retrieval-augmented generation can enhance patient outcomes and streamline medical knowledge dissemination, while also emphasizing the persistent challenges of reliability, interpretability, and hallucination risk.

\subsection{Differentiating Medical from General Hallucinations}

LLM hallucinations refer to outputs that are factually incorrect, logically inconsistent, or inadequately grounded in reliable sources \citep{huang2023survey}. In general domains, these hallucinations may take the form of factual errors or non-sequiturs. In medicine, they can be more challenging to detect because the language used often appears clinically valid while containing critical inaccuracies \citep{singhal2022large, mohammadi2023viral}.

Medical hallucinations exhibit two distinct features compared to their general-purpose counterparts. First, they arise within specialized tasks such as diagnostic reasoning, therapeutic planning, or interpretation of laboratory findings, where inaccuracies have immediate implications for patient care \citep{xu2024mitigating, miles-jay2023longitudinal, xia2024multicenter}. Second, these hallucinations frequently use domain-specific terms and appear to present coherent logic, which can make them difficult to recognize without expert scrutiny \citep{asgari2024framework, liu2024medchain}. In settings where clinicians or patients rely on AI recommendations, a tendency potentially heightened in domains like medicine \citep{zhou2025relai}, unrecognized errors risk delaying proper interventions or redirecting care pathways.

Moreover, the impact of medical hallucinations is far more severe. Errors in clinical reasoning or misleading treatment recommendations can directly harm patients by delaying proper care or leading to inappropriate interventions \citep{miles-jay2023longitudinal,xia2024multicenter,mehta2018machine}. Furthermore, the detectability of such hallucinations depends on the level of domain expertise of the audience and the quality of the prompting provided to the model. Domain experts are more likely to identify subtle inaccuracies in clinical terminology and reasoning, whereas non-experts may struggle to discern these errors, thereby increasing the risk of misinterpretation \citep{asgari2024framework,liu2024medchain}.

These distinctions are crucial: whereas general hallucinations might lead to relatively benign mistakes, medical hallucinations can undermine patient safety and erode trust in AI-assisted clinical systems \citep{miles-jay2023longitudinal, xia2024multicenter, mehta2018machine, asgari2024framework,liu2024medchain, pal2023medhalt}.

% \subsection{Medical Hallucinations Types and Terminologies}
\subsection{Taxonomy of Medical Hallucinations}
\label{sec:hallu_cls}

A growing body of literature proposes frameworks for classifying medical hallucinations in LLM outputs. \citet{agarwal2024medhalu} emphasize the severity of errors and their root causes, whereas \citet{ahmad2023creating} focus on preserving clinician trust by identifying the types of misinformation that most erode confidence. \citet{pal2023medhalt} introduce an empirical benchmark for quantifying hallucination frequency in real-world scenarios, underscoring their prevalence. Efforts by \citet{hegselmann2024data} and \citet{moradi2021deep} highlight how data quality and curation practices can influence hallucination rates, especially in the context of patient summaries.

Informed by these studies \citep{zhang2024knowledge, yu2024mechanistic, lee2023platypus, asgari2024framework, ziaei2023language, pressman2024clinical, li2024dawn, zhang2023chatgpt, wu2023exploring}, we first illustrate our taxonomy in Figure~\ref{fig:taxonomy}, which clusters hallucinations into five main categories (factual errors, outdated references, spurious correlations, incomplete chains of reasoning, and fabricated sources or guidelines) based on their underlying causes and manifestations. Subsequently,  Table~\ref{tab:hallucination_types} provides a more granular breakdown of each hallucination types that categorizes hallucinations and offers concrete examples of these categories, illustrating the various ways in which clinically oriented LLMs may produce superficially plausible but ultimately incorrect outputs.

These hallucinations are exacerbated by the complexity and specificity of medical knowledge, where subtle differences in terminology or reasoning can lead to significant misunderstandings \citep{miles-jay2023longitudinal,mohammadi2023viral}.  Furthermore, as shown in Table \ref{tab:examples}, these hallucinations can manifest across a wide range of medical tasks, from symptom diagnosis and patient management to the interpretation of lab results and visual data.

\subsection{Medical Hallucinations vs. Cognitive Biases: Different Origins, Similar Outcomes}

Cognitive biases in medical practice are well-studied phenomena, whereby clinicians deviate from optimal decision-making due to systematic errors in judgment and reasoning \citep{tversky1974judgment, o2012thinking, blumenthal-barby2014cognitive, saposnik2016cognitive}. These biases frequently arise in time-constrained or high-stress environments and can undermine the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Although LLMs do not possess human psychology, the erroneous outputs they produce often exhibit patterns that resemble these biases in clinical reasoning. By comparing medical hallucinations in LLMs to established cognitive biases, researchers gain insights into both the roots of AI-driven errors and potential strategies to mitigate them.

\paragraph{Common Cognitive Biases in Clinical Practice parallels with LLM Hallucinations.}
Clinicians frequently experience biases such as \emph{anchoring bias}, which entails relying excessively on initial impressions, even when new evidence suggests alternative explanations. Similarly, \emph{confirmation bias} leads to selective acceptance of data that reinforces a working diagnosis, while \emph{availability bias} skews judgments toward diagnoses that are more memorable or have been recently encountered \citep{ly2023evidence, blumenthal-barby2014cognitive, rehana2021common, hammond2021bias}. Clinicians also exhibit \emph{overconfidence bias}, characterized by unwarranted certainty in diagnostic or therapeutic decisions \citep{saposnik2016cognitive, mehta2018machine}, as well as \emph{premature closure}, where they settle on a plausible explanation without fully considering differential diagnoses \citep{blumenthal-barby2014cognitive}.

Hallucinations in medical LLMs echo these biases in various ways. \emph{Anchoring} appears when a model disproportionately relies on the initial part of a prompt, neglecting subsequent details or contextual information. \emph{Confirmation bias} emerges when an LLM's response aligns too closely with the user’s implied hypothesis, neglecting contradictory evidence. \emph{Availability} manifests in the model’s tendency to propose diagnoses or treatments that are disproportionately represented in its training data. \emph{Overconfidence} becomes evident when LLM outputs present an unwarranted level of certainty, a phenomenon linked to poor calibration \citep{cao2021calibration, hagendorff2023human}. Finally, \emph{premature closure} can occur if the model settles on a single, plausible-sounding conclusion without comprehensively considering differential possibilities or additional context \citep{hegselmann2024data}. Although the LLM lacks human cognition, the statistical patterns it learns can simulate biases that arise from heuristic-based thinking in clinicians.

% \subsubsection{Differences in Underlying Mechanisms.}
Despite these surface-level similarities, the basis of LLM hallucinations diverges from the cognitive underpinnings of human biases. Cognitive biases result from heuristic shortcuts, emotional influences, memory limitations, and other psychological factors \citep{tversky1974judgment, o2012thinking}. In contrast, medical LLM hallucinations are the product of learned statistical correlations in training data, coupled with architectural constraints such as limited causal reasoning \citep{jiang2023recent, glicksberg2024trials}. This distinction means that while clinicians might fail to adjust their thinking in light of conflicting information, an LLM may simply lack exposure to correct or more recent evidence—or fail to retrieve it—leading to erroneous outputs. Consequently, mitigation requires strategies tailored to each context: clinicians might benefit from decision-support tools and reflective practice to counter personal biases, while LLMs demand better data curation, retrieval-augmented generation, or explicit calibration methods to curb hallucinations and unwarranted certainty.

% \subsubsection{Implications for Mitigation.}
Identifying parallels between cognitive biases and LLM hallucinations highlights potential remediation avenues. Techniques for reducing \emph{anchoring} and \emph{confirmation bias} in clinical settings—such as prompting systematic consideration of differential diagnoses—may inform prompt design or chain-of-thought strategies in LLMs \citep{wang2024large}. Encouraging models to output uncertainty estimates or alternative explanations can address \emph{overconfidence} and \emph{premature closure} biases, especially if users are guided to critically evaluate multiple options. Meanwhile, robust fine-tuning procedures and retrieval-augmented generation can improve the balance of training data, mitigating the model’s \emph{availability} bias. Taken together, these efforts could reduce the frequency and severity of hallucinations, ensuring AI-assisted systems more closely align with evidence-based clinical practice.

\subsection{Clinical Implications of Medical Hallucinations}

The integration of large language models into healthcare introduces several risks with direct consequences for patient care and broader clinical practice. Hallucinated outputs that appear credible can guide clinicians toward ineffective or harmful interventions, influencing therapeutic choices, diagnostic pathways, and patient-provider communication \citep{topol2019high, mehta2018machine, hata2022relationship}. This section articulates how such hallucinations undermine patient safety, disrupt clinical workflows, and create additional ethical and legal complexities.

A chief concern is \textbf{patient safety}. When hallucinated outputs lead to incorrect recommendations or misdiagnoses, clinicians may adopt interventions that inadvertently harm patients \citep{hata2022relationship}. Even minor inaccuracies can escalate clinical risks if they go unnoticed or align with a clinician’s cognitive bias, ultimately compromising the quality of care.

Another critical dimension is the \textbf{erosion of trust} in AI systems. Repeated hallucinations often breed skepticism among both healthcare providers and patients \citep{willems2023cost}. Providers are less inclined to rely on potentially error-prone models, while patients may grow apprehensive about the reliability of artificial intelligence in medical decisions, inhibiting broader integration of these tools in clinical practice.

These errors also disrupt \textbf{workflow efficiency}. Hallucinations can force clinicians to verify or correct AI-generated information, adding to their workload and diverting attention from direct patient care \citep{mcdermott2024machine}. This burden can diminish the potential benefits of automation and decision support, particularly in time-sensitive or resource-constrained environments.

Beyond immediate bedside concerns, \textbf{ethical and legal implications} arise from the growing reliance on LLM-based recommendations \citep{fanta2023sociotechnical}. As models increasingly influence clinical decision-making, the question of accountability for AI-driven errors becomes more urgent. Uncertainty over liability may impede system-wide adoption and complicate the legal landscape for healthcare providers, technology developers, and regulators.

Finally, hallucinations curtail the \textbf{impact on precision medicine} by reducing the trustworthiness of personalized treatment recommendations. If an LLM’s outputs cannot consistently deliver accurate, context-specific insights, it undermines the potential to tailor interventions to individual patient profiles \citep{vasquez2023modeling}. The vision of leveraging big data to refine therapeutic strategies becomes more challenging if model-generated advice contains undetected inaccuracies.

Overall, understanding the clinical implications of medical hallucinations is essential for developing safer, more trustworthy models in healthcare. Stakeholders must consider patient safety, provider engagement, and the broader ethical and legal context to ensure that emerging technologies ultimately enhance, rather than impede, medical practice.

\section{Causes of Hallucinations}
\label{sec3}

% Medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in supporting clinical decision-making, generating patient summaries, and interpreting medical text. However, hallucinations remain a significant limitation, posing risks for clinical workflows and patient outcomes. 

% Medical hallucinations usually originate from three primary sources: data issues, model-level limitations, and complexities characteristic of the healthcare domain. Addressing these factors systematically is essential for improving the reliability of LLMs in clinical applications.

% The causes of hallucinations can be grouped into data-related factors, model-related limitations, and domain-specific challenges. Data-related factors include data input forms and metrics illustrating data quality and representativeness issues. Model-related factors include a simplified neural network depicting model architecture limitations. Domain-specific challenges include integration of diverse medical data types highlighting medical domain complexity.

Hallucinations in medical LLMs often arise from a confluence of factors relating to data, model architecture, and the unique complexities of healthcare. Although Section~\ref{sec2} examined how hallucinations manifest and why they matter in clinical contexts, this section provides a deeper look at the root causes. By understanding where and how LLMs fail, researchers and practitioners can prioritize interventions that safeguard patient well-being and advance the reliability of AI in medicine.


\subsection{Data-Related Factors}

The quality, diversity, and scope of training data profoundly influence model performance. Gaps in these areas are key contributors to hallucinations.

\subsubsection{Data Quality and Noise}

Clinical datasets, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and physician notes, often contain noise in the form of incomplete entries, misspellings, and ambiguous abbreviations. These inconsistencies propagate errors into LLM training \citep{hegselmann2024data}. For instance, a lack of structured input may confuse models, leading them to replicate false patterns or irrelevant outputs~\citep{moradi2021deep}. 
Outdated data further compounds this issue. Medical knowledge evolves continuously, and guidelines can quickly become outdated \citep{shekelle2002developing}. Models trained on static or historical data may recommend ineffective treatments, reducing clinical utility~\citep{glicksberg2024trials}. Addressing these issues requires rigorous data curation, including noise filtering, deduplication, and alignment with current medical guidelines.

\subsubsection{Data Diversity and Representativeness}

Training data must reflect the diversity of patient populations, disease presentations, and healthcare systems. Biased datasets, such as those dominated by common conditions or data from high-resource settings, limit model generalizability~\citep{chen2019can}. For instance, \citet{restrepo2024diversity} highlight that underrepresentation of minority groups can lead to systematic errors in AI predictions.
Rare diseases are particularly affected. Models often lack exposure to these conditions during training, leading to hallucinations when generating diagnostic insights~\citep{svenstrup2015rare}. Similarly, regional variations in clinical terminology and disease prevalence further exacerbate performance disparities~\citep{wang2024healthcare}. Standardized terminologies, such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), can improve consistency by harmonizing medical language across datasets~\citep{donnelly2006snomed}.
Efforts to mitigate data diversity challenges include targeted inclusion of underrepresented conditions and populations, as well as benchmarking on globally diverse datasets to assess generalizability~\citep{chen2024crosscare,matos2024worldmedqavmultilingualmultimodalmedical,medperf2023}.

\subsubsection{Size and Scope of Training Data}

While large-scale datasets are critical for training LLMs, general-purpose models often lack sufficient exposure to domain-specific medical content. As demonstrated by \citet{alsentzer2019publicly}, fine-tuning models on biomedical corpora significantly improves their understanding of clinical text. In contrast, inadequate training data coverage creates knowledge gaps, causing models to hallucinate when addressing unfamiliar medical topics~\citep{lee2024evaluation}.
Comprehensive training datasets that incorporate annotated clinical notes, peer-reviewed research, and real-world guidelines are essential to ensure coverage of both common and edge cases. Expanding the scope to include rare diseases, specialized treatments, and emerging conditions can further enhance model reliability~\citep{jiang2023recent}.

\subsection{Model-Related Factors}

Limitations intrinsic to model architecture and behavior also contribute to hallucinations, particularly in medical applications.

\subsubsection{Overconfidence and Calibration}

LLMs frequently exhibit overconfidence, generating outputs with high certainty even when the information is incorrect. Poor calibration—where confidence scores fail to align with prediction accuracy—can mislead clinicians into trusting inaccurate outputs~\citep{cao2021calibration}. For example, \citet{yuan2023hallucinations} highlight the need for improved uncertainty estimation techniques to mitigate overconfidence.
Effective strategies for addressing calibration include probabilistic modeling, confidence-aware training, and ensemble methods. These approaches enable models to provide uncertainty estimates alongside predictions, promoting safer integration into clinical workflows.

\subsubsection{Generalization to Unseen Cases}

Medical LLMs struggle to generalize beyond their training data, particularly when faced with rare diseases, novel treatments, or atypical clinical presentations. Models trained on imbalanced datasets often extrapolate from unrelated patterns, producing erroneous or irrelevant outputs~\citep{svenstrup2015rare, hegselmann2024data}. 
\citet{wang2024replace} demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs require domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt effectively to clinical tasks. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, which allow models to access external knowledge dynamically, can help improve performance on unfamiliar cases~\citep{lee2024evaluation}.

\subsubsection{Lack of Medical Reasoning}

Effective clinical decision-making relies on reasoning that integrates symptoms, diagnoses, and evidence-based treatments. However, LLMs primarily rely on statistical correlations learned from text rather than causal reasoning~\citep{jiang2023recent}. As a result, hallucinations occur when models generate outputs that sound plausible but lack logical coherence~\citep{glicksberg2024trials}.
Structured knowledge integration, such as incorporating clinical pathways and causal frameworks into training, has shown potential in improving model reasoning. Similarly, prompting strategies, such as CoT reasoning, can encourage step-by-step output generation~\citep{wang2024large}.

\subsection{Healthcare Domain-Specific Challenges}
\label{sec: challenges}
Unique complexities in the medical domain exacerbate hallucinations in LLMs, such as ambiguity in clinical language, or rapidly evolving nature of medical knowledge. 

% \subsubsection{Ambiguity in Clinical Language}

Medical text often contains \textit{ambiguous abbreviations}, incomplete sentences, and inconsistent terminology. For example, “BP” could mean “blood pressure” or “biopsy,” depending on context~\citep{hegselmann2024data}. Such ambiguities challenge LLMs, leading to misinterpretations and hallucinations. Standardization efforts, such as the adoption of structured vocabularies like SNOMED CT~\citep{donnelly2006snomed} provide consistent mappings of clinical terminology, reducing ambiguity and improving model reliability.

% \subsubsection{Rapidly Evolving Medical Knowledge}

Furthermore, medical knowledge evolves continuously as new treatments, guidelines, and evidence emerge. Static training datasets quickly become outdated, causing models to generate recommendations that no longer reflect current clinical best practices \citep{shekelle2002developing, restrepo2024diversity}.
To address this, models require regular fine-tuning on updated medical data and integration with dynamic knowledge retrieval systems. Tools capable of real-time evidence synthesis can help ensure outputs remain clinically relevant \citep{wang2024healthcare, chen2024diversity}.


% Moreover, new interventions or guidelines continuously emerge, quickly outdating static datasets \citep{shekelle2002developing, restrepo2024diversity}. Effective mitigation requires dynamic knowledge retrieval, ongoing dialogue with subject-matter experts, and regular re-training to keep model outputs aligned with contemporary best practices.

These healthcare-specific challenges interact with both data- and model-related issues, creating a multifaceted environment in which hallucinations can arise. Recognizing these contributory factors is critical for designing solutions that systematically address shortcomings in medical LLM development and deployment.



% \subsubsection{Insufficient or Biased Training Data}
% LLMs rely heavily on the quality and diversity of their training data. In the medical domain, there may be insufficient data representing rare diseases, minority populations, or specific clinical scenarios. This can lead to models that generalize poorly or exhibit biases \citep{}.

% \subsubsection{Data Quality and Curation Challenges}

% Medical data often contain inconsistencies, errors, or outdated information. Inaccurate or unverified data can lead to the propagation of misinformation within the model's outputs. Additionally, privacy concerns limit access to high-quality patient data, hindering comprehensive training \citep{}.

% \subsubsection{Architectural Limitations}
% \subsubsection{Training Methodologies}

% \subsection{Domain-Specific Challenges}
% \subsubsection{Complexity of Medical Knowledge}
% Medicine is a highly specialized field with complex terminologies and concepts. The interconnected nature of medical knowledge means that small errors can lead to significant misunderstandings.

% \subsubsection{Ambiguity in Medical Language}
% Medical language often includes ambiguous terms or jargon that require context-specific interpretation. Misinterpretation of such language can result in incorrect outputs

% \subsubsection{Rapid Evolution of Medical Information}
% Medical knowledge is continually evolving with new research findings, treatments, and guidelines. LLMs trained on static datasets may become outdated, leading to hallucinations when referencing the latest information.

% \section{Detection and Evaluation of Medical Hallucinations}\label{sec5}

\section{Detection and Evaluation of Medical Hallucinations}
\label{sec4}

\subsection{Existing Detection Strategies}

We explore several general strategies for hallucination detection in LLMs, alongside some healthcare-specific approaches. Hallucinations in LLMs occur when the model generates outputs that are unsupported by factual knowledge or the input context. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: 1) factual verification, 2) summary consistency verification, and 3) uncertainty-based hallucination detection. Various benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of these detection strategies, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:medical-hallucination-benchmarks}.

\subsubsection{Factual Verification}

Factual verification techniques assess whether claims generated by a model are backed by reliable evidence. These methods are critical in domains like healthcare, where hallucinations can lead to significant risks. One approach by \citet{chen2024complex} decomposes complex claims into sub-questions, retrieves relevant documents from web sources, and evaluates the truthfulness of each sub-component. By isolating individual facts, this method ensures rigorous verification of multi-faceted medical claims. Another method, FACTSCORE \citep{min2023factscore}, evaluates factual precision at a granular level, focusing on ``atomic facts" rather than entire sentences. This fine-grained approach is especially useful for medical applications, where even small inaccuracies in a diagnosis or recommendation can have serious consequences. FACTSCORE identifies hallucinations embedded within seemingly plausible outputs, making it a useful tool for fact verification in medical LLMs.

\subsubsection{Summary Consistency Verification}

Summary consistency methods evaluate whether a generated summary faithfully reflects the source content. These techniques are crucial for detecting hallucinations, ensuring the summary aligns with the facts present in the input data. These methods can be divided into \textbf{question-answering (QA)-based} and \textbf{entailment-based} approaches. QA-based methods assess consistency by generating questions from either the source or the summary. The first method generates questions from the source text and evaluates the summary's ability to answer them, focusing on recall \citep{scialom2019answers}. The second method, QAGS \citep{wang2020asking}, generates questions from the summary and compares the answers with the source, detecting factual inconsistencies within the summary. The third method, QuestEval \citep{scialom2021questeval}, combines both recall and precision by generating questions from both the source and the summary. It also introduces a weighting mechanism for key information, improving the robustness of summary evaluation. Entailment-based methods use natural language inference to determine whether each sentence in the summary is logically entailed by the source. Another approach reranks candidate summaries based on entailment scores, detecting subtle inconsistencies that may not be captured by QA-based methods \citep{falke2019ranking}. This approach emphasizes logical coherence and is well-suited for identifying hallucinations where facts are misrepresented or distorted. QA-based methods focus on fact recall, while entailment-based methods emphasize logical consistency, providing complementary approaches for hallucination detection.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty-Based Hallucination Detection}

Uncertainty-based hallucination detection assumes that hallucinations occur when a model lacks confidence in its outputs. These methods rely on either \textbf{sequence log-probability} or \textbf{semantic entropy} to quantify uncertainty. Sequence probability-based methods detect hallucinations by analyzing the probability assigned to generated sequences. One method \citep{guerreiro2023looking} computes the log-probability of the sequence and flags low-probability outputs as potential hallucinations. Another method \citep{zhang2023enhancing} refines this by focusing on token-level probabilities and their contextual dependencies, improving hallucination detection by adjusting for overconfidence in certain predictions. Semantic entropy-based methods shift focus to the variability in meaning across different outputs. One method \citep{farquhar2024detecting} clusters outputs by semantic meaning rather than surface-level differences, reducing inflated uncertainty caused by rephrasings of the same information. High semantic entropy indicates greater uncertainty and a higher likelihood of hallucination. Another method \citep{houdecomposing} analyzes how the model responds to different versions of the same question, helping to separate uncertainty caused by unclear question phrasings from uncertainty due to the model's own knowledge gaps. For medical LLMs, this helps determine whether the model requires further training on specific clinical concepts or if users need to be more precise in formulating their queries. Together, sequence probability and semantic entropy methods offer complementary approaches for hallucination detection, with sequence log-probabilities providing a general uncertainty measure and semantic entropy focusing on meaning-centered analysis.

% \subsection{Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks}
% Metrics for assessing medical hallucinations include:
% \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Factual Accuracy}: Measures the correctness of the information provided. \item \textbf{Clinical Relevance}: Assesses whether the output is pertinent to the clinical context. \item \textbf{Consistency}: Evaluates the internal coherence of the model's responses. \item \textbf{Specificity and Sensitivity}: Particularly in diagnostic tasks, measuring the rate of true positives and negatives. \end{itemize}
\subsection{Methods for Evaluating Medical Hallucinations}
To effectively evaluate and quantify hallucinations in medical LLMs, we propose a systematic framework that aligns with the taxonomy presented in Table \ref{tab:hallucination_types}. This framework encompasses multiple measurement approaches, each addressing specific aspects of hallucination detection and evaluation across different healthcare applications. Specific tests designed to detect these hallucinations in clinical contexts are presented in Table \ref{tab:hallucination-detect}.

\paragraph{Factual Accuracy Assessment}
This fundamental measurement approach directly addresses Factual Hallucinations and Research Hallucinations by comparing LLM outputs against authoritative medical sources. When an LLM generates information that contradicts established medical knowledge, it indicates the model is fabricating content rather than retrieving and applying accurate information. This involves both automated metrics (entity overlap, relation overlap) and expert verification, with particular emphasis on medical entity recognition and relationship validation. For instance, in Drug Discovery applications, this would assess whether drug-protein interactions described by the LLM align with established biochemical knowledge \citep{juhi2023capability}.

\paragraph{Consistency Analysis}
This approach employs Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question-Answer Consistency techniques to detect Decision-Making Hallucinations and Diagnostic Hallucinations in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and EHR Management. Internal contradictions in an LLM's response suggest the model is generating information without maintaining a coherent understanding of the medical case, indicating hallucination rather than reasoned analysis \citep{sambara2024radflag}. Future benchmarks and metrics are recommended to examine logical consistency across medical reasoning chains and evaluates whether treatment recommendations align with provided patient information and clinical guidelines.

\paragraph{Contextual Relevance Evaluation}
This measurement method addresses Context Deviation Issues using n-gram overlap and semantic similarity metrics to assess whether LLM outputs maintain appropriate clinical context. When an LLM's response deviates significantly from the medical query or context provided, it suggests the model is generating content based on spurious associations rather than addressing the specific medical situation at hand. This is especially important in Patient Engagement and Medical Education \& Training applications, where responses must align precisely with the specific medical scenario or educational objective under consideration \citep{wen2024leveraging, aydin2024large}.

\paragraph{Uncertainty Quantification}
This approach uses sequence log-probability and semantic entropy measures to identify potential areas of Clinical Data Fabrication and Procedure Description Errors. High uncertainty in the model's outputs, as indicated by low sequence probabilities or high semantic entropy, suggests the LLM is generating content without strong grounding in its training data, making hallucination more likely. This is particularly crucial in Medical Research Support and Clinical Documentation Automation, where fabricated information can have serious consequences \citep{asgari2024framework, vishwanath2024faithfulness}.

\paragraph{Cross-modal Verification}
This measurement technique specifically targets Multimodal Integration Errors by evaluating whether textual descriptions are actually supported by the medical images or data they claim to describe \citep{chen2024detecting}. When an LLM generates text about medical images that describes features or findings not present in the actual image, this indicates the model is hallucinating content rather than performing accurate interpretation \citep{sambara2024radflag}. The measurement process involves generating multiple descriptions of the same medical image, then using an evaluator model to compute entailment scores between the generated description and a ground truth imaging report. This approach is particularly critical for applications like Medical Question Answering and Clinical Documentation Automation where LLMs must generate accurate descriptions of medical imaging or laboratory results.

Each measurement approach may require both automated metrics and expert validation, with specific adaptations for medical domain requirements. For example, entity overlap metrics can be enhanced to specifically measure text similarity in medical terminology, procedures, and relationships, while NLI classifiers can be fine-tuned on medical literature and clinical guidelines.

\subsection{Challenges in Medical Hallucination Detection}
% \kumail{reminder to add some references}
% \paragraph{Understanding and Measuring Hallucinations}
One of the fundamental challenges in detecting hallucinations lies in the ambiguity of the term itself, which encompasses diverse errors and lacks a universally accepted definition~\citep{huang2024survey}. This makes it difficult to standardize benchmarks or evaluate detection methods effectively. Once a consensus on the definitions of hallucinations is established, there remains the issue of evaluating these phenomena effectively. Developing principled metrics aligned with a clear taxonomy of hallucinations is essential for advancing detection approaches. Often,domain-specific solutions tailored to the complex reasoning processes in medical contexts, such as entailment framework specific to radiology report, is useful to evaluate whether generated statements align with input findings \citep{sambara2024radflag}.

\paragraph{Lack of a Reliable Ground Truth}
A significant obstacle in hallucination detection is the frequent absence of, or the high cost of collecting a reliable ground truth, especially for complex or novel queries. For example, when simulating diagnostic tasks in radiology or summarizing complex patient histories, it is challenging to define what constitutes a \textit{hallucination} without pre-established labeled examples \citep{hegselmann2024data}. This gap hinders both the evaluation of detection methods and the supervised training of models for hallucination detection of medical LLMs.

Annotating diagnosis recommendations for real-world medical cases is challenging in part due to Hickam’s Dictum \citep{borden2013hickam}, which recognizes that patients can have multiple coexisting conditions. Symptoms often align with various potential diagnoses, making it difficult to confidently determine a comprehensive diagnosis without dedicating significant time to the case. Given time constraints, medical annotation for evaluating AI hallucinations typically limits the time doctors have to assess each AI-generated output. This restriction makes it difficult to distinguish between clear AI hallucinations, or errors, and potentially useful, yet unconventional, diagnoses that may warrant further investigation.

Lastly, some clinical cases exhibit significant disagreement among clinicians, making it difficult to condense them into a single annotation. %Specialists must carefully consider nuanced factors, such as disease progression, treatment interactions, and evolving guidelines, making it harder to quickly determine whether an AI-generated recommendation is plausible or hallucinated. 
This problem is exacerbated in highly specialized domains, such as oncology, evidenced by a recent study evaluating ChatGPT's ability to provide cancer treatment recommendations against National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines \citep{chen2023utility}. In this work, full agreement among three oncologists occurred in only 61.9\% of cases \citep{chen2023utility}, highlighting the inherent complexity of assessing AI-generated medical outputs in specialized domains.

\paragraph{Semantic Equivalence and Its Role in Detection}
Semantic equivalence is the alignment of meaning between two pieces of text, ensuring they convey the same intended message~\citep{finch2005using, pado2009measuring}. In the context of LLMs, this is used to identify inconsistencies or hallucinations by comparing multiple outputs sampled from the same input for contradictions or self-inconsistencies~\citep{farquhar2024detecting}. Additionally, semantic equivalence can verify whether a model-generated medical report accurately reflects a reference report~\citep{sambara2024radflag}. In many cases, this is done using bidirectional entailment, a mutual verification process where each text is evaluated to confirm it logically supports and is supported by the other~\citep{pado2009measuring, farquhar2024detecting}. However, there is a lack of comprehensive testing to determine whether entailment approaches perform effectively in specialized healthcare domains.

% \paragraph{Specialized Challenges in Medical AI Hallucination Detection}
% Building on the importance of semantic equivalence and entailment, healthcare presents unique challenges (Section \ref{sec: challenges}) and hallucinations can lead to severe consequences, such as misdiagnoses or inappropriate treatments. Addressing these risks requires 
% introduces a , categorizing outputs as Completely Entailed (fully supported by the report), Partially Entailed (mostly correct with minor discrepancies), or Not Entailed (unsupported or contradicted). For example, the statement “The lungs are clear” would be Completely Entailed if the report states “No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen”. A statement like “There is mild cardiomegaly” would be Partially Entailed if the report mentions “Moderate cardiomegaly is present”, while “There is no pneumothorax” would be Not Entailed if the report states “There is a pneumothorax.” These distinctions capture nuanced errors common in radiology reports, such as mismatched severity or implied negative findings. More work in such specialized approaches, including extending them to other fields like oncology, can create robust detection methods that improve LLM safety in clinical applications.

\section{Mitigation Strategies}
\label{sec5}

\subsection{Data-Centric Approaches}
As the capabilities of LLMs continue to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on data-centric approaches to improve their performance and reduce hallucinations. The quality, scope, and diversity of training data are fundamental to building reliable and accurate models, particularly in specialized fields such as biomedicine. This section outlines key strategies for reducing hallucinations through specialized dataset development and data augmentation techniques.

\subsubsection{Improving Data Quality and Curation}
Pretrained LLMs, such as GPT-3 \citep{brown2020gpt3}, GPT-4 \citep{openai2024gpt4technicalreport}, PaLM \citep{chung2024palm}, LLaMA \citep{touvron2023llama}, and BERT \citep{devlin2019bert}, have demonstrated remarkable advancements, largely due to the extensive datasets used in their training. However, achieving high accuracy in biomedical applications requires fine-tuning on domain-specific corpora that are curated for quality, diversity, and task specificity. Models such as Flan-PaLM \citep{chung2024palm, singhal2023encodemed} show high performance in medical benchmarks, illustrating the potential of targeted pre-training in improving LLM capabilities for complex medical reasoning and text generation. Fine-tuned LLaMA family models for medical tasks also show outstanding capability in the question-answering domain \citep{wu2024pmc} and cross-language adaptability \citep{wang2023huatuo}. This progress emphasizes how domain-specific training can significantly improve LLM capabilities in handling advanced medical tasks.

Enhancing data quality and curation is critical for reducing hallucinations, as inaccuracies or inconsistencies in training data can propagate errors in model outputs. To address this, curated datasets have been developed to meet the specific requirements of specialized medical tasks. For example, MEDITRON-70B \citep{chen2023meditron} is designed to improve medical reasoning, while MedCPT \citep{jin2023medcpt} enhances biomedical information retrieval, both of which are based on curated datasets for their respective purposes. These domain-specific datasets enable LLMs to develop a deeper understanding of medical knowledge, ultimately increasing reliability and accuracy. By leveraging high-quality, well-annotated datasets, models can better align with real-world clinical decision-making and minimize hallucinations that arise from incomplete or misleading information.

\subsubsection{Augmenting Training Data}
Augmenting training data has become important in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in medical applications.  Augmentation techniques help bridge knowledge gaps, improve generalization, and mitigate biases in LLM-generated outputs. Several LLM-driven solutions have been introduced to enrich training datasets with clinically relevant information. For example, models used in patient-trial matching \citep{yuan2023large} improve compatibility between electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical trial descriptions, thereby refining model accuracy in real-world clinical settings. Furthermore, models like DALL-M \citep{hsieh2024dallm} use a multistep process to generate clinically relevant characteristics by synthesizing data from medical images and text reports, allowing for more personalized healthcare solutions. Another prominent model, GatorTronGPT \citep{peng2023gatortrongpt}, trained on a comprehensive set of clinical data, improves the generation of biomedical text, facilitating the augmentation of medical training data for various tasks and downstream training applications.

\subsection{Model-Centric Approaches}
Model-centric approaches focus on directly improving LLMs through advanced training techniques and post-training modifications. Unlike data-centric methods that enhance the input data, these approaches aim to refine the model’s internal representations, reasoning capabilities, and output generation processes. Such methods are crucial in the medical domain, where factual accuracy, reliability, and interpretability are paramount for safe and effective clinical decision-making.

\subsubsection{Advanced Training Methods}
% SFT
% pretraining?
% using different loss function based on facutality
% discuss here about alignment type stuff and limitations of the pre-training data
\paragraph{Preference Learning for Factuality}
To better align model outputs and behaviors with human preferences, several methods have been introduced, including direct preference optimization \cite[DPO;][]{rafailov2024direct}, reinforcement learning from human feedback \cite[RLHF;][]{ouyang2022training}, and AI feedback \cite[RLAIF;][]{lee2023rlaif}, utilizing techniques like proximal policy optimization \cite[PPO;][]{schulman2017proximal} as a training mechanism. 

In addition to aligning outputs with human preferences, these methods have been extended to improve factuality by incorporating knowledge-based feedback signals \citep{sun2023aligning,tian2023fine}. For instance, reinforcement learning from knowledge feedback \cite[RLKF;][]{xu2024rejection} specifically trains models to generate accurate responses or reject questions when outside their knowledge scope, achieving superior factuality compared to decoding strategies or supervised fine-tuning \citep{tian2023fine}.

% medical rlkf stuff
Despite their potential, preference tuning demands a substantial volume of high-quality preference labels \citep{lee2023rlaif}, posing a significant challenge for adoption in the medical field due to the high cost of annotations, limited number of expert annotators, and privacy concerns \citep{xia2012clinical}. To address this, the use of synthetic data generated by LLMs with clinical knowledge has been proposed. For example, \citeauthor{mishra2024synfac} demonstrate that using synthetic factual edit data from LLMs can effectively guide factual preference learning, resulting in more accurate outputs without the need for extensive human annotations.
% shortcomings of rlhf

\subsubsection{Post Training Methods}
% write something here about the frequent updates to medical knowledge and the expensiveness of training methods
\paragraph{Model Knowledge Editing}
% continual learning etc.
Knowledge editing techniques provide a targeted approach to refining LLM outputs without requiring complete retraining. Unlike continual learning, which updates models through iterative fine-tuning, knowledge editing directly modifies model weights or adds new knowledge parameters \citep{zhang2024comprehensive}.. A common approach is to train a model editor, which identifies and applies corrections to internal model representations to produce factually accurate outputs \citep{de2021editing,meng2022locating}. This method offers efficiency by avoiding costly retraining, but it has significant drawbacks: it can inadvertently degrade model performance on unrelated tasks, struggles with applying multiple simultaneous edits, and often fails with edits that require broader contextual understanding \citep{mitchell2022memory}. 

Due to the complexity of medical knowledge and the lack of domain-specific benchmarks, knowledge editing has seen limited adoption in healthcare. Alternatively, parameter-efficient approaches add new modules, such as layer-wise adapters \citep{xu2024editing}, instead of altering the base model directly. Such methods are more modular and less disruptive to overall model behavior. This promising framework also propose a domain-specific benchmark, the Medical Counter Fact (MedCF) dataset, to evaluate model edits in medical contexts, to evaluate model edits in medical contexts, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted model editing in improving factual accuracy without compromising generalization.

\paragraph{Critic Models}
In addition to training an LLM to produce more factual outputs, an auxiliary critic model can be used to critique the model's outputs to re-prompt or edit its generation \citep{pan2023automatically,mishra2024fine}. Some works use self-refining methods, using the model itself to both critique and refine its own output \citep{madaan2024self, dhuliawala2023chain,ji2023mitigatinghallucinationlargelanguage}, with the aim of improving the robustness of LLM reasoning processes to reduce hallucination. Although showing some promising results, these methods rely on prompting at each intermediate reasoning step and LLM's reasoning capabilities to correct itself, which can result in unreliable performance gains \citep{huang2023large,li2024hindsight}.

\subsection{External Knowledge Integration Techniques}
External knowledge integration techniques enhance the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating up-to-date and specialized information from external sources. These approaches are particularly valuable in the medical domain, where timely, accurate, and evidence-based information is crucial for reducing hallucinations and improving decision support.

\subsubsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) \citep{lewis2020retrieval} is a prominent method for integrating external knowledge without additional model retraining. The RAG process begins with the retrieval of relevant text and the integration of it into the generation pipeline \citep{asai2023retrieval}, from concatenation to the original input to integration into intermediate Transformer layers \citep{izacard2023atlas, borgeaud2022improving} and interpolation of token distributions of retrieved text and generated text \citep{yogatama2021adaptive}. 

In medical contexts, RAG has been shown to outperform model-only methods, such as CoT prompting, on complex medical reasoning tasks \citep{xiong2024benchmarking, xiong2024improving}. More importantly, RAG's ability to explicitly cite and ground outputs in retrieved knowledge makes it highly interpretable and controllable—qualities that are particularly valuable in clinical applications \citep{rodriguez2024leveraging}. This has led to its adoption across various medical applications, including patient education \citep{wang2024enhancement}, doctor education \citep{yu2024aipatient}, and clinical decision support \citep{wang2024potential}.

Specialized RAG frameworks tailored for healthcare further enhance the accuracy of LLMs by integrating medical-specific corpora and retrievers. For example, MedRAG, a systematic toolkit designed for medical question answering, combines multiple medical datasets with diverse retrieval techniques to improve LLM performance in clinical tasks \citep{xiong-etal-2024-benchmarking}. Building on this, i-MedRAG (iterative RAG for medicine) introduces an iterative querying process where the model generates follow-up queries based on prior results. This iterative mechanism enables deeper exploration of complex medical topics, forming multi-step reasoning chains. Experiments show that i-MedRAG outperforms standard RAG approaches on complex questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets \citep{xiong2024improving}.

However, RAG techniques face key challenges that limit their effectiveness. The quality of generated responses heavily relies on the relevance and accuracy of retrieved documents. Poor retrieval results can propagate errors into model outputs \citep{xu2024knowledge}. Second, system maintenance overhead, i.e., curating and maintaining up-to-date retrieval corpora, especially for rapidly evolving fields such as medicine, requires significant resources \citep{xiong2024improving}.
Moreover, integrating misleading information from low-quality sources \citep{koopman2023dr} or conflicting evidence \citep{wan2024evidence} can degrade model performance and undermine trust in its outputs. Addressing these challenges requires advancements in retrieval models, knowledge base curation, and filtering mechanisms to ensure only high-quality, verified medical knowledge is incorporated into LLM outputs.


\subsubsection{Medical Knowledge Graphs}
Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been used extensively to encode medical knowledge for LLMs and graph-based algorithms, especially in the medical domain \citep{abu2023healthcare, lavrinovics2024knowledge, yang2023review, chandak2023building}. %Knowledge graphs offer a method to encode structural knowledge useful for reasoning as well as context and provenance as each fact in the KG is traceable. Due tho these strengths, utilizing knowledge graphs for hallucination mitigation has also been 
By structuring complex medical information into interconnected entities and relationships, KGs facilitate advanced reasoning and provide clear context and provenance \cite{shi-etal-2023-hallucination}, as each fact within the graph is traceable to its source \citep{lavrinovics2024knowledge} and informative through clear descriptions \citep{chandak2023building}. This traceability is particularly crucial in the medical field, where the accuracy and reliability of information are paramount.

The integration of KGs into LLMs has shown promise in mitigating hallucinations—instances where models generate plausible but incorrect information \citep{lavrinovics2024knowledge}. By grounding LLM outputs in the structured and verified data contained within KGs, the likelihood of generating erroneous or fabricated content is reduced in medical diagnosis. For instance, \citet{de2022toward} highlight the potential of KGs to enhance diagnostic accuracy by encoding complex medical relationships and facilitating structured reasoning in clinical decision making. Similarly, \citet{wang2022knowledge} demonstrate how KGs can be applied to medical imaging, enabling the integration of multimodal data to reduce diagnostic errors in imaging analysis workflows. \citet{yu2022improving} explore how KGs support the management of chronic disease in children, providing actionable insights through data synthesis and predictive analytics. Furthermore, \citet{gong2021smr} focus on safe medicine recommendations, utilizing KG embeddings to mitigate risks associated with incorrect prescriptions. This synergy enhances the factual consistency of model outputs, a critical factor in medical applications where misinformation can have serious consequences. Recent studies have explored various methodologies to incorporate KGs into LLM workflows, aiming to improve the factual accuracy of generated content in tasks such as link prediction, rule learning, and downstream polypharmacy \citep{gema2024knowledge}.



\subsection{Uncertainty Quantification in Medical LLMs}\label{subsec:uncertainty_quant}


% Another key aspect of reliability is that models should know what they know. LLMs will not always know all the answers: e.g., they might not be able to find any relevant, credible knowledge sources for a question. Therefore, we will develop reliable uncertainty estimation mechanisms for LLMs to abstain from answering questions with low confidence and thereby increase factuality, particularly in the medical domain. 
% Specifically, given an $\mathrm{LLM}$ and a question $\boldsymbol{q}$, we aim to develop an abstain function $f(\mathrm{LLM}, \boldsymbol{q}) \rightarrow \{\textit{true}, \textit{false}\}$ to indicate whether and why LLMs should abstain based on their knowledge gaps \citep{kamath-etal-2020-selective, jiang2021can, whitehead2022reliable}. 
% % prior work

% \citet{feng2024don} surveyed a range of existing methods and defined a typology based on LLM training, prompting, post-hoc calibration, and multi-LLM collaboration to enable reliable confidence estimation. 
% % We conducted rigorous evaluations and analysis of these strategies with the open-source LLMs LLaMA2 \citep{touvron2023llama} and Mistral~\citep{jiang2023mistral}. 
% % proposed novel conceptual work
% We propose to adapt and expand the current methods of model calibration \citep{kamath-etal-2020-selective, jiang2021can, whitehead2022reliable} and to lead to improved factuality \citep{Feng2024KnowledgeCF,wei2022chain}. We will also develop new methods for uncertainty estimation and abstain thresholding based on \textit{multi-LLM collaboration}. 
% Our central hypothesis is that reliance on a single model's self-reflection can undermine the efficacy of LLM operations, since challenges such as confirmation biases and hallucination tendencies would result in unreliable self-evaluation \citep{kadavath2022language, ji2023survey, xie2023adaptive}. 
% We will thus devise abstention strategies by allowing a base LLM to take advantage of the feedback of other models on the proposed answers and reasoning (since LLMs often have varying coverage of complementary knowledge) \citep{yu2023kola, du2023improving, Bansal2024LLMAL, Feng2024KnowledgeCF}. 

% Furthermore, in medical diagnosis settings, models may narrow down the answer to several plausible hypotheses, but lack confidence in any single one. In such cases, it is preferable for the model to output a set of plausible hypotheses rather than commit to a potentially incorrect decision or abstain entirely.

% To address this, we will develop techniques for \textit{conformal prediction}, a statistical learning method that provides confidence guarantees for an output set instead of a single prediction.

% As a brief primer, in the standard (split) conformal classification setting, we have a calibration dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, where $x_i \in \mathcal{X}$ represents an input and $y_i \in \mathcal{Y}$ is its corresponding label.

% % For a user-defined coverage level $\alpha$, we compute a conformal threshold $\hat{\tau}_\alpha$. Given a test input $x_{\text{test}}$, we iterate through all potential outputs $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ and return the set $C_\alpha(x_{\text{test}})$ of all plausible outputs $y$ where $ f(x_{\text{test}}, y) \geq \hat{\tau}_\alpha $, for a chosen scoring function $ f $.

% A key dimension of reliability in large language models (LLMs) is their ability to detect and communicate when they are uncertain about a given query or piece of information. In clinical settings, where inaccurate or ungrounded outputs can mislead decision-making, robust mechanisms for uncertainty estimation are critical. 





A key dimension of reliability in large language models (LLMs) is their ability to detect and communicate when they are uncertain about a given query or piece of information. In clinical settings, where inaccurate or ungrounded outputs can mislead decision-making, robust mechanisms for uncertainty estimation are critical. When an LLM faces questions exceeding its familiarity or training scope, it ideally should communicate uncertainty or refrain from answering, rather than offering false confidence \citep{li2024mediq}. By quantifying how confident or uncertain a model is, LLMs can refrain from providing answers when knowledge gaps are significant \citep{kamath-etal-2020-selective, jiang2021can, whitehead2022reliable, feng2024don}. This section explores contemporary methods for modeling uncertainty, discusses their relevance to medical applications, and highlights the role of multi-LLM collaboration in reducing hallucinations.

\subsubsection{Methods for Confidence Estimation}

Uncertainty in an LLM’s output can be represented and managed through various techniques, each addressing different dimensions of reliability.

\textbf{Model-Level and Training-Based Approaches.}
Certain strategies integrate uncertainty estimation directly into the training process. For example, methods that introduce probabilistic layers or specialized loss functions can encourage models to produce calibrated confidence measures, rather than treating every prediction with equal certainty \citep{kamath-etal-2020-selective, jiang2021can}. Additionally, targeted knowledge integration during pretraining can reduce blind spots, although maintaining up-to-date domain coverage remains an ongoing challenge \citep{feng2024don}.

\textbf{Prompting and Post-Hoc Calibration.}
Another class of methods focuses on refining uncertainty estimates after the initial model output. Prompt-based strategies encourage the LLM to self-assess its confidence, while post-hoc calibration techniques, such as temperature scaling or external calibrators, adjust logits or embedding representations \citep{whitehead2022reliable, xie2024calibrating, tian2023just}. Empirical findings indicate that such techniques can improve reliability in medical diagnosis tasks \citep{savage2024llm, gao2024diagnostic}, though larger models are not always better calibrated \citep{desai2020calibration, srivastava2022beyond, geng2023survey}.

\textbf{Multi-LLM Collaboration.}
Relying solely on a single LLM for self-correction can be risky if the model has learned skewed or incomplete patterns \citep{kadavath2022language, ji2023survey, xie2023adaptive}. Multi-LLM collaboration attempts to reduce individual model biases by cross-verifying reasoning processes and outcomes. Voting or consensus-based approaches harness diverse model knowledge, mitigating hallucinations and overconfidence by highlighting discrepancies across peers \citep{yu2023kola, du2023improving, Bansal2024LLMAL, Feng2024KnowledgeCF}.

\textbf{Structured Uncertainty Sets.}
In some instances, abstaining entirely may omit potentially valid insights, especially when a model has partial confidence. Techniques like conformal prediction strike a balance between outright abstention and blind certainty by providing sets of plausible answers with quantifiable error guarantees \citep{angelopoulos2022gentleintroductionconformalprediction, mohri2024language}. Such methods let clinicians consider multiple options, each accompanied by a measure of confidence, rather than a single deterministic (and potentially incorrect) recommendation.

% \subsubsection{Confidence Estimation in High-Stakes Applications}

In high-stakes medical scenarios, reliably assessing uncertainty is paramount to preventing harmful outcomes. Models are often tasked with diagnosing critical conditions based on limited or ambiguous information. Direct prompts for confidence scores can help identify when the model is overstepping its reliable scope \citep{tian2023just, yang2024confidence}, but further refinements are frequently required.

\textbf{Low-Resource Specialties as Illustrative Cases.}
Some medical subfields, such as certain aspects of women’s health, suffer from limited training data and rapidly evolving guidelines \citep{kim2024effects}. While AI-driven tools can enhance patient education and self-care behaviors in these contexts, inaccuracies pose serious risks. Systems must therefore not only provide answers but also quantify and communicate any underlying uncertainties, improving the likelihood that clinicians and patients will seek validation for potentially flawed outputs \citep{wen2024abstention, tjandra2024semantic}.

\textbf{Abstention and Deliberation.}
When models generate multiple hypotheses without a single decisive answer, abstention thresholding allows them to refrain from giving conclusive guidance \citep{geng2024survey, steyvers2024calibration} and instead guiding them to ask additional questions \citep{li2024mediq}. In some cases, multi-step or multi-agent deliberation can further refine uncertainty estimates, prompting the LLM to re-check facts or invite additional input \citep{kadavath2022language, xie2023adaptive}. Such approaches reduce the risk of passing on guesswork as definitive advice, a particular concern in time-sensitive medical scenarios.

\textbf{Empirical Insights from Clinical Settings.}
Recent work by \citet{rodman2023ai} demonstrated that GPT-4 can sometimes surpass clinicians in estimating disease likelihoods, yet both the model and human experts deviated substantially from actual prevalence rates. Meanwhile, exploration in embodied agents like Voyager \citep{wang2023voyager} shows that advanced LLM frameworks often lack robust uncertainty quantification—even outside the medical domain. These findings underscore the broader relevance of uncertainty estimation: without systematic calibration, confident but unfounded responses can overshadow the potential benefits of AI in healthcare.

By designing models that effectively convey when they are uncertain—whether via post-hoc calibration, structured confidence sets, or consensus-driven deliberation—practitioners can better interpret and validate AI outputs. Such strategies are crucial for minimizing risk in clinical diagnostics, where the cost of error can be immediate and severe.

\subsubsection{Confidence Estimation in High-Stakes Applications}\label{subsubsec:conf_estim_highstakes}

% In high-stakes scenarios, particularly in women's health, robust confidence estimation in LLM responses is essential to prevent the dissemination of incorrect or misleading information. \citet{kim2024effects} conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrating that AI chatbot interventions can positively impact women's health outcomes, including reductions in anxiety and depression and improvements in self-care behaviors. However, ensuring accurate information delivery remains a critical challenge.

% A women's health chatbot should not only provide information but also estimate its uncertainty accurately, \textit{abstain} from answering when not confident, and \textit{proactively acquire more information} through user interaction. Traditional methods such as post-hoc calibration and prompting strategies offer partial improvements in confidence estimation but lack the formal guarantees required for reliable abstention decisions \citep{geng2024survey}.

% \citet{wen2024abstention} provided a comprehensive survey on abstention strategies in LLMs, exploring methods to enable models to recognize when to withdraw responses due to uncertainty. Similarly, \citet{tjandra2024semantic} proposed fine-tuning LLMs to appropriately abstain using semantic entropy, reducing hallucinations without requiring external labels. In critical applications such as healthcare care, \citet{steyvers2024calibration} examined the calibration gap between model and human confidence in LLMs, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated models for user trust.

% Beyond abstention, factual guarantees in LLM outputs are an emerging area of research. \citet{tian2023just} explored prompting strategies to extract self-assessed confidence levels from LLMs. \citet{mohri2024language} introduced conformal factuality guarantees, using conformal prediction to ensure that high-probability correctness assurances can be applied to LLM outputs.

% A study by \citet{rodman2023ai} demonstrated that directly prompting GPT-4 to estimate the likelihood of a possible disease outperformed the estimates of the clinician. However, both GPT-4 and clinicians deviated significantly from the true range of disease prevalence, reinforcing the need for improved confidence estimation techniques.

% Having outlined various data-centric, model-centric, and knowledge-integration strategies to mitigate medical hallucinations in LLMs, we now turn to an empirical evaluation of their effectiveness. In the following Section \ref{sec:llm_exp}, we describe our experimental setup, benchmark datasets, and results in assessing the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs under different mitigation techniques.

% Robust confidence estimation in LLM outputs is particularly important in high-stakes domains where misinformation can cause harmful outcomes. These domains often feature significant uncertainty and a scarcity of specialized data resources, making reliable AI support both challenging and essential. Women’s health, for example, represents one such low-resource domain: although it accounts for a substantial share of medical needs, comprehensive datasets and specialized models are sometimes lacking. 
% % In a recent meta-analysis, \citet{kim2024effects} found that AI chatbots can positively impact women’s health outcomes by reducing anxiety and depression and encouraging self-care. Yet, these 
% Any benefits promised by an integration with LLMs hinge on accurate information delivery, highlighting the need for robust calibration and effective abstention protocols.

% Confidence estimation methods that incorporate post-hoc calibration, prompting, or abstention thresholds offer partial solutions but rarely carry formal correctness guarantees \citep{geng2024survey}. \citet{wen2024abstention} provide an extensive review of abstention strategies in LLMs, showing how well-designed methods can reduce hallucinations by enabling a model to refrain from giving answers in uncertain contexts. \citet{tjandra2024semantic} propose fine-tuning LLMs based on semantic entropy, driving the model to abstain when it cannot generate well-grounded responses. In clinical applications, \citet{steyvers2024calibration} found that discrepancies between model confidence and human expectations can undermine trust, further stressing the necessity for systematic calibration.

% Beyond abstention, factuality guarantees in LLM outputs are also drawing increasing attention. \citet{tian2023just} introduced prompting approaches to elicit self-assessed confidence from LLMs. \citet{mohri2024language} explored conformal prediction to establish probabilistic correctness bounds for LLM responses. Meanwhile, \citet{rodman2023ai} showed that GPT-4 can sometimes provide more precise likelihood estimates for diseases than human clinicians, although both AI and human estimates often deviated from true disease prevalence. Such findings underscore the importance of designing models that can both convey and refine their uncertainty judgments, whether in low-resource domains like women’s health or other high-stakes areas of medical practice.

Recent advances in medical LLM applications have demonstrated several prompting strategies for hallucination mitigation, each employing distinct cognitive frameworks to enhance diagnostic reliability. The \textbf{chain-of-medical-thought (CoMT)} \citep{jiang2024comt} approach restructures medical report generation by decomposing radiological analysis into sequential clinical reasoning steps. Implemented for chest X-ray and CT scan interpretation, this method prompts models to first identify anatomical structures (\textit{``Observe lung fields for opacities"}), then analyze pathological indicators (\textit{``Assess bronchial wall thickening patterns"}), and finally synthesize diagnostic conclusions (\textit{``Correlate findings with clinical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}). By mirroring radiologists' diagnostic workflows through structured prompt templates, CoMT reduced catastrophic hallucinations by 38\% compared to conventional report generation methods, as measured through the MediHall Score metric evaluating disease omission/fabrication rates.

The interactive \textbf{self-reflection methodology} introduces a recursive prompting architecture for medical question answering systems \citep{ji2023mitigatinghallucinationlargelanguage}. When deployed in clinical decision support scenarios, this approach initiates with a knowledge acquisition prompt (\textit{``Generate relevant biomedical concepts for: \{patient presentation\}"}), followed by iterative fact-checking queries (\textit{``Verify consistency between \{generated concept\} and current medical guidelines"}). For a case study involving rare disease diagnosis, this multi-turn prompting strategy improved answer entailment scores by 27\% across five LLM architectures by forcing models to reconcile generated content with internal knowledge representations through prompts like \textit{``Revise previous diagnosis considering [contradictory finding]"}. Human evaluations showed this reflection loop reduced critical hallucinations (misclassified disease types) by 41\% in pediatric oncology use cases.

\textbf{Semantic prompt enrichment} \citep{penkov2024mitigating} combines biomedical entity recognition with ontological grounding to constrain LLM outputs. Through integration of BioBERT for clinical concept extraction and ChEBI for chemical ontology alignment, this strategy appends verified domain knowledge directly to prompts. A representative implementation for drug interaction queries structures prompts as: \textit{``Using ChEBI identifiers [CHEBI:48607=ibuprofen] and [CHEBI:35475=warfarin], describe metabolic pathway interactions considering CYP2C9 polymorphism risks"}. When applied to pharmacological report generation, this method reduced attribute hallucinations (incorrect dosage/formulation details) by 33\% compared to baseline prompts, while maintaining 92\% terminological consistency with FDA drug labeling databases. The technique demonstrates particular efficacy in oncology applications where precise molecular descriptor usage is critical - staging reports showed 29\% fewer TNM classification errors when ontology-enriched prompts specified histological grading criteria.

\textbf{Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK)} \citep{li2024chain} is a framework that dynamically incorporates domain knowledge from diverse sources to enhance the facutal correctness of LLMs. CoK generates an initial rationale while identifying relevant knowledge domains, and dynamically refines the rationale with knowledge from the identified domains to provide more factually correct responses. The authors evaluate CoK across various domain-specific datasets, including medical, physical, and biological fields, demonstrating an average improvement of 4.9\% in accuracy compared to the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline. To further validate the framework's impact on reducing hallucinations, they present evidence of enhanced factual accuracy on single- and multi-step reasoning tasks using ProgramFC, a factual verification method based on Wikipedia. Additionally, human evaluations corroborate these findings, confirming that CoK consistently yields more accurate responses than the CoT baseline.

% Prompt engineering techniques focus on crafting effective prompts to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate and relevant responses while mitigating hallucinations. These techniques have been widely adopted in medical applications due to their ability to enhance model performance without requiring external knowledge bases or API integrations.

% \cite{zaghir2024} conducted a scoping review of 114 studies from 2022 to 2024, analyzing the widespread use of prompt engineering techniques in medical applications. They found that, among the various types of prompt engineering types, 78 studies focused on \textbf{prompt design (PD)}, the practice of crafting the prompt for LLM input. Among the prompt design engineering techniques, \textbf{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)} was most commonly used to improve LLM reasoning and factual accuracy.

\section{Experiments on Medical Hallucination Benchmark}
\label{sec:llm_exp}

\subsection{Setup}

We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various hallucination mitigation techniques on Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Med-HALT benchmark \citep{pal2023medhalt}.  We compared the performance of several LLMs across different prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented methods. Our evaluation pipeline used UMLSBERT \citep{michalopoulos2020umlsbert}, a specialized medical text embedding model, to assess the semantic similarity between generated responses and the ground truth medical information.  The following methods were implemented:

\textbf{Base:}  This method served as our baseline.  LLMs were directly queried with the questions from the Med-HALT benchmark without any additional context or instructions.  This approach allows us to assess the inherent hallucination tendencies of the LLMs in a zero-shot setting. The prompt consisted solely of the medical question.

\textbf{System Prompt:} We prepended a system prompt to the user's question. These system prompts were designed to guide the LLM towards providing accurate and reliable medical information, explicitly discouraging the generation of fabricated content. Examples of system prompts included instructions to act as a knowledgeable medical expert and to avoid making assumptions. However, it's important to note that research \citep{zheng-etal-2024-helpful} has questioned the consistent effectiveness of personas and system prompts in improving LLM performance on objective tasks. While our prompts aimed to enhance reliability, studies suggest that the impact of such prompts, particularly those relying on personas, might be variable and not always lead to significant performance gains.

\textbf{CoT:} We implemented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by appending the phrase ``\textit{Let's think step by step.}" to each question. This encourages the LLM to articulate its reasoning process explicitly, which can improve accuracy by facilitating the identification and correction of errors during the generation process. This aligns with the principle of eliciting explicit reasoning steps from LLMs to enhance performance on complex tasks \citep{wei2022chain}. Furthermore, the generation of natural language explanations, as explored in work like e-SNLI \citep{camburu2018snli}, is related to CoT in its aim to make the model's reasoning more transparent and potentially improve its factual correctness. This encourages the LLM to articulate its reasoning process explicitly, which can improve accuracy by facilitating the identification and correction of errors during the generation process.

\textbf{RAG:} We employed MedRAG \citep{xiong2024benchmarking}, a retrieval-augmented generation model specifically designed for the medical domain. MedRAG utilizes a knowledge graph (KG) to enhance reasoning capabilities.  For each Med-HALT question, we used MedRAG to retrieve relevant medical knowledge from the KG. This retrieved knowledge was then concatenated with the original question and provided as input to the LLM.  This allows the LLM to generate responses grounded in external, validated medical information.  We adapted publicly available MedRAG code and its associated KG for this implementation.

\textbf{Internet Search:}  This approach leverages real-time internet search to provide LLMs with up-to-date information.  We utilized the \texttt{SerpAPIWrapper} from \texttt{langchain} to perform Google searches.  
% The process was implemented as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item The Med-HALT question was used as the search query for \texttt{SerpAPIWrapper}.
%     \item A \texttt{langchain Tool} was created to encapsulate the search functionality.
%     \item The search was executed using this \texttt{Tool}.
%     \item The top search results were combined with the original Med-HALT question to create a combined prompt.
%     \item This combined prompt was then input to the LLMs for response generation.
% \end{enumerate}



\subsection{Dataset \& Tasks}
We utilized the Medical Domain Hallucination Test (Med-HALT) benchmark \citep{pal2023medhalt} that has been specifically designed to assess and quantify hallucinations in LLMs within the medical domain. %It addresses the critical need for robust evaluation in this high-stakes field, where misinformation can have serious consequences for patient care. The Med-HALT dataset is a diverse, multinational collection of medical queries and ground truth responses, derived from various sources to ensure broad coverage and complexity. 
The Med-HALT benchmark employs a two-tiered approach, categorizing hallucination tests into:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reasoning Hallucination Tests (RHTs):} These tests evaluate an LLM's ability to reason accurately with medical information and generate logically sound and factually correct outputs without fabricating information. RHTs are further divided into:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{False Confidence Test (FCT):}  Assesses if a model can evaluate the validity of a randomly suggested "correct" answer to a medical question, requiring it to discern correctness and provide detailed justifications, highlighting its ability to avoid unwarranted certainty.
            \item \textbf{None of the Above (NOTA) Test:} Challenges models to identify when none of the provided multiple-choice options are correct, requiring them to recognize irrelevant or incorrect information and justify the "None of the Above" selection.
            \item \textbf{Fake Questions Test (FQT):}  Examines a model's ability to identify and appropriately handle nonsensical or artificially generated medical questions, testing its capacity to discern legitimate queries from fabricated ones.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory Hallucination Tests (MHTs):} These tests focus on evaluating an LLM's ability to accurately recall and retrieve factual biomedical information from its training data. MHTs include tasks such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Abstract-to-Link Test:}  Models are given a PubMed abstract and tasked with generating the corresponding PubMed URL.
            \item \textbf{PMID-to-Title Test:} Models are provided with a PubMed ID (PMID) and asked to generate the correct article title.
            \item \textbf{Title-to-Link Test:} Models are given a PubMed article title and prompted to provide the PubMed URL.
            \item \textbf{Link-to-Title Test:} Models are given a PubMed URL and asked to generate the corresponding article title.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

By incorporating these diverse tasks, Med-HALT provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the multifaceted nature of medical hallucinations in LLMs, assessing both reasoning and memory-related inaccuracies.

% \subsection{Models}
% We evaluated a diverse set of LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to medical-specific models:

\subsection{Metrics}

\paragraph{Hallucination Pointwise Score}
The \textit{Pointwise Score} used in Med-HALT \citep{pal2023medhalt} is designed to provide an in-depth evaluation of model performance, considering both correct answers and incorrect ones with a penalty. It is calculated as the average score across the samples, where each correct prediction is awarded a positive score ($P_c = +1$) and each incorrect prediction incurs a negative penalty ($P_w = -0.25$). The formula for the Pointwise Score ($S$) is given by:

\begin{equation}
S = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \mathbb{I}(y_i = \hat{y}_i) \cdot P_c + \mathbb{I}(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i) \cdot P_w \right) \label{eq:pointwise_score}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is the final Pointwise Score.
    \item $N$ is the total number of samples.
    \item $y_i$ is the true label for the $i$-th sample.
    \item $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted label for the $i$-th sample.
    \item $\mathbb{I}(\text{condition})$ is the indicator function, which returns 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise.
    \item $P_c = 1$ is the points awarded for a correct prediction.
    \item $P_w = -0.25$ is the points deducted for an incorrect prediction.
\end{itemize}

% This metric provides a nuanced view of model accuracy, penalizing incorrect answers to reflect the potential risks associated with medical misinformation.

\paragraph{Similarity Score}
The \textit{Similarity Score} assesses the semantic similarity between the model's generated responses and the ground truth correct answer, as well as the similarity between the response and the original question. This is achieved using \texttt{UMLSBERT}, a specialized medical text embedding model, and \texttt{cosine\_similarity}. The process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Embedding Generation with UMLSBERT:} For each question in the Med-HALT benchmark, and for each type of model output (Base, System Prompt, CoT, MedRAG, Internet Search), the following texts are encoded into embeddings using \texttt{UMLSBERT}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The original medical \textit{question}.
        \item The \textit{correct option} (ground truth answer).
        \item The model's generated \textit{output} for each method.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cosine Similarity Calculation:}  After obtaining the embeddings, the cosine similarity is calculated for each model output against two references:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer Similarity:} The cosine similarity between the embedding of the \textit{correct option} and the embedding of the model's \textit{output}. This measures how semantically similar the generated response is to the ground truth answer.
        \item \textbf{Question Similarity:} The cosine similarity between the embedding of the original \textit{question} and the embedding of the model's \textit{output}. This evaluates how much the generated response is semantically related to the input question itself.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Combined Similarity Score:} A \textit{combined score} is then computed as the average of the \textit{answer similarity} and the \textit{question similarity}:
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{Combined Score} = \frac{\text{Answer Similarity} + \text{Question Similarity}}{2}
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Models}

To assess medical hallucinations comprehensively, we evaluated a diverse set of foundation models, selected to represent a range of architectures, training paradigms, and domain specializations. Our selection included both general-purpose models, which represent the forefront of broadly applicable LLM technology, and medical-purpose models, designed or fine-tuned specifically for healthcare applications. This approach allowed us to compare hallucination tendencies across models with varying levels of domain expertise and general reasoning capabilities.

\paragraph{General-Purpose LLMs} These models are trained on extensive datasets encompassing general text and code, designed for broad applicability across diverse tasks. Their inclusion helps establish a baseline for hallucination performance and assesses how well general reasoning capabilities translate to the medical domain. Within this category are models from OpenAI and Google. OpenAI Models include \texttt{o3-mini} and \texttt{o1-preview}, introduced in January 2025 and September 2024 respectively and designed to spend more time ``thinking" before responding, enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks like science, coding, and mathematics. Also included are \texttt{GPT-4o} and \texttt{GPT-4o-mini}, released in May and July 2024 respectively. GPT-4o is a multimodal model capable of processing and generating text, images, and audio, offering enhanced reasoning and factual accuracy, while \texttt{GPT-4o-mini} is a smaller, more cost-effective version that maintains strong performance with greater efficiency. Google Gemini Models feature \texttt{Gemini 2.0 Thinking} and \texttt{Gemini 2.0 Flash}, launched in Febuary 2025 and December 2024 respectively, designed for enhanced reasoning and efficient, cost-effective performance with multimodal input support. \texttt{Gemini 1.5 Flash}, released in May 2024, is optimized for speed and efficiency, offering low latency and enhanced performance.

\paragraph{Medical-Purpose LLMs} These models are specifically adapted or trained for medical or biomedical tasks. Their inclusion is crucial for understanding whether domain-specific training or fine-tuning effectively reduces medical hallucinations compared to general-purpose models. This category includes \texttt{PMC-LLaMA} and \texttt{Alpaca} Variants. \texttt{PMC-LLaMA} is a model fine-tuned from \texttt{LLaMA} on PubMed Central (PMC), a free archive of biomedical and life sciences literature. It is designed to enhance performance in medical question answering and knowledge retrieval by leveraging a large corpus of medical research papers. Alpaca Variants include \texttt{AlphaCare-13B}, an Alpaca style Llama based model further fine-tuned on a medical question-answering dataset, aiming to improve clinical reasoning and dialogue capabilities. \texttt{MedAlpaca-13B} is another Alpaca style Llama based model, fine-tuned on a combination of medical datasets, including medical question-answering and clinical text, designed to perform well on a range of medical NLP tasks.


% Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with newer general-purpose models (particularly gemini-2.0 and o1-preview) demonstrating superior hallucination resistance. These models achieved hallucination resistances of 97.3\% and 89.1\% respectively with CoT prompting, significantly outperforming medical-specific models. Notably, the similarity scores demonstrate that more advanced models maintain higher semantic relevance while reducing hallucination rates, suggesting better integration of medical knowledge.

\begin{figure}[htpb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{imgs/llm_experiments.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Hallucination Pointwise Score vs. Similarity Score of LLMs on the Med-Halt hallucination benchmark.} This result reveals that the recent models (e.g. o3-mini, deepseek-r1, and gemini-2.0-flash) typically start with high baseline hallucination resistance and tend to see moderate but consistent gains from a simple CoT, while previous models including medical-purpose LLMs often begin at low hallucination resistance yet can benefit from different approaches (e.g. Search, CoT, and System Prompt). Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation can be less effective if the model struggles to reconcile retrieved information with its internal knowledge.}
    \label{fig:experiment1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}
\paragraph{Advanced Reasoning Models Maintain Hallucination Resistance Leadership}
Our experimental results, visualized in Figure \ref{fig:experiment1}, reinforce the trend of advanced reasoning models excelling in hallucination prevention. Notably, \texttt{gemini-2.0-thinking} emerges as a top performer, exhibiting the highest hallucination resistance among the models tested, especially when augmented with Search. \texttt{gemini-2.0} and \texttt{deepseek-r1} also demonstrate robust hallucination resistance, positioning themselves alongside \texttt{o1-preview} and outperforming earlier models. This sustained superiority of general-purpose models emphasizes that cutting-edge advancements in broad language understanding are directly contributing to enhanced reliability in specialized domains like medicine.
\paragraph{CoT Remains a Consistently Effective Strategy, with System Prompting Providing Complementary Gains}
Re-examining the impact of prompting strategies, CoT continues to be a highly effective technique across various models for mitigating hallucinations. The plot further reveals that System Prompting also offers noticeable improvements, often working synergistically with CoT to further reduce hallucination rates, particularly in models like \texttt{o3-mini} and \texttt{deepSeek-r1}. These findings underscore the importance of guiding model reasoning through explicit steps (CoT) and providing clear instructions for reliable output generation (System Prompt) to enhance factual accuracy in medical contexts.
\paragraph{Similarity Scores Strongly Correlate with Hallucination Resistance, Differentiating Model Performance Tiers}
The analysis of similarity scores in Figure 5 reveals a clear stratification of models. The highest-performing models such as \texttt{gemini-2.0-thinking}, \texttt{gemini-2.0}, and \texttt{deepseek-r1} cluster in the high similarity range (0.7-0.9), indicating a strong semantic alignment of their outputs with ground truth medical information. In contrast, medical-specific models (\texttt{pmc-llama}, \texttt{medalpaca}, \texttt{alpacare}) consistently exhibit lower similarity scores (0.1-0.4) alongside higher hallucination rates. This robust correlation between semantic similarity and hallucination resistance reinforces the notion that a deeper understanding of medical concepts, as reflected in higher similarity scores, is a critical factor in minimizing factual errors in LLM-generated medical content.
\paragraph{Domain-Specific Training Still Shows Limitations Compared to Advanced General Capabilities}
The updated results further highlight the previously observed limitations of domain-specific models. Despite being trained on medical data, models like \texttt{pmc-llama} and \texttt{medalpaca} continue to exhibit significantly higher hallucination rates (around 60\%) and lower similarity scores compared to advanced general-purpose models. This persistent trend suggests that while domain-specific data is valuable, the broader language understanding and reasoning capabilities developed in state-of-the-art general models are arguably more crucial for achieving high reliability in complex medical tasks. The superior performance of models like \texttt{deepseek-r1} and \texttt{o3-mini}, which are not explicitly medical-focused but possess strong general language capabilities, further supports this observation.
\paragraph{Search-Augmented Generation Shows Nuanced Impact}
The effectiveness of search-augmented generation presents a more nuanced picture with the inclusion of newer models. While the trend of diminishing returns for search augmentation in advanced models remains generally true, \texttt{gemini-2.0-thinking} demonstrates a notable benefit from search, achieving the lowest hallucination score with this method. This suggests that even the most capable models can still leverage external, up-to-date information to further refine their responses and minimize hallucinations, particularly when dealing with rapidly evolving medical knowledge. However, for models like \texttt{deepseek-r1} and \texttt{o3-mini}, the gain from search augmentation appears less pronounced, reinforcing the overall trend that highly advanced architectures are increasingly relying on their internal knowledge base for accuracy.

Physicians then annotate LLM-generated responses to identify medical hallucinations and potential risks, as exemplified by the inaccurate reporting of `irregular pulse' in the patient's Emergency Department findings.}
    \label{fig:annotation}
\end{figure}

\section{Annotations of Medical Hallucination with Clinical Case Records}
\label{sec:new_sec7}

To rigorously evaluate the presence and nature of hallucinations in LLMs within the clinical domain, we employed a structured annotation process.  We built upon established frameworks for hallucination and risk assessment, drawing specifically from the hallucination typology proposed by \citet{hegselmann2024data} and the risk level framework from \citet{asgari2024framework} (Figure \ref{fig:annotation}) and used the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Case Reports for LLM inferences. 

% \subsection{Tests for Detecting Hallucinations in Clinical Language Models}

\subsection{Annotation Tasks for Detecting Medical Hallucination}

We utilized the three representative evaluation tests outlined in Table \ref{tab:hallucination-detect} to probe LLMs for weaknesses in consistency, factual accuracy, and their ability to navigate the complexities and ambiguities inherent in clinical information (Figure \ref{fig:annotation}). These tests were designed to elicit different types of potential hallucinations.  When hallucinations occur, they can manifest in various forms, such as incorrect diagnoses, the use of confusing or inappropriate medical terminology, or the presentation of contradictory findings within a patient's case. 

Seven experienced annotators, each holding an MD degree or equivalent clinical expertise (including a geriatrician and an otolaryngologist), independently evaluated the generated outputs for each medical case record. Annotators were tasked with identifying and categorizing any hallucinations according to the types in Table \ref{tab:hallucination-types} and assigning a corresponding risk level based on the definitions in Table \ref{tab:risk-levels}. This rigorous annotation process allowed us to gain a granular understanding of the types and severity of hallucinations produced by LLMs in the medical domain.

\subsection{Dataset: The New England Journal of Medicine Case Reports}

To evaluate the hallucination of LLMs, we used case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital, published in \textit{The New England Journal of Medicine} (NEJM) \citep{brinkmann2024building}. We focused on the ``Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital" series, filtering for Clinical Cases published between November 2000 and November 2018 to exclude cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This selection aimed to provide a representative sample of diverse medical conditions encountered in a major academic medical center.
Leveraging NEJM's categorization of medical specialties, we curated a dataset of 20 case reports, ensuring representation across a wide range of clinical areas. Each case was chosen to highlight certain challenges for the LLMs, e.g., complex differential diagnosis, detailed lab results. The distribution of cases across specialties, as defined by NEJM, is as follows (with the number of cases in the broader NEJM corpus for context):

Our smaller set of 20 cases sought to reflect this distribution, though not perfectly proportionally, to ensure coverage of common and less-frequent conditions.

\subsection{Qualitative Evaluation of Clinical Reasoning Tasks Using NEJM Case Reports}
\label{subsec:qualitative}
To qualitatively assess the LLM's clinical reasoning abilities, we designed three targeted tasks, each focusing on a crucial aspect of medical problem-solving: 1) chronological ordering of events, 2) lab data interpretation, and 3) differential diagnosis generation. These tasks were designed to mimic essential steps in clinical practice, from understanding the patient's history to formulating a diagnosis.

\paragraph{Chronological Ordering Test}
We first evaluated the LLM's ability to sequence clinical events, a cornerstone of medical history taking and understanding disease trajectories. For this Chronological Ordering Test, we prompted the LLM with the question: \textit{``Order the key events chronologically and identify temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions."} Our results indicate that while the generated chronological ordering by the LLM was generally correct, it missed several important landmark events of the patient. For instance, in the case of opioid use disorder \citep{walley2019case}, crucial details regarding the patient's history of oxycodone and cocaine use were absent from the generated timeline. These omissions are clinically significant as they provide context for the patient's presentation. Furthermore, in the coronary artery dissection case \citep{tsiaras2017case}, key treatment details, such as the administration of isosorbide mononitrate, were omitted. Precise temporal markers, such as specific dates for key events like hospital admission in the adenocarcinoma patient case \citep{murphy2018case}, were also lacking. Lastly, we observed in \citep{murphy2018case} that the LLM struggled to group concurrent events, incorrectly treating them as separate, sequential occurrences.

\paragraph{Lab Test Understanding Test}
Next, we stress-tested the LLM's capacity to interpret laboratory test results and, critically, to explain their clinical significance in relation to the patient's symptoms. For this Lab Data Understanding Test, we used the prompt: \textit{``Analyze the laboratory findings and explain their clinical significance in relation to the patient's symptoms."} Our findings indicate that while the LLM could identify most laboratory results, it frequently failed to highlight and interpret abnormal values critical to understanding the patient's conditions, particularly in cases like \citep{murphy2018case} and \citep{kazi2020case}. For example, in the adenocarcinoma patient case \citep{murphy2018case}, the patient's laboratory examination revealed a significantly elevated lactate level, a critical indicator of tissue hypoxia. Alarmingly, the LLM failed to report this crucial abnormality in its generated response, demonstrating a potential gap in its ability to prioritize and interpret clinically significant lab results.

\paragraph{Differential Diagnosis Test}
Finally, we assessed the LLM's ability to generate differential diagnoses, a vital skill in clinical decision-making. For the Differential Diagnosis Test, we asked: \textit{``Based on the Presentation of Case, Lab Data and Images, what would be the possible diagnosis?"} When generating decision trees for differential diagnoses, the LLM was generally accurate in identifying primary considerations. However, it occasionally overlooked or minimized less obvious, yet clinically relevant, differential diagnoses. For instance, in the coronary artery dissection case \citep{tsiaras2017case}, the LLM missed the potential for esophageal spasm as a differential diagnosis, highlighting a tendency to focus on the most prominent diagnoses and potentially overlooking a broader spectrum of possibilities.

\subsection{Analysis of Hallucination Rates and Risk Distributions Across Tasks and Models}
Based on expert annotations (Subsection \ref{subsec:qualitative}), we rigorously quantified hallucination rates and the severity of associated clinical risks for five prominent LLMs: `o1', `gemini-2.0-flash-exp', `gpt-4o',`gemini-1.5-flash', and `claude-3.5 sonnet' (see Figure \ref{fig:main}). Clinical risks were systematically categorized across a granular scale from `No Risk' (0) to `Catastrophic' (5), allowing for a nuanced evaluation of both the frequency and potential clinical ramifications of LLM-generated inaccuracies in medical contexts.

\paragraph{Overall Hallucination Rates and Task-Specific Trends}
A notable task-specific trend emerged: Diagnosis Prediction consistently exhibited the lowest overall hallucination rates across all models, ranging from 0\% to 22\%. Conversely, tasks demanding precise factual recall and temporal integration – Chronological Ordering (0.25 - 24.6\%) and Lab Data Understanding (0.25 - 18.7\%) – presented significantly higher hallucination frequencies. This finding challenges a simplistic assumption that diagnostic tasks, often perceived as complex inferential problems, are inherently more error-prone for LLMs. Instead, our results suggest that current LLM architectures may possess a relative strength in pattern recognition and diagnostic inference within medical case reports, but struggle with the more fundamental tasks of accurately extracting and synthesizing detailed factual and temporal information directly from clinical text. 

% This disparity may reflect underlying biases in training data or architectural limitations in handling nuanced temporal relationships and factual grounding within lengthy medical narratives.

\paragraph{Model-Specific Hallucination Rates}
GPT-4o consistently demonstrated the highest propensity for hallucinations in tasks requiring factual and temporal accuracy. Specifically, its hallucination rates in Chronological Ordering (24.6\%) and Lab Data Understanding (18.7\%) were markedly elevated compared to other models. Crucially, a substantial proportion of these hallucinations were independently classified by medical experts as posing `Significant' or `Considerable' clinical risk, highlighting not just the frequency but also the potential clinical impact of GPT-4o's inaccuracies in these fundamental tasks. Interestingly, while GPT-4o’s hallucination rate in Diagnosis Prediction was also comparatively high in absolute terms (22.0\%), it was marginally lower than that observed for Gemini-2.0-flash-exp (2.25\%, although a potential data discrepancy between output logs and visual representation warrants further investigation). 
% This suggests a possible trade-off in GPT-4o's design, potentially prioritizing broader knowledge coverage and inferential capabilities over meticulous factual and temporal accuracy in specific medical case details.

The Gemini model family exhibited divergent performance characteristics. Gemini-2.0-flash-exp consistently maintained low hallucination rates across all three tasks, demonstrating relative strength in both factual/temporal processing and diagnostic inference. Its rates were notably low for Chronological Ordering (2.25\%), Lab Data Understanding (2.25\%), and Diagnosis Prediction (1.0\%, with the aforementioned data discrepancy). In contrast, Gemini-1.5-flash displayed moderately elevated hallucination rates, particularly in Lab Data Understanding (12.3\%) and Chronological Ordering (5.0\%). While Gemini-1.5-flash also generated errors categorized as `Significant' and `Considerable' risk, these occurred at lower frequencies than observed with GPT-4o. 
% This intra-family variability within the Gemini models underscores the sensitivity of LLM performance to architectural and training nuances, even within closely related model families.

Claude-3.5 and o1 consistently emerged as the top-performing models across this evaluation, exhibiting the lowest hallucination rates across all tasks and risk categories. Remarkably, both models achieved a 0\% hallucination rate in the Diagnosis Prediction task, suggesting a high degree of reliability for diagnostic inference within this specific context. Claude-3.5 demonstrated exceptionally low hallucination rates of 0.5\% (Chronological Ordering) and 0.25\% (Lab Data Understanding). o1 mirrored this strong performance, with equally low or slightly superior rates of 0.25\% for both Chronological Ordering and Lab Data Understanding. 

% This consistent outperformance suggests that Claude-3.5 and o1 may employ architectural or training strategies that enhance their factual grounding and temporal reasoning abilities within medical text, leading to a more robust and reliable performance profile, particularly for critical tasks like diagnosis and information extraction.

\paragraph{Risk Level Distribution and Clinical Implications}
While GPT-4o's higher hallucination frequency and associated clinical risk severity in Chronological Ordering and Lab Data Understanding tasks are concerning, the surprisingly low overall hallucination rates in Diagnosis Prediction – especially the 0\% rate achieved by Claude-3.5 and o1 – offer a nuanced perspective. These findings indicate that while current LLMs are not uniformly reliable across all clinical reasoning tasks, specific models, such as Claude-3.5 and o1, may possess a nascent but promising aptitude for diagnostic inference within structured medical case presentations. However, the consistent presence of `Significant' and `Considerable' risk errors even within models exhibiting lower aggregate hallucination rates underscores a critical and overarching implication: irrespective of overall performance metrics, the deployment of any current LLM in clinical settings necessitates rigorous, task-specific validation protocols, continuous performance monitoring, and careful integration within human-in-the-loop workflows. The potential for even low-frequency, but high-risk, hallucinations in fundamental tasks like temporal sequencing and factual recall necessitates a cautious and evidence-driven approach to LLM adoption in healthcare, prioritizing patient safety and clinical accuracy above claims of generalized AI proficiency.

\subsection{Inter-rater Reliability Analysis}
\paragraph{Quantifying Agreement in Hallucination Annotation.} To rigorously assess the consistency and reliability of our qualitative evaluations, we conducted a comprehensive inter-rater reliability analysis. Seven expert annotators, each possessing an MD degree or advanced clinical specialization, independently evaluated the outputs generated by the language models for each of the 20 clinical case reports.  This analysis focused on two critical dimensions of annotation: 1) hallucination type and 2) clinical risk level.  To quantify the degree of agreement among annotators, we employed the Average Pairwise Jaccard-like Index \citep{jaccard1901etude}, a metric well-suited for assessing set similarity and inter-rater agreement in annotation tasks.  The aggregate inter-rater agreement, averaged across all cases and language models, revealed a Jaccard-like Index of \textbf{0.272} for hallucination type classification and \textbf{0.347} for clinical risk level assessment.

\paragraph{Moderate Agreement in Medical Annotation.}  The observed Jaccard-like Index values, ranging from 0 to 1, indicate a moderate level of inter-rater agreement. While not indicative of perfect consensus, these values are interpretable within the context of the inherent complexity and subjectivity associated with nuanced medical text analysis. The moderate agreement reveaos the inherent challenges in achieving complete uniformity when evaluating subtle linguistic outputs for medical accuracy. For instance, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:doctor_annotation}, annotators exhibited variability in assessing the LLM's summary of a patient case. While the factual omission of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was clearly identified as an error by one annotator, the discrepancies in the reported timelines of doctor's visits were interpreted differently by others. This example highlights the difficulty in distinguishing between critical factual inaccuracies, like the missing surgery, and potentially less clinically impactful temporal inaccuracies or stylistic choices in summarizing complex medical timelines.

\paragraph{Sources of Subjectivity and Annotation Challenges.} Discussions with the expert annotators highlighted several key factors contributing to the observed inter-rater variability, many of which are exemplified in the annotation discrepancies shown in Figure \ref{fig:doctor_annotation}. A primary challenge lies in the nuanced distinction between bona fide medical hallucinations and less critical errors, a point clearly illustrated by Annotator 1's identification of the omitted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This omission represents a potentially clinically significant factual inaccuracy, arguably a `bona fide' hallucination due to its relevance to patient history and diagnosis. In contrast, Annotators 2 and 3 focused on temporal inaccuracies, highlighting discrepancies in the timeline of doctor's visits and the emergency department visit. These temporal issues, while potentially less clinically critical than the omission of a major surgery, still represent deviations from the source text and demonstrate the subjective interpretation of `accuracy' in summarizing complex medical timelines. This distinction necessitates a high degree of clinical judgment, as annotators must decide not only if information is factually present but also its clinical relevance and the acceptable level of summarization detail.

\paragraph{Methodological Rigor to Enhance Annotation Consistency.}  To mitigate potential subjectivity and enhance annotation consistency, we implemented several methodological safeguards prior to and during the annotation process. We developed a comprehensive and interactive annotation web interface \footnote{Accessible at \url{https://medical-hallucination.github.io/}} (Figure \ref{fig:annotation_ui1}, \ref{fig:annotation_ui2}, \ref{fig:annotation_ui3}) that incorporated detailed, operationally defined criteria and illustrative examples for each hallucination type and clinical risk level category.  Moreover, we established proactive communication channels with each annotator, encouraging open dialogue and providing ongoing support to address any ambiguities, interpretational challenges, or uncertain cases encountered during their assessments. This iterative process aimed to refine understanding of the annotation guidelines and promote convergent interpretations among the expert raters.

\paragraph{Time Investment and Expertise Demands in Medical Annotation.} The time investment required for annotation varied according to the annotator's domain expertise and the specific complexity of each case report.  Annotators were explicitly authorized and encouraged to leverage external, authoritative medical resources, including platforms such as UpToDate and PubMed, to inform their evaluations and ensure comprehensive assessments. The NEJM case reports, characterized by their depth, clinical intricacy, and frequent presentation of unusual or diagnostically challenging conditions, necessitated a substantial time commitment from each annotator for thorough and conscientious evaluation of the language model outputs.

\paragraph{Value of Qualitative Insights Despite Agreement Limitations.}  Despite the inherent challenges in achieving perfect inter-rater agreement in this complex domain, the patterns and trends emerging from our annotation process remain profoundly valuable.  The observed inter-rater reliability, while moderate, is sufficient to support the identification of systematic biases and error modalities within the language models' clinical reasoning and text generation capabilities. The qualitative insights derived from this rigorous annotation process offer critical directions for future model refinement and for developing strategies to mitigate clinically relevant medical hallucinations in large language models, as elaborated in the subsequent sections.


\section{Survey on AI/LLM Adoption and Medical Hallucinations Among Healthcare Professionals and Researchers}
\label{subsec:survey_results}

To investigate the perceptions and experiences of healthcare professionals and researchers regarding the use of AI / LLM tools, particularly regarding medical hallucinations, we conducted a survey aimed at individuals in the medical, research, and analytical fields (Figure \ref{fig:survey_insights}). A total of 75 professionals participated, primarily holding MD and/or PhD degrees, representing a diverse range of disciplines. The survey was conducted over a 94-day period, from September 15, 2024, to December 18, 2024, confirming the significant adoption of AI/LLM tools across these fields. Respondents indicated varied levels of trust in these tools, and notably, a substantial proportion reported encountering medical hallucinations—factually incorrect yet plausible outputs with medical relevance—in tasks critical to their work, such as literature reviews and clinical decision-making. Participants described employing verification strategies like cross-referencing and colleague consultation to manage these inaccuracies (see Appendix \ref{app:survey} for more details).

This study received an Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption from MIT COUHES (Committee On the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects) under exemption category 2 (Educational Testing, Surveys, Interviews, or Observation). The IRB determined that this research, involving surveys with professionals on their perceptions and experiences with AI/LLMs, posed minimal risk to participants and met the criteria for exemption.

The survey instrument, comprising 31 questions, was administered online, achieving a 93\% completion rate from 75 participants. The resulting dataset of 70 complete responses formed the primary input for our analysis, enabling both quantitative and qualitative examination of the data. For example, qualitative analysis of open-ended responses on hallucination instances allowed us to identify recurring themes, which were then quantified to assess the prevalence and impact of medical hallucinations.

Respondents identified key factors contributing to medical hallucinations, including limitations in training data and model architectures. They emphasized the importance of enhancing accuracy, explainability, and workflow integration in future AI/LLM tools. Furthermore, ethical considerations, privacy, and user education were highlighted as essential for responsible implementation. Despite acknowledging these challenges, participants generally expressed optimism about the future potential of AI in their fields. The following subsections detail these findings, providing a comprehensive analysis of respondent demographics, tool usage patterns, perceptions of correctness and hallucinations, and perspectives on the future development and safe implementation of AI/LLMs in healthcare and research.development and safe implementation of AI/LLMs in healthcare and research.

    \label{fig:survey_insights}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Respondent Demographics}
A total of 75 respondents participated in the survey, representing a diverse range of professional backgrounds within the medical and scientific communities. The largest group comprised Medical Researchers or Scientists (\( n = 29 \)), followed by Physicians or Medical Doctors (\( n = 23 \)), Data Scientists or Analysts (\( n = 15 \)), and Biomedical Engineering professionals (\( n = 5 \)), and others (\( n = 3 \)). Most respondents held advanced degrees, with 52 possessing either a PhD or MD, 11 holding a Master’s degree, 9 with a Bachelor’s degree and 3 with others. Their professional experience varied: 30 had worked 1--5 years, 25 had 6--10 years, and 19 had over 20 years of professional experience. This breadth of expertise and educational attainment ensured that the survey captured perspectives across multiple career stages and levels of specialization.

\subsection{Regional Representation}
The geographic distribution of participants highlighted regions with robust AI infrastructures. Asia was most strongly represented (\( n = 27 \)), followed by North America (\( n = 22 \)), South America (\( n = 9 \)), Europe (\( n = 8 \)), and Africa (\( n = 4 \)). While this sample provided valuable insights into regions where AI is more deeply integrated into healthcare and research workflows, the limited representation from other continents signals a need for future investigations to include a broader global perspective.

\subsection{Usage and Trust in AI/LLM Tools}
AI/LLM tools were well integrated into respondents’ routines: 40 used these tools daily, 9 used them several times per week, 13 used them few times a month, and 13 reported rare or no usage. Despite this widespread adoption, trust levels exhibited more caution. While 30 respondents expressed high trust in AI/LLM outputs, 25 reported moderate trust, and 12 indicated low trust. These findings suggest that although AI tools have gained significant traction, users remain mindful of their limitations, seeking greater reliability and interpretability.

\subsection{Perceived Correctness and Encounters with AI Hallucinations}
Perceptions of correctness were mixed. Of the 61 respondents, 21 believed that AI/LLM outputs were ``often correct", 18 stated they were ``sometimes correct", and 6 felt they were ``rarely correct". More critically, hallucinations—instances where the AI-generated plausible but incorrect information—were widely encountered by 37 respondents. Such hallucinations emerged across various tasks: literature reviews (38 mentions), data analysis (25), patient diagnostics (15), treatment recommendations (13), research paper drafting (16), grant writing (4), solving board exams (7), EHR summaries (4), patient communication (5), insurance billing (2), and citations (1). The prevalence of hallucinations in high-stakes tasks emphasized the need for meticulous verification and supplemental oversight.

\subsection{Responses to AI Hallucinations}
Respondents reported multiple strategies for addressing hallucinations. The most common approach was cross-referencing with external sources, employed by 85\% (51) of respondents. Other strategies included consulting colleagues or experts (12), ignoring erroneous outputs (11), ceasing use of the AI/LLM (11), directly informing the model of its mistake (1), updating the prompt (1), relying on known correct answers (1), and examining underlying code (1). Assessing the impact of these hallucinations on a 1--5 scale, 21 respondents rated the impact as moderate (3), 22 rated it as low (2), 9 saw no impact (1), 5 observed high impact (4), and 2 reported a very high impact (5). This distribution suggests that while hallucinations are common, many respondents have developed coping mechanisms that mitigate their overall influence.

\subsection{Causes of AI Hallucinations}
Respondents identified various potential causes of hallucinations. Insufficient training data was the most frequently cited factor (31 mentions), followed by biased training data (31), limitations in model architecture (30), lack of real-world context (26), overconfidence in AI-generated responses (24), inadequate transparency of AI decision-making (14), and others (4). These reflections underscore the multifaceted technical and ethical dimensions that must be addressed to improve model reliability.

\subsection{Limitations of AI/LLMs and Future Outlook}
lack of domain-specific knowledge emerged as the most critical limitation (30) followed by the privacy and data security concerns (25), accuracy issues (24), lack of standardization/validation of AI tools (23), difficulty in explaining AI decisions (21), a range of ethical considerations (20), and others (3).

Despite these concerns, the sentiment toward future developments was predominantly positive. A majority of respondents were optimistic (32) or very optimistic (24), with only a small minority expressing pessimism (3). Regarding the direct impact of AI/LLMs on patient health, opinions were mixed: 21 respondents believed there was an impact, 15 did not, 22 were uncertain, and 16 did not provide a clear stance. This divergence highlights an evolving field where the clinical value of LLMs is still being established.

\subsection{Commonly Used AI/LLM Tools}
In terms of specific technologies, ChatGPT was the most commonly mentioned tool (30 mentions), followed by Claude (20), Google Bard/Gemini (16), and open-source models such as Llama (15). Additional tools like Perplexity (9), Alphafold (2), Copilot (1), Scite and Consensus (1) also featured, reflecting a diverse ecosystem of AI solutions supporting medical and research professionals.

\subsection{Future Priorities and Hallucination Safeguards}
When asked about priorities for improvement, respondents emphasized enhancing accuracy (12 mentions), explainability (10), and ethical considerations, including bias reduction and privacy (8). Integration with existing tools (7) and improving speed and efficiency (3) were also noted. To safeguard against hallucinations, recommendations included manual cross-checking and verification (10), human supervision and expert review (8), confidence scoring or indicators (5), improving model architecture and training (5), training and education on AI limitations (4), and establishing ethical guidelines and standards (3). These suggestions outline a path toward greater reliability, transparency, and responsible integration of AI in healthcare.

\section{Regulatory and Legal Considerations for AI Hallucinations in Healthcare}

\subsection{Deploying AI Systems in the Real-world Healthcare as Medical Devices}

AI systems that developed to be deployed in real-world is necessarily related to the quality, safety, and reliability control. They are required to meet codes of ethics and regulatory frameworks established by expert societies and governmental bodies, as hallucinations from the models can lead to life-threatening consequences \citep{coiera2024ai}. To ensure quality control, reliable performance must be achieved \citep{blumenthal2024regulation} evaluated by regulatory frameworks. Although those frameworks for AI as a medical device are less developed compared to those for other types of medical devices, established rules and new policies from expert associations and governmental organizations apply when an AI tool is used as a medical device. Incorporating these regulatory requirements during development ensures that AI tools are effectively developed.

\subsubsection{Code of Ethics, Rules, and Regulations for AI Systems}

The FDA regulates AI-driven medical systems under the category of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) \citep{FDA_SaMD}. AI systems that diagnose, treat, or monitor patients must undergo Premarket Approval (PMA) \citep{FDA_PMA} or 510(k) clearance depending on three risk levels: low, medium, and high risk \citep{FDA_510k_Clearances}. The FDA has also developed Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP) \citep{FDA_GMLP} to guide AI systems to be safely deployed. 

American Medical Association (AMA) established the guidelines for the use of AI tools in healthcare, emphasizing the principles of transparency, physician oversight, and patient safety \citep{AMA_AI_Principles} on top of the code of medical ethics \citep{PMC3399321} These guidelines mandate that AI systems are designed to augment, rather than replace, clinical judgment, ensuring that the responsibility for medical decisions remains with the physician. According to the code of ethics, they are required to exercise their professional discretion in interpreting and applying AI-assisted insights, thereby maintaining accountability for patient care and ensuring that AI technologies are used as supportive tools for the clinical process rather than delegating judgment or shifting responsibility to the AI systems.

The regulations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) play a critical role in overseeing consumer protection as it relates to the development, sale, and deployment of AI systems \citep{FTC2024}. These regulations are designed to protect consumers by preventing defective or unethical research, development, and commercialization of AI technologies. In an era where generative AI tools allow anyone with access to data and computational resources to develop AI systems, the lack of expertise or knowledge in developing such systems constitutes a breach of professional and ethical standards. This lack of competence undermines the duty of honesty and diligence. Individuals or entities that violate these standards may face penalties under FTC regulations, and the AI systems in question may be subject to regulatory intervention to prevent further misuse or harm to consumers.

Regarding issues around medical data, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be mostly issued. HIPAA governs the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) and applies to any AI systems handling patient data \citep{HHS_HIPAA}. AI systems must comply with the Privacy Rule \citep{HHS_HIPAA_Privacy}, Security Rule \citep{HHS_HIPAA_Security}, and Breach Notification Rule \citep{HHS_HIPAA_Breach_Notification} to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of patient data. Failure to comply with HIPAA’s requirements can result in significant legal penalties, fines, and reputational damage; this regulation will play a crucial role in managing the operational quality of the AI systems to implement robust privacy and security measures. AI products need to comply with such standards as other products in the market without exemption and developers should consider those regulations in the system design, development, and deployment rather than merely combining data pipelines arbitrarily. Failures in safety assessments can lead to product recalls or denial of market access.

Also, AI-based healthcare devices should comply with the International Organization for Standardization’s code ISO 13485 \citep{ISO_IEC_27001_2013} and IEC 62304\citep{ISO_IEC_27002_2013}. IEC 62304 emphasizes software development processes' safety and risk assessment, and ISO 13485 requires quality management. These standards require AI devices to meet high standards for quality, safety, and performance throughout their lifecycle.  

President Biden signed Executive Order (E.O.) 14110 on AI in October 2023 \citep{CRS_R47843}. Even though the EO did not directly address medical cases, the order stressed safety and oversight. The E.O. aligns with the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \citep{WhiteHouse_AIBillOfRights} and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) \cite{NIST_AI_RMF_2023}, both of which focus on ensuring ethical AI use, managing risks, and protecting public safety across various sectors, includes medical field. In contrast to creative AI tasks, like image generation, AI in medical contexts deals with highly sensitive knowledge and must meet higher standards for validation, accountability, and transparency. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and other governmental agencies are likely to introduce more specific rules governing AI in healthcare, given its potential life-or-death impact on patient outcomes.

In May 2024, Colorado enacted Senate Bill (SB) 24-205 \citep{Colorado_Legislation_2024}, which regulates the use of high-risk AI systems, including those used in healthcare. The law is designed to protect consumers from unlawful and discriminatory practices in critical sectors, including healthcare services, by setting strict standards for AI developers and users. AI systems are deemed ``high risk'' when they influence significant decisions, such as those affecting access to healthcare or the terms of healthcare services. Under SB 24-205, developers of healthcare AI systems must provide comprehensive documentation on data sources, known risks, and measures to mitigate potential algorithmic discrimination. Deployers, such as healthcare providers using AI, are required to implement risk management policies, conduct annual impact assessments, and disclose to patients when AI systems play a substantial role in healthcare decisions. Also, In January 2024, California's Assembly Bill No. 2013 was published to require AI developers to disclose the dataset they used if the AI is serviced in California \citep{california_ab2013_2024}.

In the European Union (EU), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), established by the European Union, requests AI developers, deployers, and operators to work for explainability to end-users along with data providers. One particularly interesting rule in the GDPR relevant to medical AI is the right to explanation or right to access meaningful information about the logic of processing \citep{GDPR_Art15}, especially in cases of automated decision-making \citep{GDPR_Art22}. If AI systems could be deployed in the EU, AI developers and deployers need to consider these rules.  


\subsubsection{Emerging New Codes for AI Systems}

Generative AI systems pose unique regulatory challenges due to their stochastic nature of variable outputs and complex integration with existing clinical workflows, difficulty in validating outputs against ground truth, and potential for generating plausible but incorrect information \citep{reddy2024generative}. In clinical settings, the implications of AI hallucinations extend across both regulated and non-regulated applications, and current models fail to ensure medical safety \citep{han2024towards}. In clinical decision support applications, hallucinations can manifest in various forms, from subtle misinterpretations of patient data to outright fabrication of medical information. These errors can cascade through the clinical workflow, potentially leading to incorrect diagnoses, inappropriate treatment recommendations, or missed critical care opportunities. As we have shown in Figure \ref{fig:main}, even state-of-the-art AI systems can generate plausible-sounding but entirely incorrect information that has the potential to mislead clinicians \citep{coiera2024ai}.

While existing legal frameworks, modeled on traditionally employed medical technologies, provide some guidance for AI applications, they fall short in addressing the unique issues posed by generative AI, particularly regarding hallucination detection and prevention. Current legal frameworks face significant challenges in assigning responsibility when AI systems contribute to adverse patient outcomes, and their application in such scenarios remains largely untested. There is a movement to develop policies tailored to AI models by addressing issued around change control \citep{FDA_AI_ChangeControl}, and more adaptive guidelines and application cases could clarify the future direction.

In this context, the adoption of a data-driven approach to developing frameworks for addressing hallucination is notably beneficial. Furthermore, there is currently a lack of research analyzing the issues related to hallucination. Consequently, the efficacy of existing regulatory bodies and their ongoing development could be significantly improved by embracing a data-based approach. It is imperative to examine the issues identified by experts within the field.

\subsubsection{Liability and Legal Frameworks}

The increasing deployment of foundation models in healthcare poses significant legal considerations, particularly when these systems produce \textit{hallucinations} or erroneous outputs that can lead to medical misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatment. Traditional medical malpractice law is primarily designed for scenarios of human error, where negligence is attributed based on deviation from a standard of care expected of similarly situated professionals.  However, when an AI system generates a hallucination, the chain of responsibility becomes less clear. To illustrate, if an AI model outputs misleading diagnostic information, questions arise as to whether liability should fall on the AI developer for potential shortcomings in training data, the healthcare provider for over-reliance on opaque outputs, or the institution for inadequate oversight \citep{bottomley2023liability}.

The ``black-box” nature of many AI systems exacerbates these complexities. These systems are characterized by a lack of transparency, rendering it difficult to trace the reasoning behind a particular output response. This opacity complicates the legal requirement of causation (i.e., linking a specific negligent act to patient harm) and raises questions for established legal doctrines such as medical malpractice, product liability, and vicarious liability \citep{ama2019tort}). In cases of AI hallucinations, establishing a direct causal connection is especially challenging when multiple parties (developers, healthcare providers, and institutions) share responsibility in the lifecycle of these technologies.

Legal scholars have proposed several approaches to address these challenges. One potential approach lies in extending existing legal theories to include AI-specific considerations. This might entail modifying the standard of care to require that clinicians not only critically evaluate AI outputs but also possess an understanding of their inherent limitations \citep{ama2019tort}. Alternatively, another proposal involves adapting product liability principles to AI technologies, potentially treating the system as a defective product if it exhibits a pattern of generating unexplainable or harmful outputs. However, this model is also challenged by the dynamic nature of AI, whereby the capacity for continual learning means that the system in operation may diverge from its original design \citep{lytal2023ai}.

Certain scholars advocate for a risk-sharing or common enterprise framework, where liability is proportionately distributed among all stakeholders based on their respective roles and the level of control they exert over the technology \citep{eldakak2024civil}. Such a framework has the potential to incentivize robust risk management, encompassing extensive testing and validation protocols, transparent documentation, and comprehensive user training. Furthermore, legal reforms may be warranted to establish clearer guidelines for informed consent, ensuring patients are informed when AI is being used, and of the potential risks associated with AI utilization in their diagnosis or treatment.

Establishing clear liability frameworks is crucial not only for addressing potential harm and compensating affected individuals, but also for fostering public trust and encouraging the safe and responsible adoption of AI in healthcare. It is imperative that the evolution of these legal doctrines keeps pace with rapid technological advancements to ensure that the potential benefits of AI are realized while concurrently safeguarding patient safety.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec7}

In this paper, we introduce and define the novel concept of \textit{\textbf{medical hallucination}} in Foundation Models, distinguishing it from general hallucinations and highlighting its unique risks within healthcare. Through a detailed taxonomy, we categorized the diverse manifestations of medical hallucinations, ranging from factual inaccuracies to complex reasoning errors, providing a structured framework for future research and mitigation efforts. Our investigation into the causes of these hallucinations highlighted the critical roles of data quality, model limitations, and healthcare domain complexities, revealing a multifaceted challenge.

To address this challenge, we explore and benchmark various detection and mitigation strategies, including factual verification, consistency checks, uncertainty quantification, and prompt engineering.  Our experimental evaluation on a medical hallucination benchmark revealed the efficacy of techniques like CoT prompting and Internet Search in reducing hallucination rates, while also demonstrating the surprising resilience of advanced general-purpose models in this domain.  Furthermore, our annotation of real-world clinical case records by expert physicians provided invaluable qualitative insights into the real-world impact and risk levels associated with medical hallucinations, complementing our quantitative findings.  A comprehensive clinician survey across the countries further enriched our understanding by capturing the perceptions and experiences of healthcare professionals regarding AI/LLM adoption and the challenges of medical hallucinations in practice.  Finally, we addressed the critical regulatory and legal considerations surrounding AI in healthcare, emphasizing the urgent need for ethical guidelines and robust frameworks to ensure patient safety and accountability.

Collectively, this work makes contributions by establishing a foundational understanding of medical hallucinations, offering practical detection and mitigation strategies, and highlighting the critical need for responsible AI deployment in healthcare.  As Foundation Models become increasingly integrated into clinical practice, our findings serve as a crucial guide for researchers, developers, clinicians, and policymakers. Moving forward, continued attention, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a focus on robust validation and ethical frameworks will be paramount to realizing the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, while effectively safeguarding against the inherent risks of medical hallucinations and ensuring a future where AI serves as a reliable and trustworthy ally in enhancing patient care and clinical decision-making.

\section{Constructing NEJM Medical Case Records Datatset}

To construct our dataset of case records from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), we employed a multi-step process for automated data retrieval, text extraction, and structured data representation. Our approach ensured efficient and ethical data acquisition while leveraging a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based techniques to maximize the accuracy and completeness of the extracted content. We ensured compliance with the website's terms of service.

\subsection{Data Collection}
We systematically retrieved and stored case records in PDF format using an automated web scraping pipeline:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Retrieval of PDF URLs:} We first extracted the URLs of all individual case record PDFs from the NEJM website. This was done by analyzing the website’s structure and collecting the relevant links programmatically.
    \item \textbf{Automated PDF Downloading:} Using Selenium WebDriver with a Chrome browser, we accessed each PDF URL and configured the browser settings to directly download the files instead of opening them in the browser for efficient scraping. 
\end{enumerate}
Once the PDFs were successfully downloaded, they were stored in a structured directory for subsequent processing.

\subsection{Document Parsing}
After collecting the PDFs, we converted them into structured JSON format of extracted text, images, and tables. We used a combination of image recognition and text extraction methods to maximize completeness and accuracy. The process involved multiple tools, each with complementary strengths and limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Text Extraction with pdfminer} 
We used pdfminer, an open-source Python package, to extract text from the PDFs.
Advantages: This tool excels at text extraction from digital PDFs, providing a complete and accurate text representation.
Limitations: However, it does not support Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and fails to recognize images, headers, or retain the original document structure.

    \item \textbf{Image and Structure Extraction with Marker} To compensate for pdfminer's shortcomings, we employed Marker, a separate parsing tool with OCR capabilities.
Advantages: This package accurately extracts images and retains the structure of the document and table format.
Limitations: Despite its OCR strengths, it sometimes misplaces text—especially when text flows across multiple pages—and may fail to detect tables.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Refining Parsed Content}
To enhance the completeness and precision of the extracted content, we applied additional refinement steps.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Handling Missing Tables} Tables are crucial components of medical case records. To ensure that all tables were properly extracted, we introduced an additional verification step. Leveraging the capability of language models to understand text, we prompted the OpenAI's GPT-4o model to read through the text extracted by Marker and identify any missing table. If the model detected missing tables, the document was parsed again with Marker. To limit the number of API calls, we limit this verification step to maximum of four trials. 

    \item \textbf{Refining Text for Completeness and Structure} The text extracted from Marker retained document structure in Markdown format but contained incomplete or misorganized text. The text from pdfminer, while complete and accurate, lacked structural formatting. 
    To produce a complete, structured representation of our text, we again prompted GPT-4o to use the extracted text from pdfminer to restore missing text from Marker and properly order the content, while ensuring markdown format. 
    \item \textbf{Providing Summaries of Extracted Images} Since our case records contained critical visual content, we provided additional context of the extracted images by providing concise summaries. These summaries were generated by using the multimodal capability of GPT-4o.


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Data Representation}
After refining the extracted content, we stored the content for each case record in a dedicated directory with the following structure: 

\lstset{
    basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,
    frame=single,
    backgroundcolor=\color{gray!10},
    breaklines=true
}
\begin{lstlisting}
Case 1/
- images/
  - image_001.png
  - image_002.png
  - description.json
- text.txt
- tables.json
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Text}
The extracted and refined text is stored in the \texttt{text.txt} file, retaining Markdown formatting.
    
\subsubsection{Tables}
All extracted tables are stored in a structured JSON format. Each table entry contains:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \texttt{"table\_df"}: Tabular data in a structured dictionary format with columns as keys and elements as values for the corresponding column.
        \item \texttt{"table\_md"}: The table formatted in Markdown.
        \item \texttt{"table\_summary"}: A concise description of the table, generated using GPT-4o.
    \end{enumerate}

Example format of \texttt{tables.json}:

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "table_1": {
        "table_df": "{' Table 1. Laboratory Data.*': 
            {0: ' Variable ', 1: ' Troponin T (ng/dl) ', 
            2: ' Hemoglobin (g/dl)  ', 3: ' Hematocrit (%)', ...}, 
            '     ': {0: ' Reference Range, Adults\u2020 ', 
            1: ' <0.03 ', 2: ' 12.0\u201316.0', ...}",
        
        "table_md": "| Parameter | Value | Unit |\n
            |-----------|-------|------|\n
            | BP | 120/80 | mmHg |\n| Heart Rate | 75 bpm | bpm |",
            
        "table_summary": "This table provides the patient's vital signs, 
            including blood pressure and heart rate."
    },
    "table_2": {...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

       
\subsubsection{Images and Descriptions}
The extracted images are saved under the \texttt{images} directory in \texttt{.png} files along with the captions and summaries of the images that are saved in JSON format in \texttt{description.json}.

Example format of \texttt{description.json}:

\samepage
\noindent
\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "image_1.png": {
        "caption": "MRI scan of the patient's brain.",
        "summary": "The image shows..."
    },
    "image_2.png": {
        "caption": "Histopathology slide.",
        "summary": "Microscopic examination reveals..."
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\par
\noindent This methodology enabled efficient, ethical, and high-quality extraction of NEJM medical case records into a multi-modal dataset of text, images, and tables.
