\subsection{Rule-based LLM reasoning}
While reasoning demonstrated a fundamental capability of LLM on applications____, there are many research such as CoT____, CoT-sc____, ToT____, etc. However, there are more attention on rule-enhanced methods____. Reasoning based on facts and deriving answers from logical rules is referred to as inferential rule following ability____. Leveraging such ability that integrating explicit rules with LLMs has gained significant attention. For instance, ____ utilized the IRAC framework to tackle legal tasks with LLMs, emphasizing the application of legal rules. Additionally, ____ proposed a neurosymbolic framework for multi-step rule application. Despite the current limitations of LLMs in rule-based reasoning____, our work demonstrates that such rule-based reasoning outperforms CoT reasoning in the MQCIC task.

\subsection{LLM Evaluations in Clinical Scenarios}
While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in medical knowledge recall and reading comprehension on medical exams____, their effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains a critical area of evaluation. For example, ____ assesses LLMs across 14 expert-curated clinical scenarios, including diagnosis, discharge summaries, and medical consultations. Similarly, ____ introduces MedCal-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate inferential rule reasoning in medical contexts, while ____ simulates a multi-step diagnostic process to test clinical reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, ____ explore LLMs' abilities in clinical fact decomposition and verification. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLMs in the MQCIC task, with a specific emphasis on their performance in clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning, providing a detailed analysis of these two critical abilities.
% (2) \textbf{Insufficient hardware computing power to support large-parameter models.} Previous work has explored the upper limits of LLMs in clinical tasks, while some research focuses on training cost-effective models for real-world applications____. 
% In line with these efforts, we also report the performance of lightweight models and our training results, aiming to explore a more balanced trade-off approach.
