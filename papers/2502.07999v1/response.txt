\subsection{The Routine Infrastructures of Creative Identity}

    To enact one's creative identity, or any identity for that matter, people rely on routines. Routines are recognizable patterns of action or behavior that are carried out by one or multiple actors within a specific context [Goffman, "Frame Analysis"] , and are assemblages of sociomaterial configurations people and artifacts (e.g., tools, procedures, technologies) [Orlikowski, "Improvising Organizational Change"] . People have agency to adapt their routines or to create new ones as need be [Giddens, "The Constitution of Society"] . Having the agency to adapt is key to the foundational routine of building and rebuilding a coherent and rewarding sense of identity [Goffman, "Stigma"] . A strong sense of self-identity, which is how a person thinks about themselves socially or physically , can give people a deep sense of security in their everyday lives . This sense of security emerges when routines are continuous and predictable, a state of ontological security, emerging from the "routine project of the self" [Giddens, "Modernity and Self-Identity"] . The flexibility in the routine project of the self comes from people's abilities to consciously or unconsciously use inferences from the past to anticipate a future . Thus, identity is a routine personal and social undertaking—as one must routinely interact with the world and reflect on the impacts of those interactions in their routine project of the self.

    
    The routines of our everyday lives are enacted on, through, and within larger societal systems. The foundations of these systems are known as infrastructures, and they support the large scale-systems that society relies upon to routinely function [Callon, "Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation"] . Infrastructure can be anything from large-scale highway systems to information and communication technologies (e.g., social media platforms) in how they support routine societal function [Star, "The Limits of Local Knowledge"] . Infrastructure is defined in use – as they are entwined with human social practice as relational systems that take on meaning or changes in meaning in a continually negotiated way depending on the social practice taking place and the actors involved [Law, "Being and Becoming: On the Natures of Agencements"] . Importantly, while humans are a part of the construction of the social meaning of infrastructures, they can be infrastructures, functioning as a combination of both known and unknown entities that animate a particular system . In this sense infrastructures are sociotechnical, meaning that they both shape and are shaped by social practices built around and with them [Star, "The Limits of Local Knowledge"] . As with any large system, infrastructures have many interconnected parts that weave themselves seamlessly into the fabric of society and go unnoticed most of the time .

    While only one small aspect of ourselves, being \textit{a creative person} is also something that is produced through routines. Creative identity is a "representational project engaging the self in dialogue with multiple others about the meaning of creativity as constructed in societal discourses" [Csikszentmihalyi, "Creativity"] . Creative identity cannot be understood by the actions of individuals alone, but rather relationships and connections between the self and others as they develop a shared notion of creativity . To have a creative identity, a person must do creative work, present that creative work to others, and have others also deem that work to be creative. One must be flexible in the routine project of the self , and creative identities are no different. Drawing ontological security around creative identity requires flexibility in how the artist constructs knowledge about the world and about themselves as creative people.

    Creative identities are supported by human infrastructures. There are people that do the work required to animate the physical and digital infrastructures where creative work is shared, as well as the electric and network infrastructures that mediate the routine presentation of one's self as a creative person. Often, artists do not know who these human infrastructures are, but their work is vital to the continued ability of creatives to routinely express themselves as creative people.

    Yet, sometimes infrastructures do not work in the way that they are intended to, and sometimes they break down , which can become chronic in certain circumstances . For artists, infrastructural breakdowns may come from how their needs and values may not match the ways infrastructures are designed , as infrastructures are not value-neutral. The human actors that build, maintain, and repair infrastructures embed their values, norms, and biases into them through this routine work . As they are embedded into infrastructures, these values can be at the heart of the routine sources of disruptions in artists' everyday lives and routines . In some cases, value misalignment between infrastructure designers and users can result in incomplete infrastructure---an infrastructure that does not meet the needs of those who depend upon it to enact their routines, which is a common concern for artists . Infrastructural breakdowns may surface the underlying ways these infrastructures support the routine development and expression of creative identity  - such as how people routinely draw on online spaces like Instagram to be inspired by the creative work of others or how designers use mood boards to find inspiration .

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Discipline and Spontaneity} are centered around creative practice itself and the inspiration that emerges from the practice of doing art. According to Hymer, "what appears to be a serendipitous thought or discovery [...] derives from both flashes of quick impressions and from the slower, more painstaking analytic work that precedes and follows such flashes" [Hymer, "Inspiration"] . For our purposes, discipline surrounds the routine practice of creative work that comes both before and after the spontaneous, serendipitous, moment of inspiration. Self-discipline is the routine enactment of creative practice through the discipline to do creative work even when struggling with creative blocks , by drawing on peer support  and engaging in critique and feedback sessions  that negotiate meaning of creativity and artist identity. Spontaneity, conversely, is the ability to capitalize on the convergence of inspirational objects and necessary others that produce new combinations of possibilities that inspire  and then being open and able to do that creative work .

\item \textbf{Mindfulness and Mindlessness}, according to Hymer are are framed around artistic awareness and engagement with the world . These contradictions are embodied in the creative objects produced and the collective negotiation of creativity and creative identity that online platforms facilitate , as well as the tools that we use to create potential inspiration . Mindfulness speaks to the awareness of the inspirational elements of one’s environment and the openness to documenting inspirational objects when they are encountered for further reference. Mindlessness, in contrast, speaks to the routine, yet mindless, use of online platforms to engage with the creative work of others and to become inspired to do creative work.

\item \textbf{Active Searching and Receptive Waiting} are focused on a person's intentionality in searching for inspiration. Hymer describes this contradiction as being both aware of how one has routinely gone about inspirational practices in the past (e.g., through deliberate routine), but also the "spontaneity and receptivity to surprise elements which enter into a transformational experience" [Hymer, "Inspiration"] . While actively searching for inspiration is a routine practice for many creative people , receptive waiting is about browsing - or, “a search, hopefully serendipitous [...] which might contribute the fact or idea needed in some intellectual effort” [Morse, "Browsing"] .

    Using this framework, we describe how the online platforms where many artists are encountering inspirational objects are supporting - and not supporting - the articulation of their artistic identities. In the next section, we discuss our method.
