abstract = {Online communities have the potential to be supportive, cruel, or anywhere in between. The development of positive norms for interaction can help users build bonds, grow, and learn. Using millions of messages sent in Twitch chatrooms, we explore the effectiveness of methods for encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors, including taking advantage of imitation effects through setting positive examples and using moderation tools to discourage antisocial behaviors. Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory, users imitated examples of behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users. Proactive moderation tools, such as chat modes which restricted the ability to post certain content, proved effective at discouraging spam behaviors, while reactive bans were able to discourage a wider variety of behaviors. This work considers the intersection of tools, authority, and types of behaviors, offering a new frame through which to consider the development of moderation strategies.},

abstract = {This paper examines the question of "values in repair" -- the distinct forms of meaning and care that may be built into human-technology interactions through individual and collective acts of repair. Our work draws on research in HCI and the social sciences and findings from ethnographic studies in four sites -- two amateur "fixers" collectives' in Brooklyn and Seattle, USA and two mobile phone repair communities in Uganda and Bangladesh -- to advance two arguments. First, studies of repair account for new sites and processes of value that differ from those appearing at HCI's better-studied moments of design and use. Second, repair may embed modes of human interaction with technology and with each other in ways that surface values as contingent and ongoing accomplishments, suggesting ongoing processes of valuation that can never be fully fixed or commoditized. These insights help HCI account for human relationships to technology built into the world through repair.},

We explore how the community handled a massive, sudden, and sustained increase in new members. Although existing theory and stories like Usenet's infamous "Eternal September" suggest that large influxes of newcomers can hurt online communities, our interviews suggest that NoSleep survived without major incident. We propose that three features of NoSleep allowed it to manage the rapid influx of newcomers gracefully: (1) an active and well-coordinated group of administrators, (2) a shared sense of community which facilitated community moderation, and (3) technological systems that mitigated norm violations. We also point to several important trade-offs and limitations.},

Subsequently, Human–Computer Interaction Games research is increasingly concerned with the development of games that serve neurodivergent1 players. In a critical review of 66 publications informed by Disability Studies and Self-Determination Theory, we analyse which populations, research methods, kinds of play and overall purpose goals existing games address. We find that games are largely developed for children, in a top-down approach. They tend to focus on educational and medical settings and are driven by factors extrinsic to neurodivergent interests. Existing work predominantly follows a medical model of disability, which fails to support self-determination of neurodivergent players and marginalises their opportunities for immersion. Our contribution comprises a large-scale investigation into a budding area of research gaining traction with the intent to capture a status quo and identify opportunities for future work attending to differences without articulating them as deficit.},

The framework is based on empirical studies, ADHD research, and related work on assistive technologies. We map existing assistive technologies and potential new research efforts to the framework concepts. This way we show how it is used to support and advance the research and development of novel assistive technologies for the ADHD domain.},

abstract = {Sketching is a valuable technique used across a variety of industries to aid creative thought. Although the benefits of sketching are widely known, there is limited instruction for the application of sketching in problem solving, particularly in the critical phase of generating ideas. This project seeks to encourage the usage of sketching in this phase by proposing a structured method to aid creative thought and divergent thinking. To inform the design of the method, exploratory research was conducted involving interviews with creative professionals from various creative disciplines in addition to concurrent think-aloud design sessions with User Experience designers. Sketches from the Royal Institute of British Architecture (RIBA) were also reviewed to collect observations from conceptual architectural sketches. The best practices and techniques uncovered in this research formed the foundation for the design of a lightweight sketching method. The main contribution of this paper is the method, Sketching for Ideation Version 1.0, which was evaluated by five User Experience Designers and two Business Consultants. The evaluation offered encouraging reviews of the method for improving idea generation and also constructive comments for future iterations.},

abstract = {Co-creative systems have been widely explored in the field of computational creativity. However, existing AI partners of these systems are mostly virtual agents. As sketching on paper with embodied robots could be more engaging for designers' early-stage ideation and collaborative practices, we envision the possibility of Cobbie, a mobile robot that ideates iteratively with designers by generating creative and diverse sketches. To evaluate the differences in co-creativity and user experience between the co-creative robots and virtual agents, we conducted a comparative experiment and analyzed the data collected from quantitative scales, observation, and semi-structured interview. The results reveal that Cobbie is more satisfying in motivating exploration, provoking unexpected ideas and engaging designers in the collaborative ideation process. Based on these findings, we discussed the prospects of co-creative robots for future developments of human-AI collaborative systems.},

abstract = {During past decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been consistently used in Creativity Support Tools (CSTs). Recently, with the development of generative AI models, particularly Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) in Computer Vision, it became possible that AI directly generates visual ideas. However, there were rarely any work in creativity research that harnessed the design ideas generated by such models directly for design space exploration. In this paper, we propose a StyleGAN-driven digital mood board, GANCollage, that integrates AI generated visual ideas into the ideation phase for creativity support. GANCollage supports semantic explorations of StyleGAN generations in an iterative human-in-the-loop manner, using an AI-driven interactive tagging system. Our evaluation involving 10 participants manifests that GANCollage provides more creativity support without compromising the final results. It also offers a more enjoyable, explicit and effective way of exploring AI generated visual ideas for ideation.},

Although each community disseminates knowledge through resources like online video tutorials, this content is often hidden behind different contexts and semantics that limits practitioners’ ability to learn, borrow, and adapt knowledge from each other. To trace how knowledge disseminates across CoPs, we analyzed video transcripts across 25 communities and characterized them using Term Frequency Proportional Document Frequency (TF*PDF) to extracted materials, tools, and techniques concepts. Using a cluster heatmap visualization, we reveal material and material parallels as boundaries for umbrella CoPs, techniques as strong predictors of kindred CoPs, and outliers as emerging sites of hybrid CoPs. We discuss implications for the design of knowledge discovery support tools to characterize material workflows, track knowledge evolution, and develop semantic vocabularies.},

Our goal was to understand how this blend of craft and technology could arouse curiosity and encourage playful making of technology. To this end, we conducted a hands-on workshop with ten experienced makers. From this workshop, several woven artifacts were generated and we discovered that integrating craft materials with electronic components fostered an acceptance of imperfection and sparked curiosity, encouraging participants to explore different ways of building electronics.},

Over a period of three months, we observed and interviewed ten women aged 42 - 78 to explore how they experienced being involved in knitting, sewing, crocheting, card making and other similar craft forms. Using the ethos of care as a lens to interpret our data, we found that our participants perceived making as an 'outlet' for them to perform activities that support their physical and mental wellbeing. Moreover, they perceived making as a tool to support others in need and help the larger community rather than a self-serving achievement. We also observed how the use of technology was inherent into their craft making activities that supported not only the making processes but also sharing these with others. Our findings highlight the 'care work' that goes into making in such a social setting that generally goes unnoticed when the focus is purely on instrumental and objective aspects of making. We believe that these findings will inform CSCW researchers to think about the not-so-visible qualities of making that elevate care (for self and for others), and to support these via the design of innovative technologies.?},

In this paper, we explore opportunities for combining the maker cultures of hand spinning with e-textile crafting. In our first study, we interviewed 32 hand spinners on their practices to better understand their motivations for spinning their own yarns and the techniques they use to do so. In our second study, we conducted workshops with 6 spinners at a local spinning guild, where participants worked with the conductive fibers and spun e-textile yarns. After the workshops, we conducted follow-up interviews with each participant to understand the opportunities and tensions of hand spinning e-textile yarns. Our findings show how spinners can blend local materials with conductive ones to develop their own custom interactive textiles, and the mismatch between how these fibers are sold and what information spinners require to inform their design decisions. Through these results, we hope to empower makers and inspire the design community to develop tools to support these DIY practices.},

Combining a qualitative survey (n=48) and in-depth interviews (n=15), we look for unexpected themes that emerge only among graphic professionals. We expand the existing knowledge in four main ways: we identify what makes a graphic idea good compared to other domains, we observe that practitioners balance conflicting creative identities with consequences on their idea management needs, that graphic ideas are sculpted out of inspirational material, and that creative control is negotiated with clients and collaborators.},

The domain of older adult-led maker-based communities offers HCI researchers the opportunity to explore not only how older adults innovatively and collaboratively create in later life, but also how we might design with these communities rather than for them. We report findings from a design workshop study spanning over two weeks involving 13 members of an urban Australian men's shed. Our findings show that making in the men's shed was influenced by (1) socio-materiality, (2) interpersonal dynamics and (3) shared expertise. We provide HCI researchers with an understanding of how older adults worked collaboratively within their own creative community as found through the deployment of a novel card-based probe, a workshop and followup investigations. We further unpack recommendations for organising design workshops with older adult maker communities that work towards meaningful community-oriented participation and greater agency in co-design studies.},
