    ____ [1] is part of DementiaBank, a multimedia database designed to facilitate the study of individuals with dementia, supported by grants NIA AG03705 and AG05133. This dataset encompasses various types of conversational data, including tasks such as the Cookie Theft picture (CTP) description ____, fluency tasks, story recall, and sentence construction. For this study, data were exclusively drawn from Probable AD, PossibleAD, MCI, and HC participants for the CTP task.
    ____ [2] is an English-language dataset from DementiaBank, comprising conversations from 26 HC participants and 28 individuals with dementia, specifically focusing on CTP conversations from the United States.
    ____ [3] consists of voice commands collected from 40 older adults, aged 65 or older, who were either HC participants or MCI participants. These participants were grouped based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ____ [4] scores. The data was collected through Amazon Alexa, a Voice-Assistant System, and includes daily spontaneous voice commands issued by users to seek assistance with everyday tasks. 
    ____ [5] includes retellings of the Cinderella story and other discourse tasks. For the Cinderella task, participants were provided with a storybook featuring Disney illustrations of the tale. The text was obscured, and pages deemed less relevant were taped together to prevent visibility.
    ____ [6] originally was collected from individuals diagnosed with probable AD at the UCLA Geriatric Outpatient Clinic and the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Hospital. This dataset contains  conversations from individuals with MCI, focusing on topics such as family, profession, personal history, and questions from a neuropsychological interview ____ [7].
    ____ [8] (The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study) follows a random sample of Wisconsin high school graduates from 1957 (N = 10,317), born between 1938 and 1940. Initially focused on educational and occupational aspirations, later surveys in 1964, 1975, 1992, 2004, and 2011 increasingly focused on health and life course experiences as participants aged ____ [9].
    ____ [10], part of DementiaBank, investigates cognitive-linguistic features in neurotypical adults and individuals with MCI due to possible AD. It employs the DementiaBank discourse protocol, which includes picture description, story narrative, procedural discourse, and personal narrative tasks.
    ____ [11] consists of spontaneous speech samples from cognitively normal subjects and individuals with MCI, recorded while describing pictures. The dataset includes English and Chinese audio recordings.
    ____ [12] comprises recordings from participants over 60 years old, all native European Spanish speakers with at least six years of primary education, ensuring literacy and minimizing cognitive load during a reading task.
    ____ [13] is part of the Clinical Linguistics PERLACH Corpus. Collected between 2012 and 2014, it includes 27 transcriptions from conversations with 21 AD patients, some interviewed twice.
    ____ [14], available through DementiaBank, consists of interview recordings from 52 Mandarin-speaking AD patients. These recordings include tasks such as the CTP description, category fluency, and picture naming exercises ____ [15].
    ____ [16], from the National Conference on Man-Machine Speech Communication (NCMMSC), consists of audio recordings where participants engage in various tasks, such as picture descriptions and fluency exercises. It features 79 subjects with AD, 93 with MCI, and 108 HC.
    ____ [17], derived from the Predictive Challenge of AD in 2019, comprises transcripts of spontaneous speech collected during CTP description tasks, a common diagnostic tool for neurological disorders ____. Participants, ranging in age from 41 to 98, included 68 individuals with AD, 144 with MCI, and 111 healthy controls.
    ____ [18] datasets consist of data collected through lab and home-based experiments conducted at the Greek Alzheimer’s Association for Dementia and Related Disorders in Thessaloniki, Greece, and participants' homes. These datasets include video and audio recordings alongside data from physiological sensors. Additionally, it incorporates data from sleep, motion, and plug sensors, offering a comprehensive view of participants' behavioral and physiological patterns. We used the Ds3, Ds5, and Ds7 darasets from Dem@Care project.
    ____ [19] comprises spontaneous speech samples from cognitively normal individuals and AD patients. The training set includes English audio recordings of participants describing the CTP from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. The test set features speech samples in Greek, where participants describe a different picture. For this study, we utilized only the test set including 24 HC, 22 AD, as the dataset creator advises against using the training set alongside other English datasets from DementiaBank due to potential overlap.

Numerous studies have explored cognitive task-based approaches for Alzheimer’s detection, using speech and language analysis as key indicators of cognitive decline. These methods consider linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as lexical richness, syntactic complexity, fluency, and acoustic properties, to differentiate between AD, MCI, and HC across various languages and datasets ____ [20]. We review related work focusing on single-language and multilingual conversation-based Alzheimer’s detection for both binary and multiclass classification, which are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:related_work}.

For binary AD detection, ____ [21] analyze the multilingual Taukdial dataset, extracting language-agnostic speech features to classify MCI and HC. ____ [22] show that multilingual approaches outperform monolingual ones, achieving up to 72\% accuracy in MCI detection using narrative speech in English and Swedish. ____ [23] demonstrate that domain-specific word embeddings improve AD vs. HC classification on the Pitt corpus.

Regarding multiclass AD detection, ____ [24] address the underrepresentation of Spanish speakers, using a CNN model on the Ivanova dataset from DementiaBank and achieving 73.03\% accuracy. Due to data limitations, they augmented the training set with synthetic samples. ____ [25] utilize the VAS dataset, achieving 74.7\% accuracy in differentiating DM, MCI, and HC, highlighting the potential of voice assistant systems for passive monitoring. ____ [26] integrate acoustic and linguistic features from Wav2Vec2.0 and BERT for early AD detection in Chinese (NCMMSC dataset), achieving 89.1\% accuracy.

____ [27] propose a transformer-based model with a feature purification network, finding that semantic features generalize well across English and French. ____ [28] show that paralinguistic features outperform pre-trained ones in cross-lingual AD detection, achieving 69.6\% accuracy when training on English and testing on Greek. ____ [29] integrate acoustic features with demographic covariates, achieving 82.6\% accuracy for AD classification. ____ [30] identify 12 PoS features distinguishing AD from HC, reaching 92.2\% accuracy. Finally, ____ [31] propose a non-invasive, speech-based diagnostic tool for AD detection in clinical and home settings.
