    \caption{Comparison of student model performance across benchmarks under different scenarios: no attack (Trained SM), UP, TP and WN. Values in () indicate percentage changes relative to Trained SM, with the highest performance in each setting bolded and underlined. Student model used in this table is Llama-7b, results for Llama-3.2-1b can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:knowledge_llama3_2}.}
