\section{Conclusion}
This work presents the first systematic study of the robustness of watermarking schemes against adversarial attacks in preventing unauthorized knowledge distillation. We propose three watermark removal approaches: two pre-distillation methods (UP, TP) and one post-distillation method (WN). Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate the resilience of watermarking schemes against these attacks. Our findings reveal that WN achieves effective watermark removal while maintaining superior knowledge preservation, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defensive strategies.
