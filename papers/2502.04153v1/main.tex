\begin{abstract}
Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. 
However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. 
To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach \textsc{UltraIF} for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. 
\textsc{UltraIF} first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an \textit{\composer} to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. 
This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. 
In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that \textsc{UltraIF} could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \method, a scalable and effective approach for synthesizing high-quality instruction-following data. By decomposing human instructions into simplified queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions, we train an \composer that enables the efficient generation of constraint-aware instructions. Across two different settings, \method demonstrates strong performance across five instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct further highlight \method's potential for self-alignment. Most importantly, we are the first to optimize the LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base model to match the instruction-following capabilities of its Instruct counterpart, underscoing the effectiveness and potential of our approach.

\section*{Impact Statements}

This paper introduces \method, a scalable approach to enhance the instruction-following abilities of LLMs. By utilizing open-source data, it fosters transparency, reproducibility, and improved interpretability. From an ethical perspective, \method reduces dependency on proprietary datasets but may influence areas such as misinformation and biased decision-making. \method contributes to the democratization of LLM development, enhancing accessibility to advanced models. While potential societal implications exist, none present immediate ethical concerns beyond those commonly addressed in Machine Learning research.
