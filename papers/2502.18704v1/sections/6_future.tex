\section{Discussion and Future Work}

TerraTrace demonstrates that spectral signature curves can be used to understand land use across location and time. While we demonstrate this in a single state, the potential for it to scale globally can be seen in the example with coffee. In addition, while we only demonstrate the use of NDVI in this preliminary work, future versions of TerraTrace could include indices like Land Surface Temperature \cite{LST} and Irrigation Probability \cite{ML}. A full list of spectral indices can be found in \cite{montero}.  TerraTrace also faces limitations which need to be overcome to achieve accurate global land use estimation. The platform's geographic limitation to California necessitates dataset expansion. While aiming for global applicability, we recognize potential generalization challenges, suggesting the development of region-specific models \cite{klemmer2024satclip}. Spatial resolution of TerraTrace is also limited to 10m x 10m based on the Sentinel-2 capabilities. Temporal limitations due to infrequent satellite imagery could be mitigated through harmonized data collection every three days \cite{HLS}. Enhancements in spatial resolution, geographic coverage, and temporal frequency can improve TerraTrace's accuracy and global relevance in land use and climate change monitoring.

Incorporating these features could allow users such as EU regulators to track land use accurately over time, ensuring that deforestation-related decisions are based on data beyond paper certifications shared by suppliers. TerraTrace could enable small and large entities alike to automatically and objectively verify historical land use for compliance, thereby creating a fairer regulatory environment. In addition to regulatory compliance, we hope this approach can also be used for new applications; for example to aid farmers to project potential risks and towards climate change adaptation.
