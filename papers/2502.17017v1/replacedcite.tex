A significant line of research has focused on improving multi-step logical reasoning in LLMs via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting____. Although CoT methods allow models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, they lack a  mechanism to assess the  coherence of these logical transitions.



Mechanistic interpretability studies have examined the roles of transformer attention heads. Recent work revealed that attention layers operate in phases—knowledge recalling, latent reasoning, and expression preparation____. Subsequent studies have shown that some attention heads introduce biases by evenly splitting probabilities between answer options____, while others suppress such behaviors during the final expression phase____. In addition, recent investigations have attempted to analyze model behavior by disabling specific components____, though these approaches are often computationally expensive or limited to simpler tasks____.
