\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this study introduces a novel multi-dimensional uncertainty quantification framework, MD-UQ, for large language models, addressing the limitations of conventional uncertainty estimation approaches. By leveraging both semantic similarity and knowledge coherence dimensions, our method disentangles and integrates complementary information to achieve a more robust uncertainty representation. Through the application of tensor decomposition techniques, MD-UQ effectively reduces redundant information and enhances the reliability of uncertainty assessments. Experimental results across multiple datasets and models demonstrate the superiority of our framework in distinguishing uncertain responses, particularly in complex and high-stakes environments.
