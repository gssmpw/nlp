\section{Conclusions and Future Work\label{sec:conclusion}}
In this paper, we proposed an automated approach for identifying potential assets in Verilog designs based on observations that we made from analyzing open-source hardware designs. 
Identified assets can then be used in downstream security-related tasks. 
Moving forward, our future work will refine accuracy by incorporating additional behavioral abstraction detection to associate identified assets with confidentiality, integrity, and availability attributes, which can provided as collateral to IP consumers. 
This will also incorporate structural analysis in the source code. 
Additionally, we plan to use identified assets to map IPs to potentially relevant \acp{CWE} to help with verification.
