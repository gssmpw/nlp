ABSTRACT = {Uncertainty of target motion, limited perception ability of onboard cameras, and constrained control have brought new challenges to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dynamic target tracking control. In virtue of the powerful fitting ability and learning ability of the neural network, this paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based end-to-end control method for UAV dynamic target tracking. Firstly, a DRL-based framework using onboard camera image is established, which simplifies the traditional modularization paradigm. Secondly, neural network architecture, reward functions, and soft actor-critic (SAC)-based speed command perception algorithm are designed to train the policy network. The output of the policy network is denormalized and directly used as speed control command, which realizes the UAV dynamic target tracking. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed end-to-end control method is demonstrated by numerical simulation. The results show that the proposed DRL-based framework is feasible to simplify the traditional modularization paradigm. The UAV can track the dynamic target with rapidly changing of speed and direction.},

abstract = {In this paper, a distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is proposed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to autonomously track another UAV. Accordingly, this paper makes three important contributions to the literature. The first one is the development of an efficient UAV tracking algorithm, the second one is the presentation of a deep reinforcement learning approach that can be adapted to the problem, and the third one is the introduction of a generalized distributed deep reinforcement learning platform that can be used in various problems such as tracking, control and mission coordination of UAVs. In order to validate the developed approaches, the PPO algorithm is simulated with the deep reinforcement learning algorithm in a distributed and non-distributed manner, a follower UAV is trained in different scenarios and the distributed and non-distributed performances of the training using CPU are obtained, scenarios using general and adaptive learning algorithms are given, and finally, the performances of the algorithms developed in the paper are presented explicitly.}

abstract = {Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities. A fully autonomous swarm composed of palm-sized drones with versatile task extensibility in the wild is realized.}}

ABSTRACT = {An important challenge for air‚Äìground unmanned systems achieving autonomy is navigation, which is essential for them to accomplish various tasks in unknown environments. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for solving air‚Äìground unmanned system navigation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) while optimizing by using a priori information from search-based path planning methods, which we call search-based optimizing DRL (SO-DRL) for the air‚Äìground unmanned system. SO-DRL enables agents, i.e., an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to move to a given target in a completely unknown environment using only Lidar, without additional mapping or global planning. Our framework is equipped with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), an actor‚Äìcritic-based reinforcement learning algorithm, to input the agents‚Äô state and laser scan measurements into the network and map them to continuous motion control. SO-DRL draws on current excellent search-based algorithms to demonstrate path planning and calculate rewards for its behavior. The demonstrated strategies are replayed in an experienced pool along with the autonomously trained strategies according to their priority. We use a multi-stage training approach based on course learning to train SO-DRL on the 3D simulator Gazebo and verify the robustness and success of the algorithm using new test environments for path planning in unknown environments. The experimental results show that SO-DRL can achieve faster algorithm convergence and a higher success rate. We piggybacked SO-DRL directly onto a real air‚Äìground unmanned system, and SO-DRL can guide a UAV or UGV for navigation without adjusting any networks.},

ABSTRACT = {The three-dimensional (3D) path planning problem of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) considering the effect of environmental wind in a dense city is investigated in this paper. The mission of the UAV is to fly from its initial position to its destination while ensuring safe flight. The dense obstacle avoidance and the energy consumption in 3D space need to be considered during the mission, which are often ignored in common studies. To solve these problems, an improved Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) path planning algorithm based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is proposed in this paper. Among the algorithms, the random obstacle training method is first proposed to make the algorithm consider various flight scenarios more globally and comprehensively and improve the algorithm‚Äôs robustness and adaptability. Then, the linear soft update strategy is employed to realize the smooth neural network parameter update, which enhances the stability and convergence of the training. In addition, the wind disturbances are integrated into the energy consumption model and reward function, which can effectively describe the wind disturbances during the UAV mission to achieve the minimum drag flight. To prevent the neural network from interfering with training failures, the meritocracy mechanism is proposed to enhance the algorithm‚Äôs stability. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are verified through simulation analysis and comparative studies. The UAV based on this algorithm has good autonomy and adaptability, which provides a new way to solve the UAV path planning problem in dense urban scenes.},

Then the map information can be parameterized to make the test data statistically significant. In addition, an instruction filter is proposed to smooth the output of the policy network in the test phase. Its improvement in obstacle avoidance performance is demonstrated in the experiment section. Finally, real-time flight experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and prove that the learning-based path planner can solve practical problems in the robot field.
