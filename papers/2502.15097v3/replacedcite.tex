\section{Related Work}
Various machine unlearning methods have been proposed for removing knowledge from LLMs____. However, most of them report results on small sets such as ____. Recently, ____ and ____ proposed unlearning benchmarks (with various evaluation metrics), but they carry key limitations we address here. We provide more detailed discussions comparing \textsc{Lume} with these works in Appendix \ref{sec:relatedexpanded}.
