\textbf{Deep NLOS Reconstruction:} Compared to traditional algorithms ____, deep learning algorithms can learn scene priors, extract features, and reconstruct hidden objects. Hybrid methods ____ introduce several multi-scale iterative model-guided unfolding networks for Confocal NLOS (C-NLOS) reconstruction. Recent work ____ transforms traditional optimization into iterative learning but focuses solely on reconstruction performance without testing on corrupted cases. Inspired by but different from previous researches ____, our proposed \xnet develops a multi-scale graph-based network for C-NLOS reconstruction.

\noindent\textbf{Graph Learning:} GNNs are designed to process graph data by establishing long-range correlations in non-Euclidean space. Micheli____ introduced the spatial graph convolutional network with nonrecursive layers. Instead of directly aggregating features from neighboring nodes, EdgeConv____ obtains local neighborhood information by subtracting the central vertex's feature from that of neighboring vertices.  ____ introduced a highway GNN for user geo-location in social media graphs, using `highway' gates to enhance gradient flow. Their research indicated a decline in performance beyond 6 layers. ____ proposed a \emph{Jump Knowledge Network} to determine graph neighbors for each node based on the graph's structure. GNN applications in computer vision____ include point cloud classification, scene graph generation, and action recognition. Point clouds are 3D points typically collected by LiDAR scans. GCNs have been used for classifying and segmenting point clouds____.
