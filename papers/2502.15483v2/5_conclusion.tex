In this paper, we present \name, a modular deep learning framework for material property prediction.
Motivated by the challenges of diversity and disparity, \name \ first trains specialized modules across a wide spectrum of material tasks, constituting \name \ Hub.
We then introduce the Adaptive Module Composition algorithm, which facilitates tailored adaptation from \name \ Hub to each downstream task by adaptively composing synergistic modules.
Experimental results across 17 datasets demonstrate the superiority of \name, with few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlighting its data efficiency and scalability.

Finally, we discuss the prospects of \name \ in driving practical advancements in materials discovery.
As an open-source platform enabling materials knowledge modularization and distribution, \name \ offers several key advantages: (1) secure, flexible upload of material modules to \name \ Hub without compromising proprietary data; (2) efficient customization of modules for downstream tasks; (3) enhanced property prediction accuracies, even in low-data scenarios.
We envision \name \ facilitating a new paradigm of modular material learning and fostering broader community collaboration toward accelerated materials discovery.
