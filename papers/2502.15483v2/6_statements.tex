\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work aimed at advancing the field of materials discovery through innovative machine learning techniques. The potential positive societal impacts include accelerating the discovery of new materials with desirable properties, benefiting industries such as energy, electronics, and manufacturing. However, there are risks associated with the mal-intended use of material knowledge to develop harmful or unsafe materials. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to ensure that the application of this work adheres to ethical guidelines. While we do not foresee significant negative consequences in the near future, we recognize the importance of responsible usage and oversight in the application of these technologies.
