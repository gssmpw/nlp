Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery.
However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce \name, a \textbf{Mo}dular framework for \textbf{Ma}terials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario.
Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of \name, with a substantial 14\% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight \name's potential for real-world applications.
Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, \name \ will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.
