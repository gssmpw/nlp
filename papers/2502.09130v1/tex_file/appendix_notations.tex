We use $\Vert\cdot\Vert$ to denote $\ell_2$ norm for both vectors and matrices. For a matrix $A$, we use $\Vert A\Vert_F=\sqrt{\sum_{ij}A_{ij}^2}$ to denote the Frobenious norm of $A$. We use $\frac{\dd}{\dd u}$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial u}$, or just $\partial_u$ to denote the (partial) derivative with respect to $u$. We use $\nabla$ to denote the gradient or Jacobian, depending on whether the function is scalar-valued or vector-valued. If not specified, for the function in form of $f(t,x)$ where $t$ is a scalar and $x$ is a vector, $\nabla f(t,x)$ means the gradient vector or Jacobian matrix with respect to $x$ rather than $t$. We use $\Delta f(t,x)=\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2}f$ as the Laplace operator. We use $\mathbb{E}[X]$ to denote the expectation of a random variable $X$, and $\text{Cov}(X,Y)$ to denote the covariance of two random variables $X,Y$. $\mathbb{E}[X|c]$ and $\text{Cov}(X,Y|c)$ denote the corresponding conditional expectation and conditional covariance given condition $c$. We use the notation $f(x)\lesssim g(x)$ or $f(x)=O(g(x))$ to denote that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that $f(x)\le Cg(x)$.

%     \item ($\ell_2$-)norm: $\Vert\cdot\Vert$, Frobenius norm: $\Vert\cdot\Vert_F$.
%     \item We use $\frac{\dd}{\dd u}$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial u}$, or just $\partial_u$ to denote the (partial) derivative. 
%     \item We use $\nabla$ to denote the gradient or Jacobian, depending on whether the function is scalar-valued or vector-valued. If not specified, for the function in form of $f(t,x)$ where $t$ is a scalar and $x$ is a vector, $\nabla f(t,x)$ means the gradient vector or Jacobian matrix with respect to $x$ rather than $t$.
%     \item $\Delta f=\sum_{i=1}^d\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2}f$ is the Laplace operator.
%     \item We use $\mathbb{E}$ to denote the expectation and $\text{Cov}$ to denote the covariance of two random variables. $\mathbb{E}[\cdot|c]$ and $\text{Cov}[\cdot,\cdot|c]$ denote the corresponding conditional version.
%     \item We use the notation $f(x)\lesssim g(x)$ or $f(x)=O(g(x))$ to hide constant factors.
