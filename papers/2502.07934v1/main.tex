\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we examine a multi-sensor system where each sensor monitors multiple dynamic information processes and transmits updates over a shared communication channel. These updates may include correlated information across the various processes. In this type of system, we analyze the impact of preemption, where ongoing transmissions are replaced by newer updates, on minimizing the Age of Information (AoI). While preemption is optimal in some scenarios, its effectiveness in multi-sensor correlated systems remains an open question. To address this, we introduce a probabilistic preemption policy, where the source sensor preemption decision is stochastic. We derive closed-form expressions for the AoI and frame its optimization as a sum of linear ratios problem, a well-known NP-hard problem. To navigate this complexity, we establish an upper bound on the iterations using a branch-and-bound algorithm by leveraging a reformulation of the problem. This analysis reveals linear scalability with the number of processes and a logarithmic dependency on the reciprocal of the error that shows the optimal solution can be efficiently found. Building on these findings, we show how different correlation matrices can lead to distinct optimal preemption strategies. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the diversity of processes within the sensors' packets, as captured by the correlation matrix, plays a more significant role in preemption priority than the number of updates.
