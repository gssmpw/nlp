\section{Conclusion}\label{conc}

In this paper, we proposed and analyzed a probabilistic preemption strategy to minimize the AoI in correlated multi-sensor multi-process systems. We derived closed-form expressions for the AoI by applying stochastic hybrid system modeling. Next, we optimized source-specific preemption probabilities to minimize the sum AoI. The problem was framed as the sum of linear ratios, which is generally NP-hard. To address this, we reformulated the problem and provided an upper bound on the number of iterations required to find the optimal solution. This upper bound shows that the optimal scenario requires relatively few iterations. We verified our theoretical findings through experiments and demonstrated the optimal preemption strategy under various conditions. The results show that optimal preemption strategies can differ significantly based on the correlation matrix. Interestingly, packets with more diverse information probability are more important than packets with more information probability.
