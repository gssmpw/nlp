\section{Conclusions}

We propose \shortname, an efficient clustering algorithm for heterogeneous FL settings addressing the challenge of non-IID data and class imbalance. Unlike existing clustered FL methods, \shortname groups clients by data distributions with flexibility and robustness, simply using the information encoded by the individual empirical loss. \shortname successfully detects homogeneous clusters, as proved by our proposed novel Wasserstein Adjusted Score. \shortname detects splits by removing out-of-distribution clients, thus simplifying the learning task within clusters without increasing communication overhead or computational cost. Empirical evaluations show that separately training classical FL algorithms on the homogeneous clusters detected by \shortname consistently improves the performance. Additionally, \shortname excels over other clustering techniques in grouping clients uniformly with respect to class imbalance and heterogeneity levels, which is crucial to mitigate the effect of non-IIDness  FL. Finally, clustering on different class unbalanced and domain unbalanced scenarios, which are correctly detected by \shortname (see Section \ref{sect:ablation}), suggests that \shortname can also be applied to anomaly client detection and to enhance robustness against malicious attacks in future research.
