Training-free guidance enables controlled generation in diffusion and flow models, but most existing methods assume differentiable objectives and rely on gradients. This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose an algorithmic framework \textbf{\ouralg}:  \underline{Tree} Search-Based Path Steering \underline{G}uidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. \ouralg offers a unified perspective on training-free guidance: proposing candidates for the next step, evaluating candidates, and selecting the best to move forward, enhanced by a tree search mechanism over active paths or parallelizing exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of \ouralg over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating \ouralg into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that \ouralg consistently outperforms the top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule generation, and enhancer DNA design, all of which involve non-differentiable challenges. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing \ouralg's scalability in inference-time computation.
