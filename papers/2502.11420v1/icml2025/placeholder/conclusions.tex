\section{Conclusion}
We proposed the framework \ouralg based on inference path search, along with three novel instantiated algorithms: \xtsampling, \xcleansampling, and \xtgrad, to address the non-differentiability challenge in training-free guidance. Experimental results demonstrated the improvements of \ouralg against existing methods. Furthermore, we identified an inference-time scaling law that highlights \ouralg's scalability in inference-time computation.
