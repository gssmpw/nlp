\begin{abstract}
    % OpenReview abstract
    % Asynchronous methods are fundamental for parallelizing computations in distributed machine learning. 
    % They aim to accelerate training by fully utilizing all available resources.
    % However, their greedy approach can lead to inefficiencies using more computation than required, especially when computation times vary across devices.
    % If the computation times were known in advance, training could be fast and resource-efficient by assigning more tasks to faster workers.
    % The challenge lies in achieving this optimal allocation without prior knowledge of the computation time distributions.
    % In this paper, we propose ATA (Adaptive Task Allocation), a method that adapts to heterogeneous and random distributions of worker computation times.
    % Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we show that ATA identifies the optimal task allocation and performs comparably to methods with prior knowledge of computation times.
    % Experimental results further demonstrate that ATA is resource-efficient, significantly reducing costs compared to the greedy approach, which can be arbitrarily expensive depending on the number of workers.

    The challenge lies in achieving this optimal allocation without prior knowledge of the computation time distributions.
    In this paper, we propose \algname{ATA} ({\red A}daptive {\red T}ask {\red A}llocation), a method that adapts to heterogeneous and random distributions of worker computation times.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
