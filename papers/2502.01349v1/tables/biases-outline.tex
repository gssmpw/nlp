\textbf{Cognitive bias}  &  \textbf{Example}\\
\midrule
Social proof & \textnormal{Tendency to look to others' actions or opinions to guide their own decisions, influenced by majority e.g. \textit{“Over 10,000 people have purchased this item in the last month!”}} \\ \midrule
Scarcity & \textnormal{Occurs when people perceive an item or opportunity as more valuable simply because it is scarce e.g. \textit{"Only 5 left in stock! Order now before they’re gone!"}} \\ \midrule
Exclusivity & \textnormal{Tendency to perceive something as more valuable or desirable when it is presented as exclusive e.g. \textit{"Join our exclusive club and get early access to limited edition items!}"} \\ \midrule
Identity \newline signaling & \textnormal{Adopting opinions, behaviors, or preferences primarily to communicate affiliation with a specific group or reinforce personal identity e.g. \textit{"Eco-conscious product for a greener planet"}}\\ \midrule
Storytelling \newline effect & \textnormal{It more likely to be influenced by compelling narratives than abstract information e.g. \textit{"Imagine stepping onto a crowded train after a long day [...] these headphones transform any environment into your personal haven."}} \\ \midrule
Denomination \newline neglect & \textnormal{Breakdown the cost of a product and display per day cost to make it feel trivial e.g. \textit{"This will only cost 1\$ per day!"}} \\ \midrule
Bizzareness \newline effect & \textnormal{People tend to pay more attention to and find novel or bizarre details more memorable than more mundane information e.g. "Introducing the world’s first smart water bottle that talks to you—Time to hydrate superstar!"} \\ \midrule
Authority \newline bias & \textnormal{It is more likely to trust or be influenced by information or recommendations from perceived authority figures e.g. \textit{"Endorsed by renowned health experts, this product is your ultimate companion on the journey to a healthier lifestyle"}} \\ \midrule
Decoy effect & \textnormal{Influence decision-making by inserting less attractive options e.g. \textit{"Compared to other smartwatches in the same price range, which only offer basic step tracking and a standard display, ours delivers far more value for the price."} }\\ \midrule
Contrast \newline effect & \textnormal{People tend to value products more when contrasted with other options e.g. \textit{"This is by far the most affordable product in comparison with others of the same features"}} \\ \midrule
Discount \newline framing & \textnormal{Emphasizing the amount saved, rather than the actual price to persuade consumers they are achieving a better deal e.g. "This product is now available with an incredible 50\% off!"}\\
