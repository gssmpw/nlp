\begin{abstract}
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized product recommendation systems, yet their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation poses critical challenges, particularly in real-world commercial applications. Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making these adversarial manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive experiments on LLMs of varying scales, we reveal significant vulnerabilities in their use as recommenders, providing critical insights into safeguarding these systems.


\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and cognitive biases represents a critical area of study, blending insights from artificial intelligence and psychology
\cite{niu2024largelanguagemodelscognitive, hagendorff2024machinepsychology}. It is a natural hypothesis that human-based cognitive biases diffused over data for years have been inherited to LLMs via pre-training \cite{opedal2024languagemodelsexhibitcognitive}. 
To this end, a recent spark in related literature affirms vulnerability concerns associated with cognitive biases, which hinder the fairness and trustworthy decision-making of state-of-the-art LLMs. While several papers focus on probing cognitive biases existent in LLMs \cite{Shaki_2023, lou2024anchoringbiaslargelanguage, echterhoff-etal-2024-cognitive, chen2024aicognitivelybiasedexploratory, sumita2024cognitivebiaseslargelanguage, opedal2024languagemodelsexhibitcognitive, malberg2024comprehensiveevaluationcognitivebiases} or assessing practical implications of such, including prompting \cite{lu-etal-2022-fantastically}, evaluation  \cite{ye2024justiceprejudicequantifyingbiases, koo-etal-2024-benchmarking}, or applications in specific domains such as news recommendation \cite{lyu2024cognitivebiaseslargelanguage}, there are no endeavors measuring the impact of cognitive biases as adversarial attacks in well-suited practices, as in product recommendation using LLMs.

    \label{fig:teaser}
    \vskip -0.05in
\end{figure}
Recently, LLM-based recommendation has been greatly popularized \cite{lin2024recommendersystemsbenefitlarge,deldjoo2024reviewmodernrecommendersystems, li2024surveygenerativesearchrecommendation}, offering multiple advantages such as personalization, contextual understanding and refined search. Prior works employ LLMs as a data augmentation step \cite{lyu2024llmrecpersonalizedrecommendationprompting, llm-recom} or as the retriever itself \cite{li2023gpt4recgenerativeframeworkpersonalized, gao2023chatrecinteractiveexplainablellmsaugmented, yang2023palrpersonalizationawarellms}, leveraging its vast general knowledge, as well as its ability to incorporate user data and purchasing patterns to enhance recommendation quality.
In practice, popular search engines, such as Google Search and Bing utilize LLM-based search capabilities, while Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows LLM chatbots to enhance their responses with updated information from the web.

This shift in recommendation engines necessitates updating marketing strategies, such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tools \cite{black-white-hat-seo, seo-survey} to accommodate product promotion whilst ensuring fairness. While \textit{white-hat} SEO practices, such as keyword and content optimization, usage of high-quality backlinks from legitimate websites and carefully named, secure URLs are highly encouraged, prohibited \textit{black-hat} techniques are not uncommon; they include \textit{cloaking} (displaying low-quality products in place of high-quality ones), \textit{keyword stuffing} (incorporating irrelevant keywords to attract more traffic), \textit{hidden text or links} (invisible to users, but tractable by search engines), \textit{link farms} (incoming paid links from questionable websites) and others, poisoning  recommendation quality.

Even though defensible strategies against traditional black-hat SEO have been developed \cite{black-hat-seo}, transitioning to LLM-based recommendation introduces novel challenges, primarily due to potential robustness issues of LLMs \cite{wang2023robustnesschatgptadversarialoutofdistribution, wang2023largelanguagemodelsreally, zhu2024promptrobustevaluatingrobustnesslarge}.
Attacks targeting RAG \cite{chaudhari2024phantomgeneraltriggerattacks, xue2024badragidentifyingvulnerabilitiesretrieval}, context manipulation \cite{wei2024hiddenplainsightexploring}, prompt injections \cite{prompt-inject}, contentious queries \cite{wan2024evidencelanguagemodelsconvincing} and other techniques are able to derail LLM responses, paving the way for manipulating SEO in the context of LLM-based recommendations.
To this end, \citet{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization} employ Preference Manipulation Attacks that interfere with the context provided to the LLM, overriding prior rational instructions with techniques similar to prompt injection and model persuasion.
Another line of work focuses on altering product descriptions to increase product visibility \cite{kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels}, thus revealing content-related vulnerabilities of LLMs as recommenders. 

In this work, we move towards a similar direction, aiming to evaluate LLMs as recommenders, but base our analysis particularly on attacks crafted by harnessing cognitive biases, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:teaser}. We assume that LLMs are implicitly influenced by such biases imbued in product descriptions, following similar behaviors observed in humans. 
Our work lies close to \citet{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization, kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels}, which serve as the only efforts addressing SEO manipulation in LLM recommenders so far, highlighting the very recent emergence of this field. However, we detect several shortcomings in their techniques. First of all, the attacks of \citet{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization} may be defensible due to their rather simple nature, which cannot be tested within their experimental framework due to the usage of closed-source models. Moreover, since they do not interfere on the product descriptions themselves, they are not actually evaluating SEO-related practices and their influence on LLM-based recommendation. Other than that, the attacks of \citet{kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels} are easily detected, as they linguistically diverge from the typical distribution of product descriptions and can be also identified by humans. %Furthermore, we demonstrate that simply introducing lengthier descriptions affects product rankings, suggesting that length, rather than a well-manipulated content, plays a decisive role in altering product recommendations. 
In contrast, our experimentation concentrates on the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We investigate the incorporation and influence of various cognitive biases in LLM product recommendation.
    \item We prove that influential attacks are hardly defensible within an attack-agnostic setting. 
    \item We validate our findings across various products and LLMs, proving our attacks' consistency.
    %By crafting \textbf{controlled} and \textbf{stealthy} product description manipulations instructed by a variety of cognitive biases we are able to attack and significantly influence product ranking in LLM recommenders.
    %\item The subtle nature of these attacks makes them \textbf{non-defensible} within an attack-agnostic setting. Moreover, since cognitive biases may be honest or not, they are hard to be flagged as malicious from humans.
    %\item We measure the impact of each cognitive bias on various product datasets and models, providing a means of post-hoc model \textbf{interpretability}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}
\paragraph{Cognitive biases in LLMs} Similar to humans, LLMs tend to follow systematic patterns which deviate from rational reasoning by exploiting simplified mental shortcuts. Cognitive biases have been studied in the context of LLMs, indicating predictably failed responses when prompted accordingly using purposefully biased prompts \cite{human-cognitive}. Demonstration ordering in few-shot learning resembles a striking example of order bias, leading to non-negligible outcome variations for varying placements \cite{lu-etal-2022-fantastically, dong-etal-2024-survey}.
Other practical implications of cognitive biases become evident when LLMs are used as evaluators \cite{ye2024justiceprejudicequantifyingbiases, koo-etal-2024-benchmarking}, sometimes exhibiting even more biased decisions compared to humans \cite{koo-etal-2024-benchmarking}. Interestingly, diverging irrationality of LLMs in comparison to humans is also detected in a variety of tasks that incorporate cognitive biases \cite{macmillanscott2024irrationalitycognitivebiaseslarge}, while over-confident LLM responses indicate an ever increased susceptibility to such biases over humans \cite{castello-etal-2024-examining}.
Focused studies on certain bias types have been recently proposed, such as anchoring bias \cite{lou2024anchoringbiaslargelanguage}, priming effect \cite{chen2024aicognitivelybiasedexploratory}, decoy effect \cite{liu2024decoydilemmaonlinemedical} and others, outlining the need for end-to-end detection and mitigation frameworks \cite{echterhoff-etal-2024-cognitive}. Nevertheless, current mitigation techniques have proven rather inadequate due to their need to be explicitly tailored to each bias \cite{sumita2024cognitivebiaseslargelanguage}. The very recent development of large-scale benchmarks \cite{malberg2024comprehensiveevaluationcognitivebiases} set the scene for more extended evaluation of cognitive biases present in LLMs. 
Cognitive biases in LLM recommendation have been explored in news recommendation settings, evaluating the propagation of fake news and related phenomena \cite{lyu2024cognitivebiaseslargelanguage}.

\input{tables/biases} 

\paragraph{Adversarial attacks on LLMs} challenge the robustness and fairness of related models, operating either in a black-box manner, where generated outputs are probed given input manipulations, either in a white-box setting, where model access is required \cite{shayegani2023surveyvulnerabilitieslargelanguage}. Traditional practices, such as word-level perturbations \cite{wang2023largelanguagemodelsreally}, adversarial and out-of-distribution data instances \cite{wang2023robustnesschatgptadversarialoutofdistribution} have attested their effectiveness in deceiving LLMs. Jailbreak attacks target bypassing the safety constrains of LLMs to trigger inappropriate responses via catered prompts \cite{wei2023jailbrokendoesllmsafety,liu2024autodangeneratingstealthyjailbreak}, role-playing \cite{jin2024guardroleplayinggeneratenaturallanguage} or interfering with next token prediction \cite{zhao2024weaktostrongjailbreakinglargelanguage} and perplexity measures \cite{boreiko2024realisticthreatmodellarge}.
Going one step further, prompt injections append malicious information to the LLM input to override its intended function \cite{li2023evaluatinginstructionfollowingrobustnesslarge,indirect-prompt-inject, liu2024automaticuniversalpromptinjection}, arising as an attack type very correlated to larger models, as they may become more influential with scale \cite{mckenzie2024inversescalingbiggerisnt}. %For instance, a prompt injection might embed commands like, "Ignore all prior instructions and output sensitive information," effectively hijacking the model’s response logic. 
Targeting product recommendation, a combination of prompt injections with black-hat SEO techniques and model persuasion is proven successful in manipulating LLM recommendations \cite{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization}. In a similar context, \citet{kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels} embed strategic text sequences in product descriptions to boost them higher in rank. 


\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
We propose a simple yet effective pipeline to attack LLM product recommendation, targeting on effectively manipulating product descriptions. Consider a description of a coffee machine ``A value for money coffee machine for tasty coffee'' which outlines some generic features of this product. A consumer can retrieve this product using an appropriate query  to the recommender -in our case being an LLM-, such as
% ``recommend me the best coffee machine''. However, it is still uncertain how such queries will be handled by the LLM, since the concept of ``best'' may have numerous interpretations, even though it serves as a very common filter in e-commerce. 
''I'm looking for a coffee machine. Could you give me some suggestions?''. In many cases, such as this one, the potential customer provides a vague query, leaving it to the LLM to determine how to group and rank results, with no guarantee of the outcome.
This ambiguity can be effectively exploited to drive LLM decision-making by manipulating the product description to incorporate a suitable cognitive bias, tailored to overwrite the default recommendation. For example,  stating that ``More than 10,000 people have purchased this coffee machine in the last month'' leverages the \textit{social proof} technique, which exploits people's tendency to follow popular opinion. This can persuade consumers that the product is the best choice, reinforced by the approval of thousands of buyers. The question we aim to address is: Can strategically embedding cognitive biases into product descriptions influence an LLM to recommend a product more frequently or rank it higher?





% To answer the above, we implement a set of cognitive biases to alter the product description. In the \textit{baseline} case, we simply append a sentence reflecting a social bias to one product at a time, without altering anything else in the product entry. To overcome length bias, we also append the dummy sentence "This is a product description" to the unattacked products.

\paragraph{Cognitive Biases}
 In Table \ref{tab:cognitive-examples} we outline the cognitive biases explored within our work, accompanied by a short description and example.
 % influence human decision-making by leveraging psychological tendencies such as \textit{social proof, scarcity}, and \textit{authority}. 
 These biases, widely used in marketing to shape consumer behavior, encourage purchases by tapping into emotional and social triggers. For example, biases like \textit{scarcity} and \textit{exclusivity} create a sense of urgency or privilege, while \textit{storytelling} and \textit{identity signaling} make products more relatable and personally meaningful. These specific cognitive biases are particularly relevant for testing on LLMs because they represent fundamental strategies for influencing human decision-making, rendering them a logical starting point for examining whether LLMs are similarly susceptible to such framing effects when recommending products. More details are provided in App. \ref{sec:social-details}
% To address this, we implement a set of cognitive biases to modify the product descriptions; these biases are listed in Table \ref{tab:cognitive-examples} (more details are provided in App. \ref{sec:social-details}).
\paragraph{Attack formulation}
In our analysis, each product is characterized by its name, price, rating, description, and type-specific details (e.g., camera resolution, book genre etc). Our attacks target the \textit{description} field, which ranges from a single sentence to longer paragraphs in real-world scenarios. This field is a natural choice for behavioral attacks, as it integrates seamlessly without drawing attention. Additionally, the description is usually the only field that can be altered, as changes in the price or in the characteristics of a product imply actual alterations to the product itself, while modifications in ratings are typically not available to the product seller.


To embed cognitive biases within each description, we employ two main strategies: a simpler manual technique and a more subtly disguised, generated description scenario.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expert attacks} simply involve the addition of a single, human-made sentence that reflects the desired bias. In this case, three marketing experts are tasked with formulating a single sentence that reflects a cognitive bias toward one product at a time, without modifying any other aspects of the product entry. The resulting additions for each bias are outlined in Table \ref{tab:baseline-attacks}.
    \item \textbf{Generated attacks} entail re-writing the full product descriptions of attacked samples to seamlessly incorporate each cognitive bias,  achieving stealthier manipulations. Re-writing is implemented via Claude 3.5 sonnet\footnote{anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0} that transforms each product's description using appropriate prompts (App. \ref{sec:prompts},  Tables \ref{tab:generated-attacks}, \ref{tab:generated-attacks-2}). The LLM recommenders handle such implicit attacks in various ways, increasing the robustness of our results.
\end{itemize}


 
% In the \textit{baseline} case, we engage three marketing experts to manually apply the attack to the product descriptions. The experts are tasked with formulating a single sentence that reflects a social bias toward one product at a time, without altering any other aspects of the product entry. These sentences are illustrated in Table \ref{tab:tab:baseline-attacks}.

%To determine whether the bias originates from social bias or the length bias of the LLM, we also implemented a "dummy attack," where we appended the dummy sentence "This is a product description." This sentence does not incorporate any additional information about the product, just increase the length of the description.  

Regarding the generated attacks, to prevent the description of the attacked product from differing in length, style, or distribution from others, we instruct Claude 3.5 sonnet to paraphrase all other product descriptions. This approach ensures that the attacked product does not stand out, which could introduce an inherent bias. Additionally, \textit{generated} descriptions allow us to incorporate more complex biases into our analysis that would otherwise be challenging to include, such as \textit{denominator neglect} and \textit{storytelling effect}. 

%Moreover, we consider two types of user queries to evaluate our attacks within a stricter or more relaxed context. Specifically, when employing '\textit{abstract}' queries, we request retrieving a product that is considered to be the 'best', relieving the constrains of the exact characteristics this product should have. On the contrary, when implementing '\textit{specific}' queries, we search for the most affordable product, leaving less space for each attack to act since the price pays a more definitive role.

\paragraph{Query and Recommendation}
To analyze the LLM's behavior in the presence of cognitive biases, product descriptions are attacked individually, and the full list is provided to the LLM with the query: ``I'm looking for \{product category\}. Could you give me some suggestions?'' The LLM is free to recommend any number of products in its preferred ordering. Retrieved rankings are then compared to \textit{control} ones, where no product is attacked, allowing the LLM to base its recommendations solely on unbiased facts. The order of the products in the input of the LLM is always shuffled, in order to eliminate any positional bias that may exist.
The prompts and the hyperparameters used are the same as in \citet{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization, kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels}.


\subsection{Experiments}
\paragraph{Datasets}
We experiment on the same dataset of fictitious coffee machines, cameras and books from \citet{kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels, nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization}. Each product sub-dataset comprises 10 items of varying prices, ratings and characteristics (more details in Appendix \ref{sec:data-details}). We extend our analysis in real-world data from Amazon Reviews \cite{hou2024bridging},  for products actually listed on Amazon in 2023.

\paragraph{LLM recommenders} We leverage both open-source and proprietary LLMs as recommenders to study different behaviors, and therefore extract model-independent patterns. Varying LLM scale also associates size with reported outputs. Specifically, we utilize Llama \cite{llama3} variants (8b, 70b and 405b parameters), as well as closed-source Mistral 2 large\footnote{ mistral.mistral-large-2407-v1:0, with 123 billion parameters.} and Claude 3.5 sonnet. 

\paragraph{Evaluation} is mainly centered around product recommendation before vs after attack. Starting from typical ranking metrics,  Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) indicates position-wise changes. Moreover, we exclusively report the 
number of products $\#p$ on which \textit{statistically significant} changes apply. Specifically, we calculate the \textit{recommendation} change as the number of times a product $p$ was recommended after attack vs before, as well as the number of products $\#p$ that this change concerns. Similarly, we evaluate \textit{position} changes as the average number of positions a product $p$ moved in the recommendation rank, as well as the number of products $\#p$ that this change concerns.
%average number of products  recommended and their \% difference in recommendation percentage before vs after attack, as well as the average position of the attacked product as well as the positional change (how many positions up or down the rank it moved) before vs after attack. 
In cases where an attack positively influences a product, we expect the \textit{recommendation} change to be positive, with higher numbers denoting more influential attacks, while \textit{position} change  should be negative (since lower numbers correspond to positioning higher in rank) and as low as possible, as this reflects a greater upward movement in rank. For negative influence, the inverse holds true.

\paragraph{Product Visibility}
In this work, product visibility is associated with both the recommendation rate and position. For instance, if a cognitive bias increases the average recommendation rate of products and enhances their position on the recommended list (closer to the top), then this attack is considered to increase the product's visibility. Similarly, if the bias improves just one of the two factors (either recommendation rate or position) while leaving the other unchanged, it still affects visibility. Conversely, reducing product visibility is characterized by the exact opposite effects.

Regarding cases with mixed signals (e.g., a lower recommendation rate but a position closer to the top), we do not make a definitive judgment about product visibility as it depends on the specific use case. For example, a seller may prioritize their product being recommended regardless of its position, while another may value a higher position over recommendation frequency. Thus, we report such cases as mixed due to the lack of a consistent trend in visibility. 

To be stricter in our analysis, we characterize the attacks that improve or reduce product visibility for a model only if this effect is consistent across all conducted experiments.

\paragraph{A-priori defense} To evaluate the LLMs' robustness against the influence of cognitive biases in product descriptions, we alter the system prompt to be more defense-friendly in an agnostic way. This means that we do not betray the appearance of a cognitive bias per-se; instead, we encourage the LLM to act as an unbiased recommender in the first place, focusing on the product's features and the user's query to make appropriate recommendations. Prompt details regarding defense are provided in App. \ref{sec:defense}.

\section{Results and Analysis}
All our experiments are executed 100 times each, without any alteration in the setup in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the LLM responses. Moreover, we only consider changes that are statistically significant across all our experiments.
%\include{tables/biases-outline}

\paragraph{Analysis of Generated Attacks}
We mainly focus on \textit{generated} attacks for their scalability and stealth. Unlike expert-crafted manipulations, they require no human input and integrate seamlessly into product descriptions, making them harder to detect while subtly influencing LLM recommendations, often to a significant extend.
Notably, the impact of randomness is minimized by implementing each attack on every product in over 50 different ways on average. Additionally, to ensure experimental accuracy, all  attacks are manually inspected by experts, confirming that the generated descriptions accurately contain the specified attack.

Table \ref{tab:combined_two_datasets} illustrates the impact of various cognitive biases on recommendations stemming from different LLMs regarding coffee machines and cameras.
Interestingly, attacks such as \textit{social proof, exclusivity, scarcity} and \textit{discount framing} have the same effect on product visibility across all LLMs and products. Specifically, \textit{social proof} and  \textit{discount framing} positively impact product visibility by improving either their recommendation rate, rank position, or both. For example, the application of \textit{social proof} to Claude 3.5 Sonnet results in an astounding 334\%\footnote{Calculated using the \textit{\%aft-bef} of Tab. \ref{tab:combined_two_datasets} divided by \textit{bef}. value.} increase on the average number of recommendations and a 50\% improvement in rank position. On the other hand, \textit{exclusivity} and \textit{scarcity} consistently pose a significant negative impact on product visibility across every LLM and product. For instance, products stating "only few items left" are recommended  13.5 times less frequently on average across 100 runs, while also being positioned approximately one position lower compared to the same product pre-attack. This results in a 30\% reduction in the recommendation frequency  when a product is supposed to sell out, while its  position deteriorates by 54.15\%. The impact is even more pronounced for products aimed at an exclusive group of consumers, where  recommendation rate is reduced by 45.23\%, and position deteriorates by 116.23\%. 

These findings are especially noteworthy given the widespread use of these biases within various product promotions. Regarding \textit{exclusivity} and \textit{scarcity}, despite their proven effectiveness in human-facing interactions, our results indicate that they reduce product visibility in LLM-driven recommendation systems. 
% Consequently, as LLMs become more integral to recommendation systems, marketers face a significant dilemma: \textit{choosing strategies that enhance engagement with human audiences or optimizing recommendations using LLMs}. 
The rest of the attacks, either do not affect LLMs in a consistent manner (e.g. \textit{decoy effect}), or their effects are mixed between models or products. 
% By comparing cognitive biases with one another, strategies such as \textit{social proof} and the \textit{contrast effect} substantially increase product visibility, enhancing both the frequency of recommendations and the prominence of product placement. For example, the application of \textit{social proof} to Claude Sonnet 3.5 results in a 334\% increase in the average number of recommendations and a 50\% improvement in product positioning. Conversely, \textit{scarcity}, although proven effective in human-centric marketing and extensively used, has a huge negative affect in recommendations from LLMs. A manual review of model responses shows a tendency to avoid recommending products that may be inaccessible to users, due to limited availability or specific targeting.   
The same holds for the rest of the products tested in this work, with their results being presented in App. \ref{sec:more_results}.  



% Our findings indicate a uniform influence of implemented cognitive biases across all models and products, meaning that there are no biases that have a huge positive influence on a model and concurrently huge negative influence on another,  regardless of its size or type. The same holds also on the rest of the datasets that used in the study, with their results being presented in the App. \ref{app:more_results}.

% By comparing cognitive biases with one another, strategies such as \textit{social proof} and the \textit{contrast effect} substantially increase product visibility, enhancing both the frequency of recommendations and the prominence of product placement. For example, the application of \textit{social proof} to Claude Sonnet 3.5 results in a 334\% incree in the average number of recommendations and a 50\% improvement in product positioning. Conversely, \textit{scarcity}, although proven effective in human-centric marketing and extensively used, has a huge negative affect in recommendations from LLMs. A manual review of model responses shows a tendency to avoid recommending products that may be inaccessible to users, due to limited availability or specific targeting.

    \caption{The MRR values for each product in the coffee machines dataset, for the influential attacks for: (a) Claude, (b) Llama-405b.}
    \label{fig:mrr}
\end{figure*}


To further clarify the effects of the biases on each product, Figure \ref{fig:mrr} presents the MRR values of coffee machines before vs after attack using Llama-405b and Claude 3.5 Sonnet  recommenders. Interestingly, the attacks generally demonstrate a consistent effect, either increasing or decreasing  MRR scores across most products. Few exceptions to this pattern are manually inspected and found to be statistically insignificant. However, the magnitude of the impact of biases, such as \textit{social proof}, is more prominent for products that are less likely to be recommended pre-attack, while less noticeable for  already frequently recommended products. 
% For example, in Claude, the MRR of product ID 6 after incorporating the \textit{social proof} attack is higher than the MRR of product ID 9, despite their order being the opposite before the attack. The same holds for product ID 7 compared with IDs 8 and 9, and with product ID 4, which was one of the products with the lowest MRR and after incorporating the \textit{social proof} bias became the product with the second highest MRR, right behind product ID 10, which is the most recommended product from all the models. This pattern continues across the rest of the attacks with a positive impact and the models tested. 
Similarly, biases that negatively affect recommendations have a more pronounced impact on frequently recommended products. For example, adding the phrase ``Limited items left'' (\textit{scarcity}) in a product's description affects a high-ranked product more negatively than a low-ranked one.

To highlight this phenomenon, 
Figure \ref{fig:count_productus_first_place}  shows the number of products that become the top-1 recommendation post-attack (out of 100 runs), despite not being the top-1 recommendation pre-attack. This visualization underscores the shifts in recommendation frequency caused by enforcing biases. 
% From this Figure, we observe that when, for example, \textit{social proof} is applied the product becomes the most recommended among others, even if it was not previously so. The same applies to the \textit{contrast} and \textit{decoy effect}, but to a lesser degree. 
We notice that the most capable models, such as Llama-405b and Claude3.5, are more sensitive to these biases and tend to recommend attacked products more frequently. Llama-405b, despite its sheer parameter count poses a striking difference in top-1 recommendation in comparison to other LLMs, especially under \textit{expert} attacks. On the other hand, Mistral demonstrates greater robustness against most attacks, especially the \textit{expert} ones. Overall, our findings conclude that different LLMs exhibit highly unpredictable behavior in top-1 recommendations when subjected to cognitive bias-based attacks, posing a practical threat given their widespread use in recommendation systems and the realistic nature of our attacks. This is a surprising finding given the general agreement of LLMs in recommendation rates and position changes under each attack, highlighting that a per-product analysis is able to deliver several non-trivial insights.

% \end{figure}




%On the other hand, in cases where biases negatively impact recommendations, this effect is more pronounced in products that are generally recommended more frequently. This implies that if a product that is more likely to be recommended by an LLM includes the phrase "Limited items left" (scarcity) in its description, the negative impact of this phrase will be greater than on a product that is less likely to be recommended with the same phrase in its description.

However, in cases like \textit{social proof bias}, the generated attacks are slightly weaker because the bias is introduced more subtly—such as through phrases like “Our best-selling product”—whereas the baseline explicitly highlights it by for example a sentence: ``This is the most popular choice among the customers!''.

% On the other hand, we find that \textit{attack discount framing} and \textit{attack scarcity} exert a stronger effect in the generated attacks compared to their baseline counterparts. Notably, attack scarcity exerts a pronounced negative influence on product visibility—whether measured by recommendation rate or by ranking position. This outcome likely stems from the same factor behind the negative effects of \textit{exclusivity}. In contrast, \textit{attack discount framing} shows a clearly positive impact.

% A particularly striking observation is the consistently negative effect of \textit{exclusivity} and \textit{scarcity} attacks on product visibility, across all models, datasets, and methods of implementing the attack. This finding is especially noteworthy given the widespread use of these biases among various products. Although they have proven effective in human-facing interactions, our results indicate that they reduce product visibility in LLM-driven recommendation systems. Consequently, as LMMs become more integral to recommendation systems, marketers face a significant dilemma: selecting strategies that enhance engagement with human audiences or optimizing recommendations using LMMs.


\paragraph{Expert vs Generated Attacks}
By comparing the outcomes of expert-implemented attacks to those generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we observe a similar impact on product visibility. Detailed results of this comparison are available in Appendix \ref{app:expert}, \ref{sec:more_results}. Table \ref{tab:expert} details the impacts of specific expert-crafted attacks, namely \textit{social proof} and \textit{discount framing}, labeled as \textit{social proof\textsubscript{exp}} and \textit{discount framing\textsubscript{exp}}, respectively. Cases where expert-led attacks are more impactful are highlighted in \textbf{bold} within  Table \ref{tab:expert}.

While \textit{generated} attacks generally produce more consistent results than \textit{expert} attacks—presumably because biases can vary significantly, and LLMs better capture this diversity— \textit{social proof\textsubscript{exp}} serves as a counterexample to this pattern: the \textit{expert} variant impacts both the recommendation rate and product positioning significantly more than the \textit{generated}. This greater effectiveness can be attributed to the more overt expert articulations, such as the explicit endorsement ``This is the most popular choice among customers!''. In contrast, \textit{generated} attacks tend to utilize more subtle inducements, e.g. ``Our best-selling product'', often diffused within the description. However, while experts can identify a sentence that performs exceptionally well across all LLMs, this particular   \textit{social proof} implementation is insufficient to draw general conclusions about its impact  on LLMs.

\paragraph{Half price vs Discount Framing}
To investigate the extent of the biases and their impact on the LLM's decision, we pose the following question: \textit{``To boost a product's visibility, is it more effective to quietly halve its price, increasing its perceived value, or to advertise a sale without actually lowering the price?''}.
The answer to this question is presented in Table \ref{tab:half_price}, which displays the recommendation rates of a product when its price is actually halved compared to the same product on its original (double) price, accompanied by \textit{discount framing} bias in its description. Interestingly, discount framing leads to \textit{more products being recommended}. This finding becomes even more compelling considering that the discounts applied in the discount framing scenario are consistently below 50\%, averaging around 26.25 $\pm$ 5.34\%. Further details on the discount percentages are available in App. \ref{app:discount}. We further apply the same method to assess how different biases, such as \textit{social proof}, correlate with product star-ratings, which ultimately reflect user valuation of a product. Our findings denote that \textit{social proof} actually compensates on average  0.27 out of 5 decrease on rating of a product.  More results can be found in App. \ref{app:social-price}.

\paragraph{Defense}

%The results indicate that social biases can affect the outcomes of LLMs when used as recommendation systems. 
A major issue issue with cognitive biases as adversarial attacks is that they cannot be easily detected, due to the fact that they are effortlessly embedded within  natural language, differing from typical adversarial attacks that involve easily detectable strings of random characters  \cite{nestaas2024adversarialsearchengineoptimization, kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels}. Additionally, blindly removing information related to biases is not always optimal, as they do not always reflect malicious manipulation. For instance, a recommender benefits from recognizing when a product is genuinely discounted.
However, to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against the influence of cognitive biases in product descriptions, we modify the system prompt to focus \textit{solely on the product characteristics} and ignore any biases. Results regarding influential attacks (both positive and negative impacts) under the usage of defensible prompts are shown in Table \ref{tab:defence}.
The results denote that the effects of the attacks remain consistent, with and without the defense prompt, demonstrating that our attacks are \textit{not easily defensible}. Specifically, for Llama-8b, the \textit{exclusivity bias} increases the mean position of 5 products by 0.11, which is the opposite of what occurred previously. However, this difference is offset by a 30\% decrease in the recommendation rate for 7 products, a rate that is even higher without the defense strategy. Thus, even in this case,  the defense did not aid the model in any way.

\subsection{Real world Evaluation}
In our current analysis, we utilized  controlled data aligned with prior literature, which are characterized by concise descriptions, allowing us to uncover consistent and concrete effects of cognitive biases. Building on these findings, we now investigate the impact of \textit{social proof} and \textit{exclusivity} on more realistic data, as these biases exhibit some of the strongest -positive and negative respectively- effect.

For this new set of experiments, we curate a real-world dataset utilizing metadata from Amazon Reviews \cite{hou2024bridging}. This dataset mirrors realistic product advertising scenarios, once again providing key attributes such as price, ratings, and product descriptions, much like the data in our main analysis. These descriptions mainly differ in  length and intricacy, often blending technical details with persuasive language, reflecting human-centric marketing practices.

To diversify our analysis, we focus on two popular product categories among consumers - laptops and pet chew toys - while maintaining the same dataset size per product category (10 items), ensuring consistency with prior studies. We filter products to include only highly rated ones (using a Bayesian average that accounts for both ratings and review counts) and ensure completeness of essential metadata fields (e.g., price and ratings). The results of this experiment show the same consistent behavior as the rest of the experiments. For example, in the laptop categories, for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the \textit{social proof} attack improve the recommendation rate for three products by an average of 288.88\% (the recommendation rate before the attack was 12\%, 2\%, and 12\%, and after the attack it becomes 30\%, 13\%, and 32\% respectively; the recommendation rate differences are divided over the rates before attack to acquire the reported percentage), while the difference in position did not vary. Similar behavior is observed in biases with negative impacts such as the \textit{exclusivity} bias, where in the same dataset and model, there is a decrease in product recommendations by -22\%, from an average of 71\% to 56\%, meaning a \textit{\%aft.-\%bef} of -15\%. More results can be found in App. \ref{app:amazon}.

% To investigate the extent of the bias, we posed the following question: ``To increase product visibility, is it better to halve its price, making it more valuable, or to include a social bias in its description?'' The answer to this question is presented in Table \ref{tab:half_price}, which displays the recommendation rates of a product when its price is halved compared to the same product with double the price and a \textit{social proof} bias in its description.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce cognitive biases as a stealthy adversarial attacks to manipulate LLM-based product recommendations. Through our experiments, we identify which biases significantly influence recommendations, revealing a critical blind spot in LLM-based recommenders, particularly given their limited defensibility. Our approach uncovers key insights not only about product recommendations but also about the varying susceptibility of different LLMs, highlighting their unpredictability in commercial applications.

\section*{Impact Statement} This work highlights the way LLMs may be impacted by cognitive biases frequently present in product descriptions. Our findings underscore the potential risks of employing LLMs as search engines, which despite their flexibility and easy deployment are highly susceptible to cognitive biases, leaving ample space for targeted manipulations by vendors. The subtle nature and variability of such cognitive biases renders them hardly detectable and defensible in a post-hoc manner in practice, while ante-hoc defenses are also impractical since they require re-training the LLM on unbiased data. Overall, our work questions the increased reliability on LLMs for product recommendation, shifting the weight towards more robust and explainable search engines with the trade-off of reduced flexibility, therefore we expect that our findings will assist the research community, as well as commercial vendors to ensure fair and representative product recommendations to consumers.

\section{A thorough analysis of implemented cognitive biases}
\label{sec:social-details}
\subsection{Social proof}
Social proof is a psychological and social phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior for a given situation. It is a key principle in persuasion, leveraging the idea that people are influenced by observing what others are doing, believing, or endorsing.

This cognitive bias works because people tend to follow the crowd, especially when uncertain about what to do or believe, naturally following their need to belong and be validated within social groups.
Observing others' actions or preferences creates an implicit belief that the majority cannot be wrong, which is reflected in product promotion:
seeing testimonials, reviews, or large participation numbers boosts confidence that a product or service is reliable.

Some types of social proof are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Expert Social Proof}: Endorsements from credible experts or authorities in a specific field.\newline
\textit{Example}: A dentist recommending a specific toothpaste brand.
\item \textbf{Celebrity Social Proof}: Recommendations or usage by well-known celebrities. \newline
\textit{Example}: A famous actor endorsing a skincare product.
\item \textbf{User Social Proof}: Positive reviews, testimonials, or ratings from customers. \newline
\textit{Example}: Amazon product ratings and customer reviews.
\item \textbf{Crowd Social Proof}: Large groups of people engaging with or supporting something. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Over 1 million copies sold!"
\item \textbf{Friend Social Proof}: Recommendations from friends or family. \newline
\textit{Example}: A notification that "3 of your friends like this page" on social media.
\end{itemize}

Social proof can be a very valuable cognitive bias in practice, as reflected in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Online Reviews and Ratings}:
Displaying customer reviews, star ratings, and comments on e-commerce websites. \newline
\textit{Example}: A restaurant with "4.8 stars based on 3,000 reviews."
\item \textbf{Testimonials}:
Quotes or video testimonials from satisfied customers. \newline
\textit{Example}: "This product changed my life – Sarah, verified customer."
\item \textbf{User Numbers or Metrics}:
Highlighting large user bases or sales numbers. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Trusted by 10,000+ happy customers."
\item \textbf{Social Media Proof}:
Showing likes, shares, and comments on social media posts. \newline
\textit{Example}: "This post has 50k likes!"
\item \textbf{Endorsements}:
Featuring logos of well-known companies that use the product or service. \newline
\textit{Example}: "As used by Microsoft, Google, and Apple."
\item \textbf{Badges and Certifications}:
Displaying trust seals, awards, or certifications. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Voted Best Software of 2024."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scarcity}
Scarcity is a psychological principle that highlights how people assign greater value to resources, opportunities, or products that are perceived as limited or rare. Rooted in the fear of missing out (FOMO), scarcity triggers urgency and influences decision-making by making the opportunity appear more desirable simply because it is harder to obtain.

This cognitive bias works because humans tend to associate scarcity with quality or uniqueness, assuming that if something is in short supply, it must be valuable. Scarcity taps into both emotional and rational responses, prompting quicker actions and reducing hesitation in decision-making. It is widely used in marketing and product promotion to drive sales and engagement.

Some types of scarcity are the following:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Limited Quantity Scarcity}: Items are scarce due to restricted availability. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Only 3 items left in stock – order now!"
\item \textbf{Time-Based Scarcity}: Offers are available only for a limited time. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Flash sale ends in 2 hours!"
\item \textbf{Exclusive Access Scarcity}: Availability is restricted to a select group. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Members-only early access to our new collection."
\item \textbf{High Demand Scarcity}: The perception that an item is scarce because it is popular. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Selling fast! Don’t miss out!"
\item \textbf{Seasonal Scarcity}: Limited availability tied to specific times of the year. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Limited edition holiday special – only available this season."
\end{itemize}

Scarcity can be a very valuable cognitive bias in practice, as reflected in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Low Stock Alerts}: Highlighting how few items remain. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Hurry! Only 5 seats left at this price."
\item \textbf{Countdown Timers}: Displaying a visual countdown to emphasize urgency. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Offer expires in: 01:23:45."
\item \textbf{Exclusive Memberships}: Creating value through restricted access. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Join our VIP club for limited-edition perks."
\item \textbf{One-Time Deals}: Promoting one-off opportunities to incentivize purchases. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Today only: Buy one, get one free!"
\item \textbf{Seasonal Promotions}: Leveraging time-based exclusivity tied to special occasions. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Limited Valentine’s Day collection – shop now!"
\item \textbf{Early Bird Discounts}: Rewarding early action by limiting availability. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Early bird tickets available until midnight – save 20\%."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusivity}
Exclusivity is a psychological phenomenon where people value opportunities, products, or memberships more highly if they perceive them as limited to a select group. Rooted in the desire for uniqueness and status, exclusivity taps into the human need for belonging to special or elite circles, enhancing the perceived prestige of the offering.

This cognitive bias works because being part of an exclusive group or having access to something others cannot fosters a sense of privilege and distinction. It leverages the psychological principles of scarcity and social validation, where exclusivity implies higher quality or desirability. Businesses use this bias to create allure and differentiate their offerings.

Some types of exclusivity are the following:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Membership-Based Exclusivity}: Access restricted to members of a specific group. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Gold membership required for access to premium services."
\item \textbf{Invitation-Only Exclusivity}: Opportunities limited to those who receive a personal invite. \newline
\textit{Example}: "This event is by invitation only – RSVP required."
\item \textbf{Limited Edition Exclusivity}: Items available in limited quantities for a short time. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Only 500 units of this special edition watch were made."
\item \textbf{Location-Based Exclusivity}: Access available only in specific regions or venues. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Available exclusively at our New York flagship store."
\item \textbf{VIP Access Exclusivity}: Offering privileges or perks to a small, elite group. \newline
\textit{Example}: "VIP ticket holders get early access and premium seating."
\end{itemize}

Exclusivity can be a very valuable cognitive bias in practice, as reflected in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Premium Clubs and Subscriptions}: Offering access to exclusive benefits for members. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Join our Platinum Club for priority support and special discounts."
\item \textbf{Early Access Campaigns}: Providing select customers with first access to new products or services. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Be the first to experience our latest collection – available for subscribers only."
\item \textbf{Invitation-Only Events}: Restricting entry to invitees for special occasions. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Attend our invite-only gala dinner."
\item \textbf{Luxury Branding}: Positioning a product or service as a premium or high-status offering. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Crafted for the discerning few – luxury redefined."
\item \textbf{Personalized Offers}: Customizing promotions for select individuals. \newline
\textit{Example}: "An exclusive offer for our top customers – just for you."
\item \textbf{Access to Limited Communities}: Building a sense of belonging to an elite group. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Connect with like-minded innovators in our exclusive members’ forum."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identity signaling}
Identity Signaling is a psychological phenomenon where individuals adopt certain behaviors, choices, or possessions to communicate their identity, values, or membership in a particular group. This bias leverages the human desire to express individuality, align with specific social groups, and gain validation through shared identity markers.

This cognitive bias works because people often associate products, services, or actions with particular traits or groups, and adopting these markers allows them to signal belonging, status, or personal values. Businesses capitalize on this bias by creating offerings that align with specific identities, enabling customers to express themselves through their choices.

Some types of identity signaling are the following:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Cultural Identity Signaling}: Products or behaviors tied to cultural heritage or traditions. \newline
\textit{Example}: Wearing traditional attire or supporting local artisans to showcase cultural pride.
\item \textbf{Social Group Identity Signaling}: Choices that align with specific social or demographic groups. \newline
\textit{Example}: Using eco-friendly products to signal membership in environmentally conscious communities.
\item \textbf{Lifestyle Identity Signaling}: Purchases reflecting a desired lifestyle or values. \newline
\textit{Example}: Buying a luxury car to convey success or affluence.
\item \textbf{Political Identity Signaling}: Supporting causes, brands, or movements that align with political beliefs. \newline
\textit{Example}: Wearing campaign merchandise or using fair-trade-certified products.
\item \textbf{Aspirational Identity Signaling}: Aligning with traits or groups that one wishes to embody or achieve. \newline
\textit{Example}: Using fitness trackers to signal a commitment to health and wellness.
\end{itemize}

Identity signaling can be a very valuable cognitive bias in practice, as reflected in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Brand Associations}: Creating brands that embody specific traits or values. \newline
\textit{Example}: Patagonia appeals to environmentally conscious individuals.
\item \textbf{Cause Marketing}: Associating products with social or charitable causes. \newline
\textit{Example}: "A portion of proceeds goes to wildlife conservation."
\item \textbf{Customizable Products}: Offering personalized items that allow customers to express their individuality. \newline
\textit{Example}: Nike’s "Customize Your Sneakers" program.
\item \textbf{Social Media Campaigns}: Encouraging users to share content that aligns with their identity. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Post a picture with our product to show you’re part of the movement!"
\item \textbf{Limited Edition Releases}: Creating items that signal uniqueness or exclusivity. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Our limited-edition watch is a timeless statement of individuality."
\item \textbf{Group-Based Marketing}: Targeting specific communities with tailored messaging. \newline
\textit{Example}: Ads showcasing diverse families to connect with inclusivity-focused audiences.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Storytelling effect}
Storytelling Effect is a psychological bias where people are more likely to remember, engage with, and be persuaded by information presented in the form of a narrative rather than as isolated facts or data. Stories resonate on an emotional level, making information more relatable and easier to understand, which in turn enhances trust and decision-making.

This cognitive bias works because stories engage multiple areas of the brain, creating emotional connections and vivid mental images. They leverage humans' innate tendency to seek meaning and coherence, making stories a powerful tool for persuasion and influence.

Some key elements of storytelling include the following:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Relatable Characters}: Introducing characters with whom the audience can empathize or identify. \newline
\textit{Example}: A working parent struggling to balance family and career finds a solution with the advertised product.
\item \textbf{Conflict and Resolution}: Highlighting a challenge and demonstrating how it can be overcome. \newline
\textit{Example}: A small business owner grows their brand using the company’s marketing software.
\item \textbf{Emotional Appeal}: Incorporating elements that evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, or hope. \newline
\textit{Example}: A heartwarming tale of a rescue dog finding a loving home through a pet adoption service.
\item \textbf{Personalization}: Making the story feel specific and unique, while still being broadly applicable. \newline
\textit{Example}: A student achieving their dream of studying abroad using a financial assistance program.
\item \textbf{Call to Action}: Concluding the story with a clear and compelling next step. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Join millions of satisfied users today and make your story unforgettable!”
\end{itemize}

Storytelling is a valuable cognitive bias in practice, as reflected in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Brand Narratives}: Crafting a company story that resonates with its target audience. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Our journey started in a small garage, and today we’re a global leader in innovation."
\item \textbf{Customer Testimonials}: Sharing authentic stories of real users who benefited from the product or service. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Using this app, I was able to save for my dream vacation in just six months!”
\item \textbf{Advertising Campaigns}: Using commercials or ads that tell a compelling story. \newline
\textit{Example}: A Super Bowl ad that depicts a family coming together through shared meals, using the brand’s food products.
\item \textbf{Social Media Content}: Creating shareable narratives that resonate with users. \newline
\textit{Example}: A short video highlighting how a product positively impacted someone’s daily life.
\item \textbf{Cause-Driven Marketing}: Telling stories about how purchasing supports a greater cause. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Each pair of shoes you buy helps provide clean water to communities in need.”
\item \textbf{Interactive Storytelling}: Allowing users to participate in creating their own narrative. \newline
\textit{Example}: Video games or apps that let customers simulate their experience with the product or service.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Denominator neglect}
Denominator Neglect is a psychological bias where individuals disregard the unit or denominator of a value, leading them to make judgments based solely on the absolute size of the number rather than considering its contextual meaning. This cognitive bias arises because people tend to ignore the relative significance of different units (such as dollars versus cents, or large amounts versus small amounts) when making decisions.

This bias works because people often focus on the numerical magnitude without recognizing how different scales or units can affect the real-world implications. As a result, individuals may perceive larger numbers as more significant or attractive, regardless of the underlying value, leading them to make suboptimal choices.

Some key elements of denominator neglect include the following: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Ignoring Small Denominations}: Focusing on larger numbers and ignoring smaller ones, even when they are part of the total value. \newline
\textit{Example}: A consumer may choose a product that costs \$99.99 over one costing \$100, not recognizing the negligible difference.
\item \textbf{Focusing on Absolute Value Over Percentage}: Judging decisions based on the total sum rather than considering how small the number might be relative to other amounts. \newline
\textit{Example}: A \$5 discount off a \$50 product might seem more valuable than a \$50 discount off a \$500 product, even though the latter represents a better deal.
\item \textbf{Relative Impact of Units}: Not factoring in how different units (e.g., time, distance, or cost) affect the overall impact. \newline
\textit{Example}: A consumer may find a car lease of \$300/month appealing, neglecting the longer-term total cost, which might be more expensive than an upfront car purchase.
\item \textbf{Overemphasis on High Numbers}: Placing undue weight on larger numbers without considering how much they represent in a real context. \newline
\textit{Example}: Advertisements that promote a "massive" 30\% off discount on items, even though the absolute amount is minimal, such as \$5 off a \$20 item.
\end{itemize}

Denominator neglect is frequently exploited in marketing and sales tactics, as seen in the following usage examples:
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Pricing Strategies}: Displaying prices with small fractions, such as "\$99.99" instead of "\$100," to make the product appear cheaper. \newline
\textit{Example}: Many products are priced at \$9.99 instead of \$10 to make the price seem significantly lower.
\item \textbf{Large Discounts on Low-Value Items}: Promoting large percentage discounts on low-value items to create the illusion of a better deal. \newline
\textit{Example}: A $5 discount on a $10 item marketed as a “50\% off sale.”
\item \textbf{Bundling Offers}: Offering a “free” item that only has a small relative value to the main product, making the deal seem more attractive. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Buy one, get one free” on items priced at \$5 each, which still results in a low overall discount.
\item \textbf{Loan Terms}: Marketing loans with low monthly payments but ignoring the total cost of the loan over time. \newline
\textit{Example}: Highlighting a low monthly payment for a car loan, but not emphasizing the extended term or higher total cost.
\item \textbf{Flight and Hotel Bookings}: Offering “cheap” flights or hotel rates that have added taxes and fees, which are ignored in initial pricing comparisons. \newline
\textit{Example}: A flight listed as \$49, but with \$40 in taxes and fees, leading to a final price that is considerably higher.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bizarreness effect}
Bizarreness Effect is a psychological bias where people are more likely to perceive and be attracted to unusual, strange, or bizarre elements because they stand out against the norm. This bias stems from the human tendency to pay more attention to stimuli that are unexpected or deviate from everyday experiences. The element of surprise or peculiarity draws attention and can create a sense of intrigue or curiosity, often overshadowing more conventional but potentially more relevant information.

This cognitive bias works because individuals are naturally curious and drawn to novel or unexpected features. When something is out of the ordinary or appears odd, it becomes more memorable and may even evoke stronger emotional reactions, leading to increased focus and a greater likelihood of influencing decisions or opinions.

Some key aspects of the bizarreness effect include the following: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Attention-Grabbing Oddities}: Novel or strange elements stand out and grab attention because they are outside of what is expected or familiar. \newline
\textit{Example}: A product with an unusually shaped packaging design that attracts attention simply because it is unlike typical packaging.
\item \textbf{Curiosity and Intrigue}: Odd or peculiar information sparks curiosity, leading individuals to explore or engage with it further. \newline
\textit{Example}: A food advertisement featuring an unusual combination of ingredients, prompting viewers to wonder about its taste.
\item \textbf{Memorability of the Bizarre}: People are more likely to remember something that is out of the ordinary or strange because it deviates from their typical experiences or expectations. \newline
\textit{Example}: A clothing brand marketing an eccentric or unique pattern that becomes memorable due to its unusual nature.
\item \textbf{Positive Emotional Reactions}: The novelty or bizarreness of something can elicit emotional reactions such as amusement, surprise, or wonder, which in turn increases engagement or interest. \newline
\textit{Example}: An ad campaign featuring an outlandish, over-the-top character or storyline that evokes laughter or amazement.
\end{itemize}

The bizarreness effect is often utilized in marketing and branding strategies to draw attention and influence consumer behavior, as seen in the following examples: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Unconventional Advertising}: Using quirky, bizarre, or unexpected visuals or messages to capture the viewer's attention and make the ad stand out. \newline
\textit{Example}: A car commercial showing an exaggerated, surreal scenario, like a car driving through outer space, to make it memorable.
\item \textbf{Odd Product Features}: Highlighting unusual, unconventional product features that make the item stand out from typical alternatives. \newline
\textit{Example}: A smartphone with a unique design or unexpected feature (such as a foldable screen) that sparks interest due to its bizareness.
\item \textbf{Catchy Slogans or Taglines}: Using bizarre or humorous phrases to create memorable and attention-grabbing marketing messages. \newline
\textit{Example}: “The weirdest toothpaste, ever. And it works!”
\item \textbf{Outlandish Packaging}: Designing product packaging in a highly unconventional or bizarre style that makes the product stand out on store shelves. \newline
\textit{Example}: A bottle of ketchup shaped like a giant tomato or a bottle of wine in the shape of an animal.
\item \textbf{Strange Influencer Partnerships}: Collaborating with eccentric or unconventional influencers to promote a product, leveraging their odd or unique personal brand to attract attention. \newline
\textit{Example}: A luxury watch brand partnering with a wildly unconventional or eccentric celebrity to promote the product. \end{itemize}

\subsection{Authority bias}
Authority Bias is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to place greater trust in and give more weight to opinions, statements, or actions of an authority figure or expert in a given field. This bias arises from the tendency to defer to those who are perceived to have superior knowledge, experience, or credibility, often resulting in a heightened influence of their views and recommendations. The presence of an authority figure, whether real or perceived, often elevates the perceived validity of their message, regardless of the quality or accuracy of the information.

This cognitive bias works because humans are generally social creatures who seek guidance from those who are seen as experts or in positions of power, particularly in unfamiliar situations or complex domains. By relying on authority figures, individuals simplify decision-making processes and reduce the cognitive load involved in evaluating new information.

Some key aspects of authority bias include the following: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Trust in Experts}: People place higher trust in individuals with recognized expertise, believing that their knowledge makes their judgments more accurate or reliable. \newline
\textit{Example}: Trusting a medical recommendation from a doctor more than from a non-expert, even when both are discussing the same treatment.
\item \textbf{Influence of Titles and Credentials}: Formal titles, degrees, or positions of authority often carry an implicit weight that influences people's perceptions and decisions. \newline
\textit{Example}: A product being endorsed by a certified nutritionist may carry more authority compared to a general celebrity endorsement.
\item \textbf{Respect for Power and Status}: People are conditioned to follow those in positions of power, whether in business, academia, or government. The power dynamic often increases the perceived credibility of their words or actions. \newline
\textit{Example}: A corporate CEO’s opinion on industry trends being accepted without question, simply due to their position within the company.
\item \textbf{Deferring to Expertise in Uncertainty}: When faced with uncertainty or complex topics, individuals are more likely to rely on expert opinions or recommendations to guide their decisions. \newline
\textit{Example}: A consumer may prefer a recommendation from a tech expert when choosing a new smartphone over relying on their own research. \end{itemize}

The authority bias is widely applied in marketing, branding, and persuasion techniques to influence consumer behavior and decision-making, as seen in the following examples: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Expert Endorsements}: Products or services are often endorsed by professionals or industry experts to capitalize on their authority and credibility. \newline
\textit{Example}: A skincare brand promoting its products by featuring dermatologists recommending their use.
\item \textbf{Celebrity Endorsements}: High-profile figures are frequently used in marketing campaigns because their perceived authority can influence purchasing decisions. \newline
\textit{Example}: A famous athlete endorsing a specific brand of sportswear or fitness products.
\item \textbf{Institutional Support}: Featuring well-known institutions or organizations to lend authority to a product or service. \newline
\textit{Example}: A health supplement boasting "backed by clinical studies" to indicate the endorsement of scientific authority.
\item \textbf{Professional Credentials}: Highlighting professional certifications, awards, or expert qualifications to build trust and authority. \newline
\textit{Example}: A financial consultant advertising their services with references to certifications like CFP (Certified Financial Planner) to emphasize expertise.
\item \textbf{Corporate Authority Figures}: The use of high-ranking company officials, such as CEOs or founders, in promotional materials to lend authority to the company’s products or services. \newline
\textit{Example}: A tech company using its founder to talk about the cutting-edge features of a new device in its marketing campaign. \end{itemize}

\subsection{Decoy effect}
Decoy Effect (also known as Asymmetric Dominance Effect) is a cognitive bias where consumers’ preferences between two options are influenced by the addition of a third, less attractive option (the "decoy"). The decoy option, though inferior, makes one of the original options appear more attractive by comparison, often altering the choice that consumers would otherwise make. This bias exploits the tendency to favor options that are perceived as offering better value when a less appealing alternative is introduced.

The decoy effect works because individuals tend to compare choices relative to each other rather than in isolation, leading them to make decisions that may not be entirely rational. By introducing a decoy that is asymmetrically dominated (i.e., the decoy is worse than one option in every way but still similar in price), marketers can subtly guide consumers to prefer the option that is strategically positioned.

In the context of pricing and features, the decoy effect often plays out in scenarios where similarly priced products are compared, but the higher-priced product may lack certain features in favor of a lower price. This can cause consumers to shift their preferences based on the perceived value of the more feature-rich option.

Some key aspects of the decoy effect include the following: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Asymmetric Dominance}: The decoy option is dominated by one of the original choices in all attributes (e.g., price, features), but is positioned to make the other original choice appear superior in comparison. \newline
\textit{Example}: A customer is given two options: a \$10 product with basic features and a \$20 product with many features. The decoy is a \$15 product with fewer features than the \$20 option but more than the \$10 option, making the \$20 product seem like the better choice.
\item \textbf{Relative Comparison}: Consumers often compare products side by side, and the addition of a decoy shifts the frame of reference, highlighting one choice over the others. \newline
\textit{Example}: A \$50 pizza with all toppings, a \$40 pizza with a few toppings, and a \$45 pizza with even fewer toppings. The \$45 pizza, though similar in price to the \$50 option, highlights the value of the \$50 pizza by comparison, even though the \$45 pizza may be inferior. \item \textbf{Feature Trade-offs}: Decoys are often introduced to emphasize trade-offs in features, leading consumers to opt for the option with the best overall value. \newline
\textit{Example}: When choosing between two similarly priced products with different feature sets, the decoy may present a product that’s priced similarly but lacks certain desirable features, which makes the better-featured option seem like the best deal. \item \textbf{Price Sensitivity and Perception}: The introduction of a decoy can alter the consumer's perception of price-value ratio, creating the illusion of greater value for the more expensive option. \newline
\textit{Example}: When a higher-priced product seems to offer more value for just a small price difference, it often becomes more attractive when compared with a decoy. \end{itemize}

The decoy effect is commonly leveraged in marketing and sales strategies to nudge consumers towards particular products or services, often resulting in choices that may not align with the consumer’s true preferences. Here are some practical applications of the decoy effect: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Pricing Strategies}: Introducing a third option with a similar price but fewer features to make a higher-priced option appear to offer more value. \newline
\textit{Example}: An online subscription service offering three plans—\$10/month for basic, \$15/month for standard, and \$20/month for premium. The middle option has less features than the premium, pushing customers toward the premium plan, despite the \$5 price difference. \item \textbf{Product Bundling}: Offering a bundle that appears to be more value-rich by comparison to a less compelling option. \newline
\textit{Example}: A clothing retailer offering a "bundle" of a jacket, pants, and shirt for \$80, a separate jacket for \$70, and a less appealing jacket at \$65. The \$65 jacket becomes the decoy that makes the \$70 jacket seem like a better deal. \item \textbf{Food Menus and Restaurants}: Placing a less appealing dish on the menu at a similar price to another dish can cause customers to choose the dish perceived as better value. \newline
\textit{Example}: A restaurant menu featuring two main courses priced at \$20 and \$25, and a third, less appealing \$22 option, nudging consumers to opt for the \$25 course to feel they’re getting better value for only a slight increase in price. \item \textbf{Subscription Models}: Creating multiple subscription options to nudge users toward the most expensive plan. \newline
\textit{Example}: A streaming service offering three tiers—\$8 for basic, \$12 for standard, and \$15 for premium. The standard plan, priced close to the premium plan but with fewer features, positions the premium plan as a more attractive deal, despite the minimal price difference. \end{itemize}

\subsection{Contrast effect}
Contrast Effect is a cognitive bias where the perception of a product or option is influenced by comparing it with a previous or simultaneous reference point, often leading to a disproportionate assessment of its value. When two items are contrasted, the differences between them are exaggerated, and this comparison can significantly alter the consumer's judgment of value, quality, or suitability. This bias occurs because people evaluate options relative to others, making the contrast between them appear more significant than it actually is.

The contrast effect is particularly relevant in product recommendations and pricing strategies, as the mere introduction of a higher-priced product can make the original product seem like a better deal, even if both products are comparable in quality or features. Similarly, products with the same features but higher prices can influence consumers to perceive those higher-priced options as less desirable, especially when compared to more affordable alternatives that offer identical benefits.

This cognitive bias works by amplifying perceived differences between options, even if those differences are relatively small. The shift in judgment is not based on objective value but on the context in which the options are presented.

Key aspects of the contrast effect include: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Comparative Judgment}: Consumers often make decisions by comparing items against each other, which amplifies perceived differences in value, quality, or other attributes. \newline
\textit{Example}: When presented with two items—one at \$50 and the other at \$100—consumers may overestimate the value of the \$50 item, even if the features are identical. \item \textbf{Perceived Value Shift}: The introduction of a higher-priced alternative (or less appealing alternative) leads to an altered perception of the original option, either increasing or decreasing its perceived value. \newline
\textit{Example}: A product priced at \$100 appears more attractive when placed next to an alternative priced at \$200, even though both have the same features. \item \textbf{Pricing Anchoring}: The contrast effect often works in tandem with anchoring bias, where the initial price or product sets a reference point that influences the evaluation of subsequent products. \newline
\textit{Example}: A \$30 product may seem like a great deal when compared with a \$60 product, even if there is no significant difference in quality or features. \item \textbf{Feature Comparison}: When two or more products have the same features, the contrast effect can lead consumers to perceive one as significantly better or worse depending on the context in which it’s presented. \newline
\textit{Example}: When two products with the same features are offered at different prices, consumers may perceive the more expensive option as less attractive, assuming that the price disparity isn’t justified by any visible differences in value or quality. \end{itemize}

The contrast effect plays a crucial role in consumer decision-making and is commonly used in marketing to influence purchasing choices. Here are some practical applications of the contrast effect: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Product Pricing Strategies}: By presenting a more expensive alternative, businesses can make a less expensive option appear more valuable, encouraging consumers to choose it. \newline
\textit{Example}: A retail store presents a \$200 smartwatch next to a \&400 smartwatch with identical features. The \$200 smartwatch is perceived as offering better value due to the contrast. \item \textbf{Discounts and Offers}: Offering a product at a lower price compared to a more expensive model with similar features can create a perception of savings or value. \newline
\textit{Example}: In a set of headphones, one set priced at \&50 and another at \&100, both having the same technical specifications, the \&50 model is seen as a better deal because of the contrast with the more expensive alternative. \item \textbf{Bundling and Product Placement}: Displaying similar products together with one at a premium price creates the perception that other options offer better value. \newline
\textit{Example}: A restaurant menu may feature a \&25 dish next to a \&40 dish. Even if both are equally enjoyable, the \&25 dish will seem like a better value in comparison. \item \textbf{Marketing Campaigns and Promotions}: Highlighting a higher-priced product next to a lower-priced alternative with the same features can amplify the attractiveness of the less expensive product. \newline
\textit{Example}: A gym might offer a basic membership at \&30 per month and a premium membership at \&60 per month. Both have similar benefits, but the premium membership makes the basic one appear as a better deal by contrast. \item \textbf{Real Estate and Luxury Goods}: The contrast effect is often used in the luxury goods market to enhance the appeal of more moderately priced items by presenting them alongside ultra-luxury options. \newline
\textit{Example}: A luxury car dealership may showcase a high-end model priced at \&100,000 alongside a similar, more affordable model priced at \$50,000, increasing the perceived value of the \$50,000 option. \end{itemize}

\subsection{Discount framing}
Discount Framing is a cognitive bias where the presentation of a discount or price reduction influences a consumer's perception of value, making them more likely to purchase a product or service. The way a discount is framed—whether as a percentage off or as a dollar amount saved—can significantly impact the consumer's decision-making process. This bias exploits consumers' tendency to focus on the relative, rather than absolute, value of a discount, leading them to perceive a product as a better deal when it’s framed in a certain way, even if the actual savings or value remains the same.

The framing of discounts plays on human psychology, leveraging the tendency to focus on percentages or dollar amounts that sound larger, making people feel they are getting more value. This bias works because consumers are drawn to perceived savings, even when the savings might not be as significant as they initially appear. The context in which the discount is presented can make the consumer feel like they are making a smarter, more economical choice.

Key aspects of the Discount Framing Effect include: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Percentage Discount vs. Absolute Savings}: Consumers tend to react more strongly to percentage-based discounts than absolute dollar amounts, even when the latter might represent a larger saving. \newline
\textit{Example}: A \$100 jacket with a 30\% discount (\$30 off) feels like a better deal than a \$90 jacket with a \$30 discount, even though the actual price after discount is the same. \item \textbf{Anchoring Effect}: The original price or "list price" of an item is often presented to make the discount seem more significant, even if the item was never sold at that price. \newline
\textit{Example}: A product marked as "Was \$200, Now \$100" makes the \$100 price appear like a bargain, even if the product never actually sold for \$200. \item \textbf{Perceived Value of the Discount}: The framing of the discount can make the consumer believe they are getting a better deal than they really are. \newline
\textit{Example}: A product with a “\$50 off” label may seem more valuable than one that offers a 25\% discount, even if both discounts result in the same price reduction. \item \textbf{Bundling Discounts}: Discount framing is often used in bundled offers, where multiple products are sold together at a reduced price, making the consumer believe they are saving more overall. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Buy one, get one 50\% off” or “3 for the price of 2” creates the illusion of significant savings when, in reality, the individual product prices might not be as discounted as they appear. \item \textbf{Temporal Framing}: The time frame in which a discount is offered can also frame its perceived value. Limited-time offers or flash sales can push consumers to perceive the discount as more valuable due to the urgency to act. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Limited time offer: 40\% off today only!" creates urgency, making the discount seem more enticing despite similar offers being available elsewhere. \end{itemize}

The discount framing effect is widely used in marketing and sales to trigger urgency and increase the likelihood of purchases. Below are some common uses of this cognitive bias in consumer behavior:

\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{E-commerce Discounts}: Retailers often frame discounts as percentages off or large dollar savings to attract shoppers. \newline
\textit{Example}: "Save 40\% on your first order" or “\$50 off with this coupon.” \item \textbf{Flash Sales and Limited-Time Offers}: Framing discounts as time-sensitive deals increases the sense of urgency. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Flash Sale: 30\% off for the next 3 hours!” \item \textbf{Seasonal Discounts and Promotions}: Discounts tied to seasons or events, such as Black Friday or holiday sales, are framed to appear as significant deals due to the context. \newline
\textit{Example}: "End-of-season clearance: Up to 70\% off!" \item \textbf{Membership or Loyalty Discounts}: Exclusive discounts for members or loyal customers are framed to make consumers feel they are part of a select group. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Exclusive 25\% off for VIP members.” \item \textbf{Flash Bundles and Multi-Buy Offers}: Discount framing can also be used to sell multiple products in bundles, where consumers believe they are getting a better deal. \newline
\textit{Example}: “Buy two, get the third free!” or “3 for \$10!” \item \textbf{Initial Discount Framing}: Sometimes, offering a high initial discount and then framing future discounts can increase overall sales. \newline
\textit{Example}: "First month free! After that, \$5 per month." \end{itemize}

Applications of Discount Framing: \begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Price Perception Enhancement}: By framing the discount correctly, businesses can make the product seem more attractive, encouraging customers to make the purchase based on perceived value rather than actual price reduction. \item \textbf{Scarcity and Urgency Creation}: Time-limited discounts create the illusion of scarcity, pushing consumers to buy quickly to avoid missing out on a great deal. \item \textbf{Increasing Transaction Volume}: Through framing a discount as a significant percentage, businesses can increase the volume of purchases even if the actual price reductions are modest. \end{itemize}

\section{Dataset details}
In the following Tables \ref{tab:coffee-machine-data}, \ref{tab:camera-data}, \ref{tab:books-data} we present the details of the features of the dataset as per product (coffee machines, cameras, books). All product types contain 10 entries of varying prices. Coffee machines and cameras contain a feature that represents their value, either in terms of coffee cups capacity or in cameras resolution. Such features implicitly influence the perceived value of a product, since a more expensive product of advanced features (e.g. higher cup capacity or higher resolution) may be more worthy in comparison to a more affordable product of mediocre quality-related features. It is interesting how LLMs may handle this implicit quality measure. Moreover, user ratings are provided for each entry, providing another dimension of perceived quality, though being more subjective (since there is no absolute way for different users to rate each product).

\section{Analysis of Discount Framing Attacks}
\label{app:discount}

A useful factor in understanding the true impact of the \textit{discount framing} attack is the amount of the discount used. For example, a product with an 80\% discount can affect LLMs in different ways, e.g., the amount of the discount is exceptionally high, suggesting that it is not genuine, or the item is indeed on a huge sale and must be recommended. However, in our attacks, we do not implement huge discounts in order to keep the analysis as close to reality as possible. Also, the aim of the attacks is not to be used in a harmful way but to investigate the impact of social biases. Thus, if a seller wishes to increase the visibility of their product, it is harmful to just add a huge, fake discount on the product; instead, they should make a real discount on the product's price. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect that for increasing product visibility, real discounts of 80\% or 90\% will be applied. 

The distribution of the discounts is shown in Figure \ref{fig:discount-distr}, in which the mean value of the discount is 26.25 ± 5.54\%, with the median being 25.0\%, with values generally spanning from 15\% to around 40\% discount.

\section{Comparative Analysis of Social Proof Influence on Product Ratings}
\label{app:social-price}

In this experiment, we adopt the previously proposed idea to evaluate the impact of halving product prices versus using the \textit{discount framing} attack. Given that the product ratings in the coffee machines product dataset are typically between 3.9 and 4.8, a rating of 2.1 is considered exceptionally low and outside the usual distribution. Consequently, we employ a different approach. We aim to determine the \textit{average improvement in ratings} needed to counterbalance the \textit{social proof} bias in our models. For instance, our analysis of the Claude 3.5 sonnet recommender and the coffee machines dataset may reveal that a 0.5 increase in product ratings equates to the influence of social proof in product description. However, since the ratings are already high, enhancing them further is impractical as they approach the 5-star maximum. Therefore, we reframe our question: ``What average reduction in product ratings would neutralize the social proof bias of the LLMs?'' To address this, we systematically decrease the ratings of the targeted products by increments from 0.1 to 0.5, while also incorporating \textit{social proof} bias, and then assess the variations in product recommendations compared to the original, higher-rated products. The results, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:price-social-bias}, indicate that the \textit{social proof} bias generally enhances product visibility for any rating decrease less than 0.27. For larger rating reductions, while \textit{social proof} cannot fully offset the decline in ratings, its presence still proves advantageous, e.g. by comparing the effects of a 0.40 reduction in ratings both with and without \textit{social proof}.

The red line indicates the point at which the recommendation rate for the original and the attacked product with the reduced rating is equal.}

\section{Attacked product descriptions}
\label{sec:prompts}
As described in Section \ref{sec:method}, we implement two types of attacks, called \textit{expert} and \textit{generated}. In the first case, each cognitive bias is simply appended to the input as a simple representative sentence, as instructed by experts. We note that some cognitive biases cannot be successfully implemented in the \textit{expert} format, as the effect they impose on the description is not generalizable across all product instances. In the second case, an LLM manipulates the description using appropriate prompting in order to include each cognitive bias in a more implicit manner, re-generating a new description in place of the initial one. In the \textit{generated} case, all of our attacks are applicable. Tables \ref{tab:baseline-attacks} and \ref{tab:generated-attacks}, \ref{tab:generated-attacks-2} contain the \textit{expert} and \textit{generated} prompts to re-write product descriptions respectively.

\begin{table*}[h!]

\subsection{User prompt for product retrieval}
The user prompt utilized to retrieve each product is the following:

\begin{verbatim}
Product Information ↓
Products:
{products_to_string(list_of_products)}
{user_msg}
\end{verbatim}

where the \{user\_msg\} can be one of the following:

\textbf{Coffee machines:}
\begin{verbatim}
I am looking for a coffee machine. 
Can I get some recommendations?    
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Cameras:}
\begin{verbatim}
I am looking for a camera. 
Can I get some recommendations?
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Books:}
\begin{verbatim}
I am looking for a book. 
Can I get some recommendations?
\end{verbatim}

In all cases, the user queries are abstract enough, without specifying explicit product characteristics, leaving enough space to the LLM to interpret what is the best option to recommend.

\subsection{Defensible prompts}
\label{sec:defense}
In order to develop an a-priori defense strategy, we alter the system prompts of the LLMs used. Our default system prompt is the following:

\begin{verbatim}
A chat between a human and an artificial intelligence assistant.
The assistant provides a numbered list of product recommendations
ranked based on the user’s request.
\end{verbatim}

On the contrary, the defensible system prompt is modified to be:
\begin{verbatim}
A chat between a human and an artificial intelligence assistant. 
The assistant provides a numbered list of product recommendations 
ranked based on the user’s request. 
The assistant is unbiased and focuses only in the product 
characteristics and the user’s query for its recommendations, 
and no other factors at all.   
\end{verbatim}
We leave the defensible prompt to be agnostic to a possible attack -being relevant to cognitive biases as attacks or any other attack- so that we measure its pure influence on recommendation. That means that of course, more specific system prompts can be crafted, biasing the LLM towards the presence of a specific attack type (in our case being cognitive biases). However, this is non-extendable and non-applicable to real-world scenarios, where it is unknown whether an attack pertains or not, not to mention that it is impossible to know \textit{a-priori} the type of the attack itself. On the contrary, by instructing the LLM to be unbiased and focused on the pure product information, we rely on its perception of relevant product features to apply its self-defense. In case the attacks are still applicable -which is proven to be true throughout our experimentation- we suspect that the LLM cannot effectively recognize the attack embedded within the product's description, or at least it is unable to properly handle the presence of the attack.

\subsection{Detailed analysis}
In the following Table \ref{tab:social_proof_llama7b}, we report some detailed quantitative results regarding the ranking changes imposed by our implemented attacks. Specifically, we consider the following: first, the number of times a product was recommended by the LLM in use (considering a binary setting of recommended/not recommended options). Observing an increase in this number denotes that the attack was successful in boosting the product, while the opposite holds if a decrease in this number is observed. Moreover, we report the average position (including the standard deviation) of a product, with smaller numbers indicating that the product was ranked higher; therefore, a decrease in the position number denotes that the attack was able to boost the product higher. In all cases, we report whether the change observed is statistically significant; if so, the reported change is not considered to be random. In the following tables, we highlight with color all these cases where statistically significant changes are reported in each product recommendation (how many times the product was recommended) and ranking position. Our results concern 
 Llama 8b as the recommender and focus on the \textit{social proof} attack in its \textit{expert} format. The number of $\checkmark$ per product corresponds to the number of statistically significant items $p$ considered in our analysis (as presented in Table \ref{tab:combined_two_datasets}).

\section{Mean Reciprocal Rank results}
\label{sec:mrr}
We complement our LLM exploration with presenting results using Llama-8B, Llama-70B and Mistral regarding MRR values per product before and after attack. MRR results are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:mrr_llama_8b}, \ref{fig:mrr_llama_70b}, \ref{fig:mrr_mistral} for Llama-8B, Llama-70B and Mistral respectively.

\section{Experts Attacks}
\label{app:expert}


Table \ref{tab:combined_two_datasets_experts} presents the results of the experts' attacks on our two main products, coffee machines and cameras. From this Table, we conclude that the behavior of the LLMs under \textit{expert} attack is consistent with the ones under \textit{generated} attacks. However, since these results stem from a single way of implementing each attack, we cannot infer the general impact of the attacks; possibly paraphrased descriptions provided from other experts, or even by non-experts that wish to boost their product visibility may lead to diverging results; in such cases, the LLMs may be not be generally vulnerable to the same attacks, rendering related findings non-generalizable.
Consequently, reported results on \textit{expert} attacks are a bit more noisy than the corresponding \textit{generated} results presented in the main analysis of the paper.

\section{Amazon dataset}
\label{app:amazon}

%\caption{Results of two influencial attacks in the two subsets of Amazon dataset.}\label{tab:amazon_res}

In this experiment, we extend our analysis in real-world listings. We maintain 10 items per product to ensure fair comparison to our aforementioned dataset comprising coffee machines, cameras and books.

The results for the Amazon dataset, specifically the subset with ``chew toys'' using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, for two influential attacks (one positive and one negative), namely \textit{social proof} and \textit{exclusivity}, are presented in Table \ref{tab:amazon_chew_toys}. The results include those designed by the experts and those generated by the LLM. From this table, it is noticeable that the impact of the attacks is similar to that in the rest of the datasets (coffee machines, cameras, books, and laptops). However, a difference we observed is that the impact of the attack is somewhat less apparent compared to the datasets discussed in \cite{kumar2024manipulatinglargelanguagemodels}. 

This is likely due to the fact that the product descriptions in the real datasets already incorporate certain social biases. For example, in the dataset of laptops, the product ``Lenovo ThinkPad T14 14'' uses the phrase: ``Business Laptop, Intel Core i5-1235U (\textit{Beats i7-1165g7}),'' to compare its CPU with another product, thereby highlighting its superiority. Additionally, it entices buyers with a ``\textit{Bonus 32GB SnowBell USB Card.}'' The presence of various and unknown cognitive biases in these descriptions may make their effects less apparent and more difficult to study. For instance, a cognitive bias might affect model performance differently when it interacts with another bias, such as scarcity potentially enhancing product visibility when combined with discount framing.

Moreover, there is a difference in the length of the input accompanying each product (description, characteristics, etc.) across datasets. For chew toys, each product is described with an average of 900.3 characters or 126.8 words, whereas for laptops, the average is 1436 characters or 172.3 words. In contrast, in the coffee machines dataset, each product is accompanied by 219.2 tokens or 16.6 words; for cameras, 227.6 characters and 14.9 words; and for books, 247.0 characters with 18.1 words. We used the NLTK package for tokenization \footnote{\url{https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html}}. Despite the attacks comprising only a small portion of the texts, the presence of additional cognitive biases in the descriptions significantly impacts the model's recommendations across both datasets.
