The innovative aspect of this research is conveyed by rephrasing three tasks proposed in Kahneman and Tversky{'}s works and determining whether the LLMs{'} answers to the tasks are correct or incorrect and human-like or non-human-like. The latter classification is made possible by interviewing a total of 56 native speakers of Italian, English and Spanish, thus introducing a new linguistic comparison of results and forming a {``}human standard{'}. Our study indicates that GPTs 3.5 and 4 are very frequently subject to the cognitive biases under discussion and their answers are mostly non-human-like. There is minimal but significant discrepancy in the performance of GPT 3.5 and 4, slightly favouring ChatGPT 4 in avoiding biased responses, specifically for Availability heuristics. We also reveal that, while the results for ChatGPT 4 are not significantly language dependent, meaning that the performances in avoiding biases are not affected by the prompting language, their difference with ChatGPT 3.5 is statistically significant.",

It has been a significant trend to explore ICL to evaluate and extrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize the progress and challenges of ICL. We first present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, prompt designing strategies, and related analysis. Additionally, we explore various ICL application scenarios, such as data engineering and knowledge updating. Finally, we address the challenges of ICL and suggest potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL.",

Given their training on human (created) data, LLMs have been shown to inherit societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to bias functionally resembling cognitive bias. Human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive science, we develop a dataset containing 13,465 prompts to evaluate LLM decisions on different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, while proposing a novel method utilizing LLMs to debias their own human-like cognitive bias within prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of the presence and effects of cognitive bias across commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our selfhelp debiasing effectively mitigates model answers that display patterns akin to human cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias.",

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into applications, with versatile functionalities that can be easily modulated via natural language prompts. So far, it was assumed that the user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting? We show that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions and reveal several new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved at inference time. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to broadly investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks. We then demonstrate the practical viability of our attacks against both real-world systems, such as Bing Chat and code-completion engines, and GPT-4 synthetic applications. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called. Despite the increasing reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations of these emerging threats are lacking. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities, we aim to promote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the development of robust defenses that protect users from potential attacks.},

In this work, we assemble 16 LLMs encompassing four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLer), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (40{\%} of comparisons made by all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 44{\%}, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.",

We demonstrate that the order in which the samples are provided can make the difference between near state-of-the-art and random guess performance: essentially some permutations are {``}fantastic{''} and some not. We analyse this phenomenon in detail, establishing that: it is present across model sizes (even for the largest current models), it is not related to a specific subset of samples, and that a given good permutation for one model is not transferable to another. While one could use a development set to determine which permutations are performant, this would deviate from the true few-shot setting as it requires additional annotated data. Instead, we use the generative nature of language models to construct an artificial development set and based on entropy statistics of the candidate permutations on this set, we identify performant prompts. Our method yields a 13{\%} relative improvement for GPT-family models across eleven different established text classification tasks.",
