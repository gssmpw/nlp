	Abstract = {With the increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where LLMs make predictions based on contexts augmented with a few examples. It has been a significant trend to explore ICL to evaluate and extrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize the progress and challenges of ICL. We first present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, prompt designing strategies, and related analysis. Additionally, we explore various ICL application scenarios, such as data engineering and knowledge updating. Finally, we address the challenges of ICL and suggest potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL.},

@article{Darnall2022,
	Abstract = {Environment, social, and governance (ESG) reporting guidelines are institutional rules that can enhance the credibility of firms' publicly disclosed information related to ESG. Reporting is often voluntary and global ESG reporting guidelines typically rely on process-focused third party verification. However, in developing its reporting guidelines, the Japanese government gave firms the unusual option of pursuing either process- or content-focused verification. This paper draws on the unique Japanese setting to examine whether firms that use ESG reporting guidelines increase their quantity of disclosed sustainability information. Furthermore, it assesses whether, given the option, (1) firms tend to pursue process- or content-focused verification, and (2) which type of verification leads to greater information disclosure. We show that firms that follow ESG guidelines disclose 39% more sustainability information compared to firms that publish sustainability reports but do not follow ESG reporting guidelines. Content-focused verification leads to greater information disclosure than process-focused verification in that firms publish 23% more text in their sustainability reports. Moreover, given the option, firms prefer to use content- over process-focused verification. However, most global ESG reporting guidelines endorse process-focused verification and this verification is less effective than content-focused verification at encouraging firms' information disclosure. Our findings raise a timely and relevant question about the movement by global ESG standard developers to promote process- rather than content-focused verification. They also suggest that firms that wish to create sustainability distinction by way of ESG reporting may benefit by advocating for more robust forms of verification.},

@article{Eng2022sasb,
	Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of sustainability disclosures and disclosure ratings on firm value. This paper compares the informativeness of sustainability disclosures in company reports versus environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure ratings. The authors examine the extent to which they provide incremental information. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of panel data from over 2,600 publicly-listed non-financial US companies for the period 2014--2018. The authors obtain sustainability disclosures from Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Navigator and ESG disclosure scores from Bloomberg. The authors regress market value and/or stock price on sustainability disclosures and ESG scores to evaluate information content. Findings: ESG scores are positively associated with market value and price. Sustainability disclosures in the form of metrics and company-tailored narratives provide incremental information content on market value and/or price. Boilerplate disclosures reduce market value and price. Sustainability disclosures and ESG scores provide incremental information, suggesting that it would be beneficial to harmonize standards for reporting sustainability disclosures. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is that the authors have only considered sustainability disclosures for a sample of US companies from two sources -- SASB Navigator and Bloomberg. Practical implications: The paper provides some evidence that may be pertinent to the debate on whether to harmonize the guidance on reporting sustainability issues. Social implications: The paper provides evidence on the benefits to firms for reporting sustainability issues. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to analyze company sustainability disclosures obtained from two different sources -- SASB Navigator and ESG disclosure ratings -- and compare them for relevance for company valuation. With SASB Navigator, the authors obtain further refinement into the nature of the information provided in the sustainability disclosures, that is, boilerplate, company-tailored or metrics disclosures.},

It constitutes a fundamental element for natural language understanding in machine intelligence. With the advancement of large language models, the research focus in natural language processing has predominantly shifted toward high-level task processing, inadvertently downplaying the importance of foundational pragmatic processing tasks. Nevertheless, pragmatics serves as a crucial medium for unraveling human language cognition. The exploration of pragmatic processing stands as a pivotal facet in realizing linguistic intelligence. This survey encompasses important pragmatic processing techniques for subjective and emotive tasks, such as personality recognition, sarcasm detection, metaphor understanding, aspect extraction, and sentiment polarity detection. It spans theoretical research, the forefront of pragmatic processing techniques, and downstream applications, aiming to highlight the significance of these low-level tasks in advancing natural language understanding and linguistic intelligence.},

	Abstract = {As an important source for disclosure a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, stock exchanges gradually strengthen their requirements for listed companies to periodically submit their ESG exports. However, these documents are often unstructured, making it difficult to directly evaluate a company's disclosure level as well as the performance quantitatively. In this study, we develop a quantitative framework, ESGReveal, for assessing corporate ESG performance based on large language model (LLM) techniques. Specifically, by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology with LLMs, we extract relevant performance data from complex corporate ESG reports. The ESGReveal framework consists of three primary modules: an ESG Metadata module for standardized queries, a Report Preprocessing module for database construction, and an LLM Agent module for data extraction. We evaluated the performance of various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGLM, and QWEN, and found that GPT-4 achieved 76.9% accuracy in data extraction and 83.7% accuracy in disclosure analysis, showing the best improvement over baseline models. We applied this ESGReveal model to 2249 ESG reports published by 166 companies across 12 industries listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx), analyzing the disclosure and performance of key ESG indicators. Results show that for mandatory environmental and social indicators required by HKEx, the sample companies achieved disclosure rates of 69.5% and 57.2%, respectively. Different industries exhibited varying performance in key ESG indicators, such as the proportion of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting key areas for future emission reduction efforts. These findings underscore the need to strengthen ESG practices across sectors and emphasize both general and sector-specific ESG initiatives. In summary, by leveraging the capabilities of LLM and RAG technologies, ESGReveal offers a practical and efficient solution to the pressing need for consistent and accurate ESG information retrieval.},
