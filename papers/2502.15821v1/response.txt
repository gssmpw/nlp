\section{Related Work}
\noindent\textbf{NLP Methods in Sustainability Analysis.}
To automate the extraction of insights from sustainability reports, popular NLP approaches include analyzing topic occurrence **zhou2021topicdiscovery**, sentiment analysis **pasch2022sentimentclass**, and RAG **kim2019transformer**. Yet, these traditional NLP approaches do not consider how greenwashing might distort extracted insights **huang2020greenwashing**. To promote the transparency of sustainability claims, **liu2018environmentalclaim** studied environmental claim detection, and **yu2021tcfdconformance** assessed report conformance to TCFD guidelines. However, these works do not explicitly address building robust ESG analysis against greenwashing risks.

\noindent\textbf{Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis}.
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has become a popular NLP problem over the past decade **tan2019aspectbasedsentiment**. Yet, ABSA has focused on reviews and opinion mining **pang2008aspectbasedsentiment**, despite calls for aspect-level analysis to be extended to other contexts **dong2020contextualaspects**. Our study presents the first adaptation of aspect-level analysis to the aspect-action classification task. While we focus on sustainability, aspect-action analysis could potentially be adapted for other applications - i.e. government policy analysis **kim2019governementpolicy**.
 
\noindent \textbf{Cross-Generalization Studies}. Cross-domain generalization has become an increasingly important challenge in NLP **wang2020crossdomaingeneralization**. However, there has been limited investigation on how models perform on \textit{unseen categories within the same domain} - i.e. cross-category generalization. Yet, this deserves attention because intra-domain data shifts are distinct from cross-domain shifts, and can significantly degrade model performance **li2020crosscategorygeneralization**. Moreover, data annotation for unseen categories is expensive and impractical, as these categories often arise unexpectedly from evolving text content **yu2021evolvingcategories**.

\noindent \textbf{LLMs Biases in Sustainability Analysis.}
Given LLMs' reasoning capabilities **brown2020languagemodels**, they have increasingly been utilized for tasks within sustainability analysis, such as knowledge base construction **kang2020knowledgebaseconstruction**, RAG **kim2019transformer**, among others. However, their performance on domain-specific tasks can be impacted by pre-training biases **liu2021pretrainbias** , and the impact of these biases on sustainability analysis tasks remains under-explored.
