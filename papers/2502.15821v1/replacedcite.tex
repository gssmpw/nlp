\noindent\textbf{NLP Methods in Sustainability Analysis.}
To automate the extraction of insights from sustainability reports, popular NLP approaches include analyzing topic occurrence____, sentiment analysis____, and RAG____. Yet, these traditional NLP approaches do not consider how greenwashing might distort extracted insights____. To promote the transparency of sustainability claims,____ studied environmental claim detection, and____ assessed report conformance to TCFD guidelines. However, these works do not explicitly address building robust ESG analysis against greenwashing risks.

\noindent\textbf{Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis}.
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has become a popular NLP problem over the past decade____. Yet, ABSA has focused on reviews and opinion mining____, despite calls for aspect-level analysis to be extended to other contexts____. Our study presents the first adaptation of aspect-level analysis to the aspect-action classification task. While we focus on sustainability, aspect-action analysis could potentially be adapted for other applications - i.e. government policy analysis____.

\noindent \textbf{Cross-Generalization Studies}. Cross-domain generalization has become an increasingly important challenge in NLP____. However, there has been limited investigation on how models perform on \textit{unseen categories within the same domain} - i.e. cross-category generalization. Yet, this deserves attention because intra-domain data shifts are distinct from cross-domain shifts, and can significantly degrade model performance____. Moreover, data annotation for unseen categories is expensive and impractical, as these categories often arise unexpectedly from evolving text content____. 

% \noindent\textbf{Cross-Generalization Methods.}
% Popular methods for cross-domain generalization include learning domain-invariant features through adversarial training____, or learning higher-level semantic features through contrastive learning____. Yet, it remains unclear whether these techniques can be effective for cross-category generalization.

\noindent \textbf{LLMs Biases in Sustainability Analysis.}
Given LLMs' reasoning capabilities____, they have increasingly been utilized for tasks within sustainability analysis, such as knowledge base construction____, RAG____, among others. However, their performance on domain-specific tasks can be impacted by pre-training biases____, and the impact of these biases on sustainability analysis tasks remains under-explored.
