\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Post-training pruning has emerged as a crucial optimization technique as large language models (LLMs) continue to grow rapidly. However, the significant variations in weight distributions across different LLMs make fixed pruning strategies inadequate for multiple models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OptiShear}}, an efficient evolutionary optimization framework for adaptive LLM pruning. Our framework features two key innovations: an effective search space built on our Meta pruning metric to handle diverse weight distributions, and a model-wise reconstruction error for rapid evaluation during search trials. We employ Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) to optimize both pruning metrics and layerwise sparsity ratios. Through extensive evaluation on LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral models (7B-70B) across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our adaptive pruning metrics consistently outperform existing methods. Additionally, our discovered layerwise sparsity ratios enhance the effectiveness of other pruning metrics. The framework exhibits strong cross-task and cross-model generalizability, providing a cost-effective solution for model compression.

\section*{Limitations}
% While OptiShear demonstrates promising results in adaptive pruning for large language models, there are several limitations to consider. First, although OptiShear achieves superior pruning results, it requires computational resources for super large LLMs. This search cost may limit its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. Second, OptiShear shows fewer effectiveness on LLaMA-3 models under semi-structured pruning constraints (4:8 and 2:4 sparsity patterns), likely due to the model's higher knowledge density that makes it more sensitive to parameter block removal. Third, while OptiShear's pruning metrics can generalize from complex to simpler tasks, they demonstrate poor transferability across models with significantly different weight distributions, such as from LLaMA-3 to LLaMA-1/2 models. Finally, the framework's performance depends on the quality of calibration data. Although OptiShear maintains relatively robust performance with limited samples, achieving optimal results still requires careful selection of calibration data.
While OptiShear demonstrates promising results in adaptive pruning for large language models, there are several limitations to consider.
%First, although OptiShear achieves superior pruning results, its search process demands significant computational resources for super large LLMs. This overhead becomes particularly challenging for models beyond 70B parameters, potentially limiting its practical application in resource-constrained environments. The search cost, while justified by improved results, may present adoption barriers for smaller organizations or research groups.
For example, OptiShear shows reduced effectiveness on LLaMA-3 models under semi-structured pruning constraints (4:8 and 2:4 sparsity patterns). This limitation likely stems from two factors: (1) the model's higher knowledge density making it more sensitive to parameter block removal, and (2) the more complex weight distribution patterns in newer architectures that challenge our current search space design. Performance degradation becomes particularly noticeable at sparsity rates above 50\% under these structured constraints.
Additionally, while OptiShear's pruning metrics successfully generalize from complex to simpler tasks within the same model family, they demonstrate limited transferability across architectures with fundamentally different weight distributions. For example, metrics optimized for LLaMA-3 show poor performance when applied to LLaMA-1/2 models, suggesting that the underlying weight transformation mechanisms may be too model-specific. This limitation necessitates separate optimization processes for different model families, increasing the overall computational cost for organizations maintaining multiple model types.

%Finally, while OptiShear demonstrates relatively robust performance with limited calibration data, its effectiveness remains dependent on calibration data quality. The selection of representative samples is crucial, particularly for specialized domains and diverse task types. 

Future research directions could address these limitations through more efficient search algorithms, architecture-agnostic pruning strategies, and improved transferability across model families. Additionally, investigating hybrid approaches that combine the benefits of different pruning paradigms might help mitigate some of these constraints.


\section*{Ethics Statement}
This study utilizes publicly available datasets for our models. Prior research endeavors have generally taken ethical considerations into account. We have manually inspected a subset of samples and found no explicit ethical concerns, including violent or offensive content. Nonetheless, it is crucial to highlight that the output generated by large language models lacks the degree of control we might assume. Consequently, we are prepared to implement measures to mitigate any unforeseen outputs.
