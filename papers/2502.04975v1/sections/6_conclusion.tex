\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We proposed a new training-free NAS proxy called \textit{Variance of Knowledge of Deep Network Weights (VKDNW)}. The method has strong theoretical support and achieved state-of-the-art results on three public datasets and in two search spaces. 

Based on throughout evaluation and comparison to other existing approaches, it has been shown that it provides an information orthogonal to the network size leading to a zero-cost ranking were contribution of the network size and architecture feasibility are separated. We have also shown that previously used correlation metrics for proxy evaluations do not sufficiently assess the key ability to discriminate top networks and to address this problem we have proposed a new evaluation metric and re-evaluated previous methods with the new metric.
