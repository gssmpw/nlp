Below are prompt templates used for different modules of \model. The last template references the work of MAC-SQL~\citep{wang2024mac}.

\begin{myverbatim}{Prompt Template of Abstract Query Pattern}
You are now an excellent SQL writer. First, I will provide an instruction and three examples. Your task is to learn from the examples how to transform the Original Question into the Masked Question using the DB schema. After that, you will receive a new question with a similar Original Question structure to the examples. Your goal is to replicate the examples to generate the final correct Masked Question.

Let's work this out step by step to ensure we have the right answer. Given a DB schema and an Original Question, follow these steps:

1. Based on the provided schema, identify the required tables and columns in the Original Question for masking.
2. Mask the Original Question with placeholders:
    - Replace table names with [TABLE].
    - Replace column names with [COLUMN].
    - Replace specific values with [VALUE].

Here are three examples:

{ex}

Refer to the examples and respond with the Masked Question with no explanation.

{schema}

###Foreign keys
{db_fk}

### Original Question: {question}
### Masked Question:
\end{myverbatim}

\begin{myverbatim}{Prompt Template of Contextual Schema Markup}
You are now an excellent SQL writer. First, I will provide an instruction and three examples. Your task is to learn from the examples how to transform the Masked Question into the Replaced Question using the DB schema. After that, you will receive a new question with a similar Masked Question structure to the examples. Your goal is to replicate the examples to generate the final correct Replaced Question.

Let's work this out step by step to ensure we have the right answer. Given a DB schema and an Original Question, along with a Masked Question, follow these steps:

1. Identify and replace masked parts such as [COLUMN], [TABLE], and [VALUE] with the appropriate names and values from the schema.
2. For each masked part:
    - If it is a [COLUMN], replace it with the format (masked part from the Original Question, [table].[column]).
    - If it is a [TABLE], replace it with the format (masked part from the Original Question, [table]).
    - If it is a [VALUE], replace it with the format (masked part from the Original Question, [value]).
3. Append additional table and column information that might not have been explicitly mentioned in the original Masked Question but are needed when generating SQL, selecting up to 10 relevant pieces of information.

Here are three examples:

{ex}

Refer to the examples and respond with the Replaced Question with no explanation.

### Schema:
{schema}

### Foreign keys:
{db_fk}

### Original Question: {question}
### Masked Question: {mask}
### Replaced Question:
\end{myverbatim}


\begin{myverbatim}{Prompt Template of Generating SQL}
You are now an excellent SQL writer. First, I will provide an instruction and three examples. Your task is to learn from the examples how to transform the Replaced Question into the Gold SQL using the DB schema. After that, you will receive a new question with a similar Masked Question structure to the examples. Your goal is to replicate the examples to generate the final correct Gold SQL.

Let's work this out step by step to ensure we have the right answer. Given a DB schema and an Original Question, along with a Masked Question and a Replaced Question, follow these steps:

1. Understand the Masked Question:
    - The Masked Question is a version of the Original Question where table names, column names, and specific values are replaced with placeholders such as [TABLE], [COLUMN], and [VALUE].
    - This helps to abstract the question so that it can be mapped to the schema more easily.

2. Understand the Replaced Question:
    - The Replaced Question is derived from the Masked Question by replacing the placeholders with actual table names, column names, and values from the DB schema.
    - Each placeholder is replaced with the format (masked part from the Original Question, [table].[column] for columns, [table] for tables, and [value] for values).
    - At the end of the Replaced Question, additional tables and columns that were not explicitly mentioned in the original question will be appended in the format "Other tables and columns:".

3. Generate the Gold SQL:
    - Identify the necessary tables and columns involved in the Replaced Question.
    - Based on the Replaced Question, analyze how the Gold SQL is constructed.
    - Ensure that the SQL query accurately reflects the intent of the Original Question.

Here are three examples:

{ex}

Refer to the examples and respond with the Gold SQL with no explanation.

{schema}

###Foreign keys
{db_fk}

### Table Value
{value}

### Original Question: {question}
### Masked Question: {mask}
### Replaced Question: {replace}
Pay special attention to the information within the parentheses () in the Replaced Question, as it is crucial for generating the correct Gold SQL.
### Gold SQL:

\begin{myverbatim}{Prompt Template of Correcting SQL}
[Instruction]
When executing SQL below, some errors occurred, please fix up SQL based on query and database info.
Solve the task step by step if you need to. Using SQL format in the code block, and indicate script type in the code block.
When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.
[Constraints]
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the [Question] without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
[Query]
-- {query}
[Evidence]
{evidence}
[Database info]
{desc_str}
[Foreign keys]
{fk_str}
[old SQL]
```sql
{sql}
```
[SQLite error] 
{sqlite_error}
[Exception class]
{exception_class}

Now please fixup old SQL and generate new SQL again.
[correct SQL]
