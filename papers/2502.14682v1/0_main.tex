Large language models have demonstrated excellent performance in many tasks, including Text-to-SQL, due to their powerful in-context learning capabilities. They are becoming the mainstream approach for Text-to-SQL.
However, these methods still have a significant gap compared to human performance, especially on complex questions. As the complexity of questions increases, the gap between questions and SQLs increases. We identify two important gaps: the structural mapping gap and the lexical mapping gap.
To tackle these two gaps, we propose \model, an efficient SQL generation pipeline based on LLMs, which alleviates gaps through Abstract Query Pattern (AQP) and Contextual Schema Markup (CSM).
AQP aims to obtain the structural pattern of the question by removing database-related information, which enables us to find structurally similar demonstrations.
CSM aims to associate database-related text span in the question with specific tables or columns in the database, which alleviates the lexical mapping gap. 
Experimental results on the Spider and BIRD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
Specifically, \model + GPT-4o sets a new state-of-the-art on the Spider benchmark with an execution accuracy of 87.9\%, and achieves leading results on the BIRD dataset with an execution accuracy of 64.67\%.
% Initially, we leverage the training set to construct examples. Subsequently, we mask database-specific information in user queries to obtain their Abstract Query Pattern (AQP) representation. Based on AQP, we introduce an intermediate step termed Contextual Schema Mapping (CSM), which emphasizes database-related information, including tables, columns, and cell values, within the text, thereby establishing a clear mapping between natural language and database schema.
% Experimental results demonstrate that this significantly enhances the model's ability to comprehend user queries within the database context. 
% Following this, we generate SQL queries grounded on CSM and refine any erroneous SQL outputs. Within our framework, we begin by employing GLM-4 to construct a training set and perform extensive experiments, ultimately using GPT-4 in its optimal version to achieve the best performance.
