For decades, IR systems operated under the assumption that humans are
both the creators of content and the ones searching for it.
With the rise of
LLMs, this assumption does not hold anymore.
LLMs now actively participate in query formulation, document
generation, and ranking. We argue that the resultant emerging multi-agent
retrieval setting, composed of query, document and ranker agents,
calls for special consideration. For example, some
classical retrieval paradigms and principles fall short and should be
re-considered. 
We then discuss the different agents (query, document and ranker) and their interplay.
In addition, we
present empirical exploration performed with various multi-agent
retrieval settings. Analysis reveals the significant effects of the connections between the types of agents employed to generate queries and documents and those used to induce rankings.
