Some recent advances in RL, also termed as model-free or data-driven control, are reported in Table~\ref{tab:rl_categories}. The table summarizes the literature across different categories of policy class (linear/nonlinear, statics/dynamics) and the training procedure, which will also be briefly discussed below.

         \item[2] While not necessary, these policies can be designed to depend on previous instances of the states and/or actions.

\paragraph{Q-Learning:}
The policy class considered in \eqref{eq:policy_class} is that of a greedy policy in Q-Learning literature. However, the minimization of $\mathrm Q_\theta$ is often problematic as it is often non-convex in $u$. Therefore, works in this domain either have to resort to discretized state and action spaces (Sutton et al., "Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation") or to Neural Network approximations of the minimizer of  $\mathrm Q_\theta$ (Mnih et al., "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"). There are Q-Learning settings where there is convexity in $u$, such as LQR (Anderson and Moore, "Optimal Control: Linear Quadratic Methods"), but there is no support for constrained state and input spaces.

\paragraph{Regret minimization:}
Works in this area consider the online data-driven linear policies:
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:min_regret_policy}
   \pi_K(x_t) = -K_0 x_t - \sum_{\tau=1}^H K_\tau w_{t-\tau}.
\end{equation}
When disturbances are entirely stochastic and i.i.d., we have from Certainty Equivalence that the disturbance feedback terms of~\eqref{eq:min_regret_policy} can be neglected, and the problem reduces to finding an appropriate model and solving a Riccati-like problem to recover $K_0$ (Bertsekas, "Dynamic Programming: Deterministic and Stochastic Models"). On the other hand, when disturbances are correlated, these terms are necessary and are discovered through Online Convex Optimization (Hazan et al., "Bandit Problems and Dynamic Allocation Indices"). In both scenarios, however, the policy class is linear, and as such, they only concern the unconstrained setting.


\paragraph{Willems' Lemma:} This lemma (Bertsekas, "Dynamic Programming: Deterministic and Stochastic Models") provides a data-based model parameterization that combines system identification and controller design in one step.
In (Bengtsson et al., "An MPC framework for LQR synthesis using Willems' Lemma") it is used to express LQR synthesis as a data-driven optimization program, while in (Kamgarpour et al., "A Data-Driven Approach to Linear Quadratic Regulator Design") the lemma is used in an MPC setting. Such results require decision variables that are much larger in dimension than traditional approaches.
Conversely, we offer reduced complexity in that regard by shrinking the MPC-$N$ problem to MPC-1.

\paragraph{Offline Reinforcement Learning:} To prevent the value function from exploiting any dataset bias, offline RL approaches typically attempt to enforce pessimistic policy learning; this can be achieved by constraining the policy learning within the region supported by the dataset (Fujimoto et al., "Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning without Exploration"), penalizing state-action pairs outside the dataset (Baird, "Reinforcement Learning with High-Dimensional Continuous Actions"), or by the primal-dual optimization method (Scherrer et al., "A Primal-Dual Optimization Framework for Offline Reinforcement Learning").  In (Kumar et al., "Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning") it is used to express LQR synthesis as a data-driven optimization program, while in (Liu et al., "Provable Offline Multi-Agent RL with Value Function Constraints") the lemma is used in an MPC setting. Such results require decision variables that are much larger in dimension than traditional approaches.
Conversely, we offer reduced complexity in that regard by shrinking the MPC-$N$ problem to MPC-1.

\paragraph{VF Approximation:} The idea of using a value function approximation was first introduced by (Sutton, "Temporal Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning"). This approach has been further developed and improved upon in various works, including (Precup et al., "Off-Policy Temporal Difference Learning with Function Approximation") and (Scherrer et al., "A Primal-Dual Optimization Framework for Offline Reinforcement Learning").
