\label{apdx:sureveyquestions}
\subsection{First Survey Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What difficulties or challenging situations did you face when you started giving the tutor's?
    \item What difficulties and challenging situations do you currently face during the tutor’s?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Second Survey Questions}

\textbf{Open-ended Questions: }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What types of student engagement problems have you encountered?
    \item Why do you think students are disengaged?
    \item Which strategies have you used to increase students' engagement and when did you use them? Please list all strategies and the situations when you use them:
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Strategy-specific Questions: }

    \item Did you show empathy and respect towards your students to improve students' engagement (e.g., referring to students by their names or demonstrating concerns for their well being)? How and when?
    \item Did you promote social community and belonging among your students to improve students' engagement (e.g., let students introduce themselves or facilitate warm social interaction between students)? How and when?
    \item Did you discuss behavioral expectations with your students to improve students' engagement (e.g., don't interrupt each other when talking or start tutoring sessions on time)? How and when?
    \item Did you discuss academic goals with your students to improve students' engagement? (e.g., master certain subject specific skills or personal long term goals that students want to achieve (go to university))? How and when?
    \item Did you promote active learning in your tutoring sessions to improve students' engagement (e.g., let students work on problems or let them explain a concept to you)? How and when?
    \item Did you give prompt and positive feedback to students to improve students' engagement?(e.g., when they make progress towards solving a problem or when they show good behavior)? How and when?
    \item Did you encourage students to be persistent to improve students' engagement(e.g., don't allow students to give up or scaffold until they succeed)? How and when?
    \item Did you give autonomy to your students to improve students' engagement (e.g., let students participate when making decisions)? How and when?
    \item Did you set time constraints for activities inside your tutoring sessions to improve students' engagement (e.g., asking students to solve a practice problem in 5 minutes)? How and when?
    \item Did you present yourself to your students as a positive role model to improve students' engagement (show a growth mindset or start sessions on time)? How and when?
\end{enumerate}
