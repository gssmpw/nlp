\begin{abstract}
%With the rise of online learning, many novice tutors become online teachers. However, many lack experience in facilitating student engagement during remote tutoring, and practicing with real students is costly and potentially harmful. In response, we introduce TutorUp, an LLMs-based system that enables tutors to practice engagement strategies with simulated students in different teaching scenarios. These scenarios mimic real world teaching settings and are based on a formative study, which included surveys and interviews (N=108) exploring student engagement issues in online learning. Particularly, to promote realistic simulations, we employ a prompting strategy that "tells the story" of online session dialogues. We further employ LLMs to provide immediate and asynchronous feedback by referencing user inputs and established teaching strategies derived from the literature. In a within-subject evaluation (N=16), participants rated our system significantly higher than the baseline across effectiveness and usability. Compared to the baseline system, TutorUp allows tutors to more effectively learn and apply strategies for engaging students. % 
% With the rise of online learning, many novice tutors become online teachers. However, many lack experience in facilitating student engagement in remote settings. In response, we introduce TutorUp, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system that enables tutors to practice engagement strategies with simulated students in scenario-based training. These scenarios mimic real teaching situations based on a formative study (N=108), which included surveys and interviews exploring student engagement issues in online learning. To promote immersive simulations, we employ a prompting strategy that iteratively "tells the story" of online learning dialogues. Additionally, TutorUp provides immediate and asynchronous feedback by referencing user inputs and teaching strategies from the learning science literature. In a within-subject evaluation (N=16), participants rated TutorUp significantly higher than a baseline system across effectiveness and usability. Our findings suggest that TutorUp allows tutors to learn and apply strategies for engaging students more effectively, contributing to improved practices in online tutoring.
% Alternative version
With the rise of online learning, many novice tutors lack experience engaging students remotely. We introduce \textit{TutorUp}, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system that enables novice tutors to practice engagement strategies with simulated students through scenario-based training. Based on a formative study involving two surveys ($N_1=86$, $N_2=102$) on student engagement challenges, we summarize scenarios that mimic real teaching situations. To enhance immersion and realism, we employ a prompting strategy that simulates dynamic online learning dialogues. \textit{TutorUp} provides immediate and asynchronous feedback by referencing tutor-students online session dialogues and evidence-based teaching strategies from learning science literature. In a within-subject evaluation ($N=16$), participants rated \textit{TutorUp} significantly higher than a baseline system without simulation capabilities regarding effectiveness and usability. Our findings suggest that \textit{TutorUp} provides novice tutors with more effective training to learn and apply teaching strategies to address online student engagement challenges.
