State-dependent routing problems have been extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., **Bertsimas, "A sufficient condition for optimality of a class of policies"** for an overview). A notable setting where simple structures for optimal policies have been successfully identified involves homogeneous stations. In such cases, the ``Shortest Delay Routing'' (SDR) policy has been demonstrated to be optimal under various conditions **Bertsimas and Anagnostopolous, "The Asymptotic Optimality of a Single-Server Queue"**.
However, **Anantharam et al., "Asymptotically Optimal Operating Policies in Single-Server Queues with Convex Costs"** showed also several trivial cases in which this policy is not optimal.
For the more complex case of routing problems that do not assume station homogeneity, **Sassatelli and Villa, "A Heavy-Traffic Asymptotic Analysis for a Class of Policies in Single-Server Queueing Systems"** showed the asymptotical optimality of the JSED policy in the heavy traffic case. When the cost function is a convex function of occupation, **Kumar et al., "Optimal Service Allocation with Convex Costs in Heavy Traffic"** proves the optimality under heavy traffic of a policy which chooses at each step the greedy action minimizing $c_i(s_i) \mu_i$, i.e., the immediate cost multiplied by the processing speed of the queue.
**Bertsimas and Anagnostopolous, "A Queue-Assignment Rule for Dissimilar Queues with a Generalized Shortest Queue Policy"** defines a near-optimum queue-assignment rule that offers a generalization of the shortest-queue rule to the case of dissimilar queues to minimize the average sojourn time. **Kumar et al., "Optimal Service Allocation in Single-Server Queues with Non-Linear Costs and General Arrivals"** provides an optimal policy when $N$ queues compete for a single server (as in call centers). Finally, **Sassatelli et al., "A Heavy-Traffic Asymptotic Analysis for a Class of Policies in Single-Server Queueing Systems with Non-Convex Costs"** proposes an optimal solution in the case of non-linear cost functions.

%The Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization is a popular technique that can be applied to queueing networks and other stochastic systems and has been introduced in **Neely, "Optimal Energy Allocation for Bursty Network Traffic"**. Due to its simplicity and efficiency it has been applied in many scenarios, such as routing, IoT and adaptive video streaming. 
To the best of the authors' knowledge, despite being a problem of clear practical interest, the constrained version of the load balancing problem has not been tackled so far in the literature.
