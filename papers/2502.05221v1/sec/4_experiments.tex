\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Dataset Preparation}
The models were trained on the TSP-50 dataset, consisting of 1,502,000 training samples, and evaluated on a test set of 1,280 samples. To assess the generalization capabilities, the trained models were further evaluated on TSP-100 and TSP-500 datasets, with test set sizes of 1,280 and 128 samples, respectively. All experiments were conducted on a system equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.

\subsection{Comparison with Other Models}

Table~\ref{tab:comparison} outlines the performance of the Blackout DIFUSCO variants and other greedy-based approaches alongside traditional solvers like Concorde and 2-OPT. The results highlight:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Top-3 Greedy Performers}: DIFUSCO (Greedy), T2T (Greedy), and B-DIFUSCO (more improved), which demonstrated the lowest gaps (\%) compared to other methods.
    \item Blackout DIFUSCO's performance placed it consistently within the \textbf{Top-3}, emphasizing its competitiveness and efficiency compared to the baseline models.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:comparison} also demonstrates the progression in performance among Blackout DIFUSCO variants:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original Blackout DIFUSCO} achieved a gap of \textbf{0.23\%}, indicating a strong baseline.
    \item \textbf{Improved Blackout DIFUSCO} further enhanced the performance but slightly increased the gap to \textbf{0.38\%} due to additional complexity.
    \item \textbf{More Improved Blackout DIFUSCO} finalized with a gap of \textbf{0.20\%}, achieving near-optimal performance within the greedy-based category.
\end{itemize}
This incremental improvement underscores the effectiveness of targeted refinements in the diffusion model.

\subsection{Result Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:optimality_gap} provides a visual analysis of the optimality gaps across decoding methods (Greedy, Greedy + 2-OPT, Sampling, Sampling + 2-OPT) and datasets (TSP-50, TSP-100, TSP-500). Notable insights include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generalization Capability}: Although trained exclusively on TSP-50, the Blackout DIFUSCO model effectively generalized to larger datasets (TSP-100 and TSP-500), maintaining competitive gaps.
    \item \textbf{Model Stability}: The consistent performance of the diffusion-based methods across all datasets suggests robustness against instance complexity.
    \item \textbf{Greedy Efficiency}: The results reaffirm the strength of greedy strategies when optimized diffusion techniques are applied.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the results validate the proposed methods' capabilities and their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently.
