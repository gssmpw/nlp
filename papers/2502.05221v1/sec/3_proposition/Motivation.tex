\subsection{Motivation.}  
In DIFUSCO, the discrete diffusion model (D3PM) outperformed its continuous Gaussian counterpart (DDPM) due to its ability to naturally align with the discrete nature of adjacency matrix. Inspired by this success, we propose integrating Blackout Diffusion into DIFUSCO. Blackout Diffusion extends the discrete state-space paradigm to a continuous-time framework, combining the structural advantages of D3PM with the smoother transitions and finer control offered by continuous-time dynamics. This integration is anticipated to further enhance the model's ability to generate high-quality solutions for combinatorial optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
