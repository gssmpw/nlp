\subsection{More Improved Blackout DIFUSCO}
Building upon the observation time scheduling introduced in Improved Blackout DIFUSCO, we further refine the design to focus on regions where the corrupted heatmaps exhibit the largest standard deviations (\(\text{std}\)), as these regions are more challenging for the network to reconstruct. To achieve this, we introduce a hyperparameter \(\alpha\) to control the sampling density along the time axis.

The new schedule is designed to allocate more sampling steps to regions with high \(\text{std}\) while maintaining symmetry around the point of maximum variance. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The middle portion of the time axis, where the variance is highest, receives more samples.
    \item The start and end segments (\(T \alpha\)) are linearly reduced to half the maximum variance, creating a smooth transition.
\end{itemize}

For our experiments, we set \(\alpha = 0.2\), ensuring that \(20\%\) of the time axis on both ends tapers to half the maximum \(\text{std}\). The middle portion transitions linearly from this midpoint back to the peak, forming a symmetric triangular schedule. This design enables the model to concentrate more sampling steps in regions with high reconstruction difficulty, further improving its ability to recover accurate adjacency matrices.
