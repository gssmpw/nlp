\subsection{TSP Formulation}

In the case of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the goal is to compute the shortest Hamiltonian cycle that visits all $N$ nodes in a Euclidean space exactly once and returns to the starting node. Here, $S$ is the set of all feasible tours, and $x \in S$ represents a specific tour. The objective function $f(x)$ is the total length of the tour, defined as:
\[
f(x) = \sum_{(i, j) \in x} d(i, j),
\]
where $d(i, j)$ is the Euclidean distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the summation is over all edges $(i, j)$ in the tour $x$.

It is important to note that $f(x)$ is only defined over the feasible set $S$, meaning $x$ must satisfy the constraints of forming a valid Hamiltonian cycle. In TSP, this ensures that every node is visited exactly once and the tour is closed.
