\section{Conclusion}
The integration of Blackout Diffusion into DIFUSCO introduces a novel approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems through continuous-time dynamics. By aligning variance peaks with observation time and concentrating sampling in regions of high reconstruction difficulty, the proposed improvements enhance solution quality and model efficiency. While More Improved Blackout Diffusion demonstrated superior performance on TSP50 and competitive results on larger datasets, the method underscores the potential of continuous-time frameworks in combinatorial optimization. This study serves as a foundational step towards advancing diffusion-based models for discrete optimization tasks, encouraging future exploration of optimized scheduling techniques and adaptive sampling strategies. The insights gained here pave the way for broader applications of generative diffusion models in solving NP-hard problems.
