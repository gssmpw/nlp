\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The 4th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium was held in person on December 15-16, 2024, in the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The symposium included research roundtable sessions to foster discussions between participants and senior researchers on timely and relevant topics for the ML4H community~\citep{jeong2024recent,hegselmann2023recent}.

The organization of the research roundtables at the conference involved 13 senior and 27 junior chairs across 13 tables. Each roundtable session included an invited senior chair (with substantial experience in the field), junior chairs (responsible for facilitating the discussion), and attendees from diverse backgrounds with interest in the sessionâ€™s topic.

\section{Organization Process}
\label{sec:organizationprocess}

We began by identifying an initial set of topics from articles published in the ML for health literature over the past 3-5 years, complemented by suggestions from ML4H roundtable subchairs. After eliminating duplicates, we curated a list of 24 candidate topics. Then, the roundtable subchairs vote for each topic and finalize the 13 topics. For each topic, we invited senior chairs with domain expertise, targeting one chair per roundtable. We then selected junior chairs, prioritizing two individuals with prior experience relevant to the topic. Researchers in the program committee are also welcomed to serve as junior chairs in the roundtable.

Before the event, junior and senior chairs collaborated to draft an introductory paragraph, which was shared on the ML4H website. They also proposed up to four discussion questions to guide the sessions. Given the popularity of roundtables from previous years, where two 25 min sessions were held, we instead had two 50-minute discussions, which allowed the participants to discuss topics in more depth. Following the event, the chairs submitted written summaries that highlight the key insights and takeaways from their discussions.

\section{Summary}

The ML4H 2024 Research Roundtables highlighted diverse challenges and opportunities in the application of machine learning to healthcare. Among the most discussed topics was the application of multimodal foundation models capable of processing diverse data types. However, significant challenges remain in handling incomplete data, varying data quality, temporal alignment, and maintaining privacy across modalities. The discussions highlighted the importance of understanding clinical context and sampling biases when developing these models.

Causality emerged as a critical consideration. Participants noted the need for standardized benchmarks, evaluation protocols, and reporting guidelines. Causal models can offer increased robustness, however there can be a trade-off between causal validity and predictive performance. The discussions emphasized the value of developing ways to disentangle causal and correlational representations in healthcare models.

Data standardization and benchmarking pose persistent challenges. Despite the availability of public healthcare datasets, researchers struggle with preprocessing standardization, reproducibility, and clinical validation of variables. For low- and middle-income countries, unique challenges exist in implementing healthcare AI, including limited infrastructure and data availability. Participants discussed potential solutions including synthetic data generation, robust partnerships between developed and developing regions, and the importance of stakeholder engagement. The discussions emphasized the need to prioritize data quality and representativeness while ensuring solutions are contextually appropriate and ethically sound.

Participants across sessions noted how AI systems can perpetuate existing biases and exacerbate disparities in care. The roundtable on fairness and bias highlighted the need for epistemic humility and meaningful inclusion of diverse perspectives in AI development, including input from social scientists, bioethicists, and patients. Participants expressed concern about structural barriers to inclusive research, and extractive and exploitive AI practices. The discussion highlighted novel methodological approaches to measuring disparities and called for educational and structural reform in ML and medicine. 

A recurring theme was the need for thoughtful integration of AI into existing clinical workflows, with participants highlighting the gap between research and deployment. Most evaluated models are not deployed, but many deployed models are not evaluated. Participants were particularly concerned about regulation loopholes that allow EHR providers to deployed models without demonstrated clinical utility, proper monitoring protocols, and governance structures. Consistent with emerging regulatory frameworks in Europe and around the world, participants in several roundtables emphasized that different AI tools require different levels of oversight depending on their risk levels and potential for harm.

Rather than pursuing AI as a solution in itself, participants emphasized the importance of understanding real clinical needs and contexts. This includes carefully considering whether one should even consider AI solutions for a particular problem, and how we can adapt tools to specific context and varying healthcare resource settings. The discussions also highlighted the importance of continuous evaluation and monitoring of AI systems after deployment, particularly given the complex and evolving nature of healthcare environments.

The interdisciplinary nature of ML4H research requires on strategic partnerships and continuous proactive effort and learning to bridge the knowledge gap. Success often depends on \textit{bilingual} experts in the team who can effectively translate between technical and clinical domains to facilitate better communication and innovation. Rotations that provide clinicians and computer scientists with first-hand experience of the realities and challenges faced by the other field can be very beneficial. 

Finally, the conversations underscored the importance of engaging stakeholders, earning trust, and ensuring equity in AI-driven healthcare solutions, particularly in low-resource settings.

%Roundtable participants also highlighted the importance of health economics considerations, healthcare-specific benchmarks, robust evaluation methods tailored to real-world clinical conditions, and challenges in the evaluation of fairness and bias. 

%The roundtables also delved into interdisciplinary collaborations, particularly the challenges of integrating expertise from AI and clinical fields. Attendees stressed the importance of \textit{bilingual} experts who bridge technical and medical knowledge to facilitate better communication and innovation. Effective clinician-AI interactions were another focus, with participants advocating for holistic evaluations that consider the usability and relevance of AI tools in clinical workflows. In addition, the discussions explored the role of social AI in mental health and its potential to personalize care through real-time behavioral monitoring. Finally, the conversations underscored the importance of engaging stakeholders, fostering trust, and ensuring equity in AI-driven healthcare solutions, particularly in low-resource settings where data quality and accessibility remain key hurdles.

\section{Lessons Learned}

Overall, recruiting senior and junior chairs went smoother compared to the previous year, except for niche interdisciplinary areas such as health economics. Limited funding for attending the conference remains an issue for many potential chairs. Delays in visa processing, which unfairly affect participants from lower- and middle-income countries, prevented some participants from attending the conference. 

This year, the roundtable chairs came from diverse academic and industry backgrounds, which enriched the discussions. The longer 50-minute format allowed for more in-depth discussion and networking among participants. Overall, roundtable sessions were well-attended and popular among participants and chairs. However, the large number of participants who attended research roundtables which were held on another floor in the venue caused significant congestion beyond elevator capacities. 

After the conference, junior and senior chairs provided summaries of discussions, which was used to create this document. We recommend ML4H 2025 conference to continue incorporating research roundtables. Introducing variations and additional focus to topics each year, which could be inspired by local interests and expertise, can help ensure research roundtables remain engaging and relevant for years to come.
