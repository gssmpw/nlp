\section{Extracting data with \spike}\label{sec:appendix-spike}

We found two patterns of statements, which can convey a clear sentiment, and built queries upon these patterns to extract statements from \spike. Examples for all types of statements are presented in Table~\ref{tab:base-sentence}.


First, are statements in which the verb in the statements is a verb with clear sentiment, that often implies the sentiment of the entire statement. E.g., `wastes', `rejects', `fails' are negative verbs, while verbs like `enjoys', `succeeds', `empowers', conveys positive statements. 

The second pattern of statements that we found suitable for conveying a clear sentiment, are statements which describe some event/action, and its consequences, where often the adjective that describes the consequences holds information whether it is positive or negative. 

Next, we needed to label and filter them due to two main issues. First, we needed to handle the cases in which negation words appear in the statement and flips the sentiment. For example, a statement like ``We did not enjoy the show'' includes a positive verb (enjoy), but the negation flips its sentiment to be a negative statement. Another issue we encountered is that there are many statements which are irrelevant to our case, even though they match the positive/negative patterns, for example ``I couldn't sympathize with the shopping aspect of the book since I hate to shop .'' does not convey any clear sentiment, despite the use of the verb `hate'.

\input{tables/after-framing-examples}

Example for statements after framing are presented in in Table~\ref{tab:after-framing}.

\subsection{Framing Prompts}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``Here is an example of a base statement with a negative sentiment: I failed my math test today. Here is the same statement, after adding a positive framing: I failed my math test today, however I see it as an opportunity to learn and improve in the future. Here is a negative statement: <statement> Like the example, add a positive suffix or prefix to it. Don't change the original statement.''

    \item ``Here is an example of a base statement with a positive sentiment: I got an A on my math test. Here is the same statement, after adding a negative framing: I got an A on my math test. I think I spent too much time learning to it though. Here is a positive statement: <statement>. Like the example, add a negative suffix or prefix to it. Don't change the original statement.''
\end{enumerate}

\section{Annotation Platform}\label{sec:mturk-appendix}

We select a pool of 10 qualified workers who successfully passed our qualification test, which consisted of 20 base statements (unframed), for which annotators were expected to achieve perfect accuracy. The estimated hourly wage for the entire experiment was approximately 14USD per hour.

Screenshot of the annotation platform is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:annotation-platform}.

\section{Models}\label{sec:appendix-models}

We ran the open models via together-ai API.\footnote{\url{https://www.together.ai}} 
The list of models we used are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "google/gemma-2-9b-it"
    \item "google/gemma-2-27b-it"
    \item "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"
    \item "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
    \item "mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1"
    \item "meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-chat-hf"
    \item "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf"
\end{itemize}

For \gpt{}, we used the OpenAI api, with "gpt-4o-2024-08-06".\footnote{\url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview}}
