    \caption{Percentage of reframed statements that results in sentiment shift positive to negative or vice versa). Red represents negative-base statements reframed as positive, and green represents positive-base statements reframed as negative. Horizontal lines show the mean across models. We find that both LLMs and humans are influenced by opposite framing, with a stronger effect for positive reframing.}
