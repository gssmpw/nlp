    \caption{Distribution of sentiment scores before and after applying opposite-sentiment framing, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:adding-framing}. Prior to framing, base sentences exhibit a clear polarity (positive or negative), whereas the application of opposite framing introduces ambiguity, shifting the sentiment scores toward a less distinct polarity.}
