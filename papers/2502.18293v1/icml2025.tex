% \subsection{Figures}

% You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
% your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
% legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
% least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
% not appear on a gray background.

% Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
% form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
% that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
% figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

% Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
% \emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
% the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
% \cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
% 9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
% case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
% bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
% (use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
% two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Algorithms}

% If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
% environments to format pseudocode. These require
% the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
% algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
% \cref{alg:example} shows an example.

% \begin{algorithm}[tb]
%    \caption{Bubble Sort}
%    \label{alg:example}
% \begin{algorithmic}
%    \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
%    \REPEAT
%    \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
%    \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
%    \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
%    \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
%    \STATE $noChange = false$
%    \ENDIF
%    \ENDFOR
%    \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
% \end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}

% \subsection{Tables}

% You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
% figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
% However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
% 0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
% \cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
% type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
% should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

% \begin{table}[t]
% \caption{Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible
% Bayes on various data sets.}
% \label{sample-table}

% Cleveland & 83.3$\pm$ 0.6& 80.0$\pm$ 0.6& $\times$\\
% Glass2    & 61.9$\pm$ 1.4& 83.8$\pm$ 0.7& $\surd$ \\
% Credit    & 74.8$\pm$ 0.5& 78.3$\pm$ 0.6&         \\
% Horse     & 73.3$\pm$ 0.9& 69.7$\pm$ 1.0& $\times$\\
% Meta      & 67.1$\pm$ 0.6& 76.5$\pm$ 0.5& $\surd$ \\
% Pima      & 75.1$\pm$ 0.6& 73.9$\pm$ 0.5&         \\
% Vehicle   & 44.9$\pm$ 0.6& 61.5$\pm$ 0.4& $\surd$ \\
% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{sc}
% \end{small}
% \end{center}
% \vskip -0.1in
% \end{table}

% Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
% Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
% row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
% wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
% top or bottom of the page.

% \subsection{Theorems and such}
% The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
% \begin{definition}
% \label{def:inj}
% A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
% \end{definition}
% Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
% \begin{proposition}
% If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
% the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof} 
% Left as an exercise to the reader. 
% \end{proof}
% \cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
% \begin{lemma}
% \label{lem:usefullemma}
% For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{theorem}
% \label{thm:bigtheorem}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
% \end{theorem}
% An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
% \begin{corollary}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
% the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{assumption}
% The set $X$ is finite.
% \label{ass:xfinite}
% \end{assumption}
% \begin{remark}
% According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
% \end{remark}
