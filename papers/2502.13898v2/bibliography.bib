    abstract = {Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as image classification, computers still perform poorly on cognitive tasks such as image description and question answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked ``What vehicle is the person riding?'', computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that ``the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.''In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of {\$}{\$}35{\$}{\$}objects, {\$}{\$}26{\$}{\$}attributes, and {\$}{\$}21{\$}{\$}pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs.},

Existing automatic evaluation metrics are primarily sensitive to n-gram overlap, which is neither necessary nor sufficient for the task of simulating human judgment. We hypothesize that semantic propositional content is an important component of human caption evaluation, and propose a new automated caption evaluation metric defined over scene graphs coined SPICE. Extensive evaluations across a range of models and datasets indicate that SPICE captures human judgments over model-generated captions better than other automatic metrics (e.g., system-level correlation of 0.88 with human judgments on the MS COCO dataset, versus 0.43 for CIDEr and 0.53 for METEOR). Furthermore, SPICE can answer questions such as which caption-generator best understands colors? and can caption-generators count?",

The experimental results of several typical algorithms (e.g. SSD, YOLOv5, Faster RCNN and Deformable DETR) on the datasets show that data labeling errors (such as missing labels, category label errors, inappropriate labels) are another factor that affects the detection performance of small objects.}

Yet, most current work in gesture or action interpretation remains rooted in view-dependent representations. This paper introduces Motion History Volumes (MHV) as a free-viewpoint representation for human actions in the case of multiple calibrated, and background-subtracted, video cameras. We present algorithms for computing, aligning and comparing MHVs of different actions performed by different people in a variety of viewpoints. Alignment and comparisons are performed efficiently using Fourier transforms in cylindrical coordinates around the vertical axis. Results indicate that this representation can be used to learn and recognize basic human action classes, independently of gender, body size and viewpoint.}

    abstract = {Weakly-supervised grounded image captioning (WSGIC) aims to generate the caption and ground (localize) predicted object words in the input image without using bounding box supervision. Recent two-stage solutions mostly apply a bottom-up pipeline: (1) encode the input image into multiple region features using an object detector; (2) leverage region features for captioning and grounding. However, utilizing independent proposals produced by object detectors tends to make the subsequent grounded captioner overfitted in finding the correct object words, overlooking the relation between objects, and selecting incompatible proposal regions for grounding. To address these issues, we propose a one-stage weakly-supervised grounded captioner that directly takes the RGB image as input to perform captioning and grounding at the top-down image level. Specifically, we encode the image into visual token representations and propose a Recurrent Grounding Module (RGM) in the decoder to obtain precise Visual Language Attention Maps (VLAMs), which recognize the spatial locations of the objects. In addition, we explicitly inject a relation module into our one-stage framework to encourage relation understanding through multi-label classification. This relation semantics served as contextual information facilitating the prediction of relation and object words in the caption. We observe that the relation semantic not only assists the grounded captioner in generating a more accurate caption but also improves the grounding performance. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on two challenging datasets (Flick30k Entities captioning and MSCOCO captioning). The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding performance. We made the code publicly available.}
