\caption{\textbf{MI performance versus the Train-Test gap.} The target models exhibit varying Train-Test gaps, measured by the difference in DocVQA scores between member/non-member documents. Our attacks remain effective even when the gap is small, with performance improving as the gap increases across most target models and datasets. In contrast, baseline methods show more variable performance under these conditions.}
