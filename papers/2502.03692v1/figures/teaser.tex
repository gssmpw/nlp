    \caption{\textbf{The General Scheme of Document-level Membership Inference Attacks.} \textit{Training:} A DocVQA model is trained on a dataset of documents, each associated with \textbf{multiple questions/answers}. \textit{Deployment:} An adversary exploits this structure by querying the model with questions related to a target document. By aggregating the model's responses, the adversary can infer the membership of the document in the training set.}
