    \caption{\textbf{Diagram of Spaced KD.} In online KD, the teacher and student are two individual networks. In self KD, we follow the prior work~\citep{self-kd} that distills knowledge from the deepest layer to the shallower layers of the same network. In Spaced KD, we train the teacher with a controllable space interval steps ahead and then distill its knowledge to the student network.
    %Thus, the teacher is the deepest layer of the network and the students are the shallow layers along with their corresponding classifiers.
