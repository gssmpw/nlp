\label{sec:Conclusion}
This paper introduced the Knapsack Schema Linking Agent (KaSLA), a pioneering approach to overcoming schema linking challenges in text-to-SQL tasks. Based on knapsack optimization, KaSLA effectively prevent the missing of relevant elements and excess redundancy, thereby significantly enhancing SQL generation accuracy. Our introduction of an enhanced schema linking metric, sets a new standard for evaluating schema linking performance.
KaSLA utilizes a hierarchical linking strategy, starting with optimal table linking and then proceeding to column linking within selected tables, effectively reducing the candidate search space. In each step, KaSLA employs a knapsack optimization strategy to link potentially relevant elements while considering a limited tolerance for potential redundancy. Extensive experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks have demonstrated that KaSLA can significantly enhance the SQL generation performance of existing text-to-SQL models by substituting their current schema linking processes. These findings underscore KaSLA's potential to revolutionize schema linking and advance the broader capabilities of text-to-SQL systems, offering a robust solution that paves the way for more precise and efficient database interactions.


\section{Limitation} \label{sec: Limitation}
There are mainly two limitations of this work. First, although KaSLA demonstrates significant advancements in schema linking accuracy and efficiency, its performance traditionally depends on a comprehensive training dataset with detailed ground truth linking results. However, our experiments indicate that KaSLA possesses a degree of transferability, showing promise even in scenarios where training data is sparse or less diverse. This adaptability suggests that KaSLA can maintain reasonable effectiveness across different database environments, although performance might still be impacted in highly dynamic or rapidly evolving schema structures. Additionally, the reliance on a fine-tuning process of LLMs, integrating DeepSeek-coder-1.3B, could pose scalability challenges in resource-constrained settings. Despite these limitations, KaSLA remains a powerful tool for schema linking optimization in text-to-SQL tasks, and future work could focus on enhancing its adaptability and efficiency.
