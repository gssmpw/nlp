\section{Introduction}
Document structure parsing is essential for visually rich document understanding, enabling applications such as information retrieval and document summarization~\cite{xu2020layoutlm}. Unlike traditional text-based document processing, mining reports and other complex documents contain heterogeneous semantic entities, requiring hierarchical parsing to infer parent-child relationships~\cite{li2020docbank}.

The \textit{AAAI-25 Visually-Rich Document (VRD-IU) Leaderboard} task involves predicting parent-child relationships among detected entities in mining reports. This problem is challenging due to scanned and inconsistently structured documents, necessitating inference from spatial and contextual cues. Performance is evaluated using accuracy.  


In this paper, we present our solution, which ranked first in the competition. We combines large margin loss for improved feature discrimination with heuristic greedy algorithms for efficient hierarchical assignment. Method~\ref{sec:method} details our approach, Experiments~\ref{sec:experiments} presents experimental results, and Conclusion section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with insights and future directions.
