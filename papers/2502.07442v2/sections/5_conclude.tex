\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we proposed a novel approach for document structure parsing, combining large margin loss with heuristic-based greedy algorithms. Our method enhances feature discrimination while efficiently capturing hierarchical relationships. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating deep learning with rule-based refinements, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the AAAI-25 VRD-IU challenge. Future work includes exploring more diverse datasets and refining heuristic rules for better generalization.
