\section{Experiments}
In this section, we present the competition dataset, our implementation, and the archived results of the competition.
\label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset contains 571 training, 165 validation, and 81 test documents. Labels are provided only for the training set, while the validation and test sets are used for the public and private leaderboards. Each document contains multiple objects, each with a bounding box in the scanned document and optional text content. The task is to predict the parent object for each object, evaluated using accuracy.
\subsection{Implemtentation}
We use a pre-trained BART-large \cite{lewis2019bart} for text feature extraction and a pre-trained SwinV2-Tiny \cite{liu2022swin} for image features. The extracted features are concatenated with additional information such as page number and bounding box position. Two separate encoders, each with a 512-dimensional output, are used to extract features for parent and child entities.
\subsection{Results}
Due to time constraints in the competition, we were unable to conduct extensive experiments on alternative methods or additional datasets. Table~\ref{tab:result} presents the main results obtained on the competition dataset, evaluated on the validation set and test set.
