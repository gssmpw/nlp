\section{Related works}
%The most relevant works are the local and dynamic sampling algorithms introduced in____, as discussed above.

Our local sampling algorithm also falls into the category of providing \emph{local access to large random objects}____.
Given a $q$-spin system $\+S = (G = (V, E), \bm{\lambda}, \bm{A})$ and public random bits, our algorithm can generate consistent samples $X_{\Lambda}$ such that $X \sim \mu = \mu^{\+S}$ upon multiple queries of any subset of vertices $\Lambda \subseteq V$, using only a local number of probes for public random bits.

The design of our local sampler is based on the backward deduction of Glauber dynamics. We also show that local sampling algorithms can be achieved even for unbounded-degree graphs, assuming some precomputation with respect to the spin system. A related work of this is____, where they perform each update of the forward Glauber dynamics for the hardcore model and the Ising model in sublinear time, with precomputation assumed. However, their application and techniques differ from ours: They use separate algorithms for the hardcore and Ising models, while we propose a unified algorithm for all spin systems. Additionally, they employ Bernoulli factory algorithms to accelerate updates for the Ising model, which contrasts with our approach.
