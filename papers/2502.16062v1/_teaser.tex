\captionof{figure}{The \sysname\ system leverages textual user input to generate visual blends, offering a platform for creative exploration. The system broadens the spectrum of design possibilities by mapping abstract concepts -- highlighted in \blu{blue} and \ora{orange} colors -- onto tangible physical objects through constructed metaphorical associations. These mapped objects are then seamlessly integrated based on shared attributes, resulting in conceptually meaningful and visually cohesive blends.}
