\section{Hypotheses}



Previous studies indicate that creating visual blends is a challenging task~\cite{10.1145/3290605.3300402, 10.1145/3411764.3445089}. 
However, a broader range of related examples can enhance the ideation process~\cite{ECKERT2000523}. 
Additionally, reducing the cognitive load unrelated to creative tasks can boost creativity~\cite{malycha2017enhancing}.
Given the specific application of our system and the creative practices of designers, we propose the following hypotheses relative to the baseline (described in section~\ref{sec:eval}):


\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\textbf{H\arabic*}]
    \item Compared to the baseline, the \sysname{} system improves the overall usability by streamlining the design ideation workflow.
    \item Compared to the baseline, the \sysname{} system is capable of decreasing users' mental demand  (\textbf{H2a}), physical exertion (\textbf{H2b}), and time pressure (\textbf{H2c}) during visual blend design ideation, while simultaneously improving their satisfaction with the design ideation outcomes (\textbf{H2d}), reducing the required effort (\textbf{H2e}), and mitigating frustration during task execution (\textbf{H2f}).
    \item Compared to the baseline, the \sysname{} system is capable of generating a greater quantity (\textbf{H3a}) and a wider variety of design ideation outcomes (\textbf{H3b}) in the same amount of time, leading to improved overall designer satisfaction (\textbf{H3c}).
    \item Compared to the baseline, the \sysname{} system enables users to explore a broader range of creative ideas more easily (\textbf{H4a}), facilitates collaboration between designers and AI (\textbf{H4b}), and enhances the enjoyment of the design process (\textbf{H4c}). Additionally, users are likely to perceive the generated ideation results as more worthwhile (\textbf{H4d}), and the system's user interface enables them to focus on the task itself (\textbf{H4e}). 
    Furthermore, users can exhibit increased expressiveness during their design ideation activities (\textbf{H4f}). 
    \item Compared to the baseline, the \sysname{} system offers a more metaphorical approach to supporting user ideation activities.
\end{enumerate}
