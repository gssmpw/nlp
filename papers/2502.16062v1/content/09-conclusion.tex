\section{Conclusion}



This paper introduces \sysname, an AI-assisted system designed to enhance the process of visual blend ideation by leveraging metaphors. 
%Our system utilizes large language models and commonsense knowledge bases to explore objects and their associated attributes, forming metaphorical connections with abstract concepts.
Our system utilizes LLMs and commonsense knowledge bases to explore objects and their associated attributes, forming metaphorical connections with abstract concepts. 
It offers the capability to automatically generate blending proposals based on user selections, facilitating rapid creative realization for verification through the T2I model.
To evaluate the system, we conducted a user study involving 24 participants who had AI experience. The findings demonstrate that \sysname\ has the potential to enhance the creativity of the generated ideation results and enable the expression of abstract concepts more metaphorically.
Additionally, this research offers insights into user preferences regarding visual blend design and potential future approaches for supporting design with generative AI.
