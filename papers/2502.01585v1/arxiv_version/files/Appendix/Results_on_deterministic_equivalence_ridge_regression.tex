\section{Proofs for ridge regression}

In this section, we provide the proof of deterministic equivalence for ridge regression in both the asymptotic (\cref{app:asy_deter_equiv_lr}) and non-asymptotic (\cref{app:nonasy_deter_equiv_lr}) settings. Additionally, we provide the proof of the relationship between test risk and the $\ell_2$ norm given in the main text, as detailed in \cref{app:relationship}.
