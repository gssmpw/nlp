\subsection{Recommender System}
% first introduce CRS - on hold

Sequential recommendation methods____ primarily focus on developing temporal encoders to capture both short- and long-term user interests. The evolution of these encoders has progressed from GRU units____, to more advanced architectures such as self-attention mechanisms (e.g., SASRec____), bidirectional encoders (e.g., BERT4Rec____ with masked item training), graph neural networks____, and other Transformer-based models____.
In the context of embracing large language models, generative recommenders____ treat item indices as tokens and predict them in a generative manner. Meanwhile, LLMs____ are utilized to play as a sequential embedding extractor to improve the recommendation performance. In our framework design, all recommendation models can be considered as components of the tools.

Before large language model become popular, conversational recommendation system (CRS)____ aims at designing better dialogue understanding models or incorporating reinforcement learning for multiple dialogues answering. Due to the capacity of the conventional language model, it lose the flexibility of the dialogue including the dialogue format and number of turns. To resolve this problem, some researchers____ leverage the power of LLM to better understand the intention of user.

The echo chamber effect occurs when individuals are exposed only to information and opinions that reinforce their existing beliefs within their social networks____, leading to a lack of diverse perspectives and increased polarization____. In the context of recommender systems, researchers have begun to study echo chambers and feedback loops____. Kalimeris et al.____ propose a matrix factorization-based recommender system with a theoretical framework for modeling dynamic user interests, while $\partial$CCF____ employs counterfactual reasoning to mitigate echo chambers.

\subsection{Personal Language-based Agent}
In the early stages, some researchers____ in the NLP field developed dialogue agents with personas to enhance dialogue quality. Language models____ are prompted with role descriptions to simulate realistic interactions by storing experiences, synthesizing memories, and dynamically planning actions, resulting in believable individual and social behaviors within interactive environments.

WebShop____ attempts to understand product attributes from human-provided text instructions using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Similar to traditional conversational recommender systems (CRS)____, it is impractical for users to describe each product attribute every time. With the advancement of large language models (such as GPTs____), many researchers____ have begun designing domain-specific agents that integrate various tool learning and memory mechanisms.

More recently, recommendation agents (RecAgent)____ have been developed to simulate user behaviors and predict user-item interactions. A common design feature among these agents is the use of historical interaction information as user memory____, with LLMs utilized to generate the ranking results. Unlike platform-side RecAgents, $\model$ and $\modelplus$ are the first to operate on the user side, generating re-ranking results based on user instructions and individual memory, unaffected by the influence of advantaged users.
