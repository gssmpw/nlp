No need for labeled data or training; Quick deployment; Handles nuanced language patterns. & 
Computationally expensive; May be less accurate than fine-tuned classifiers on domain-specific data. \\ \hline

\textbf{Fully Synthetic Data} & 
Enables training when no authentic data is available; Suitable for low-resource domains. & 
Synthetic data may lack diversity and realism; Risk of overfitting to generated patterns. \\ \hline
