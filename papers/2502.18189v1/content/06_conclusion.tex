\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented exact algorithms for minimum dilation triangulations,
%We find that, experimentally, \binmdt{} is faster \incmdt{},
greatly outperforming previous methods from the literature.
This has also yielded insights into
the intricate structure of optimal solutions for regular $n$-gons,
together with new lower bounds on the worst-case dilation of triangulations.
This demonstrates the value of computational tools for gaining analytic insights
that seem out of reach with purely manual analysis.

On the theoretical
side, one tantalizing open question remains the complexity of
the MDT; here the intricate structure of solutions for 
regular $n$-gons may show the way for hardness constructions even for 
convex arrangements. An equally fascinating problem is 
the worst-case dilation of triangulations; here we conjecture that 
the asymptotic dilation for regular $n$-gons 
corresponds to the worst-case dilation 
for general point sets, implying a value between
$\lbRhoShort$ and $1.4482$, with a better lower 
bound achievable via even larger $n$-gons.

On the practical side, the runtime of our algorithms 
is dominated by repeatedly computing the dilation of a triangulation.
With sums of square roots handled as described,
this does not appear to be a difficult problem per se,
so appropriately tailored algorithms or data structures 
for carrying out huge numbers of dilation queries
would be extremely helpful.
