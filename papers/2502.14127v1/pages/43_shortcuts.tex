\subsection{\mcqa Shortcuts May Let LLMs ``Cheat''} \label{subsection:artifacts}

Answerable MCQs (\cref{subsection:quality}) are not always high quality, as shortcuts may let LLMs guess the answers to MCQs without knowing the answers \cite{10.1145/3596490}, overestimating model accuracy \cite{wiegreffe2021teach}.
%
Shortcuts can arise from annotator artifacts \cite{gururangan2018annotation}, spurious patterns \cite{zhou2023explore}, or bypassed reasoning steps \cite{chen2019understanding}.
%
If LLMs best random guessing via partial inputs (e.g. choices only) \cite{richardson2020does}, they may~exist.

Below, we discuss how scoring (\cref{subsubsection:shortcut_scoring})
and data collection methods (\cref{subsubsection:shortcut_dataset})
can mitigate shortcuts.

\subsubsection{Calibrated Scoring Can Deter Guessing} \label{subsubsection:shortcut_scoring}

While rare in human testing,\footnote{Since
they may induce stress or anxiety in students~\cite{vanderoost2018elimination},
but we think it is fine to stress~LLMs.} scoring methods can
penalize wrong guesses~\cite{lau2011guessing}:
\textbf{1) Probability scoring:} elicit confidence scores for each choice \cite{finetti1965methods}; \textbf{2) Negative marking:} subtract points for wrong answers with abstention allowed \cite{holt2006analysis}; and \textbf{3) Elimination scoring:} students iteratively remove wrong choices until unsure \cite{ben1997comparative}.
Confidence \cite{li-etal-2024-think}, abstention \cite{goral2024wait}, and elimination \cite{ma2023poe} have been studied in LLMs, so they may be easy to use for \mcqa evaluation.

These methods deter guessing, but also reward calibrated models that know their knowledge gaps \cite{guo2017calibration}.
While often ignored in evaluations \cite{bommasani2023holistic},
calibration scoring could let \mcqa better test decision-making \cite{liu2024dellma} and enable partial credit for subjective tasks where multiple choices may be tenable~(\cref{subsection:testing_what}).



\subsubsection{We Can Design Shortcut-Proof MCQs} \label{subsubsection:shortcut_dataset}

Data designers should limit shortcuts; an easy way is
uniform design.
When solving MCQs with only choices,
\citet{Balepur2024ArtifactsOA} find LLMs may exploit distributional
differences, so like educators~do (\cref{subsection:quality}), we should write parts of MCQs consistently: via the same agent, source, and decoding method.
%
HellaSwag \cite{zellers2019hellaswag} leads to the highest known choices-only accuracy, where \textit{user}-written answers and \textit{model}-written distractors are inconsistent, showing the necessity of uniform data design.

Contrast sets are another tool that detect if models ignore inputs and use shortcuts \cite{Gardner2020EvaluatingML}.
%
In \mcqa, they are entry pairs differing by some inputs (e.g. question)
that change the answer (Figure~\ref{fig:contrast}), ensuring models attend to the perturbed input
\cite{elazar2023measuring}.
%
\citet{balepur2024your} use contrast sets in commonsense \mcqa to
ensure none of their LLMs rely on shortcuts in choices to rank
highly.
%
Contrast sets are often made manually \cite{Kaushik2020Learning}, so future work~can test
automatic ways to build them \cite{li-etal-2020-linguistically}.

Studying how users and models \textit{``cheat''}
\cite{saxon-etal-2023-peco} in MCQs also finds shortcuts.
%
In reading comprehension, \citet{Pang2021QuALITYQA} give~users \inlinecode{ctrl+F} to detect MCQs quickly solvable without using the full text, while \citet{Malaviya2022CascadingBI} flag MCQs where users
can use simple heuristics.
%
We can also train models to cheat; adversarial
filtering trains simple models
(e.g. bag-of-words) and omits MCQs they can solve \cite{zellers2018swag}.~Extending this, we believe having strong LLMs reason to cheat---similar to safety work in alignment faking
\cite{greenblatt2024alignment}---can help find shortcuts.
