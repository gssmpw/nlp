\begin{prompt}[title={Prompt \thetcbcounter: Paper Classifier Prompt}, label=prompt:paper_clf]
You are a lab assistant, helping with a systematic review on using LLMs to perform MCQA (Multiple Choice Question Answering). Your task is to rate the relevance of a paper to the topic of MCQA, particularly focusing on research related to:\\
    - Format (e.g., limitations of the MCQA format, connection to real-world tasks, assumption of a single best answer).\\
    - Dataset Quality (e.g., saturation, test set leakage, incorrect answers, artifacts and shortcuts).\\
    - Models (e.g., robustness, logical reasoning challenges).\\

    We are not interested in papers related to generating multiple-choice questions.\\

    To clarify:\\
    - Papers focusing explicitly on MCQA methodologies, evaluations, or related challenges are considered highly relevant.\\
    - Papers on closely related topics (e.g., general question answering, NLP datasets, or evaluation methods) may still be relevant if they address concepts transferable to MCQA.\\
    - Papers that solely discuss unrelated NLP tasks, such as translation or summarization, without mentioning MCQA or related issues, are irrelevant.\\
    - Papers focusing on training a model from scratch or using entirely different evaluation paradigms (e.g., open-ended text generation) are also considered irrelevant unless they explicitly tie back to MCQA.\\

    Be aware that a paper might not explicitly spell out "MCQA" but could still use a multiple-choice format or discuss related issues under different terminology. In such cases, use your judgment to evaluate its relevance.\\

    Provide a response in JSON format with two fields:\\
    - 'reasoning': A single sentence justifying your decision.\\
    - 'rating': A string that is one of the following categories:\\
    - 'highly relevant'\\
    - 'somewhat relevant'\\
    - 'neutrally relevant'\\
    - 'somewhat irrelevant'\\
    - 'highly irrelevant'\\

Question: Heat, light, and sound are all different forms of what?\\
Answer: \colorbox{SkyBlue}{Energy}

\begin{prompt}[title={Prompt \thetcbcounter: Justified \mcqa (Figure~\ref{fig:format}, bottom)}, label=prompt:justified_mcqa]
Give the letter of the answer and a justification\\
Question: Heat, light, and sound are all different forms of what?\\
Choices: (A) fuel (B) energy (C) matter (D) electricity\\
Answer:\\
Justification:\\
\\
 \colorbox{SkyBlue}{Answer: B}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{Justification: Heat, light, and sound are all different forms}\\\colorbox{SkyBlue}{of energy. Energy is the ability to do work or produce}\\\colorbox{SkyBlue}{change. Heat is thermal energy, light is electromagnetic}\\\colorbox{SkyBlue}{energy, and sound is mechanical energy traveling through a}\\\colorbox{SkyBlue}{medium. Therefore, the correct answer is B) energy.}

Just give the letter of the answer\\
Question: In Spongebob, Tony's house has a poster referencing what band?\\
Choices: (A) Queen (B) Gorillaz (C) Kiss\\
Answer: \colorbox{SkyBlue}{I don't have a record of a character named Tony in}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{SpongeBob SquarePants having a poster referencing a}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{band. However, if you meant Tony Fast Jr. (a minor}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{character from the episode Tutor Sauce), his room has a}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{poster that appears to reference the band Kiss.}\\

\colorbox{SkyBlue}{Thus, the answer is:}\\

\colorbox{SkyBlue}{(A) Kiss}\\

\colorbox{SkyBlue}{I chose this because Kiss is known for their iconic face}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{paint, and the poster in the episode features a character}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{with similar stylized makeup, which aligns with the band's}\\
\colorbox{SkyBlue}{aesthetic.}
