\begin{abstract}

The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant privacy concerns regarding the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) in user prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a query-unrelated PII masking strategy and introduce PII-Bench, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing privacy protection systems. PII-Bench comprises 2,842 test samples across 55 fine-grained PII categories, featuring diverse scenarios from single-subject descriptions to complex multi-party interactions. Each sample is carefully crafted with a user query, context description, and standard answer indicating query-relevant PII. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current models perform adequately in basic PII detection, they show significant limitations in determining PII query relevance. Even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, particularly in handling complex multi-subject scenarios, indicating substantial room for improvement in achieving intelligent PII masking.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces PII-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 2,842 test samples, along with a query-unrelated PII masking strategy. Our evaluation reveals that while current LLMs achieve strong performance in basic PII detection (F1>0.90), they show limited capability in query-relevance assessment (F1<0.63) and struggle with complex multi-subject scenarios. Small-scale models demonstrate substantially lower performance across all tasks. These findings establish important benchmarks for privacy-preserving systems and highlight critical challenges in intelligent PII handling. 

\section*{Limitations}
Despite PII-Bench's contributions to privacy protection evaluation, several limitations merit acknowledgment. While the current dataset encompasses common privacy scenarios, it requires expansion into specialized domains such as medical records and financial transactions. Our automated synthesis methodology mitigates this limitation by enabling flexible dataset expansion across domains, languages, and cultural contexts, supporting continuous refinement of PII categories to meet evolving application requirements.
The evaluation framework primarily assesses the accuracy of PII entity detection and query relevance determination, but lacks systematic evaluation of models' reasoning processes. Specifically, it does not fully capture how models interpret queries, derive information requirements, and make relevance judgments about sensitive information. This gap in assessment methodology limits our understanding of models' reasoning capabilities in real-world privacy protection scenarios.

\section*{Ethical Concerns}
Throughout the development and implementation of PII-Bench, ethical considerations have remained our paramount priority. To ensure the evaluation dataset itself does not compromise privacy, we have implemented rigorous data synthesis and review protocols, with all sample data undergoing multiple rounds of scrutiny by professional security teams to guarantee the absence of real personal information. During the data generation process, we have carefully engineered our algorithms to ensure equitable representation across different demographic groups, establishing comprehensive human review mechanisms to verify that generated data remains free from bias and discriminatory content.
