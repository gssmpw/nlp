\begin{abstract}
  We propose a new approach for proving safety of infinite state systems.
  %
  It extends the analyzed system by \emph{transitive
  relations} until its \emph{diameter} $D$ becomes finite, i.e., until constantly many
  steps suffice to cover all reachable states, irrespective of the
  initial state.
  %
  Then we can prove safety by checking that no error state is reachable in $D$ steps.
  %
  To deduce transitive relations, we use \emph{recurrence analysis}.
  %
  While recurrence analyses can usually find conjunctive relations only, our approach also discovers disjunctive relations by combining recurrence analysis with \emph{projections}.
  %
  An empirical evaluation of the implementation of our approach in our tool \tool{LoAT}
  shows that it is highly competitive with the state of the art.
