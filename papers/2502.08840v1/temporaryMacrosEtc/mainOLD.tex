\begin{abstract}
The \emph{graph projection} of a hypergraph is a simple graph with the same vertex set and with an edge between each pair of vertices that appear together in a hyperedge.  
We consider the problem of reconstructing a random $d$-uniform hypergraph from its projection. Feasibility of this task depends on $d$ and the density of hyperedges in the random hypergraph. For $d=3$ we precisely determine the threshold, while for $d\geq 4$ we give bounds. All of our feasibility results are obtained by exhibiting an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the original hypergraph, while infeasibility is information-theoretic. 

Our results also apply to mildly inhomogeneous random hypergraphs, including hypergraph stochastic block models. 
% A consequence of our results is that claims from the 2023 COLT paper \cite{gaudio2023community} are disproved. 
\red{
A consequence of our results is that we solved the information theoretic limit of exact recovery of hypergraph stochastic block model given the similarity matrix, which appeared as an open problem in \cite{gaudio2023community} .
