\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The \emph{graph projection} of a hypergraph is a simple graph with the same vertex set and with an edge between each pair of vertices that appear in a hyperedge.  
We consider the problem of reconstructing a random $d$-uniform hypergraph from its projection. Feasibility of this task depends on $d$ and the density of hyperedges in the random hypergraph. For $d=3$ we precisely determine the threshold, while for $d\geq 4$ we give bounds. All of our feasibility results are obtained by exhibiting an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the original hypergraph, while infeasibility is information-theoretic. 

Our results also apply to mildly inhomogeneous random hypergrahps, including hypergraph stochastic block models. A consequence of our results is that claims from the 2023 COLT paper \cite{gaudio2023community} are disproved.
