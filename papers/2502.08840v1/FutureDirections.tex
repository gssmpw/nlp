\section{Open Problems}
We list a number of open problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove or disprove the conjecture that the threshold $\cdel d$ for $d=4,5$ is at $\frac{2d-4}{2d-1}$.
    \item Instead of having uniform hypergraphs, we can consider general hypergraphs with hyperedges of different sizes. If hyperedges of different sizes appear independently at random, when is exact recovery possible?
    \item Instead of exact recovery, we might aim for only \emph{almost} exact recovery or \emph{partial} recovery, where we want to recover $1-o_n(1)$ or $\Omega_n(1)$ fraction of hyperedges instead of all hyperedges. Where is the optimal threshold for almost exact recovery.
    \item What is the reconstruction threshold for recovery from the similarity matrix rather than the projected graph? In other words, how much does it help to know the number of hyperedges an edge belongs to? 
    \item A problem exhibits a statistical-computational gap if the information theoretically optimal performance cannot be reached by an efficient algorithm. For $d=3,4,5$, we have shown that the information theoretically optimal algorithm is always efficient whenever exact recovery is possible. When $d\ge 6$ what is the threshold $\cdel d$? If the threshold is above $\frac{d-1}{d+1}$, 
    is there a statistical-computational gap? In other words, is it still possible to efficiently achieve exact recovery for any $\delta\le \cdel d$?
    \item If we consider the random hypergraph as a random bit string of length $\binom{n}{d}$, the projected graph as a bit string of length $\binom{n}{2}$. The operator $\proj$ can be viewed as an information channel. How much entropy is lost with the projection operation $\proj$?
    \item How well does the greedy algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:greedy}) work? What is the threshold for the greedy algorithm to exactly recover the original hypergraph?
    \item The running time of Algorithm~\ref{alg:map} depends exponentially on $\b(\frac{d-1}{d+1}-\delta\b)\inv$. Is this dependence necessary?
\end{enumerate}
