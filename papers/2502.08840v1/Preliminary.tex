% \section{Preliminaries}
% A \emph{random $d$-hypergraph} $\rhG(n,d,\delta)=([n],\hE_{\hG})$ \footnote{\cg{might be helpful to have separate notations for a set of hyperedges and a set of edges}} where every $d$-hyperedge is included in $\hE_{\rhG}$ with probability $p=\Theta(n^{-d+1+\delta})$.\footnote{Constant factors do not affect any result of the paper. The same result also holds with possibly different probabilities at different edges. The parametrization is made so that expected degree of a node is $\Theta(n^\delta)$.} 
% Let $\Ih_\he$ for any $\he\in \binom{[n]}{d}$ be the indicator that $\he\in \hE_{\rhG}$.
