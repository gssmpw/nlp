Several pHRI frameworks have been introduced in recent years, with early research primarily focused on collision detection and reaction mechanisms to prevent injuries caused by robots in industrial settings**Grioli, D., et al., "Human-robot interaction in industrial environments: A review"**. Over time, more advanced approaches have emerged, integrating risk metrics into robotic control systems to account for injury risks during human-robot interactions**Sikorski, T., et al., "Risk-aware Human-Robot Interaction with Industrial Robots"**. Additionally, innovations such as precise but heavy compliance achieved through admittance control on industrial robots**Koehler, "Admittance Control for Human-Robot Interaction"** and the use of soft skins with embedded force sensors**Chalon, M., "Soft-Skin-Based Force and Tactile Sensing for Social Robots"** have made robots more adaptable to close-contact interactions. However, despite these advancements, the performance of these systems has often fallen short of industry requirements. This highlights the need to shift the approach toward performance-oriented solutions. Instead of viewing safety as a limiting factor, the framework presented in this paper positions safety as a constraint within performance optimization, as suggested in**Müller, B., "Performance-Oriented Design for Human-Robot Interaction: A Review"**, ensuring both high safety standards and enhanced performance in industrial pHRI.
