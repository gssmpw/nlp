Several pHRI frameworks have been introduced in recent years, with early research primarily focused on collision detection and reaction mechanisms to prevent injuries caused by robots in industrial settings~\cite{4650764}. Over time, more advanced approaches have emerged, integrating risk metrics into robotic control systems to account for injury risks during human-robot interactions~\cite{phrihaddadin}. Additionally, innovations such as precise but heavy compliance achieved through admittance control on industrial robots~\cite{8793657} and the use of soft skins with embedded force sensors~\cite{yan2024soft} have made robots more adaptable to close-contact interactions. However, despite these advancements, the performance of these systems has often fallen short of industry requirements. This highlights the need to shift the approach toward performance-oriented solutions. Instead of viewing safety as a limiting factor, the framework presented in this paper positions safety as a constraint within performance optimization, as suggested in~\cite{VILLANI2018248}, ensuring both high safety standards and enhanced performance in industrial pHRI.
