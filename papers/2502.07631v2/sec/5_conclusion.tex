\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we show that by decoupling semantic and motion learning, we eliminate the negative transfer that \gls{E2E} training typically imposes on object and map perception. 
Besides, we leverage the correlation between semantic tasks to promote positive transfer during \gls{E2E} training. We validate that our improvements in perception and prediction directly enhance planning performance, achieving SOTA collision rates.
