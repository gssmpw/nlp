            \caption{Neuron level analysis of safety and utility overlapping in each layer of Llama3-8B. Following~\citet{wei}, we calculate the Jaccard Index between the top 20\% safety-related neurons and the top 20\% math (or code) utility-related neurons to assess potential conflicts at the neuron level across different models. \textbf{Higher} Jaccard index signifies \textbf{greater} overlap between safety and utility neurons. Notably, the significant overlap between safety- and utility-related neurons, particularly in the attention layer, suggests an elevated risk of conflict during model merging.}
