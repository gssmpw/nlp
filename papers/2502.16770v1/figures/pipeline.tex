            \caption{Overview of LED-Merging. In \textbf{location}, we identify important safety and utility neurons in base and fine-tuned models, respectively. We use different colors to represent the various neurons. After location, in \textbf{election}, we select neurons scoring highly in both two models in the election step as safety and utility-related neurons in task vectors. Subsequently, we \textbf{disjoint} these important neurons and construct masks, in which isolating the duplicated important neurons across all task vectors. Finally, we combine them into one merged task vector.}
