\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented \frameworkName a new type of online video game cheating methodology which employees virtualization and introspection to bypass modern anti-cheats. We tested the effectiveness of the attack on three different games including Fortnite, each of them running in between them five different anti-cheat systems. We evaluated the performance of our cheats for every game and reported negligible impact on the games' performance. 

Cheating in online video games remains an open problem despite the already proposed solutions. Our methodology can provide cheaters an unfair advantage over other players while remaining undetected. While this kind of cheat is more complex to setup, it could enable cheat developers to build cheat-enabled cloud gaming services (CGaS). We hope that this paper can raise awareness among game and anti-cheat developers and foster the development of new techniques to identify these kinds of cheats, as we believe they will become more prevalent as the usage of cloud gaming becomes more common among players.
