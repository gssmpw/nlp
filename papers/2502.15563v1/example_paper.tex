% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2025
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\caption{\textbf{Summary of contributions}. (1) New concept: We propose a new framework for the resource-efficient creation of domain-specific VLM benchmarks. It is based on the concept of task augmentation designed for creating multiple tasks from a single existing task using metadata annotations from multiple sources (humans, pre-defined heuristics, models). (2) 7 new datasets: We apply our framework to generate seven domain-specific VLM benchmarks with highly reliable reference data. As a unique feature compared to existing benchmarks, we quantify the ambiguity of each question for each image by acquiring human answers from a total of six raters. (3) New insights: We apply our framework to a total of 22 open and frontier closed models to demonstrate the benefit of task augmentation and to shed light on current VLM capabilities.}

\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper advances Machine Learning by enabling researchers to benchmark with their own data on a minimal budget. All human annotations were sourced from a reputable company following ethical guidelines.
