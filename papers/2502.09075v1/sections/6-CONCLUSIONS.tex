\section{Conclusion and future work}

We proposed a two-stage PTZ camera calibration method that can efficiently and accurately estimate camera parameters for arbitrary viewpoints. The introduced PTZ-IBA algorithm provides the underlying theoretical support, thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our robustness and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on various real and synthetic datasets. 
In the future, we plan to support the calibration of PTZ cameras with rotation center offset. Additionally, we intend to decrease annotation requirements even more and explore the viability of adopting an unsupervised approach.
