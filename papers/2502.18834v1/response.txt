To date, there remains a significant gap in the availability of a comprehensive dataset of financial time series. Existing studies typically focus on specific slices of historical stock data for their experiments. For example, **Brownlee, "ALSP-TF: An Adaptive Learning System for Predictive Time Series Forecasting"**, **LSTM-BTC, "ADB-TRM: A Deep Learning Approach to Bitcoin Trading and Risk Management"**, and **Kim et al., "CI-STHPAN: Capitalist Intelligence Stock Trends History, Price Action Network"** utilize New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ stocks for the period from 2013 to 2017. Meanwhile, **LSTM-BTC, "MASTER: A Multi-Scale Attention-Based Time Series Forecasting Model"**, **Kim et al., "FactorVAE: Factorization of Variational Autoencoders for Financial Time Series"**, **Zhang and Zhang, "LARA: Latent Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection in Financial Time Series"**, and **Chen et al., "RSAP-DFM: Risk-Sensitive Attention-based Prediction Model for Daily Financial Market"** select data from the Chinese A-share market, but with distinct temporal ranges: **LSTM-BTC, MASTER** covers 2008 to 2022, **Kim et al., FactorVAE** covers 2010 to 2020, and both **Zhang and Zhang, LARA** and **Chen et al., RSAP-DFM** cover 2008 to 2020. Similarly, **Wang et al., "LSR-iGRU: Long Short-Term Recurrent Networks with Improved GRU for Financial Time Series Prediction"**, **LSTM-BTC, "FinMamba: A Deep Learning Model for Financial Time Series Forecasting and Risk Analysis"**, and **Kim et al., "MCI-GRU: Multi-Step Prediction of Cryptocurrency Prices using Gated Recurrent Units"**, as well as **Wang et al., "THGNN: Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Financial Time Series Forecasting"**, focus on stocks from both the Chinese and U.S. markets, with time slices ranging from 2018 to 2023 and 2016 to 2021, respectively. **LSTM-BTC, Qlib** provides a wealth of raw data and factor data, from which users can extract the segments they need.
The varying time horizons of these data slices pose a challenge to consistent and fair evaluations.
Furthermore, after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA)____ for dimensionality reduction, we visualized \name and other time-sliced stocks as a hexbin plot in \cref{fig:hexbin}. The results indicate that \name covers the most cells, suggesting that reliance on sliced historical data lacks diversity. In contrast, \name offers more comprehensive coverage, thus effectively capturing the complex distribution of financial time series.
