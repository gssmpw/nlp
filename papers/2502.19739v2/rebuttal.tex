We thank the reviewers for the valuable comments, noting our work ``novel", ``solid'', ``valuable'', ``well-written'', ``easy to understand'', ``simple but well-evaluated'', and ``address a difficult problem'', with ``high quality'', ``noticeable'', ``sufficient'' and ``strictly better'' results.

%and recognition of our novel problem setup (\Rone, \Rtwo, \Rthree), well paper writing (\Rone, \Rtwo), novel method (\Rone, \Rtwo), comprehensive experiments (\Rone, \Rtwo), and SOTA performance (\Rone, \Rtwo). 



\noindent \textbf{Q1.~[\Rone, \Rtwo, \Rfour] Real-time performance.} 
Our model achieves 45 FPS rendering performance on our mobile device after quantization-aware-training. QAT is not included in the paper as our focus is the layered representation. Hardware configuration will be provided. % We will include it in the revised version.

% Our universal mesh avatars achieve 4 ms rendering time (25 FPS) on our mobile device, comparable to PiCA. We will elaborate with detailed hardware configuration.


% \noindent \textbf{Q10.~[\Rtwo] Modeling as mesh not strand.} We opted for this approach to ensure real-time rendering capabilities essential for practical applications. While strand-based models offer more detail, they require higher computational power, limiting their accessibility.

\noindent \textbf{Q2.~[\Rtwo, \Rthree] Strand-based methods} cannot be easily generated by hypernetworks, making it computationally demanding and not meet the compactness requirements for mobile VR applications. In contrast, mesh representation used in our approach are better supported by modern devices, thus providing a more efficient solution for dynamic avatar modeling.

% face limitations in producing strands efficiently using hypernetworks, are computationally expensive, and lack the compactness required for real-world VR applications. By using a disentangled mesh representation, our method achieves better long-term temporal tracking and offers a more efficient solution for dynamic avatar modeling.



\noindent \textbf{Q3.~[\Rone] Inconsistent hair segments.} 
% We refine the hair segmentation mask through erosion and dilation, creating a mask that extends beyond exact boundaries to account for inaccuracies. This enhanced mask weights the hair segmentation loss, ensuring the model prioritizes identified hair areas and addresses common issues like stray hairs. We also implement a dynamic weight decay, starting with a lower weight and gradually increasing to 1.

% To address the inaccuracy, hair mask is refined with erosion and dilation. 
% Besides, the segmentation loss is weighted dynamically with weights gradually increased from 0.01 to 1.

\noindent \textbf{Q4.~[\Rone] Dehairing loss} $\mathcal{L}_{\text{dehair}}$ 
%is strategically utilized during the early training iterations to ensure geometric consistency between the predicted bald head geometry $\mathbf{G}^\text{face}$, and a reference geometry $\mathbf{G}^\text{ref}$ derived from the dehairing process described in Sec.~3.1. This is expressed as $\mathcal{L}_{\text{dehair}} = \text{MSE}(\mathbf{G}^\text{ref} - \mathbf{G}^\text{face})$ and will be elaborated.

This is expressed as $\mathcal{L}_{\text{dehair}} = \text{MSE}(\mathbf{G}^\text{ref} - \mathbf{G}^\text{face})$ and will be elaborated.

\noindent \textbf{Q5.~[\Rone] The absence of identity biases in $\mathcal D _\text{p}$} aims to enhance efficiency during runtime deployment, not necessarily for ``real-time'' purposes. Our model uses a single shader with the learned MLP weights in $\mathcal D _\text{p}$ for runtime, eliminating the need to manage multiple shaders for multiple users. We agree that the geometry decoder already takes the per-identity bias into account, and is indeed a reason for the absence of identity bias here. We will make it clear.

% The absence of identity biases in $\mathcal D _\text{p}$} aims to enhance efficiency during runtime deployment, not necessarily for ``real-time'' purposes. This means we do not need to customize MLP weights in $\mathcal D _\text{p}$ for each user during testing. We agree that the geometry decoder already takes the per-identity bias into account, and is indeed a reason for the absence of identity bias here. We will make it clear.

\noindent \textbf{Q6.~[\Rone] Geometric coherence.} While this separation provides greater detail and flexibility, we do not claim it ensures perfect coherence in extreme deformations or at skin-hair intersections without additional measures. We rely on the described losses with image loss being the most reliable and accurate regularizer. The intended meaning of geometric coherence refers to synchronizing deformations through a unified latent encoder. We will clarify this.

\noindent \textbf{Q7.~[\Rone] Notation.} $\Theta^{g,\text{hair}}_\text{id}$/$\Theta^{e,\text{hair}}_\text{id}$ are per-id bias for hair geometry/appearance decoders, with $\Phi_g^{\text{hair}}$/$\Phi_e^{\text{hair}}$ being their network parameters.

\noindent \textbf{Q8.~[\Rone] Relighting.} Adopting the URavatar formulation to enable relighting is feasible and is in our plan.

% \noindent \textbf{Q11.~[\Rone] Typo.} Corrected. Thank you.



\noindent \textbf{Q9.~[\Rtwo] Dataset.} Our model demonstrates notable cross-identity generalization with 76 identities. Scaling the dataset with greater diversity is on our agenda and will further enhance the model's generalizability.

\noindent \textbf{Q10.~[\Rtwo] Contribution 3} underscores our model’s advancements in dynamic hair-face interactions during head pose changes, expression transfers, and hairstyle variations. Comprehensive experiments on unseen subjects in zero-shot driving scenarios demonstrate LUCAS's adaptability and practicality, setting it apart from previous methods.

\noindent \textbf{Q11.~[\Rtwo, \Rthree]} \textbf{Sec.~3.1} will be elaborated.

\noindent \textbf{Q12.~[\Rthree]} Our \textbf{motivation for using mesh-based representations} is rooted in their proven efficiency and practicality, as demonstrated by models like PiCA. Meshes are inherently compact, computational memory efficient, and well-suited for DSP/GPU hardware, making them widely adopted in the real-world VR applications. Building upon PiCA, our method enhances geometry, dynamic hair-face interactions, and cross-id generalization ability without compromising efficiency, unlike computationally intensive Gaussian and strand-based methods.

\noindent \textbf{Q13.~[\Rthree] Narrative of Sec.3.4.} This section highlights how our layered mesh design improves anchor geometry for precise and visually appealing Gaussian renderings. We will revise to better articulate its role and benefits.

\noindent \textbf{Q14.~[\Rthree] Zero-shot driving} refers to transferring expressions $z$ from a trained identity to unseen identities without requiring retraining.
% Specifically, for trained identities ABC, we might use expression code $z$ from A to animate B and C. For an unseen identity D, $z$ from A would similarly drive D without D's data being included in the training set. 
% for trained identities ABC and unseen identity D, we use expression code $z$ from A to drive D

% This demonstrates our model’s capability to generalize to new subjects without requiring retraining.

\noindent \textbf{Q15.~[\Rthree] Hair reconstruction quality} is benchmarked below by computing metrics on the hair regions.

\noindent \textbf{Q16.~[\Rthree] Visualization of dynamic interaction.} Please refer to the \textit{suppl.} video for the animation results.

\noindent \textbf{Q17.~[\Rthree] Gaussian Head Avatar} is a personalized model requiring 3DMM coefficient transfer for expression transfer. In contrast, LUCAS is a universal model capable of generalizing to unseen identities, making it more versatile for dynamic, real-world applications. 

\noindent \textbf{Q18.~[\Rthree] Mesh resolution.} 
% Unlike the original PiCA, our approach uses the same resolution mesh vertices (65K) for both input and output. We will clarify this.

% We will clarify this.

\noindent \textbf{Q19.~[\Rthree] Hair UV} is a 256$^2$ map defined as
$\mathbf{G^\text{hair}} = \mathbf{g}_\text{mean}^\text{hair} + d^\text{hair} + \mathbf{g}^\text{hair}$, where $\mathbf{g}^\text{hair}_\text{mean}$ is a mean hair geometry, $f^\text{hair}$ and $d^\text{hair}$ are a per-identity positional encoding and geometry displacement, respectively. 


\noindent \textbf{Q20.~[\Rfour] Limitation.} Our method represents a remarkable improvement over current techniques, particularly in capturing finer details, dynamic interactions, and cross-id generalization ability. However, we acknowledge its limitations, including dependency on training data, challenges with extremely complex hairstyles, lack of physics-based priors and dynamic relighting capabilities. We are committed to addressing these issues in future work.

\noindent \textbf{Q21. Related works} on approaches using hair segmentation~[\textbf{\Rone}], point-based and one-shot models~[\textbf{\Rthree}] and MeGA~[\textbf{\Rfour}] will be discussed.
