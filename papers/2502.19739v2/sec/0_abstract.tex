% We present LUCAS, a novel 3D universal head avatar representation that disentangles the face and hair geometry and appearance into a layered structure. Unlike previous single-mesh avatars, LUCAS's compositional design enables more accurate hair dynamics and alignment during head movements and expressions.
%LUCAS introduces a Universal Layered Prior Model that powers both the face and hair branches, enabling cross-identity generalization while maintaining real-time performance. Our model can further integrate with Gaussian splatting to achieve higher visual fidelity at the cost of computational efficiency, particularly beneficial for complex hairstyles.
%Experiments demonstrate that LUCAS outperforms previous single-mesh and Gaussian-based avatar models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including on held-out subjects in zero-shot driving scenarios. LUCAS exhibits enhanced dynamic performance in handling head pose changes, expression transfer, and hairstyle variations, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D head avatar reconstruction with flexible quality-performance trade-offs.

% Chen's version
Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction faces critical challenges in modeling dynamic face-hair interactions and achieving cross-identity generalization, particularly during expressions and head movements.
We present LUCAS, a novel Universal Prior Model (UPM) for codec avatar modeling that disentangles face and hair through a layered representation. Unlike previous UPMs that treat hair as an integral part of the head, our approach separates the modeling of the hairless head and hair into distinct branches.
LUCAS is the first to introduce a mesh-based UPM, facilitating real-time rendering on devices.
Our layered representation also improves the anchor geometry for precise and visually appealing Gaussian renderings. Experimental results indicate that LUCAS outperforms existing single-mesh and Gaussian-based avatar models in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, including evaluations on held-out subjects in zero-shot driving scenarios. LUCAS demonstrates superior dynamic performance in managing head pose changes, expression transfer, and hairstyle variations, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D head avatar reconstruction. \href{https://lsn33096.github.io/LUCAS/}{Project page: https://lsn33096.github.io/LUCAS/.}
