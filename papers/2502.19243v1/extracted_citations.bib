	abstract = {We investigate the determinants of distributed solar technology adoption at the village and household level in India. Using spatial data on insolation, census records, and original surveys, we show that remote and poor but large villages with abundant sunshine have led the wave of solar technology adoption as an alternative to grid electricity. At the household level, however, wealth and financial access are positively associated with solar technology adoption, a result that holds for both solar lanterns and home systems. Moreover, remote villages are more likely to see solar technology adoption when households have access to finance through banks. We also find that the use of household solar technology is strongly associated with a household's subjective satisfaction with domestic lighting. These results demonstrate that understanding solar technology adoption requires considering both community and household characteristics. They also underscore the importance of financial access as a precondition for using distributed solar power as an alternative to grid connectivity.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the spatio-temporal patterns of solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption, solving the ongoing need to inform the management of the distribution networks with spatially explicit estimations of PV adoption rates. This work addresses a key limitation of agent-based models (ABMs) that use rule or equation-based decision-making. It achieves this by adopting an aggregated definition of the agents using artificial neural networks (ANN) as the criteria for decision-making. This novel approachdraws from both ABM and Spatial Regression methods. It incorporates spatial and temporal dependencies as well as social dynamics that drive the adoption of PVs. Consequently, the model yields a more realistic characterisation of decision-making whilst reflecting individual behaviours for each location following the real-world layout. The model utilises the ANN’s approximation capabilities to generate knowledge from historical PV data, as well as adapt to changes in data trends. First, an autoregressive model is developed. This is then extended to capture the population heterogeneity by introducing socioeconomic variables into the agent’s decision-making. Both models are empirically validated and benchmarked against the Bass Model. Results suggest that the model can account for the spatio-temporal and social dynamics that drive the adoption process and that the ABM and ANN integrated model has superior adaptive capabilities to the Bass model. The proposed model can estimate spatio-temporally explicit forecasts for up to five months with an accuracy of 80\%. In line with the literature, results suggest that income, electricity consumption and the average household size variables yield the best results.},

	abstract = {Setting solar photovoltaic capacity targets and implementing supportive policies is a widespread strategy among nations aiming to achieve decarbonisation goals. However, policy implementation without a thorough understanding of the intricate relationship between social, economic, and land-use factors and solar photovoltaic deployment can lead to unintended consequences, including over- or underdeployment and failure to reach targets. To address this challenge, an investigation was conducted into the relationship between 36 factors and solar photovoltaic deployment across 143 countries from 2001 to 2020 using correlation analysis and principal component analysis. From these factors, five key variables were identified that collectively explain 79\% of the year-to-year variation in photovoltaic capacity. Using these variables, a neural network model was constructed, enabling the estimation of capacity additions by country with an error of less than 10\%. Additionally, a solar photovoltaic deployment index was developed, serving as a benchmark for comparing a country’s actual historical photovoltaic deployment to similar nations. Furthermore, the model’s utility in evaluating the impact of solar photovoltaic policies was explored. Through three distinct use cases—forecasting solar photovoltaic capacity additions, developing a solar photovoltaic deployment index, and assessing the impact of solar photovoltaic policies—the model emerges as a potentially powerful tool for governments and policy makers to assess solar photovoltaic deployment effectively and formulate strategies to promote sustainable solar energy growth.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) panels offer significant potential for contributing to the UK's energy policy goals relating to decarbonisation of the energy system, security of supply and affordability. The substantive drop in the cost of panels since 2007, coupled with the introduction of the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Scheme in 2010, has resulted in a rapid increase in installation of PV panels in the UK, from 26.5MWp in 2009 to over 5GW by the end of 2014. Yet there has been no comprehensive analysis of the determinants of PV deployment in the UK. This paper addresses this gap by employing spatial econometrics methods to a recently available data set at a fine geographical detail. Following a traditional regression analysis, a general to specific approach has been adopted where spatial variations in the relationships have been examined utilising the spatial Durbin model using the cross-sectional data relating to the UK NUTS level 3 data. Empirical results indicate that demand for electricity, population density, pollution levels, education level of households and housing types are among the factors that affect PV uptake in a region. Moreover Lagrange Multiplier test results indicate that the spatial Durbin model may be properly applied to describe the PV uptake relationship in the UK as there are significant regional spillover effects.},

	abstract = {Energy is defined as the ability to do work and can be converted through variety of processes and used in various applications. Primary energy sources such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, wood, solar etc. can be directly used without being converted to another type of energy. Secondary energy sources, of which electricity and fuel oil are typical examples, are form of energies that are transformed from primary energy sources and are more expensive because of the conversion process and the losses associated. Starting especially with the industrial revolution, meeting the energy demand has been one of the most important concerns of countries. Starting from 1970’s, enforced in particular by the energy crisis, humankind have turned to renewable energy since the production of petroleum, which was the main energy source then, faced an unprecedented shortage and thus increased prices. As one of the main renewable energy sources, solar energy has made a rapid progress in the past decades, with variety of technologies, such as photovoltaics, thermal converters, passive architectural systems and so on. Photovoltaics, which convert solar energy directly into electrical energy, presently play an important role in energy policies of countries. As a developing country, Turkey is experiencing a rapid annual growth of energy demand, including electricity. However, Turkey is extensively dependent on the imported fossil fuel for meeting the increasing demand, with a limited domestic reserve. Therefore, the present energy policy of Turkey is based on cutting down the amount of fossil fuel imported. Solar and wind energies are two of the main candidates to play a major role in cutting down the amount of fossil fuel presently used. In the present study, Turkey’s solar energy potential and photovoltaic development are analyzed. With a relatively high solar energy potential, Turkey’s installed photovoltaic capacity and photovoltaic electricity generation are analyzed in comparison to 5 selected European Union countries (EU-5). In addition, the ratio of installed photovoltaic capacity per capita to solar potential has been analyzed as a function of gross national product. The results indicate that the installed capacities and power generation of countries are not in direct proportion with their solar energy potential. It has also been concluded that Turkey's photovoltaic development is not sufficient in comparison to the EU-5 countries and effective incentive policies are required to be implemented rapidly in order for Turkey to reach their level.},

This study contributes to navigating this post-subsidy uncertainty by identifying the factors associated with the uptake of a domestic-scale technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), in England and Wales, and exploring its spatial distribution. It uses FiT installation data from Ofgem, available at a fine-grained spatial resolution for the period April 2010–September 2019, to test the effect of social, housing, political, energy and environmental factors. It is shown that population demographics, housing density, size, type and tenure, and energy consumption practices are important factors influencing the uptake of domestic PV at the local level. The South West and East of England are identified as regions of unexpectedly high uptake, controlling for the other factors. This is, at the time of writing, the first attempt to model PV uptake at a fine-grained spatial level across England and Wales.},

	abstract = {The installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on residential units is one of the measures that countries around the world are implementing to mitigate the impact of the global warming crisis. Australia has become the world leader in the solar PV sector since it introduced its solar-related program in 2001. The adoption was initially spurred by government-driven incentive schemes providing opportunities for early adopters to financially capitalise on the technology through feed-in tariffs. Over time, the growth was further propelled by the phenomenon often referred to as the neighbourhood effects. This paper conducted a statistical analysis to investigate the demographic composition, at postal area (POA) resolution, associated with the PV uptake in Australia. To detect the presence of the neighbourhood effects, a formula was developed to simplify its quantification, drawing analogies to kinematics. The results of the regression analysis reveal that gender, share of certain age groups, land area, and dwellings with a vehicle do not correlate with adoption. On the other hand, other variables such as marital status, weekly household income, number of bedrooms, population and dwellings densities, do have influences, positively and negatively. Furthermore, the “accelerated rate” determines a positive impact of the neighbourhood effects in the range of 15 to 20 additional PV units installed per year per POA. A publicly accessible tool was developed with this study that can aid policymakers in exploring the socio-economic indicators identified in this analysis as predictors of the diffusion of the technology for effective policies, regulations, and schemes.},

This article empirically examines the diffusion of an important renewable energy technology: residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Using detailed data on PV installations in Connecticut, we identify the spatial patterns of diffusion, which indicate considerable clustering of adoptions. This clustering does not simply follow the spatial distribution of income or population. We find that smaller centers contribute to adoption more than larger urban areas, in a wave-like centrifugal pattern. Our empirical estimation demonstrates a strong relationship between adoption and the number of nearby previously installed systems as well as built environment and policy variables. The effect of nearby systems diminishes with distance and time, suggesting a spatial neighbor effect conveyed through social interaction and visibility. These results disentangle the process of diffusion of PV systems and provide guidance to stakeholders in the solar market.},

Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs1–9. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (−75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland. Our inventory could aid PV delivery aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.},

First, to accurately predict China’s solar PV installed capacity, this paper proposes a multi-factor installed capacity prediction model based on bidirectional long short-term memory-grey relation analysis. The results show that, the MAPE value of the GRA-LSTM combined model established in this paper is 5.995, compared with the prediction results of other models, the prediction accuracy of the GRA-BiLSTM model is higher. Second, the BiLSTM model is used to forecast China’s installed solar PV capacity from 2020 to 2035. The forecast results show that China’s newly installed solar PV capacity will continue to grow and reach 2833GW in 2035. Third, the employment number in China’s solar PV industry during 2020–2035 is predicted by the employment factors (EF) method. The results show that the energy transition in China during 2020–2035 will have a positive impact on the future stability and growth of the labor market in the solar PV industry. Overall, an accurate forecast of solar PV installed capacity can provide effective decision support for planning electric power development strategy and formulating employment policy of solar PV industry.},

Using two waves of Eurobarometer surveys, we find a positive local average treatment effect for 7 of the 8 pro-environmental behaviors.

Panel data was drawn from the World Bank and OECD databases for 20 OECD countries for the period 1997–2019. Rigorous analytic procedures were employed to better address the methodological issues of existing literature for the analysis of panel data. In this regard, cross-section dependency and heterogeneous structure of the panel data were considered. Accordingly, Gengenbach, Urbain, and Westerlund's panel cointegration test was employed to examine whether there was a long-term relationship between the variables. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Mean Group Dynamic Least Squares were employed to test the robust impact of independent variables on the dependent variable in the long run. Lastly, Dumitrescu \& Hurlin's Granger non-causality test was conducted to determine the direction of the relationship between variables. Findings showed that while lower-level education and per capita GDP significantly increased CO2 emissions, higher education significantly decreased it. The CO2 emissions and per capita GDP posed significant negative influences on renewable energy. On the contrary, while both levels of education had positive influences, higher education appeared to be the most influential variable on renewable energy. The causality analyses yielded bidirectional causality relationships between CO2 emissions and renewable energy, low-level education, and higher education; conversely, unidirectional causality relationships between CO2 emissions and per capita GDP. Collectively, the study highlighted the significance of a highly educated workforce for promoting and creating a sustained environment by reducing CO2 emissions and increasing renewable energy utilization.},

	abstract = {Using microdata from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2010), this paper investigates whether there are green returns to education in China, where educational attainment promotes pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. We establish causality by exploiting the exogenous variation induced by the implementation of the Compulsory Schooling Law (CSL) in China. We find evidence that educational attainment is associated with higher levels of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and these estimates are robust to various robustness checks. Further analysis reveals that the acquisition of environmental knowledge is the channel that drives the effect of education on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Finally, the effects of education are heterogeneous across individuals.},

	abstract = {Globally, deployment of grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) has increased dramatically in recent years. The UK has seen rapid uptake reaching over 500,000 installations totalling 2.8 GWp by 2013. PV can be installed in different market segments (domestic rooftop, non-domestic rooftop and ground-mounted “solar-farms”) covering a broad range of system sizes in a high number of locations. It is important to gain detailed understanding of what grid-connected PV deployment looks like (e.g., how it deployed across different geographic areas and market segments), and identify the major drivers behind it. This paper answers these questions by developing a novel geographical information systems (GIS)-framework—the United Kingdom Photovoltaics Database (UKPVD)—to analyze temporal and spatial PV deployment trends at high resolution across all market segments. Results show how PV deployment changed over time with the evolution of governmental PV policy support. Then spatial trends as function of local irradiation, rurality (as a proxy of building and population density) and building footprint (as a proxy for roof-area) are analyzed. We find in all market segments, PV deployment is strongly correlated with the level of policy support. Furthermore, all markets show a preference to deploy in rural areas and those with higher irradiation. Finally, local clustering of PV in all market segments was observed, revealing that PV is not spread evenly across areas. This work reveals the complex nature of PV deployment, both spatially and by market segment, reinforcing the need capture this through mapping.},
