   abstract = {A key element in solving real-life data science problems is selecting the types of models to use. Tree ensemble models (such as XGBoost) are usually recommended for classification and regression problems with tabular data. However, several deep learning models for tabular data have recently been proposed, claiming to outperform XGBoost for some use cases. This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to XGBoost on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that XGBoost outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that XGBoost requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and XGBoost performs better on these datasets than XGBoost alone.},

   abstract = {The need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in escalating interest in renewable energy generation. Yet few countries have seriously tested household potential to produce energy from PV panels. Propelled by mandatory EU targets for renewable energy, and constrained with limited territory, the Government of Malta launched a subsidy scheme with a view to encouraging PV installation by households. The scheme reached the desired adoption levels within a very short period of time. The study takes an entire-country dimension to assess the determinants of household investment in PV panels. A unique dataset is specifically constructed for this study. We find that the prevalence of younger households, higher incomes, dwelling ownership and unshared roof space results in higher rates of uptake. Neither higher educational levels nor the participation in other environmental schemes (recycling) contribute any explanatory power to uptake of PV panels. Pro-government sentiment (captured by voting outcomes) significantly and positively influences the take-up of the grant and installation of PV panels. We conclude by identifying some pointers for policy makers interested in harvesting the potential of households.},

abstract = {The conventional model of energy production and consumption has come under severe scrutiny. Concerns related to climate change, increased energy needs and issues surrounding conventional sources of energy generation have highlighted a need to adopt sustainable means of energy generation. Renewable energy sources are believed to have the potential to meet rising energy needs in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Solar energy is particularly interesting in this respect as it has the potential to be used at commercial as well as household level; however, to this end, its contribution to global energy supply has remained limited. A number of studies have explored factors influencing the adoption of solar photovoltaics (PV) at the household level and proposed measures to foster its development. This paper aims to systematically review and analyse the state of solar PV adoption by exploring “What are the key factors influencing the adoption of solar PV at household level?”. From 146 studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, the study identifies 127 unique factors influencing adoption behaviour, and groups these into eight categories, namely economic, environmental, social, personal, demographic, technical, regulatory and market-related factors. Based on the findings, this paper proposes guidelines for practitioners, identifies knowledge gaps and suggests directions for future research to strengthen the scholarship in this domain.}

However, the determination of the decision to accept renewable energy technologies still lacks a clear understanding. Estimating a cross-sectional survey, this study analyzed the impact of the ethnic-caste factor on the adoption of solar power technology in Nepal. The results reveal that Dalit and Madhesi households that are the lowest caste and marginalized ethnic group within Nepal society were about 36.3\% and 79.8\% less likely to adopt solar power technology compared to the high caste households, respectively. Using propensity score matching to deal with bias and inconsistent estimates, the results confirm the impact of the ethnic-caste system on solar power technology adoption. The findings reflect that aside from the economic variables that play a role in determining the adoption of renewable energy technologies, social and cultural factors are also significant. The main policy implication is that policymakers should consider a holistic approach to renewable energy policy design, especially the socio-cultural factor priorities, to increase the opportunities for government policy access among marginalized groups.},

In this work, the potential solar land requirements and related land use change emissions are computed for the EU, India, Japan and South Korea. A novel method is developed within an integrated assessment model which links socioeconomic, energy, land and climate systems. At 25–80\% penetration in the electricity mix of those regions by 2050, we find that solar energy may occupy 0.5–5\% of total land. The resulting land cover changes, including indirect effects, will likely cause a net release of carbon ranging from 0 to 50 gCO2/kWh, depending on the region, scale of expansion, solar technology efficiency and land management practices in solar parks. Hence, a coordinated planning and regulation of new solar energy infrastructures should be enforced to avoid a significant increase in their life cycle emissions through terrestrial carbon losses.},

Photovoltaic installations contribute to more sustainable solutions to satisfying energy requirements, however, they also require land. To address this dilemma, agrivoltaics has been proposed, combining energy and agricultural production on the same area. Our objectives were to review and synthesise the current agronomic knowledge on agrivoltaics and its future development possibilities. A systematic literature search was conducted in Web of Science on 17 December 2022, resulting in 54 articles that met the inclusion criteria and concentrated primarily on food production. Most studies focused on combining electricity generation with crop production. Vegetables, especially lettuce and tomato, were the focus of many papers. The success of a crop under an agrivoltaic system depends on many factors, yet mainly on location and season. Additionally, even light-demanding crops such as maize could be grown under certain conditions. Therefore, we propose to define an optimal daily light integral for each species, rather than a shade level. Given climate change, agrivoltaics may reduce inter-annual yield fluctuation by buffering the negative effects of both frost and high temperatures on crops, as well as reducing water consumption. Future research should focus mainly on berries and on plants whose production can be affected by high temperatures. Experiments on larger areas, over several years, and with solar panels allowing a separation of the light spectrum are needed to promote development of agrivoltaics without affecting crop yields.},

Innovative agrivoltaic systems that combine agriculture and solar energy production is one set of the solutions to reduce these emissions. While circularity is a pressing issue in agriculture and landscape experience in solar energy production, these issues have received little attention in relationship to agrivoltaics. This study examines aspects of circularity and landscape experience in built agrivoltaic projects reported in scientific literature and recently constructed agrivoltaic projects in the Netherlands. Understanding circularity and landscape experience in agrivoltaics contributes to enabling agriculture transitions and increasing public acceptance. Peer-reviewed literature was used to examine which aspects of circularity and landscape experience were addressed in 16 international agrivoltaics cases. Critical performance indicators were used for circularity and spatial properties for landscape experience. Furthermore, a systematic analysis of ten Dutch agrivoltaic cases was conducted by examining their visibility, accessibility, patch configuration and agricultural land-use beneath the agrivoltaic system. The results show that contribution to regional economy and vitality of the rural area is the most frequently mentioned circularity indicator, which is found in 82\% of the international cases and 60\% of the Dutch cases. Low visibility and low accessibility of agrivoltaic systems were found in the majority of Dutch agrivoltaic cases. Limited attention to landscape experience was found in the studied literature. This study provides valuable recommendations for research, farmers and policy makers for advancing transitions towards circular agrivoltaic power plants that pay more attention to landscape experience.},

Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs1–9. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (−75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland. Our inventory could aid PV delivery aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.},

However, large-scale deployment of solar farms requires vast land areas, potentially posing conflicts with other land uses. For example, solar farms have been built in forested regions or with a direct cost to forests (through deforestation). Here, we evaluated land-use conflicts between forests and established solar farms worldwide, and further assessed the energy efficiency effect of placing solar farms over forests using simulation results from seven state-of-the-art Earth system models. Our results, based on remote sensing analysis, showed that 6320 solar farms (9.14\%) exhibit land-use conflicts with forests, accounting for 4.9\% of the total solar farm area. The capacity factor (CF) of solar farms was found to decrease with increasing forest coverage because of enhanced cloud formation and reduced solar radiation. Even though deforestation was shown to be able to increase the local CF, in deforestation areas CF was still found to be lower than over open land (cropland or grassland). Moreover, the effect of a significantly increased CF following deforestation was found to take about 36 years to emerge, potentially exceeding the service lifetime of a solar farm (25–30 years). Our results highlight the fact that building solar farms over forests or through deforestation leads to no gain in energy efficiency compared to open land, and hence should only be carried out with great caution or completely discouraged.},

There is growing concern that large renewable energy installations will displace other land uses. Where should future solar power installations be placed to achieve the highest energy production and best use the limited land resource? The premise of this work is that the solar panel efficiency is a function of the location’s microclimate within which it is immersed. Current studies largely ignore many of the environmental factors that influence Photovoltaic (PV) panel function. A model for solar panel efficiency that incorporates the influence of the panel’s microclimate was derived from first principles and validated with field observations. Results confirm that the PV panel efficiency is influenced by the insolation, air temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. The model was applied globally using bias-corrected reanalysis datasets to map solar panel efficiency and the potential for solar power production given local conditions. Solar power production potential was classified based on local land cover classification, with croplands having the greatest median solar potential of approximately 28 W/m2. The potential for dual-use, agrivoltaic systems may alleviate land competition or other spatial constraints for solar power development, creating a significant opportunity for future energy sustainability. Global energy demand would be offset by solar production if even less than 1\% of cropland were converted to an agrivoltaic system.},

	abstract = {The majority of electricity and heat in Colorado comes from coal and natural gas; however, renewable energy sources will play an integral role in the state’s energy future. Colorado is the 11th windiest state and has more than 250 sunny days per year. The objectives of this research are to: 1) determine which landcover classes are affiliated with high wind and solar potential; and 2) identify areas that are suitable for wind and solar farms using multicriteria GIS modelling techniques. Renewable potential (NREL wind speed measurements at 50 m above the ground and NREL annual insolation data), landcover, population density, federal lands, and distance to roads, transmission lines, and cities were reclassified according to their suitability. Each was assigned weights based on their relative importance to one another. Superb wind classes are located in high alpine areas. Unfortunately, these areas are not suitable for large-scale wind farm development due to their inaccessibility and location within a sensitive ecosystem. Federal lands have low wind potential. According to the GIS model, ideal areas for wind farm development are located in northeastern Colorado. About 41 850 km2 of the state has model scores that are in the 90–100\% range. Although annual solar radiation varies slightly, inter-mountain areas receive the most insolation. As far as federal lands, Indian reservations have the greatest solar input. The GIS model indicates that ideal areas for solar development are located in northwestern Colorado and east of Denver. Only 191 km2 of the state had model scores that were in the 90–100\% range. These results suggest that the variables used in this analysis have more of an effect at eliminating non-suitable areas for large-scale solar farms; a greater area exists for suitable wind farms. However, given the statewide high insolation values with minimal variance, solar projects may be better suited for small-scale residential or commercial projects.},

The study showed that CLC2018 in general complied with the definitions. Nonconformities were mainly found for detailed and (in a Norwegian context) marginal classes. The classification can still be improved by complementing visual interpretation with classification based on the statistical profile of each polygon when detailed land use and land cover information is available. The use of auxiliary information at the polygon level can thus provide a better, thematically more accurate CLC dataset for use in European land monitoring.},

Nevertheless, the potential use of global LC products is often very limited by the lack of detailed accuracy information at regional to national level. This paper proposes a methodology for performing accuracy assessment of large-area LC products, which takes into account a number of factors arising from intrinsic characteristics of LC, such as thematic uncertainty that results from the partial overlap in legend definitions and lack of homogeneity within reference and classification data. The approach compares the LC pixel label not only with the dominant reference label but also with sub-dominant LC types within the extent of the sampling unit. The methodology was illustrated in Spain using four LC datasets (GlobCover, MODIS land cover (MODISLC), GLC2000 and CORINE). The variety of reference label data offered by a detailed national database, namely SIOSE, supported several different fuzzy agreement definitions in order to derive unbiased estimates of accuracy measures. CORINE followed by GLC2000 showed the highest accuracy scores, whereas GlobCover and MODISLC showed the lowest scores. Nevertheless, the fuzzy approach revealed that a great amount of disagreement in GlobCover and MODISLC datasets does not actually correspond to classification errors, but it can be associated to legend ambiguity and mixed coverage pixels.},

The remote sensing community has responded to this increased interest by improving data quality and methodologies for extracting land cover information. However, in addition to the advantages provided by satellite products, certain limitations exist that need to be objectively quantified and clearly communicated to users so that they can make informed decisions on whether and how land cover products should be used. Accuracy assessment is the procedure used to quantify product quality. Some aspects of accuracy assessment for evaluating four global land cover maps over Canada are discussed in this paper. Attempts are made to quantify limiting factors resulting from the coarse spatial resolution of data used for generating land cover information at regional and global levels. Sub-pixel fractional error matrices are introduced as a more appropriate way for assessing the accuracy of mixed pixels. For classification with coarse spatial resolution data, limitations of the classification method produce a maximum achievable accuracy defined as the average percent fraction of dominant land cover of all pixels in the mapped area. Relationships among spatial resolution, landscape heterogeneity and thematic resolution were studied and reported. Other factors that can affect accuracy, such as misregistration and legend conversion, are also discussed.},

However, their output variability remains a key problem for managing electricity systems, and the implications of multi-day to multi-year variability are still poorly understood. As other energy-using sectors are electrified, the shape and variability of electricity demand will also change. We develop an open framework for quantifying the impacts of weather on electricity supply and demand using the Renewables.ninja and DESSTINEE models. We demonstrate this using a case study of Britain using National Grid's Two Degrees scenario forwards to 2030. We find the British electricity system is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, with peak demand rising above 70 GW due to electric heating, and intermittent renewable output exceeding demand as early as 2021. Hourly ramp-rates widen by 50\% and year-to-year variability increases by 80\%, showing why future power system studies must consider multiple years of data, and the influence of weather on both supply and demand. Our framework is globally applicable, and allows detailed scenarios of hourly electricity supply and demand to be explored using only limited input data such as annual quantities from government scenarios or broader energy systems models.},

	abstract = {The measurement of near real-time national solar PV electricity output is an increasingly important component for managing electricity systems. PV systems embedded in the distribution network are problematic for system operators since their output is not directly visible through existing transmission system metering. Typically, national solar PV output is measured indirectly by upscaling the output from a sample of reference PV systems using an estimate of the national capacity. National PV output is then used, along with similar measurements for other embedded technologies such as wind, to train and validate electricity forecasts which ensure efficient electricity market operation. For the first time and using Great Britain as a case study, we investigate the accuracy of this general approach by characterising different sources of uncertainty in national PV output measurements. We find that the capacity error, at ±5\%, dominates the yield calculation error, at {\textless} ±1\% and leads to an overall error in GB solar PV output estimates of ±5.1\%. We conclude that solar PV measurements, and consequently national electricity demand forecasts, are currently limited by the state of national PV capacity registers. To make PV output measurements more accurate nations must develop a coherent and comprehensive approach to PV system registration, and output measurement methods must move away from using static solar PV capacity registers towards estimating an operational grid-connected solar PV capacity. This could involve moving away from capacity registers altogether and instead estimating capacity from other sources, for example, from network power flows, satellite imagery, or more likely, a combination of complementary datasets.},

The former is appropriate for data with a non-zero probability of zero observations and the latter is appropriate for data with a large dispersion. Our models will assume that we have data Yi, i = 1,…, N, with differing means μi, with common p and σ2. The Tp (μi, σ2) distribution can be characterised by Var(Yi) = σ2μip, i = 1,…, N. In general, we shall model the μi in terms of explanatory variates xij, i = 1,…, N, j= 1,…, m. We discuss how it is straightforward to construct the maximum likelihood estimates of p, μi, and σ 2 in a GLM oriented computer package.

Jørgensen and de Souza (1994) directly modelled the risk or expected cost of claims per insured unit, μ say. They observed that the dependence of the likelihood function on μ is as for a linear exponential family, so that modelling similar to that of generalized linear models is possible. In this paper we observe that, when modelling the cost of insurance claims, it is generally necessary to model the dispersion of the costs as well as their mean. In order to model the dispersion we use the framework of double generalized linear models. Modelling the dispersion increases the precision of the estimated tariffs. The use of double generalized linear models also allows us to handle the case where only the total cost of claims and not the number of claims has been recorded.},

First, local policies have a robust and significant impact on PV adoption. Second, there is a strong unconditional income effect, implying a Matthew effect in the subsidization of PVs. Our third finding is however that this income effect is largely driven by the fact that wealthier households are more likely to adopt because they tend to be higher users, are more frequent house owners, or own houses that are better suited for PV. In several extensions, we consider the determinants of the average size of installed PVs, and the differential impact of certain variables over time.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy systems are land intensive at local scales. Appropriate siting can help to mitigate the extent to which RE implementation compromises existing land-based economies and ecosystem services. As such, an integrated approach to land-use and energy planning, or land-energy planning, can help to ensure that RE technologies can be intensively implemented while minimizing negative impacts. Requisite to the development of such plans is (a) estimating total land availability on which technologies capable of supporting RE production functions after considering various socio-political, economic and ecological constraints; (b) identifying potential sources of conflict among multiple RE options; and (c) assessing the trade-offs associated with allocating this land toward one energy system and not another. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues at a regional-scale in the context of intensifying solar and bioenergy production. A methodology is developed from which to (a) locate land that is most likely to support both dedicated bioenergy feedstock and solar photovoltaic (PV) production in an area; (b) identify the point at which mutual land must be used in order to achieve their market potential; and (c) estimate and evaluate trade-offs associated with choosing one system over another at mutual land, in this case total potential electricity production and energy density (MWh/ha), in the context of regional energy needs and existing renewable electricity assets. Mutual land is located through GIS-based land-suitability modeling and map overlay techniques. Comparisons of production potential and land-use efficiency are made for a range of fixed-axis solar PV technologies against two short rotation woody coppice systems (poplar; willow) and two perennial grass systems (switch grass; miscanthus). Rooftop space is found to be sufficient to provide the land area required for solar PV to meet mid-day regional electricity requirements. If all mutual land in the region were allocated toward dedicated bioenergy crops instead of solar PV systems, (a) a 100 per cent renewable electricity system is within the limits of technical feasibility, even in the absence of large-scale storage systems; and/or (b) bioelectricity systems could provide back-up electricity for rooftop solar PV systems. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.},

This implies that the total amount of energy that can be obtained from these sources is limited. Next to this land is also in use for other purposes, of which food production is the most important. The area required for both food and energy supply depends on one hand on the consumption and on the other on the production per m2. Large differences in both production and consumption are observed globally. In this analysis distinction is made in land use requirements in so-called ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ circumstances. It is shown that in poor circumstances there is not enough land to fulfill the needs for food and energy when biomass is used as and energy source. In the rich situation prospects seems to be better, but in that case a large-scale transformation is required of woodlands and forests into intensive energy crop plantations. When PV-systems are used, the land area required for energy is reduced to a large extent. Their large-scale implementation is not possible on the short term due to technical problems. It is concluded that in the near future energy from biomass is the most likely renewable energy source, however, this source cannot fulfill all the energy requirements. For the more distant future energy from PV-systems seems to have the largest potentials, however, implementation requires large changes in present energy infrastructure.},

The figure emerging from our experimental survey shows 800 ha of arable lands sealed over the overall regional area in less than 7 years. So far, planning permissions to install solar modules are no longer acknowledged with ease on agricultural land and the subsidies have declined. Since solar technologies are a new promising land use frontier in agricultural land, a “standstill” may not be the best policy response. Land use policies should be able to respond to rapid changes, but this starts with rapid update of the effective land use practices. A positive feedback would come from open and volunteered geo-information.},

	abstract = {The article presents an ethnographic analysis of the planning and implementation of open-field photovoltaic (PV) plants on agricultural land in East Germany. Employing qualitative methods, the study delves into the multifaceted dynamics surrounding the expansion of Germany’s renewable energy sector, particularly in the considered 'energy state' of Brandenburg. Despite Germany’s commitment to renewable energy, the absence of a comprehensive legal framework governing conflicts over land use for solar energy installations poses significant challenges. Large-scale solar parks, designed for mass energy generation, often necessitate significant land acquisition, which sparks conflicts, particularly when the potential land serves agricultural purposes. The study underscores the shifting perception of land from socioecological wealth to a mere economic resource. The urgency of addressing ecological tipping points through energy transitions contrasts with the current scenario of unchecked investor and developer land acquisitions in pursuit of economic gains. This phenomenon, characterised as ‘invisible land-grabbing,’ has engendered a lack of trust in large-scale PV projects and potentially hampers solar PV approval processes. In conclusion, the article highlights the intricate interplay between energy transitions, land management, and socioecological well-being. It calls for a holistic approach to address the ethical, ecological, and economic implications of renewable energy expansion and land use.},

In an explorative study, I used Q methodology to inquire how affected stakeholders perceived the development of a photovoltaic solar park in Switzerland. This allowed me to identify possible ways to alleviate conflicts between designating land for agricultural use and renewable electricity development. The results show that while most identified worldviews among stakeholders agreed large roof surfaces should be prioritized for solar panels, remaining divergences explain tensions that threatened the realization of the solar park. Two perspectives were in conflict: on one side, actors defending a strict protection of agricultural land; on the other, actors who considered it appropriate to build solar panels on fields. The results also suggest that renewable energy expansion should preserve a balance between large-scale and small-scale photovoltaic power development to be socially acceptable amongst a broad spectrum of stakeholders.},

The reliability of this data is critical for the registry's usefulness, but few validation studies have been published. In this work we provide a review of existing literature that relies on data from the MaStR and thereby show the registry's importance. We then build a data and testing pipeline for relevant data of the registry, with a focus on the two aspects of facility's location and size. All test results are published online in a reproducible workflow.

An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production, as a basis for management of the electricity grids and trading on the energy market. We present and evaluate the regional PV power prediction system of University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH providing forecasts of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. The proposed approach is based on forecasts of the global model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF). It includes a post-processing procedure to derive optimised, site-specific irradiance forecasts and explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted irradiances to PV power. Finally, regional power forecasts are derived by up-scaling from a representative set of PV systems. The investigation of proper up-scaling is a special focus of this paper. We introduce a modified up-scaling approach, modelling the spatial distribution of the nominal power with a resolution of 1° × 1°. The operational PV power prediction system is evaluated in comparison to the modified up-scaling approach for the control areas of the two German transmission system operators ‘transpower’ and ‘50 Hertz’ for the period 2.7.2009–30.4.2010. rmse values of the operational forecasts are in the range of 4–5\% with respect to the nominal power for intra-day and day-ahead forecast horizons.

Regional PV power forecasts provide the basis for grid management and trading of PV power on the energy market. On the local scale, smart grid applications define a sector with increasing need for PV power forecasting. Here, we present and evaluate new and enhanced features of the regional PV power prediction system of the University of Oldenburg and Meteocontrol GmbH. The basic approach to predict regional PV power with an hourly resolution of up to 2 days ahead is based on global model forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and includes explicit physical modelling steps to convert the predicted solar irradiance into PV power. The proposed new, empirical approach aims at improving PV power predictions during periods of snow cover, where the original forecasts usually show a strong overestimation of the power production. The approach integrates measured PV power production data and additional meteorological forecast parameters. The new approach for power forecasting has been evaluated against the operational forecasts for the control area of the German transmission system operator ‘50Hertz Transmission GmbH’ for a 1-year period. The root mean square error (rmse) of the forecasts could be reduced from 4.9\% to 3.9\% for intra-day forecasts, and from 5.7\% to 4.6\% for day-ahead forecasts. The largest improvement was found during January, where the rmse could be reduced by more than half by applying the proposed algorithm for snow detection. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this work, a framework is proposed to forecast the aggregated power generation of a large fleet of small behind-the-meter solar PV sites. The outputs of those sites are not individually measured and thus, the aggregated output is “invisible” to power system operators. The proposed model uses the available historical power generation data of a very limited number of representative sites in the region, along with Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) inputs. This way, it is not necessary to constantly monitor all the sites in the region. Fuzzy Arithmetic Wavelet Neural Networks (FAWNN) are used to develop the forecasting engine, providing fuzzy confidence intervals for any desired level, so this methodology can handle various shapes of uncertainties in the input data. The proposed model is validated using actual PV generation data from 6673 sites in California. The simulation results have shown that the proposed approach is capable of forecasting BTM solar PV fleet despite using limited data. The root mean squared error for the forecasts was found to be 3\% for the California region.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the total photovoltaic (PV) power generated in the control areas of the transmission system operators (TSO) is an important step in the integration of the large amounts of PV energy into the German electricity supply system. A standard approach for evaluating the regional PV power generation from weather forecast consists in upscaling the forecast of a limited set of reference plants to the complete area. Previous studies shown that this method can lead to large errors when the set of reference plants has different characteristics or weather conditions than the set of unknown plants. In this paper, an alternative to the upscaling approach is proposed. In this method, called a probabilistic regional PV model, an average PV model with a very limited number of inputs (two module orientation angles) is used to calculate the power generation of the most frequent module orientation angles. The resulting power values are finally weighted according to their probability of occurrence to estimate the actual power generation. The implementation of this model thus only requires information on the location and peak capacity of the plant installed in a region and no PV plant measurement is necessary. The proposed method has been evaluated against the estimate of the total power generation provided by the German TSOs, which shows that an RMSE ranging from 4.2 to 4.9\% can be obtained with this method using on IFS meteorological forecast. The regional power forecasted with the probabilistic approach was also compared to the day-ahead forecast disseminated by the TSO. This analysis shows that the forecast evaluated with the proposed approach has an RMSE less than 0.5\% higher than the reference forecasts. This is considered a promising result given that the forecast evaluated with the probabilistic model is based on one single weather model and that – at the exception of the model calibration - no statistical post-processing method is used to optimize its performance.},

	doi = {10.5194/asr-15-51-2018},
	abstract = {Classical approaches to the calculation of the photovoltaic (PV) power generated in a region from meteorological data require the knowledge of the detailed characteristics of the plants, which are most often not publicly available. An approach is proposed with the objective to obtain the best possible assessment of power generated in any region without having to collect detailed information on PV plants. The proposed approach is based on a model of PV plant coupled with a statistical distribution of the prominent characteristics of the configuration of the plant and is tested over Europe. The generated PV power is first calculated for each of the plant configurations frequently found in a given region and then aggregated taking into account the probability of occurrence of each configuration. A statistical distribution has been constructed from detailed information obtained for several thousands of PV plants representing approximately 2\&thinsp;\% of the total number of PV plants in Germany and was then adapted to other European countries by taking into account changes in the optimal PV tilt angle as a function of the latitude and meteorological conditions. The model has been run with bias-adjusted ERA-interim data as meteorological inputs. The results have been compared to estimates of the total PV power generated in two countries: France and Germany, as provided by the corresponding transmission system operators. Relative RMSE of 4.2 and 3.8\&thinsp;\% and relative biases of −2.4 and 0.1\&thinsp;\% were found with three-hourly data for France and Germany. A validation against estimates of the country-wide PV-power generation provided by the ENTSO-E for 16 European countries has also been conducted. This evaluation is made difficult by the uncertainty on the installed capacity corresponding to the ENTSO-E data but it nevertheless allows demonstrating that the model output and TSO data are highly correlated in most countries. Given the simplicity of the proposed approach these results are very encouraging. The approach is particularly suited to climatic timescales, both historical and future climates, as demonstrated here.},

The large majority of PV plants not being measured in Germany, the total PV power generated in a region is commonly estimated by upscaling the power production of a set of reference PV plants to the entireness of the plants installed in the considered area. A given uncertainty can be expected in the estimation of the power generation of a PV plant with the upscaling method when the reference plants used have different configurations or weather conditions. To gain better insight into the performance of the upscaling method, its error has been analysed using power measurements of a set of 366 PV plants. The analysis allows an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the uncertainty of the upscaling method and quantifies its error for the test study considered. In the case study analysed, it could be shown that the quarter hourly RMSE1In this paper, RMSE values are calculated with 15min time averaged power values, which corresponds to the time resolution used for energy trading.1 value decreases with an increasing number of reference plants and a decreasing number of un-metered plants. It could also be shown that even for a large number of reference plants, a variation of the RMSE between 0.01 and 0.025kW/kWp can be observed, depending on the choice of the reference plants. It is shown that the average distance between a reference and unknown plant constitutes a good indicator of the performance of a set of reference plants, but that the match between the characteristics of the reference and unknown plant also plays an important role, which could not be quantified with the available dataset.},

Similarly, when using 30 reference PV systems, we report median improvements from 0.036 W/Wp,8.25\%, 0.083 W/Wp and 24.8\%, down to 0.01 W/Wp,1.41\%, 0.049 W/Wp and 11.4\%, representing relative improvements of 72.2\%, 82.9\%, 41.0\% and 54.0\%, respectively. We discuss the fundamental challenges facing the use of reference PV systems, satellite-derived power estimates, combining the two data sources, and the knowledge required to address these issues. We ultimately conclude that combining satellite-based PV power estimates with data from reference PV systems is always more beneficial than either on their own.},

To estimate the generated power of a large number of unmeasured photovoltaic systems (e.g., to determine the sum of all systems in a portfolio), existing methodologies typically incorporate an upscaling step based on measured reference units. The upscaling approach presented in this paper extends this methodology by additionally taking into account the module orientation of all reference and target systems. Unknown module orientations are determined in a parameterization step using available geographic information system (GIS) based data sources. The power of the reference units is then used to estimate the power generation of all target units by applying a power projection and spatial interpolation as described in the literature. This new approach leads to improvements up to 5\% in terms of RMSErel values by offering a high spatial resolution and covering individual differences of PV systems.},

	abstract = {Power output measurements from PV systems are subject to a wide variety of systematic external and internal influences, such as shading, soiling, degradation, module and inverter quality issues and other system-level losses. All of these influences upon PV power measurements make the use of PV power output datasets for higher-level analysis problematic, particularly in their use as reference PV systems for estimating the power of a regional portfolio. To address these issues, we present a three-step method. Firstly, a parameterisation and quality control of power measurements is performed, which also corrects for consistent inefficiencies by a loss factor LF. Secondly, the detection of systematic de-ratings affecting PV system power output differently for each time step of the day (predominantly due to shading) together with the implementation of a subsequent “re-rating” of the power output measurements in a process referred to as tuning. The pivotal element of this approach is a 30-day running 90th percentile of the clear-sky index for photovoltaics kpv and the computation of a daily de-rating profile. Lastly, high kpv related variance in the early morning and evening is detected and filtered. Whilst these three methods are independent of each other, we suggest applying them in combination following the same order as in our paper. Cross-validations of these methods demonstrate significant improvements to the PV power measurement profiles, particularly in their use as reference PV systems for upscaling approaches. The RMSE falls from 0.174 to 0.09 W/Wp,rRMSE from 46.5\% to 21.9\%,MAPE from 47.9\% to 20.8\% and the correlation r increases from 0.767 to 0.919. Hence, we report overall improvements to RMSE,rRMSE,MAPE and r by 48\%,53\%,57\% and 20\%, respectively.},

However, policy implementation without a thorough understanding of the intricate relationship between social, economic, and land-use factors and solar photovoltaic deployment can lead to unintended consequences, including over- or underdeployment and failure to reach targets. To address this challenge, an investigation was conducted into the relationship between 36 factors and solar photovoltaic deployment across 143 countries from 2001 to 2020 using correlation analysis and principal component analysis. From these factors, five key variables were identified that collectively explain 79\% of the year-to-year variation in photovoltaic capacity. Using these variables, a neural network model was constructed, enabling the estimation of capacity additions by country with an error of less than 10\%. Additionally, a solar photovoltaic deployment index was developed, serving as a benchmark for comparing a country’s actual historical photovoltaic deployment to similar nations. Furthermore, the model’s utility in evaluating the impact of solar photovoltaic policies was explored. Through three distinct use cases—forecasting solar photovoltaic capacity additions, developing a solar photovoltaic deployment index, and assessing the impact of solar photovoltaic policies—the model emerges as a potentially powerful tool for governments and policy makers to assess solar photovoltaic deployment effectively and formulate strategies to promote sustainable solar energy growth.},

Efficient management, and innovations such as short-term forecasting and machine vision, demand high-resolution geographic datasets of PV installations. However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86\% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66 GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93 GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.},

Central to forward planning is an understanding of what affects PV growth, yet insights into the determinants of PV adoption in the literature are limited. What factors do drive the adoption at local level? Are the effects of these factors geographically uniform or are there nuances? What is the nature of these nuances? Existing studies so far use aggregate macro datasets with limited ability to capture the role of peer effects. This paper considers some established variables but also broadens the base of variables to try to identify new indicators relating to PV adoption. Specifically, it analyses domestic PV adoption in the UK at local level using data on the number of charities as a proxy to capture the opportunities to initiate social interactions and peer effects. A geographically weighted regression model that considers the spatially varying relationship between PV adoption and socio-economic explanatory variables reveals significantly more variability than the global regression. Our results show that charities and self-employment positively influence PV uptake while other socio-economic variables such as population density has bidirectional impacts.},

	abstract = {Globally, deployment of grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) has increased dramatically in recent years. The UK has seen rapid uptake reaching over 500,000 installations totalling 2.8 GWp by 2013. PV can be installed in different market segments (domestic rooftop, non-domestic rooftop and ground-mounted “solar-farms”) covering a broad range of system sizes in a high number of locations. It is important to gain detailed understanding of what grid-connected PV deployment looks like (e.g., how it deployed across different geographic areas and market segments), and identify the major drivers behind it. This paper answers these questions by developing a novel geographical information systems (GIS)-framework—the United Kingdom Photovoltaics Database (UKPVD)—to analyze temporal and spatial PV deployment trends at high resolution across all market segments. Results show how PV deployment changed over time with the evolution of governmental PV policy support. Then spatial trends as function of local irradiation, rurality (as a proxy of building and population density) and building footprint (as a proxy for roof-area) are analyzed. We find in all market segments, PV deployment is strongly correlated with the level of policy support. Furthermore, all markets show a preference to deploy in rural areas and those with higher irradiation. Finally, local clustering of PV in all market segments was observed, revealing that PV is not spread evenly across areas. This work reveals the complex nature of PV deployment, both spatially and by market segment, reinforcing the need capture this through mapping.},

This study contributes to navigating this post-subsidy uncertainty by identifying the factors associated with the uptake of a domestic-scale technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), in England and Wales, and exploring its spatial distribution. It uses FiT installation data from Ofgem, available at a fine-grained spatial resolution for the period April 2010–September 2019, to test the effect of social, housing, political, energy and environmental factors. It is shown that population demographics, housing density, size, type and tenure, and energy consumption practices are important factors influencing the uptake of domestic PV at the local level. The South West and East of England are identified as regions of unexpectedly high uptake, controlling for the other factors. This is, at the time of writing, the first attempt to model PV uptake at a fine-grained spatial level across England and Wales.},

Previous research has focused on the micro-dynamics of renewable energy acceptance, but systematic research exploring the factors of renewable deployment with large N data is outstanding. We study the meso-level investigating the impact of actors and context on the approval of ground-mounted solar photovoltaic applications. The analyses rely on the Renewable Energy Planning Database provided by the United Kingdom's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and planning officer reports. Logistic regressions allow us to predict under what circumstances solar farm proposals in England are successful by local authorities. Our results suggest that only some actors matter: solar farm planning success seems to rely on recommendations of actors with institutional power and members of the public rather than advocacy groups. However, context also plays an important role, in particular, surrounding landscapes and planning guidelines. Robustness checks using Coarsened Exact Matching lend further confidence in our results. This implies that policymakers should address definitional and pragmatic issues that hinder the decision-making process in solar planning. This may encourage all stakeholders to employ different communication strategies in the future.},

This study develops a transferable methodology to explore the trade-offs between landscape impact, land use competition and resource quality for onshore wind as well as ground- and roof-mounted photovoltaic (PV) systems for the first time across GB. These trade-offs constrain the technical and economic potentials for these technologies at the Local Authority level. Our approach combines techno-economic and geospatial analyses with crowd-sourced ‘scenicness’ data to quantify landscape aesthetics. Despite strong correlations between scenicness and planning application outcomes for onshore wind, no such relationship exists for ground-mounted PV. The innovative method for rooftop-PV assessment combines bottom-up analysis of four cities with a top-down approach at the national level. The results show large technical potentials that are strongly constrained by both landscape and land use aspects. This equates to about 1324 TWh of onshore wind, 153 TWh of rooftop PV and 1200–7093 TWh ground-mounted PV, depending on scenario. We conclude with five recommendations that focus around aligning energy and planning policies for VRE technologies across multiple scales and governance arenas.},

A set of maps, each representing a given suitability criterion, is created with geographical information systems (GIS) software. These are combined to give a Boolean map of areas which are appropriate for large-scale solar farm installation. Several scenarios are investigated by varying the criteria, which include geographical (land use) factors, solar energy resource and electrical distribution network constraints. Some are dictated by the physical and technical requirements of large-scale solar construction, and some by government or distribution network operator (DNO) policy. It is found that any suitability map which does not heed planning permission and grid constraints will overstate potential solar farm area by up to 97\%. This research finds sufficient suitable land to meet Future Energy Scenarios (UK National Grid outlines for the coming energy landscape).},

Active grid connection requests are more than double the total installed capacity of the US power plant fleet (2,600 vs. 1,280 GW). The time required to secure a connection has increased by 70\% over the last decade, and withdrawal rates remain high at 80\%, suggesting a constrained transmission system that jeopardizes energy transition targets. Wide distributions of interconnection costs indicate the inherent uncertainty of the interconnection process.

However, to date, the advancement of Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) in the country has been very limited due to various barriers. For this reason, identifying and mitigating the main barriers that hamper the advancement of RETs is necessary to allow the successful deployment of these technologies. Based on data collected from a questionnaire survey and interviews conducted among the major renewable project developers, the authors identify and rank the major barriers to the adoption of renewable energy technologies in Chile. Our findings show that the most significant barriers include “grid connection constraints and lack of grid capacity”, “longer processing times for a large number of permits”, “land and/or water lease securement” and “limited access to financing”. Furthermore, we discuss the most critical barriers in detail together with policy recommendations to overcome them.},

The article considers four key categories of RES development barriers in the European Union: political, administrative, grid infrastructural, and socioeconomic. The work is based on publicly available historical data from European Union reports, Eurostat, and the Eclareon RES Policy Monitoring Database. The empirical analysis includes all 27 countries belonging to the European Union. The research aimed to determine the impact of all four types of factors, including socioeconomic, on the development of RESs in European Union countries. The analysis uncovered that describing the European Union as a consistent region regarding the speed of renewable energy advancement and the obstacles to such progress is not accurate. Notably, a significant link exists between a strong degree of societal development and the integration of renewable energy sources. In less prosperous EU nations, economic growth plays a pivotal role in renewable energy development. Barriers of an administrative nature exert a notable influence on renewable energy development, especially in less affluent EU countries, while grid-related obstacles are prevalent in Southern–Central Europe. In nations where the proportion of renewable energy sources in electricity consumption is substantial, an excess of capacity in the renewable energy market significantly affects its growth.},

Specifically, we propose an efficient dataset creation methodology for aerial imagery which allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results, improving the previous model's recall score by more than eight percentage points to 98\% while keeping its precision almost constant at 92\%. Furthermore, we show that our optimized model extends its superior classification performance to lower image resolutions. After re-training our optimized model on lower resolution imagery, we apply it to Germany's most-populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia, and deliver a proof of concept for automatically validating, updating, and creating databases of renewable energy systems at a large scale.

The substantive drop in the cost of panels since 2007, coupled with the introduction of the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Scheme in 2010, has resulted in a rapid increase in installation of PV panels in the UK, from 26.5MWp in 2009 to over 5GW by the end of 2014. Yet there has been no comprehensive analysis of the determinants of PV deployment in the UK. This paper addresses this gap by employing spatial econometrics methods to a recently available data set at a fine geographical detail. Following a traditional regression analysis, a general to specific approach has been adopted where spatial variations in the relationships have been examined utilising the spatial Durbin model using the cross-sectional data relating to the UK NUTS level 3 data. Empirical results indicate that demand for electricity, population density, pollution levels, education level of households and housing types are among the factors that affect PV uptake in a region. Moreover Lagrange Multiplier test results indicate that the spatial Durbin model may be properly applied to describe the PV uptake relationship in the UK as there are significant regional spillover effects.},

At the household level, however, wealth and financial access are positively associated with solar technology adoption, a result that holds for both solar lanterns and home systems. Moreover, remote villages are more likely to see solar technology adoption when households have access to finance through banks. We also find that the use of household solar technology is strongly associated with a household's subjective satisfaction with domestic lighting. These results demonstrate that understanding solar technology adoption requires considering both community and household characteristics. They also underscore the importance of financial access as a precondition for using distributed solar power as an alternative to grid connectivity.},

	abstract = {Energy is defined as the ability to do work and can be converted through variety of processes and used in various applications. Primary energy sources such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, wood, solar etc. can be directly used without being converted to another type of energy. Secondary energy sources, of which electricity and fuel oil are typical examples, are form of energies that are transformed from primary energy sources and are more expensive because of the conversion process and the losses associated. Starting especially with the industrial revolution, meeting the energy demand has been one of the most important concerns of countries. Starting from 1970’s, enforced in particular by the energy crisis, humankind have turned to renewable energy since the production of petroleum, which was the main energy source then, faced an unprecedented shortage and thus increased prices. As one of the main renewable energy sources, solar energy has made a rapid progress in the past decades, with variety of technologies, such as photovoltaics, thermal converters, passive architectural systems and so on. Photovoltaics, which convert solar energy directly into electrical energy, presently play an important role in energy policies of countries. As a developing country, Turkey is experiencing a rapid annual growth of energy demand, including electricity. However, Turkey is extensively dependent on the imported fossil fuel for meeting the increasing demand, with a limited domestic reserve. Therefore, the present energy policy of Turkey is based on cutting down the amount of fossil fuel imported. Solar and wind energies are two of the main candidates to play a major role in cutting down the amount of fossil fuel presently used. In the present study, Turkey’s solar energy potential and photovoltaic development are analyzed. With a relatively high solar energy potential, Turkey’s installed photovoltaic capacity and photovoltaic electricity generation are analyzed in comparison to 5 selected European Union countries (EU-5). In addition, the ratio of installed photovoltaic capacity per capita to solar potential has been analyzed as a function of gross national product. The results indicate that the installed capacities and power generation of countries are not in direct proportion with their solar energy potential. It has also been concluded that Turkey's photovoltaic development is not sufficient in comparison to the EU-5 countries and effective incentive policies are required to be implemented rapidly in order for Turkey to reach their level.},

This article empirically examines the diffusion of an important renewable energy technology: residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Using detailed data on PV installations in Connecticut, we identify the spatial patterns of diffusion, which indicate considerable clustering of adoptions. This clustering does not simply follow the spatial distribution of income or population. We find that smaller centers contribute to adoption more than larger urban areas, in a wave-like centrifugal pattern. Our empirical estimation demonstrates a strong relationship between adoption and the number of nearby previously installed systems as well as built environment and policy variables. The effect of nearby systems diminishes with distance and time, suggesting a spatial neighbor effect conveyed through social interaction and visibility. These results disentangle the process of diffusion of PV systems and provide guidance to stakeholders in the solar market.},

	abstract = {The installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on residential units is one of the measures that countries around the world are implementing to mitigate the impact of the global warming crisis. Australia has become the world leader in the solar PV sector since it introduced its solar-related program in 2001. The adoption was initially spurred by government-driven incentive schemes providing opportunities for early adopters to financially capitalise on the technology through feed-in tariffs. Over time, the growth was further propelled by the phenomenon often referred to as the neighbourhood effects. This paper conducted a statistical analysis to investigate the demographic composition, at postal area (POA) resolution, associated with the PV uptake in Australia. To detect the presence of the neighbourhood effects, a formula was developed to simplify its quantification, drawing analogies to kinematics. The results of the regression analysis reveal that gender, share of certain age groups, land area, and dwellings with a vehicle do not correlate with adoption. On the other hand, other variables such as marital status, weekly household income, number of bedrooms, population and dwellings densities, do have influences, positively and negatively. Furthermore, the “accelerated rate” determines a positive impact of the neighbourhood effects in the range of 15 to 20 additional PV units installed per year per POA. A publicly accessible tool was developed with this study that can aid policymakers in exploring the socio-economic indicators identified in this analysis as predictors of the diffusion of the technology for effective policies, regulations, and schemes.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the spatio-temporal patterns of solar photovoltaic (PV) adoption, solving the ongoing need to inform the management of the distribution networks with spatially explicit estimations of PV adoption rates. This work addresses a key limitation of agent-based models (ABMs) that use rule or equation-based decision-making. It achieves this by adopting an aggregated definition of the agents using artificial neural networks (ANN) as the criteria for decision-making. This novel approachdraws from both ABM and Spatial Regression methods. It incorporates spatial and temporal dependencies as well as social dynamics that drive the adoption of PVs. Consequently, the model yields a more realistic characterisation of decision-making whilst reflecting individual behaviours for each location following the real-world layout. The model utilises the ANN’s approximation capabilities to generate knowledge from historical PV data, as well as adapt to changes in data trends. First, an autoregressive model is developed. This is then extended to capture the population heterogeneity by introducing socioeconomic variables into the agent’s decision-making. Both models are empirically validated and benchmarked against the Bass Model. Results suggest that the model can account for the spatio-temporal and social dynamics that drive the adoption process and that the ABM and ANN integrated model has superior adaptive capabilities to the Bass model. The proposed model can estimate spatio-temporally explicit forecasts for up to five months with an accuracy of 80\%. In line with the literature, results suggest that income, electricity consumption and the average household size variables yield the best results.},

	abstract = {With the acceleration of China's energy transformation process and the rapid increase of renewable energy market demand, the photovoltaic (PV) industry has created more jobs and effectively alleviated the employment pressure of the labor market under the normalization of the epidemic situation. First, to accurately predict China’s solar PV installed capacity, this paper proposes a multi-factor installed capacity prediction model based on bidirectional long short-term memory-grey relation analysis. The results show that, the MAPE value of the GRA-LSTM combined model established in this paper is 5.995, compared with the prediction results of other models, the prediction accuracy of the GRA-BiLSTM model is higher. Second, the BiLSTM model is used to forecast China’s installed solar PV capacity from 2020 to 2035. The forecast results show that China’s newly installed solar PV capacity will continue to grow and reach 2833GW in 2035. Third, the employment number in China’s solar PV industry during 2020–2035 is predicted by the employment factors (EF) method. The results show that the energy transition in China during 2020–2035 will have a positive impact on the future stability and growth of the labor market in the solar PV industry. Overall, an accurate forecast of solar PV installed capacity can provide effective decision support for planning electric power development strategy and formulating employment policy of solar PV industry.},

	abstract = {The current study examined the impact of different levels of education on environmental quality and renewable energy. Panel data was drawn from the World Bank and OECD databases for 20 OECD countries for the period 1997–2019. Rigorous analytic procedures were employed to better address the methodological issues of existing literature for the analysis of panel data. In this regard, cross-section dependency and heterogeneous structure of the panel data were considered. Accordingly, Gengenbach, Urbain, and Westerlund's panel cointegration test was employed to examine whether there was a long-term relationship between the variables. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Mean Group Dynamic Least Squares were employed to test the robust impact of independent variables on the dependent variable in the long run. Lastly, Dumitrescu \& Hurlin's Granger non-causality test was conducted to determine the direction of the relationship between variables. Findings showed that while lower-level education and per capita GDP significantly increased CO2 emissions, higher education significantly decreased it. The CO2 emissions and per capita GDP posed significant negative influences on renewable energy. On the contrary, while both levels of education had positive influences, higher education appeared to be the most influential variable on renewable energy. The causality analyses yielded bidirectional causality relationships between CO2 emissions and renewable energy, low-level education, and higher education; conversely, unidirectional causality relationships between CO2 emissions and per capita GDP. Collectively, the study highlighted the significance of a highly educated workforce for promoting and creating a sustained environment by reducing CO2 emissions and increasing renewable energy utilization.},

	abstract = {Using microdata from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2010), this paper investigates whether there are green returns to education in China, where educational attainment promotes pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. We establish causality by exploiting the exogenous variation induced by the implementation of the Compulsory Schooling Law (CSL) in China. We find evidence that educational attainment is associated with higher levels of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, and these estimates are robust to various robustness checks. Further analysis reveals that the acquisition of environmental knowledge is the channel that drives the effect of education on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Finally, the effects of education are heterogeneous across individuals.},

	abstract = {It is often observed that individuals with higher education levels tend to be more environmentally friendly. Yet, the causal evidence is lacking because there may well be omitted variables that cause individuals to attain more education and also cause individuals to be environmentally conscious. We implement a regression discontinuity design to estimate the increase in educational attainment due to changes in compulsory education laws in 20th century Europe. This allows us to overcome the identification problem of endogenous educational attainment. Using two waves of Eurobarometer surveys, we find a positive local average treatment effect for 7 of the 8 pro-environmental behaviors. An analysis of related questions on the survey supports the notion that education causes individuals to be more concerned with social welfare and to accordingly behave in a more environmentally friendly manner.},
