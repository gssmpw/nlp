Our work introduces the mirror extragradient algorithm as a powerful computational tool for solving variational inequalities, extending existing results to constrained domains and establishing polynomial-time convergence under suitable conditions. By leveraging this framework, we provide the first computationally tractable characterization of Walrasian equilibria in balanced economies and introduce the mirror extratâtonnement process, which converges efficiently even in challenging cases like the Scarf economy. Our theoretical insights and empirical validation suggest that computational intractability in general equilibrium is largely a consequence of discontinuities rather than fundamental hardness, offering a new perspective on Scarf’s long-standing challenge in applied general equilibrium theory.
