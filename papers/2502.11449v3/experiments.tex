In this section, we first apply the \emph{t\^atonnement} and mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process with kernel function $\kernel(\price) \doteq \|\price\|^2$, first to solve the Scarf economy with the goal of illustrating the differing convergence behavior between the two price-adjustment processes. We then apply the mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process with kernel function $\kernel(\price) \doteq \|\price\|^2$ to solve a number of Arrow-Debreu exchange economies \cite{arrow-debreu} with the goal of demonstrating that our pathwise Bregman-continuity assumption holds, and that the mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process can efficiently solve very large Walrasian economies in practice.

\deni{REVIEWWWWWW}We record in the first 2 leftmost plots of \Cref{fig:exp_results} the movement of prices in the Scarf economy for the \emph{t\^atonnement} and mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} processes respectively. As is well-established, the sequence of prices generated by \emph{t\^atonnement}, despite starting very close to the equilibrium prices $(\nicefrac{1}{3}, \nicefrac{1}{3}, \nicefrac{1}{3})$ spiral away from the prices, converging to the $(0, 0, 1)$ price vector which is not a Walrasian equilibrium. In contrast, the prices generated by the mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process spiral inwards towards the equilibrium price despite starting far way from the equilibrium prices. An intuitive explanation of this behavior is as follows, the continuous-time variant of \emph{t\^atonnement} is known to cycle around the equilibrium prices \cite{scarf1960instable}. Now, one way to intepret the discrete-time \emph{t\^atonnement} (resp. mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement}) process is as an explicit (resp. implicit) discretization \cite{butcher2008numerical} of the continuous-time \emph{t\^atonnement} dynamics. A well-known fact is that explicit (resp. implicit) discretization methods are unstable (resp. stable) when the continuous-time dynamics cycle, thus explaining the observed behavior.

An Arrow-Debreu exchange economy $(\numbuyers, \numcommods, \consumptions, \consendow, \util)$ consists of $\numcommods \in \N$ commodities, $\numbuyers \in \N$ consumers each $\consumer \in [\numconsumers]$ with a consumption space $\consumptions[\buyer]$, an endowment of commodities  $\consendow[\consumer] \in \R^\numcommods_+$, and a utility function $\util[\consumer]: \consumptions[\buyer] \to \R$. An Arrow-Debreu exchange economy $(\numbuyers, \numcommods, \consumptions, \consendow, \util)$ can be represented as a bounded continuous competitive economy $(\numgoods, \excessset)$ where the excess demand correspondence is given as: $\excessset(\price) \doteq \sum_{\player \in \players} \argmax\limits_{\consumption[\consumer] \in \consumptions[\consumer]: \consumption[\consumer] \cdot \price \leq \consendow[\consumer] \cdot \price}  \util[\consumer](\consumption[\consumer]) - \sum_{\consumer \in \consumers} \consendow[\consumer]$.\footnote{We refer the reader to \Cref{sec_app:ad_comp} on additional background and definitions on Arrow-Debreu exchange economies.}

We consider the following utility function classes to run our experiments:
1.~linear: $\util[\buyer](\allocation[\buyer]) = \sum_{\good \in \goods} \valuation[\buyer][\good] \allocation[\buyer][\good]$; 
2.~Cobb-Douglas:  $\util[\buyer](\allocation[\buyer]) = \prod_{\good \in \goods} \allocation[\buyer][\good][][{\valuation[\buyer][\good]}]$; 
3.~Leontief:  $\util[\buyer](\allocation[\buyer]) = \min_{\good \in \goods} \left\{ \nicefrac{\allocation[\buyer][\good]}{\valuation[\buyer][\good]}\right\}$; 
and 4.~CES: $\util[\buyer](\allocation[\buyer]) = \sqrt[{\rho_\buyer}]{ \sum_{\good \in \goods} \valuation[\buyer][\good] \allocation[\buyer][\good][][{\rho_\buyer}]}$ with each utility function parameterized by a vector of valuations $\valuation[\buyer] \in \mathbb{R}_+^{\numbuyers}$, where each $\valuation[\buyer][\good]$ quantifies the value of commodity $\good$ to consumer $\consumer$. 
We summarize the experiments we run in \Cref{table:exp_summary}. The parameters of each economy are initialized randomly according to the uniform random distribution.\footnote{ For reproducibility purposes, we include our code ready to run on \coderepo, and include all details of our experimental setup in \Cref{sec_ap:experiments}.} We record the results of our experiments in \Cref{fig:exp_results}, describing for what value of $\varepsilon \geq 0$, are the prices generated throughout the algorithm a $\varepsilon$-Walrasian equilibrium.

We observe that in all our experiments except in experiments 5 and 6---which include Linear consumers and are as such not covered by our theory as the excess demand for the economies is not singleton-valued---the mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process converges to a Walrasian equilibrium. In all experiments, we verify and confirm that pathwise Bregman-continuity holds, thus justifying our assumption. Finally, while our experiments obey our theory which suggests a best-iterate convergence to a $\varepsilon$-Walrasian equilibrium in $\nicefrac{1}{\varepsilon^2}$ time-steps, we observe that a last-iterate convergence occurs only for experiments 5, corresponding to the case of Cobb-Douglas consumers, for which even \emph{t\^atonnement} is known to converge in last-iterates. This suggests that achieve convergence in last iterates might not be possible with the mirror \emph{extrat\^atonnement} process.
