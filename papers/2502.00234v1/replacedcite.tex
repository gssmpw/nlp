\paragraph{High-Order Scheme for Chemical Reaction Systems.}

Regarding approximate methods developed for simulating compound Poisson processes and chemical reaction systems with state-dependent intensities, efforts have been made on the $\tau$-leaping method____, and its extensions____. For a quick review of the problem setting and these methods, one may refer to____. The adaption of these methods to discrete diffusion models presents unique challenges due to the presence of both time and state-inhomogeneous intensities in the underlying Poisson processes.
