\paragraph{Discrete Diffusion Models.}
Since its introduction, discrete diffusion models have undergone significant refinements, including the development of score-entropy loss~\citep{lou2024discrete} and flow-matching formulation~\citep{campbell2024generative,gat2024discrete}. These models generally fall into two categories based on their noise distribution: uniform~\citep{lou2024discrete,schiff2024simple} and masked (absorbing state)~\citep{ou2024your,shi2024simplified,sahoo2024simple,zheng2024masked}, each offering unique advantages in modeling discrete distributions. Recent theoretical advances have emerged through numerous studies~\citep{chen2024convergence, zhang2024convergence, ren2024discrete}.

\paragraph{High-Order Scheme for Continuous Diffusion Models.}

The development of high-order numerical schemes for solving ODEs and SDEs represents decades of research, as comprehensively reviewed in \citet{butcher1987numerical,kloeden1992numerical,kloeden2012numerical}. These schemes have recently been adapted to accelerate continuous diffusion model inference, encompassing approaches such as the exponential integrators~\citep{zhang2022fast,zhanggddim}, Adams-Bashforth methods~\citep{lu2022dpm++,xue2024sa,zhangsong2023improved}, Taylor methods~\citep{tachibana2021quasi,dockhorn2022genie} and (stochastic) Runge-Kutta methods~\citep{liu2022pseudo,lu2022dpm,karras2022elucidating, zheng2023dpm, li2024accelerating,wu2024stochastic}.

\paragraph{High-Order Scheme for Chemical Reaction Systems.}

Regarding approximate methods developed for simulating compound Poisson processes and chemical reaction systems with state-dependent intensities, efforts have been made on the $\tau$-leaping method~\citep{gillespie2001approximate}, and its extensions~\cite{cao2004numerical, burrage2004poisson, hu2011weaka, hu2009highly}. For a quick review of the problem setting and these methods, one may refer to~\citet{weinan2021applied}. The adaption of these methods to discrete diffusion models presents unique challenges due to the presence of both time and state-inhomogeneous intensities in the underlying Poisson processes.
