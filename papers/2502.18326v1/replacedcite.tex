\paragraph{Theoretical Works \& Synthetic Data}
A growing body of works____ provides significant theoretical understanding of compositional generalization results in the vision domain.
Similar works exist for compositionally in language____, often under the more specific term \emph{systematicity}____.
In the language domain, promising progress has been made____, but results in both domains nonetheless remain confined to synthetic datasets____l; ____ actively questions the transferability of insights to real-world data. In contrast, our work analyzes compositional generalization using real-world retrieval datasets.

\paragraph{VLM Benchmarks \& Contamination}
Several compositionality benchmarks have been proposed for VLMs____. However, these studies do not consider the overlap of concept combinations with web-scale pretraining data.
Data contamination of this kind has been shown to significantly impact CLIP's zero-shot performance____, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine generalization and mere memorization.
A notable exception is ____, who generate test images of novel attribute-object pairs, but as a result, their benchmark resorts to synthetic data. Our work controls for data contamination by only considering combinations that do not occur in the pretraining data but do occur in real-world benchmarks.
