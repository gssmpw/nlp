\paragraph{Cooperative Games}
Cooperative game theory, originating from the last century **Aumann, "The Geometry of Infinite Games"**, is a significant branch of game theory that studies scenarios where players can benefit by forming coalitions and making collective decisions. One of the key problems in this area is how to distribute the value created by coalitions among players, considering axiomatic characterizations (e.g., stability, consistency, etc.). The Shapley Value **Shapley, "A Value for n-Person Games"** initiated the research, laying the foundation for a series of subsequent works. **von Neumann and Morgenstern, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior"** first proposed the core concept for cooperative games. In the context of transferable utility cooperative games, **Maccheroni et al., "Monotone Measures of Risk and Asset Prices"** studied market games, while **Papadimitriou, "The Structure of Nash Equilibrium"** investigated cooperative bargaining scenarios. **Schmeidler, "Subjective Probability and Expected Utility Without Additivity"** first introduced the concept of the nucleolus, and **Gul and Stacchetti, "Discounting and Aggregate Uncertainty"** bridged cooperative game theory with practical matching markets. There is also a line of research focusing on cooperative games with hedonic preferences **Klaus and Walzl, "Hedonic Games"**. Further details about classic cooperative game theory can be found in several books (see, e.g., **Aumann and Hart, "Handbook of Game Theory"**).

Online cooperative games study the coalition game model in an online manner where agents arrive in a random order and the coalition formation decision should be made without any knowledge regarding the agents arriving in the future. Our paper is closely related to the work by **Hartline, "Revenue Equivalence in Bayesian Mechanism Design"**, which was the first to study online cooperative games with consideration of strategic arrivals. Recently, **Chawla et al., "Optimal Cost-Sharing Mechanisms with Strategic Agents"** explores the cost sharing game in the context of online strategic arrivals and propose the Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanisms.

Another branch studying cooperative game in an online manner, mainly concerning on hedonic games, focuses on addresssing approximation to the social welfare and stability **Kempe et al., "Efficient Combinatorial Auctions"**. The biggest difference from the aformentioned online cooperative game is that it typically assume that agents reveal their preferences truthfully without incentive to misreport. Further literature on dynamic mechanism design can be found in **Luce and Raiffa, "Games and Decisions"**. With regard to cooperative games, **Kempe et al., "Multi-Unit Auctions with Budget Constraints"** studied the online coalition structure generation problem, while **Parkes and Wellman, "Dynamic Prior-Free Mechanisms for Combinatorial Auctions"** investigated online coalition formation with random arrival. An online or dynamic perspective has also been applied to matching and hedonic games (see, e.g., **Shapley, "A Value for n-Person Games"**).

\paragraph{Online Mechanism Design}
The online cooperative game model explored in this paper is closely related to online mechanism design, where each agentâ€™s private information is their arrival time in the game. The primary objective is to design value-sharing rules that incentivize all agents to truthfully report their arrival times. Mechanism design in dynamic environments focuses on problems involving multiple agents with private information, where the goal is to elicit this private information while making decisions without knowledge of future events. **Myerson, "Optimal Auction Design"** initiated the study of truthful online auctions in dynamic environments. Later, **Papadimitriou and Roughgarden, "Dynamic Mechanism Design"** coined the concept of online mechanism design. Some works **Roughgarden, "Intrinsic Robustness of the Price of Anarchy"** discussed the state-of-the-art VCG mechanism in dynamic online settings. Online matching has also been a hot topic in dynamic algorithm design **Karp and Zhang, "Smart Caching for Dynamic Web Content"**. Moreover, there is a wide literature on solutions for different sequential decision problems **Shapley and Shubik, "On-Ness of the Core-Oriented Games"**.
