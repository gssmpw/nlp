\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods in CIR. Specifically, we begin by reviewing supervised CIR approaches, with a focus on the four main components of their general framework. We then explore the emerging field of zero-shot CIR, along with several related tasks in CIR. Following this, we review various CIR datasets, grouping results according to the datasets and providing corresponding analyses. 
Through these comprehensive endeavors, we have gained profound insights into the current challenges in CIR and have outlined some promising research directions for the future. This comprehensive survey is an invaluable and insightful resource for researchers and practitioners, significantly propelling the rapidly evolving field of CIR.  



% Finally, we highlight the current challenges in CIR and identify promising research directions for the future. This survey serves as an invaluable resource for both researchers and practitioners, contributing to the rapidly evolving field of CIR.
