%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is an emerging yet challenging task that allows users to search for target images using a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text specifying the user's desired changes to the reference image. Given its significant academic and practical value, CIR has become a rapidly growing area of interest in the computer vision and machine learning communities, particularly with the advances in deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive review of CIR to provide a timely overview of this field. Therefore,  we synthesize insights from over 120 publications in top conferences and journals, including ACM TOIS, SIGIR, and CVPR.
In particular, we systematically categorize existing supervised CIR and zero-shot CIR models using a fine-grained taxonomy. For a comprehensive review, we also briefly discuss approaches for tasks closely related to CIR, such as attribute-based CIR and dialog-based CIR. Additionally, we summarize benchmark datasets for evaluation and analyze existing supervised and zero-shot CIR methods by comparing experimental results across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we present promising future directions in this field, offering practical insights for researchers interested in further exploration. The curated collection of related works is maintained and continuously updated in \href{https://github.com/haokunwen/Awesome-Composed-Image-Retrieval}{\textsc{Awesome-CIR}} repository.
