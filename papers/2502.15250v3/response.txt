\section{Related work}
In this section, a combination of gradient-based method, Bayesian decison and mathematical morphology is introduced, which can detect frontal zone and fronts. Further improvements with innovative algorithms are in the next section.

\subsection{Data}
The sea surface temperature(SST) is obtained from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch daily global $5$km($0.05$ degree exactly) satellite coral bleaching heat stress monitoring product(v3.1). It addresses errors identified in previous versions of the SST data, particularly for coral reef regions during the period from 2013-2016. What is more, this fine-grained resolution is essential for understanding ocean fronts and it can be downloaded from \url{https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/}. 

Results of Lyapunov method for comparison are composed of multimission altimetry-derived gridded backward-in-time FSLE and Orientations of associated eigenvectors **M.

\subsection{Gradient calculation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernel}
	\begin{gathered}
		F_{x}=\begin{bmatrix}-1&-2&-1\\0&4&0\\1&2&1\end{bmatrix}\\
		F_{y}=\begin{bmatrix}-2&-1&0\\-2&8&-2\\0&-1&-2\end{bmatrix}
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bayesian decision}
The undetermined frontal zone point $E$ can be judged by posterior probability. If $P(fact|E=i)P(E=i)>=P(fact|E=j)P(E=j)$, then $E$ is seen as frontal zone point and non frontal zone point otherwise. The whole process is shown in algorithm \ref{alg:bd}. 

\subsection{Skeletonization}
With maximum disk method(MDM) in mathematical morphology, these one-pixel-width fronts can be extracted from the frontal zone obtained above. MDM is a skeletonization algorithm that determines whether each point in the frontal zone is a front point, also known as a skeleton point.

\subsection{Skeleton trimming}
Although these fronts have been found, they have many branches, and in order to extract the main features and adapt to the research scale, redundant branches must be removed. Here, a greedy algorithm called the discrete skeleton evolution(DSE) algorithm is used to assign weights to each branch, iteratively removing the branch with the minimum weight to obtain the main fronts **P. Soille, "Morphological Image Analysis"**.

The points in $S(Z)$ need to be classified into $3$ categories: endpoint, connection point and intersection point. The endpoint has $1$ point in $S(Z)$ connected to itself, the connection point has $2$ and the intersection point has $3$. It is clear to see that endpoint and intersection point determine a branch in $S(Z)$. Suppose $l_i(i=1,2,...,N)$ are the endpoints in $S(Z)$, $f(l_i)$ are the closest intersection points to $l_i$, $Q(l_i,f(l_i))$ are the branches.

The frontal zone after skeleton reconstruction was determined according to $R(S)=\cup_{s\in S(Z)}U(s,r(s))$; among them, $R(S)$ is the frontal zone after skeleton reconstruction, $r(s)$ is the radius of the largest disk $U(s,r(s))$ with the center $s$ and in the frontal zone.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight}
	w_i=V(R(S))-V(R(S-Q(l_i,f(l_i))))
\end{equation}

Using \eqref{eq:weight} to assign weights to every branch $Q(l_i,f(l_i))$ and $V()$ is the area function. $w_i$ is the number of pixels loss when comparing the reconstructed frontal zone and the original. It can be seen from this equation that if $w_i$ approches $0$, it will mean that the reconstructed frontal zone after removing $Q(l_i,f(l_i))$ is similar to the original, so it can be removed and a greedy algorithm can be obtained as in algorithm \ref{alg:dse}.
