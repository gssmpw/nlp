\textbf{Physics-based (white-box) models}:
Research on maneuvering models began with____. Later,____,____, and____ contributed to hydrodynamic aspects and stability principles. ____ and____ used Taylor expansion for maneuvering models. The MMG model that is widely used in autonomous navigation was introduced by____, was improved by____ and has been applied by____ and____. Other models for low-speed hydrodynamic forces include the HD model____, the CD model____, and the TBL model____.

\textbf{Black box models}: Recently machine Learning approaches such as   artificial neural networks____ and Gaussian processes____ have been explored. ____ uses deep neural networks (DNN) for 6-DoF motion prediction in waves to demonstrate how DNNs can capture nonlinear dynamics between the ship state and wave conditions while maintaining good generalization.

\textbf{Grey box models}:
An other research avenue has focused on developing parameter estimation methods to combine traditional physics-based models with data-driven adaptation.
____ employed a gradient-free optimization method (namely CMA-ES) to tune parameters of an MMG model____ using sea-trial data of a real-scale ship. 
____ proposed a framework that 
fits open parameters of an Abkowitz model____ to data of the target ship while using a well-validated model of a similar ship to regularize the fitting process. In this way, the resulting predictions are on par with the validated model while they are tailored to the target ship's behavioral patterns. 
Although, improved prediction accuracy has been demonstrated, depending on the type of fitted parameters reliability to the model can be lost, if the parameters are not interpretable.
Unlike these approaches, the data-driven physics-based model introduced in this paper, which is based on the white-box model____, focuses on optimizing interpretable parameters, making the results more accessible and understandable to domain experts.   \vspace{-4mm}


% This enables a direct relation between the model's output and the underlying physical and operational characteristics of the ship. While focusing parameter estimation on interpretable parameters might seem advantageous, it can lead to reduced reliability of the resulting model if the constraints imposed by the physics-based framework are not properly maintained.
% \textcolor{red}{Here, we need to describe how our approach differs to the above, for example depending on the open parameters interpretability can be lost and the fact that our physics-based model is Spyrou-based which implies .... also, here describe that if parameter estimation focuses on non interpretable parameters then the resulting model is not reliable. }



% bridges the dynamics of similar ships by using parameters from a well-validated model as a knowledge foundation for developing models of new ships. 
% In parallel, work has been done on parameter fine-tuning methods for existing models.
