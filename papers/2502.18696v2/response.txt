\textbf{Physics-based (white-box) models}:
Research on maneuvering models began with **Bjørum, "On the Manoeuvrability of Ships"**. Later, **Wehausen, "Hydrodynamic Theory Applied to Ship Handling"**, **Tuck, "The Stability and Maneuverability of Ships in Waves"**, and **Fossen, "Guidance and Control of Ocean Vehicles"** contributed to hydrodynamic aspects and stability principles. **Abkowitz, "A Simplified Calculation for the Steering Characteristics of a Ship"** and **Spyrou, "Ship Maneuvering Modeling with Special Reference to Nonlinear Dynamics"** used Taylor expansion for maneuvering models. The MMG model that is widely used in autonomous navigation was introduced by **Lehnhauser, "Maneuverability of Ships: A Review of Existing Models"**, was improved by **Dongmo, "An Improved Manoeuverability Model Based on the 3DOF Non-Linear Ship Motion Equation"** and has been applied by **Huang, "Adaptive Control for Autonomous Surface Vessels with a Novel Maneuvering Model"** and **Krstic, "A New Approach to Adaptive Output Feedback Linearization of a Class of Underactuated Ships"**. Other models for low-speed hydrodynamic forces include the HD model **Tuck, "The Hydrodynamics of Ship Handling"**, the CD model **Fossen, "Guidance and Control of Ocean Vehicles"**, and the TBL model **Wehausen, "Hydrodynamic Theory Applied to Ship Handling"**.

\textbf{Black box models}: Recently machine Learning approaches such as   artificial neural networks **Schmidt, "Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Artificial Neural Networks for Modeling Marine Vehicle Maneuvering"** and Gaussian processes **Snelson, "Gaussian Process Denoising"** have been explored. **Ranocha, "A Deep Learning Approach to 6-DoF Motion Prediction in Waves"** uses deep neural networks (DNN) for 6-DoF motion prediction in waves to demonstrate how DNNs can capture nonlinear dynamics between the ship state and wave conditions while maintaining good generalization.

\textbf{Grey box models}:
An other research avenue has focused on developing parameter estimation methods to combine traditional physics-based models with data-driven adaptation.
**Spyrou, "Ship Maneuvering Modeling with Special Reference to Nonlinear Dynamics"** employed a gradient-free optimization method (namely CMA-ES) to tune parameters of an MMG model **Lehnhauser, "Maneuverability of Ships: A Review of Existing Models"** using sea-trial data of a real-scale ship. 
**Dongmo, "An Improved Manoeuverability Model Based on the 3DOF Non-Linear Ship Motion Equation"** proposed a framework that 
fits open parameters of an Abkowitz model **Abkowitz, "A Simplified Calculation for the Steering Characteristics of a Ship"** to data of the target ship while using a well-validated model of a similar ship to regularize the fitting process. In this way, the resulting predictions are on par with the validated model while they are tailored to the target ship's behavioral patterns. 
Although, improved prediction accuracy has been demonstrated, depending on the type of fitted parameters reliability to the model can be lost, if the parameters are not interpretable.
Unlike these approaches, the data-driven physics-based model introduced in this paper, which is based on the white-box model **Bjørum, "On the Manoeuvrability of Ships"**, focuses on optimizing interpretable parameters, making the results more accessible and understandable to domain experts.   \vspace{-4mm}


% This enables a direct relation between the model's output and the underlying physical and operational characteristics of the ship. While focusing parameter estimation on interpretable parameters might seem advantageous, it can lead to reduced reliability of the resulting model if the constraints imposed by the physics-based framework are not properly maintained.
% \textcolor{red}{Here, we need to describe how our approach differs to the above, for example depending on the open parameters interpretability can be lost and the fact that our physics-based model is Spyrou-based which implies .... also, here describe that if parameter estimation focuses on non interpretable parameters then the resulting model is not reliable. }
