\section{Evaluation}

We aim to answer the following research questions:

\begin{description}

\item[RQ1] How does the context of the focal method and other
  assertions in the test affect the model performance?

\item[RQ2] How does the performance of \assertfive compare to existing
  approaches?

\item[RQ3] Does \assertfive generate fault-detecting assertions for
  developer-written tests?

\end{description}
