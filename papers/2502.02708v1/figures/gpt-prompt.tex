    You will receive two code snippets that are written in the Java programming language.
    The first code snippet contains a test method, and the second code snippet is the focal method that is exercised by the test method.
    The test method snippet contains a masked \enquote{\(<\)ASSERTION\(>\)} part.
    Please suggest 10 different and suitable assertions for this masked statement, ranked by their suitability.
    Only return Java code!
    Only use the JUnit assertion methods \enquote{assertTrue}, \enquote{assertFalse}, \enquote{assertEquals}, \enquote{assertNotEquals}, \enquote{assertNull}, \enquote{assertNotNull}, \enquote{assertThrows}.
    Alternatively, assert expected exceptions using a try-catch and the \enquote{fail} method.
    Add an empty line between assertions.\\
