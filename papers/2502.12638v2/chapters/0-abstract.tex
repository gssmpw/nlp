%     3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material design. While prior efforts focus on 3D diffusion models for their benefits in modeling continuous 3D conformers, they overlook the advantages of 1D SELFIES-based Language Models (LMs), which are able to generate 100\% valid molecules and leverage the billion-scale 1D molecule datasets. To combine these advantages for 3D molecule generation, we propose a foundation model -- NExT-Mol: 3D Diffusion Meets 1D Language Modeling for 3D Molecule Generation. NExT-Mol uses an extensively pretrained molecule LM for 1D molecule generation, and subsequently predicts the generated molecule's 3D conformers with a 3D diffusion model. We enhance NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning. Notably, we demonstrate that incorporating 1D representations from our molecule LM improves the 3D diffusion model's conformer prediction by 1.3\% coverage-recall on GEOM-DRUGS. Given these improvements, NExT-Mol achieves leading performances in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation, 3D conformer prediction, and conditional 3D molecule generation, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a foundation model in the field. Our codes and pretrained checkpoints are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NExT-Mol}.

We enhance NExT-Mol's performance by scaling up the LM's model size, refining the diffusion neural architecture, and applying 1D to 3D transfer learning. Notably, our 1D molecule LM significantly outperforms baselines in distributional similarity while ensuring validity, and our 3D diffusion model achieves leading performances in conformer prediction. Given these improvements in 1D and 3D modeling, NExT-Mol achieves a 26\% relative improvement in 3D FCD for \textit{de novo} 3D generation on GEOM-DRUGS, and a 13\% average relative gain for conditional 3D generation on QM9-2014.
