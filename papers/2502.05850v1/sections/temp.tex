scale: 
(1) want a small model with a more or less accuracy
(2) want the best accuracy no matter how large of the model
(3) a usr defined design space of various sizes for differnt layers and get the best accuracy. 

(1) forks, one design targets two objectives. 
(2) branchs
(3) multi-objectives, 

multi-scope, co-optimization,
