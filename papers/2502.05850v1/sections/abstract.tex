This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two key issues: cross-stage co-optimization and optimization search. By seamlessly integrating programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming and leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization, the framework automates both top-down and bottom-up design flows, reducing the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. 
The proposed framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results underscore the novelty and potential of the proposed framework for automated, resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs.
