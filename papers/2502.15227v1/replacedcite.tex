Since Stanney et al. ____ identified the need to develop a better theoretical understanding of cybersickness, 
different models concerning sensory conflict, postural instability, etc., are in development, although this goal has yet to be fully achieved ____.

\subsection{Measuring Cybersickness}

Traditionally, researchers test the cybersickness level that a user experience with subjective questionnaires.

\subsubsection{Subjective Measures}
The simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) is widely adopted to quantify the cybersickness elicited by virtual reality ____. 
Although SSQ can capture the symptoms that users experience at the end of the experiment, it does not provide information about users' discomfort level in-between the start and the end of exposure.
Repeating SSQ takes a significant amount of time and could lead to higher reported symptoms due to demanding characteristics ____.
The Fast Motion Sickness Score (FMS) is an easy-to-administer, finely graded motion sickness measure where participants report their level of motion sickness on a scale from 0 (no sickness at all) to 20 (frank sickness) ____. 
FMS can be taken repeatedly throughout the exposure to a provocative stimulus so that the time course of motion sickness can be captured.

Each participant's discomfort score ratings can be used to calculate their average discomfort score (ADS) and relative discomfort score (RDS).
RDS captures the participant's relative performance if they terminate early ____, and has been widely used by researchers (e.g., ____). While subjective measures are widely used in assessing cybersickness, they have several limitations that impact their reliability, including their dependence on the user's ability to judge and recall their discomfort, and their inability to capture real-time fluctuations in discomfort and sickness levels.
