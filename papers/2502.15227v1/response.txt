\subsection{The Cause of Cybersickness}
Since Stanney et al., "Cybersickness: Perception and Physiological Response" identified the need to develop a better theoretical understanding of cybersickness, 
different models concerning sensory conflict, postural instability, etc., are in development, although this goal has yet to be fully achieved ____.
The sensory conflict theory claims that the cause of cybersickness is the discrepancy between the visual and inertial information.
The optical flow generated by virtual locomotion in VR specifies acceleration that does not correspond to the inertial force changes users can perceive ____.
On the other hand, the postural instability theory attributes cybersickness to prolonged exposure to postural instability ____.
In VR, optical flow does not fully correspond to the vestibular/inertial information in accordance with physical laws, creating difficulties for the user in stabilizing their posture.
Researchers have had success using postural data (sometimes in combination with other physiological signals) to predict cybersickness 
%\dd{____}
____. 
Although these two hypotheses disagree with each other in many aspects, both of them agree that 
%\dd{an earth-based rest frame }
Earth referents, which means elements of VR displays that are stable relative to the Earth ____,
should mitigate cybersickness ____.

\subsection{Measuring Cybersickness}

Traditionally, researchers test the cybersickness level that a user experience with subjective questionnaires.
However, objective cybersickness measures are still under exploration.

\subsubsection{Subjective Measures}
The simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) is widely adopted to quantify the cybersickness elicited by virtual reality ____.
Although SSQ can capture the symptoms that users experience at the end of the experiment, it does not provide information about users' discomfort level in-between the start and the end of exposure.
Repeating SSQ takes a significant amount of time and could lead to higher reported symptoms due to demanding characteristics ____.
The Fast Motion Sickness Score (FMS) is an easy-to-administer, finely graded motion sickness measure where participants report their level of motion sickness on a scale from 0 (no sickness at all) to 20 (frank sickness) ____.
FMS can be taken repeatedly throughout the exposure to a provocative stimulus so that the time course of motion sickness can be captured.
Fernandes and Feiner adapted the discomfort score developed by Rebenitsch and Owen, where participants were asked to rate their discomfort level from 0 (how they felt coming in) to 10 (severe discomfort) ____.
Each participant's discomfort score ratings can be used to calculate their average discomfort score (ADS) and relative discomfort score (RDS).
RDS captures the participant's relative performance if they terminate early ____, and has been widely used by researchers (e.g., ____). While subjective measures are widely used in assessing cybersickness, they have several limitations that impact their reliability, including their dependence on the user's ability to judge and recall their discomfort, and their inability to capture real-time fluctuations in discomfort and sickness levels.


\subsubsection{Objective Measures}
Objective measures aim to provide implicit, real-time, and continuous data on a user's levels of discomfort and cybersickness.  
Previous studies have identified various physiological signals that can serve as objective indicators of cybersickness symptoms. 
Among these, gastric activity measured by electrogastrogram (EGG) ____,
heart rate or heart rate variability measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) or Photoplethysmogram (PPG), 
brain activity measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ____,
electrodermal activity (EDA) ____,
eye movement behavior ____,
and postural activity data
%\dd{____}
____
have been explored as potential indicators of cybersickness.
Recent approaches have also used deep learning methods to analyze information about the visual scene, such as 3D motion flow, to estimate cybersickness symptoms ____.
Additionally, other approaches have integrated deep learning techniques with both physiological data and visual scene information to estimate and forecast cybersickness ____.
Despite their potential, objective measures are still not widely used due to their complexity, cost, and technical challenges in physiological data collection and analysis.


\subsection{Mitigating Cybersickness}
\subsubsection{Overview}
Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate cybersickness in VR (see Ang et al., "CyberSickness: A Review" ____ for a review).
Most of the software-based techniques, such as the dynamic FOV restrictor, rest frame, and peripheral blurring, try to reduce peripheral optical flow.
Peripheral vision plays an important role in motion perception because the human visual system is sensitive to certain aspects of motion ____.
However, there are also other factors that can influence perception ____.

Hardware-based techniques include galvanic vestibular stimulation ____,

Distraction ____,

However, there was a lack of a comparison between the software-based techniques that produced significant results.
Some of the techniques, like reverse flow visualization or geometry modification, can introduce undesirable visual effects in the fovea.
Additionally, the adoption of hardware-based techniques is limited because they require extra devices.
