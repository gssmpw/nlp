    In this paper, we propose \MethodName{}, a novel radiance field deblurring approach that can synthesize high-quality novel views from blurred training views with significantly reduced training time. 
    \MethodName{} leverages deep neural network (DNN)-based deblurring modules to enjoy their deblurring performance and computational efficiency. 
    To effectively combine DNN-based deblurring and radiance field construction, we propose a novel radiance field (RF)-guided deblurring and an iterative framework that performs RF-guided deblurring and radiance field construction in an alternating manner.
    Moreover, \MethodName{} is compatible with various scene representations, such as voxel grids and 3D Gaussians, expanding its applicability. 
    We also present \SynthDataName{}, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for training radiance field deblurring frameworks.
    We conduct extensive experiments on both camera motion blur and defocus blur, demonstrating that \MethodName{} achieves state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis quality with significantly reduced training time.
