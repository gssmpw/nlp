\paragraph{Our system was helpful in prompt engineering} We asked participants to rate the satisfaction, helpfulness, and effectiveness of the system in the following questions: (i) How satisfied are you with the performance of the system? (ii) This tool was helpful in improving my prompt. (iii) Using this tool made the process of prompt engineering more efficient. These questions were rated on a seven-point Likert scale. Figure X shows the results. 

Overall, all participants expressed high satisfaction with our system's performance. They thought the system was helpful to improve prompts and make prompt engineering more efficient. 

% actual participant number starts from 103, I will use P1 to represent 103, P2->104...
Without our system, the typical approach to prompt engineering was varied. 
P1 made LLM assume it is a human and provided LLM with as much context as possible. 
Participants (P2, P4, P5) used a general refining process, starting prompts from scratch, testing prompts on data points, adjusting prompts based on incorrectly labeled data, re-testing, and re-verifying until the participant was satisfied. 

The post-questionnaire showed that our system also provided insights for participants on prompt engineering: ``adding or deleting a few words can change the overall output (P1)'', ``I can compare how many labels are correctly labeled before and after modifying prompts (P2)\steven{I rephrased participant's wording. is that ok}''...\steven{add more later}. 
One participant (P5) mentioned ``I really like this tool instead of traditional prompt engineering on Chatgpt and Copilot conversations.''
