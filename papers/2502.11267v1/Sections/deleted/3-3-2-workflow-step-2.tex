\kenneth{Keep the sample}



%\subsubsection{Sample/Resample a random subset}

Users can randomly or sequentially sample data into the `Working Data Sample' tab. With Random Sample, users enter any whole number between 1 and the total number of the group IDs in the whole dataset. \system will then randomly select that number of groups from the dataset and copy them into the ``Working Data Sample'' tab. 
In Sequential Sample, users specify a range of group IDs, and \system will then import the data instances from the selected range of groups into the ``Working Data Sample'' tab.
Once the sampling starts, all data instances in the ``Working Data Sample' tab will be removed except ones that have `Keep it in the next data sample'' checked. 

\paragraph{Keep it in the next data sample} For instances that have ``Keep it in the next data sample'' checked, their group will remain in the later random or sequential sampling.

\paragraph{Annotation Note} Only the data instances in the ``Working Data Sample'' tab will be annotated once the ``Start Annotation'' button is clicked.
