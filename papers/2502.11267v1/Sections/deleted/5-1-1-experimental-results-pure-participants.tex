%\paragraph{Not accessing LLM Explanations and exploring more instances per iteration help participants on PITD}
 % Which setting helps participants on PITD?

%We further examined the effects of \textbf{LLM Explanation Access} and \textbf{the number of data instances per iteration}. 





%\paragraph{Does LLM Explanation Helps?}









% \steven{The following can only show that participants under that certain group had a higher ACC or lower MSE. It does not reflect the impact of our system.}
% In single conditions (Table~\ref{tab:single-condition-t-test}), focusing participants within one condition, \textbf{LY} participants achieved notably higher accuracy compared to LN and 50Y participants. 
% In addition, \textbf{LY} participants demonstrated significantly lower MSE than all other participants. 

% In the mixed conditions (Table~\ref{tab:mixed-condition-t-test}), which combined access to LLM explanation with exploring 50 instances per iteration conditions, LN-50Y participants showed a significantly lower accuracy than the rest of the conditions. 
% LY-50Y participants had significantly lower MSE than other participants, except LY-50N participants.
