% \steven{ending of related word}We wanted to design a system to bridge the gap of xxxx: a graphical interface implemented on Google Sheet add-on, generalizing to single-class data annotation tasks, without requiring extensive knowledge of programming and system configuration. By combining the widespread familiarity and advanced features of Google Sheets with large-scale data annotation and iteration tracking, we aimed to make it easier for people to experiment with and benefit from LLMs.
