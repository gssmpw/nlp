%\paragraph{Having the flexibility to structure tasks freely and make adjustments on the go—whether modifying the Gold Shots or the Rule Book—reduces the burden of the traditional, iterative labeling process.}
We asked participants, in a free-text format, ``\textit{(Q10) What features did you find most useful?}'' Fourteen participants specifically mentioned that `Gold Shots' were particularly valuable, as they provided explicit examples to guide LLMs. 
Additionally, six participants highlighted the usefulness of the Rule Book. 
These two features stood out among the responses, demonstrating their importance in enhancing the user experience.
Participants noted that the flexibility to structure tasks freely and make on-the-fly adjustments---such as modifying the Gold Shots or Rule Book---eases the burden of the traditional iterative labeling process.
