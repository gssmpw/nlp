\section{Overview}

\revision{In this section, we first explain the foundational concept of Hausdorff distance-based penetration depth algorithms, which are essential for understanding our method (Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminary}).
We then provide a brief overview of our proposed RT-based penetration depth algorithm (Sec.~\ref{subsec:algo_overview}).}

\subsection{Overview of the RTPD Algorithm}\label{subsec:algo_overview}
Fig.~\ref{fig:Overview} presents an overview of our RTPD algorithm.
It is grounded in the Hausdorff distance-based penetration depth calculation method (Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminary}).
%, similar to that of Tang et al.~\shortcite{SIG09HIST}.
The process consists of two primary phases: penetration surface extraction and Hausdorff distance calculation.
We leverage the RTX platform's capabilities to accelerate both of these steps.

The penetration surface extraction phase focuses on identifying the overlapped region between two objects.
\revision{The penetration surface is defined as a set of polygons from one object, where at least one of its vertices lies within the other object. 
Note that in our work, we focus on triangles rather than general polygons, as they are processed most efficiently on the RTX platform.}
To facilitate this extraction, we introduce a ray-tracing-based \revision{Point-in-Polyhedron} test (RT-PIP), significantly accelerated through the use of RT cores (Sec.~\ref{sec:RT-PIP}).
This test capitalizes on the ray-surface intersection capabilities of the RTX platform.
%
Initially, a Geometry Acceleration Structure (GAS) is generated for each object, as required by the RTX platform.
The RT-PIP module takes the GAS of one object (e.g., $GAS_{A}$) and the point set of the other object (e.g., $P_{B}$).
It outputs a set of points (e.g., $P_{\partial B}$) representing the penetration region, indicating their location inside the opposing object.
Subsequently, a penetration surface (e.g., $\partial B$) is constructed using this point set (e.g., $P_{\partial B}$) (Sec.~\ref{subsec:surfaceGen}).
%
The generated penetration surfaces (e.g., $\partial A$ and $\partial B$) are then forwarded to the next step. 

The Hausdorff distance calculation phase utilizes the ray-surface intersection test of the RTX platform (Sec.~\ref{sec:RT-Hausdorff}) to compute the Hausdorff distance between two objects.
We introduce a novel Ray-Tracing-based Hausdorff DISTance algorithm, RT-HDIST.
It begins by generating GAS for the two penetration surfaces, $P_{\partial A}$ and $P_{\partial B}$, derived from the preceding step.
RT-HDIST processes the GAS of a penetration surface (e.g., $GAS_{\partial A}$) alongside the point set of the other penetration surface (e.g., $P_{\partial B}$) to compute the penetration depth between them.
The algorithm operates bidirectionally, considering both directions ($\partial A \to \partial B$ and $\partial B \to \partial A$).
The final penetration depth between the two objects, A and B, is determined by selecting the larger value from these two directional computations.

%In the Hausdorff distance calculation step, we compute the Hausdorff distance between given two objects using a ray-surface-intersection test. (Sec.~\ref{sec:RT-Hausdorff}) Initially, we construct the GAS for both $\partial A$ and $\partial B$ to utilize the RT-core effectively. The RT-based Hausdorff distance algorithms then determine the Hausdorff distance by processing the GAS of one object (e.g. $GAS_{\partial A}$) and set of the vertices of the other (e.g. $P_{\partial B}$). Following the Hausdorff distance definition (Eq.~\ref{equation:hausdorff_definition}), we compute the Hausdorff distance to both directions ($\partial A \to \partial B$) and ($\partial B \to \partial A$). As a result, the bigger one is the final Hausdorff distance, and also it is the penetration depth between input object $A$ and $B$.


%the proposed RT-based penetration depth calculation pipeline.
%Our proposed methods adopt Tang's Hausdorff-based penetration depth methods~\cite{SIG09HIST}. The pipeline is divided into the penetration surface extraction step and the Hausdorff distance calculation between the penetration surface steps. However, since Tang's approach is not suitable for the RT platform in detail, we modified and applied it with appropriate methods.

%The penetration surface extraction step is extracting overlapped surfaces on other objects. To utilize the RT core, we use the ray-intersection-based PIP(Point-In-Polygon) algorithms instead of collision detection between two objects which Tang et al.~\cite{SIG09HIST} used. (Sec.~\ref{sec:RT-PIP})
%RT core-based PIP test uses a ray-surface intersection test. For purpose this, we generate the GAS(Geometry Acceleration Structure) for each object. RT core-based PIP test takes the GAS of one object (e.g. $GAS_{A}$) and a set of vertex of another one (e.g. $P_{B}$). Then this computes the penetrated vertex set of another one (e.g. $P_{\partial B}$). To calculate the Hausdorff distance, these vertex sets change to objects constructed by penetrated surface (e.g. $\partial B$). Finally, the two generated overlapped surface objects $\partial A$ and $\partial B$ are used in the Hausdorff distance calculation step.
