        Comparison of processing times for penetration depth calculation using the CPU-based implementation based on the state-of-the-art method ($CPU_{Tang}$~\cite{SIG09HIST}), CUDA-based GPU implementation ($GPU_{CUDA}$), and our ray-tracing core-based method ($RTPD$).
        Left: Bunny benchmark. Right: Lucy benchmark.
        The black lines represent the ground truth, while the white lines indicate the results from our method.
        Our method achieved speedups of up to 37.66x and 5.33x compared to $CPU_{Tang}$ and $GPU_{CUDA}$, respectively.
