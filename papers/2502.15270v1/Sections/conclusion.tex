\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of non-resettable device identifiers in custom Android systems. We design an end-to-end approach to identify sensitive and vulnerable custom system properties and settings in the wild. 
By applying our approach to \datasetsize custom Android ROMs, we have identified thousands of vulnerable system properties and settings, and further validation through remote real-device testing confirmed our findings.
Through comparison, our approach outperforms existing work in scalability, efficiency and vulnerability coverage.
We also investigated the root reasons for such vulnerabilities, including overlooked system properties and settings, overly complex access control rules, and additional access channels for system properties. We also observed that the same vulnerable implementations usually recur across devices from the same brand.
Our study highlights the need for greater scrutiny of additional access channels to non-resettable device identifiers and the importance of better solutions to safeguard user privacy during system customizations.
