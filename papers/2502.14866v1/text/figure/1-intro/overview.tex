    \caption{\system system overview. 
    In prefilling stage, \system processes both dense heads and streaming heads within a fused sparse attention kernel. Past Keys and Values are stored in two separate paging systems: one for streaming heads and the other for dense heads. In decoding stage, \system applies dynamic sparsity on dense heads with a page selection procedure. Only selected KV Pages will be loaded for the decoding stage attention.
    We omit normalization layers and residual connections in this figure for the sake of simplicity. }
