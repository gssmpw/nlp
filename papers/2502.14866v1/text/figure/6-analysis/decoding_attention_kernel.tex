    \caption{\textbf{Efficiency gains from static and dynamic sparsity in \system}. These sparsity patterns contribute to a compound speedup effect, with static sparsity being more effective at shorter contexts, and dynamic sparsity offering greater benefits at longer contexts. We report the latency of a single attention layer in Llama-2-7B.}
