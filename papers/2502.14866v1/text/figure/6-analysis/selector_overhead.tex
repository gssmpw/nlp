    \caption{\textbf{Effect of Reusable Page Selection}. The overhead of the dynamic page selector is significant, as its complexity increases linearly with input sequence length. Our \textit{Reusable Page Selection} effectively mitigates this issue. The latency breakdown is evaluated on Llama-3-8B.}
