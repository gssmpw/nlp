    \caption{\textbf{End-to-end speedup breakdown in \system}: Consistent with findings from attention layer analysis, static sparsity (50\% streaming heads) yields greater benefits at shorter context lengths. In contrast, dynamic sparsity achieves up to \textbf{4.5$\times$} end-to-end speedup for longer sequences. Results are based on measurements using Llama-3-8B with unit batch size.}
