    \caption{\textbf{Decoding Speed Evaluation}. The y-axis indicates the relative throughput of each system, normalized by the speed of \system. Note that MInference exhibits limited decoding performance due to its unoptimized decoding stage with \textbf{dense attention}, but when integrated into vLLM, it can achieve throughput comparable to that of vLLM.
