    \caption{Hierarchical Paging in \system system. We assume the each \textit{physical page} contains $N_p = 8$ tokens and each \textit{logical page} has $N_l = 4$ tokens. The $k_{max}$ and $k_{min}$ vectors are concatenated to the end of each \textit{physical page}, and are pre-computed during the context stage and previous decoding steps. The importance of each \textit{physical page} is decided by the max of the importance scores of the \textit{logical pages} it contains. We omitted KV quantization in this figure for the sake of simplicity. %
