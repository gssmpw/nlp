\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

We demonstrate interactive post-capture refocusing of dense and sparse LFs with arbitrarily selected single or multiple volumetric regions. Our method employ the shift-and-sum algorithm with pixel-dependent depths to achieve simultaneous in-focus and out-of-focus regions having the same depth range. We almost completely eliminate ghosting artifacts resulted due to the undersampling of sparse LFs by using a U-Net based deep learning model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method achieves impressive results for both dense and sparse LFs. Furthermore, our method is fast and achieves near real-time processing for sparse LFs. Future work includes design of hardware architectures to efficiently implement the proposed method for real-time interactive LF refocusing. 

%providing solutions to refocus only on interested objects or regions while keeping rest of the area out-of-focus. Furthermore, we provide end-to-end pipelines for dense LFs as well as sparse LFs enabling volumetric refocusing on sparse LFs. In the future, we hope to improve the accuracy and the speed of the $\alpha$ value search and disparity map estimation.
