\begin{abstract}
A four-dimensional light field (LF) captures both textural and geometrical information of a scene in contrast to a two-dimensional image that captures only the textural information of a scene. Post-capture refocusing is an exciting application of LFs enabled by the geometric information captured. Previously proposed LF refocusing methods are mostly limited to the refocusing of single planar or volumetric region of a scene corresponding to a depth range and cannot simultaneously generate in-focus and out-of-focus regions having the same depth range. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end pipeline to simultaneously refocus multiple arbitrary planar or volumetric regions of a dense or a sparse LF. We employ pixel-dependent shifts with the typical shift-and-sum method to refocus an LF. The pixel-dependent shifts enables to refocus each pixel of an LF independently. For sparse LFs, the shift-and-sum method introduces ghosting artifacts due to the spatial undersampling. We employ a deep learning model based on U-Net architecture to almost completely eliminate the ghosting artifacts. The experimental results obtained with several LF datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, sparse LFs refocused with the proposed method archive structural similarity index higher than $0.9$ despite having only $20\%$ of data compared to dense LFs. 


%Post-capture refocusing is an attractive application of Light fields (LFs). Most of the existing LF refocusing methods can only refocus at a single depth and manual search of parameters is required. In this paper, we propose an automated end-to-end pipeline for LF post-capture refocusing at multiple arbitrary-volumes simultaneously in real-time. The proposed method is not necessarily restricted to dense LFs like most of the existing methods but explore the possibilities with sparse LFs with less number of sub-aperture images (SAIs). We provide two variations for dense LFs and sparse LFs. The experiments on several popular datasets shows that our algorithms achieves a good balance between the quality and speed.
