\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.5em}
In this paper, we introduced STAF as a novel approach to enhancing INRs. Our work mitigates the limitations of conventional ReLU neural networks, particularly their spectral bias which impedes the reconstruction of fine details in target signals. Through experimentation, we demonstrated that STAF significantly outperforms SOTA models like FINER, INCODE, and Fourier features in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and PSNR value. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of STAF in capturing high-frequency details more precisely, which is crucial for applications in computer graphics and data compression. The parametric, trainable nature of STAF allows for adaptive learning tailored to the specific characteristics of the input signals, resulting in superior reconstruction quality. Moreover, our theoretical analysis provided insights into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the improved performance of STAF. By combining the strengths of the Fourier series with the flexibility of neural networks, STAF presents a powerful tool for various high-fidelity signal processing tasks.
