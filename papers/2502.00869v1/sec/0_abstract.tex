% Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling continuous signals.  However, conventional ReLU-based networks suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained details in target signals. We introduce \textbf{S}inusoidal \textbf{T}rainable \textbf{A}ctivation \textbf{F}unctions \textbf{(STAF)}, designed to model and reconstruct diverse complex signals with high precision. STAF significantly mitigates spectral bias, allowing faster learning of high-frequency details compared to ReLU networks. We demonstrate STAF's superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks in both signal representations and inverse problems, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence with superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Our extensive experimental evaluation establishes STAF's effectiveness in improving the reconstruction quality and training efficiency of continuous signals, making them valuable for various applications in computer graphics and related fields.
Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling continuous signals. The spectral bias of ReLU-based networks is a well-established limitation, restricting their ability to capture fine-grained details in target signals. While previous works have attempted to mitigate this issue through frequency-based encodings or architectural modifications, these approaches often introduce additional complexity and do not fully address the underlying challenge of learning high-frequency components efficiently. We introduce \textbf{S}inusoidal \textbf{T}rainable \textbf{A}ctivation \textbf{F}unctions \textbf{(STAF)}, designed to directly tackle this limitation by enabling networks to adaptively learn and represent complex signals with higher precision and efficiency. STAF inherently modulates its frequency components, allowing for self-adaptive spectral learning. This capability significantly improves convergence speed and expressivity, making STAF highly effective for both signal representations and inverse problems. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that STAF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in accuracy and reconstruction fidelity with superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). These results establish STAF as a robust solution for overcoming spectral bias and the capacity-convergence gap, making it valuable for computer graphics and related fields.
