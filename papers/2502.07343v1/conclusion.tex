\section{CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK}
In this paper, we propose a novel ANNS index, \method, for the hybrid vector query problem, \revision{which comprises three novel components: the greedy Pareto frontier search algorithm, the dynamic edge pruning strategy, and the edge seed method.} %To compute a candidate neighbor set comprising approximate nearest neighbors under varying $\alpha$ values, we introduce a greedy Pareto frontier search algorithm. To dynamically apply the pruning strategy of the Relative Neighborhood Graph for edge pruning, we develop a novel dynamic edge pruning strategy. Additionally, to select appropriate seeds for the graph index in the \hvq problem, we present a new edge seed method. This work opens up a promising research direction for designing novel ANNS indexes for hybrid vector queries. 
One possible future direction is to extend our proposed index to multi-vector queries, where each object involves more than two vectors. Another potential direction is to develop a disk-based version of our index, making it suitable for implementation in vector databases.
