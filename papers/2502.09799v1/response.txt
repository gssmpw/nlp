\section{RELATED WORK}
% Our research draws on literature in three key areas. First, we build on the extensive background of Project-Based Learning (PBL), exploring both the benefits it offers and the challenges it presents for teachers. Second, we engage with the expanding body of research on AI-based tools in education, particularly focusing on large language model (LLM)-based tools that bolster and enhance the pedagogical practices commonly employed in PBL. Finally, we build on prior research in the co-design of educational tools, emphasizing the collaborative development process to create AI solutions that meet the unique needs of educators. 

\subsection{Project-Based Learning}


Rooted in constructivist learning theories, project-based learning (PBL) places students at the center of the learning process, challenging conventional education practices and redefining the roles of teaching, learning, and school organization [1]  
Unlike problem-based learning, which promotes deductive reasoning [2],  and involves structured evaluation based on how well a student’s solution addresses a defined problem [3], PBL allows students to explore real-world issues and develop their own solutions [4]. 
AI's capacity to personalize learning is beneficial in PBL settings where differentiated instruction is crucial [5]. AI tools can support targeted instruction by tailoring lessons for diverse learners, encouraging student iteration on artifacts, and adapting materials to individual student strengths and weaknesses [6] . 

%Helping students manage time and materials efficiently, tools like Trello and Cronofy, integrated with AI plug-ins, can predict resource needs  ____. 
AI-assisted design tools like Autodesk Dreamcatcher and intelligent project management software such as Asana and Monday.com can facilitate student project management, allowing them to focus on creative and critical thinking [7].


%AI has shown potential in improving the quality of collaboration for project completion and knowledge construction ____. 
Considering project collaboration and knowledge construction [8], research scholars have discussed how AI can evaluate group performance by analyzing interaction patterns and predicting outcomes based on academic and behavioral data, enabling more effective grouping strategies [9]. AI systems can also guide students toward productive problem-solving, suggesting activities on collaborative styles, and pedagogical interventions to improve group work [10] . 

% Tan, Lee, and Lee (2022) discuss how AI techniques can evaluate group performance by analyzing metrics such as tone, relevance, and interaction patterns ____. This analysis helps teachers and students understand how group dynamics influence learning outcomes and how they can be improved. 
% AI can also predict group performance based on various factors, including students’ academic performance, interests, and behavioral data, allowing for more effective grouping strategies ____. 
% AI can also provide real-time feedback to improve interaction patterns during collaborative activities. For instance, AI agents can guide students towards more productive problem-solving behaviors, recommend specific activities based on collaborative styles, and even suggest pedagogical interventions to tutors for improving group work ____. 
% These capabilities are particularly valuable in PBL settings, where collaboration and teamwork are essential for project completion and knowledge construction.
Considering grading in PBL, AI-powered assessment systems, such as Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Automated Written Corrective Feedback (AWCF), can offer real-time, continuous feedback, helping students to refine their work iteratively [11]. These systems not only reduce the teacher's workload but also enhance the accuracy and efficiency of grading, allowing teachers to focus on more meaningful interactions with students [12]. AI can also support formative assessment practices in PBL by providing insights into students' progress, helping teachers guide and support students more effectively [13].

Despite potential benefits, integrating LLMs into PBL presents challenges, such as biased algorithms, that necessitates careful design and human oversight to ensure fairness and accuracy in assessment and feedback [14]. Comprehensive PD is needed for teachers to use LLM tools responsibly and equitably [15], understand their long-term effects across age groups and subject areas, and address ethical concerns like data privacy [16]. In our current work, we aim to overcome some of these challenges by co-designing GenAI-powered support systems with \textit{teachers} in PBL settings. {This is unlike recent studies that have focused on co-designing these tools with \textit{students} in the higher education contexts [17] . We also examine challenges more unique to K-12 PBL, that emphasizes scaffolding and skill-building [18].} 

\subsection{Co-designing Educational Tools with Teachers}

Co-design is a collaborative, iterative process where teachers, researchers, and developers jointly design, prototype, and evaluate educational tools %each with clearly defined roles
[19]. This approach leverages stakeholders' expertise to address concrete educational needs, making it well-suited for creating technology-enhanced learning environments that are contextually relevant and practical for real-world classrooms [20]. Studies have documented the co-design of mobile science applications, scripted wiki environments, and other educational technologies that support authentic scientific inquiry and other pedagogical practices [21].

Involving teachers in the co-design process enhances development efficiency, increases teacher agency and ownership, and promotes higher adoption rates and sustained use of educational tools beyond the initial study [22]. %Participation fosters ownership, leading to higher adoption rates and integration into teaching practices ____. 
Co-design can also serve as a form of professional development, enabling teachers to deepen their understanding of new technologies and explore ways to incorporate them into instructional strategies [23]. Because co-design fosters a more reciprocal and participatory approach {[24]}, it has the potential to upend the traditional, unidirectional process of educational technology  ____ and enables teachers to engage with complex topics beyond their expertise [25]. %contributing to tool development while learning from the process ____. 
Furthermore, co-design has the potential to influence the broader sociocultural context of schools and drive systemic change in educational technology design and implementation by reshaping power dynamics and promoting an ethics of care within educational research and design [26]. {Scholars have however noted that involving teachers in the human centered design process happens less often in K-12 settings compared to higher education ____.}


%This can drive systemic changes in how educational technologies are developed, implemented, and sustained within schools.
% In addition to its impact on teacher learning, past research has considered how teachers participate in the design of technology-enhanced learning environments ____. For example, studies have documented the co-design of mobile science applications, scripted wiki environments, and other educational technologies that support authentic scientific inquiry and other pedagogical practices ____. These efforts underscore the importance of involving teachers in the design process to ensure that the resulting tools are functional and aligned with their students' educational goals and needs.

% \textbf{To the best of our knowledge, no existing studies have documented a co-design process with K-12 teachers aimed at integrating GenAI into project-based learning pedagogy. Given the unprecedented and rapidly advancing nature of GenAI, along with its potential to address the unique challenges of PBL and the ethical considerations it entails, our research is particularly timely. Our findings and empirical evidence also provide valuable insights into shaping the future use of GenAI in PBL, }\textit{\textbf{guiding}}\textbf{ and }\textit{\textbf{encouraging}}\textbf{ its responsible and effective implementation.}
