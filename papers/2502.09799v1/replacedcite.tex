\section{RELATED WORK}
% Our research draws on literature in three key areas. First, we build on the extensive background of Project-Based Learning (PBL), exploring both the benefits it offers and the challenges it presents for teachers. Second, we engage with the expanding body of research on AI-based tools in education, particularly focusing on large language model (LLM)-based tools that bolster and enhance the pedagogical practices commonly employed in PBL. Finally, we build on prior research in the co-design of educational tools, emphasizing the collaborative development process to create AI solutions that meet the unique needs of educators. 

\subsection{Project-Based Learning}

% \textbf{Core Concepts and Practices in PBL: }PBL is deeply rooted in constructivist learning theories, which suggest that students achieve a deeper understanding of content when they actively "construct and reconstruct" knowledge through direct experience and interaction with the world ____.  At its core, PBL involves students engaging in complex, real-world tasks over an extended period, resulting in the creation of artifacts such as reports, models, and presentations ____. These artifacts serve as tangible representations of students' learning and are often shared with an audience, further enhancing the relevance and authenticity of the learning experience ____.
% The structure of PBL is typically characterized by several key steps: students and/or teachers identify an open-ended question or problem to address, students conduct research to explore potential solutions, they create artifacts that encapsulate their new ideas, and finally, they present these artifacts to an audience ____ . Crucially, the driving questions in PBL are often situated within ill-defined problem spaces, allowing for multiple solutions and diverse learning pathways ____. This approach not only fosters creativity and critical thinking but also places control of the learning process in the hands of students, encouraging them to take ownership of their projects.
