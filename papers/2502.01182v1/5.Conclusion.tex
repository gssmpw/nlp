\section{Conclusion}


In this work, we introduced \ours, a pivot-based single model ensemble framework, to enhance translation in scenarios where parallel data are scarce.
By transferring knowledge from diverse pivot languages, we were able to obtain not only diverse but also high-quality candidates.
And the optimal path to generating the best candidate varies per sentence, our study underscores the significance of exploiting a spectrum of pivot languages.
Moreover, the single model generation process offers cost savings compared to multi-model ensemble approaches. 
Empirical results and qualitative analyses show that the proposed method can yield contextually suitable translations for the given source sentences by leveraging pivoted candidates.
