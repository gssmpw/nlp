\section*{Limitations}


Despite \ours utilizes candidates obtained via pivoting, limitations arise from the nature of pivot translation.
Constraining the pivot language to high-resource languages can limit the number of candidates because pivoting through low-resource languages can lead to some loss of information due to error propagation inherent in the two-step translation.
This semantic shift potentially causes a decrease in candidate quality. 
If the quality of candidates declines, improvements from the ensemble might not be significant, indicating a limitation in the number of pivot paths.
