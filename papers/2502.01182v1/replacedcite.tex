\minisection{Pivot-based approaches}
Pivot translation is an approach that decomposes the translation task into two sequential steps____.
By transferring knowledge from high-resource pivot languages, pivoting is especially effective in translation between low-resource languages ____.
In this study, pivot translation enables us to obtain high-quality candidates for the ensemble.
____ discusses a pivot-based transfer learning technique where source$\rightarrow$pivot and pivot$\rightarrow$target models are first trained separately, then use pre-trained models to initialize the source$\rightarrow$target model, allowing effective training of a single, direct NMT model.
____ further investigate the transfer learning approach by utilizing auxiliary monolingual data.


Pivot translation typically employs English as the bridge language.
Nonetheless, previous studies have explored the use of diverse pivot languages, taking into account factors such as data size and the relationships between languages____.
By leveraging the ability of pivot translation to produce diverse outputs, several studies have focused on generating paraphrases____.
More recently, ____ uses pivot translation for ensemble, but it requires computing token-level probabilities and fails to improve translation.
Our work shares the motivation with these studies, generating translations depending on the pivot path to obtain a variety of candidates.


\minisection{Ensemble in NLG tasks}
Ensemble learning is a widely adopted strategy to obtain more accurate predictions by employing multiple systems____.
In NMT, the traditional approach involves averaging the probability distributions of the next target token, which is predicted at each decoding step by multiple models ____ or by different snapshots____.
When multiple sources are available, an ensemble can be conducted with predictions obtained by different sources~\cite {firat-etal-2016-zero}.
Also, a token-level ensemble through vocabulary alignment across LLMs has also been proposed____.
However, these methods are not applicable to recent black-box models as they cannot compute token-level probabilities at decoding time.


Selection-based ensemble has also been explored, which chooses the final output among the existing candidates.
This can be achieved through majority voting by selecting the most frequent one____ or selecting the best candidate with QE____.
Recently, MBR decoding____, which aims to find the hypothesis with the highest expected utility, has gained attention.
However, this approach limits the final output space to the existing candidate pool.

On the other hand, the generation-based ensemble method involves generating a new final prediction.
Fusion-in-Decoder____ proposes an architecture that aggregates additional information with a given input.
More recently, within the context of LLMs, ____ and ____ investigate a method of using LLMs to generate multiple outputs and aggregate them.
Generating new output through LLMs offers the benefit of explicitly harnessing their pre-trained knowledge within the ensemble process.
