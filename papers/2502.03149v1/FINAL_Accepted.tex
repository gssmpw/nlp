		\begin{abstract}
			Secure resource management (SRM) within a cloud computing environment is a critical yet infrequently studied research topic. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and comparative performance evaluation of potential cyber threat countermeasure strategies that address security challenges during cloud workload execution and resource management. Cybersecurity is explored specifically in the context of cloud resource management, with an emphasis on identifying the associated challenges. The cyber threat countermeasure methods are categorized into three classes: \textit{defensive strategies}, \textit{mitigating strategies}, and \textit{hybrid strategies}. The existing countermeasure strategies belonging to each class  are thoroughly discussed and compared. In addition to conceptual and theoretical analysis, the leading countermeasure strategies within these categories are implemented on a common platform and examined using two real-world virtual machine (VM) data traces. Based on this comprehensive study and performance evaluation, the paper discusses the trade-offs among these countermeasure strategies and their utility, providing imperative concluding remarks on the holistic study of cloud cyber threat countermeasures and secure resource management. Furthermore, the study suggests future methodologies that could effectively address the emerging challenges of secure cloud resource management.

		\section{Introduction}	\IEEEPARstart{C}{loud} 
		Computing has become an indispensable platform for all the industries, academia, business enterprises, social web-networks, etc. to serve the precise needs and provide the service features, tools and applications as per their requirements to help them meet their workloads processing, networking, and storage demands \cite{szefer2011eliminating,zhang2022two, saxena2022high, bi2024arima,swain2024intelligent,yadav2020adaptive}.  Within cloud data centers (CDC)s, the workload or online transactions are processed at outsourced cloud resources equipped with virtualization technology enabling resource sharing among multiple users \cite{feng2018privacy,{yadav2021managing}, shen2017block,liu2015two}. The virtualization of cloud resources  improve resource utilization and enables users to  switch their demands dynamically and pay accordingly \cite{saxena2023performance,barroso2013datacenter, chhabra2023secure,ding2018dfa, yu2014security}. Otherhand, the discrepancies and unpatched susceptibilities developed during virtualization prompts security breaches, sensitive data hampering, and severe cyber threats. The vulnerable VMs and hypervisors expedite the occurrence of cyberattacks \cite{saxena2023ai,saxena2023emerging}. An adversary or hacker may initiate multiple VMs for exploiting the VMs and hypervisor vulnerabilities in multiple ways to launch a cyber threat on one or multiple target VM(s) \cite{yin2022cloud,yuan2020minimizing,zhang2022trust}. The mismanagement during
physical resource distribution yields co-residency and creation of side-channels resulting into adversary VM appealing security threats such as leakage of user's confidential data, hampering of
data, unauthorized access via insecure interfaces, hijacking of 
accounts, etc. \cite{zhao2024cooperative, saxena2024high, yu2014security, liang2017mitigating}.  Therefore, procuring the SRM within cloud infrastructure has become a key challenge for  the stakeholders and Cloud Service Providers (CSP)s.


%\par   
\subsection{Motivation}
Cyber threats are gobbling up the utility of the cloud services for the beneficiaries, including cloud service providers  as well as the end users. According to the estimation of Norton Security, in 2023, cyber criminals will
be breaching 33 billion records per year \cite{cloud2021security}. A recent survey focusing on security breaches of cloud data marked the biggest cloud cyber threats of millions of users' sensitive data that have surpassed on-premise breaches \cite{attacks2022}. It reports that even the giant cloud service providers  including Facebook, Alibaba, LinkedIn, Accenture, Sina Weibo, etc.  have failed to serve the secure service management to the users. These cyber threats have witnessed  the misconfiguration and mismanagement
associated with the virtualization technology at the cloud platform are the topmost causes of leakage of terabytes of sensitive data of millions of cloud users across the world \cite{cloud2020security,yadav2018adaptive, alouffi2021systematic, yadav2017mereg}. 
The security loopholes that generate during inefficient workload distribution and resource management  expedites VM security threats. Correspondingly, if the mismanagement and inefficiency during resource allocation are deliberately handled by detecting underlying  vulnerability with the concern of security, ample of security breaches that hamper users' sensitive information can be interrupted or halted. These facts generate a strong motivation for a  comprehensive survey analysis of existing countermeasure strategies against security threats  to address the the critical  objectives of imparting security during physical resource allocation in cloud environments.



\subsection{Secure Cloud Resource Management Viewpoint }
The context and utility of securing cloud resource management is exhibited in Fig.  \ref{fig:fig1securityoverview} through an interactive information flow among users' \textit{A}pplications, \textit{W}eb of servers, and \textit{C}loud data center infrastructure. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{fig1_securityOverview}
	\caption{Security perspective in cloud resource management}
	\label{fig:fig1securityoverview}
\end{figure}
The heterogeneous workload applications from a wide range of sources such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT), cyberphysical systems, smart devices, and online healthcare, etc. send their data processing requests to the web of servers within cloud infrastructure. Each server is equipped with high computing and storage resources, the hypervisor enables deployment of various number and capacities of VMs for execution of user applications {\cite{yadav2017mums}}. The cloud infrastructure comprising of scalable storage, networking, and computing resources serving execution of extensive range of cloud applications such as GMail, Youtube, Facebook, etc. is supported by the virtualization layer deployment using Docker, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Kubernetes, etc.  Considering a broader view of scheduling and distribution of multiple users' applications, it has been observed that the virtual resources are allocated negligently or lacking security perspective of  workload processing.  However, as discussed in the motivation that the security loopholes that are generated during inefficient workload distribution and resource management open the doors to VM security threats. To this context, security becomes the major concern during resource allocation and mangement. As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1securityoverview}, the intended security is addressed at various level of service management with the help of \textit{Application Security Management}, \textit{Secure VM Management}, \textit{Secure Resource Scheduling}, \textit{Security Attack Factors Analysis}, and \textit{Secure Workload Execution Database}. By inducing and utilizing various levels of security management during cloud resource management, the cybersecurity associated with sensitive workload processing and confidential transactions get enhanced.  



\subsection{Research Challenges}
The cloud computing environment is highly obliged to provide secure workload processing and data communication to serve the reliable and secure services to the users. To maintain effective security along with performance-efficiency is a compelling feature that drives the users' trust and dependence with reliability for the heterogeneous cloud services. Nevertheless, securing the cloud infrastructure and intended resource management is a complex problem entangled with some major challenges as discussed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Misconfigured Resources}: {Misconfiguration of physical and virtual resources is one of the most significant security challenges in cloud environments. Such misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit. For instance, the Capital One breach in 2019 resulted from a misconfigured web application firewall, allowing attackers to access sensitive data of over 100 million customers \cite{capitalone2019}. There is a need of developing automated configuration management tools using machine learning algorithms to continuously monitor and rectify configuration vulnerabilities in real-time.}

    \item \textit{Heterogeneous/Unknown Users}: The  shared nature of the cloud complicates resource allocation among a diverse user base, including both legitimate users and potential adversaries. {For example, resource schedulers may struggle to identify malicious VMs from unknown users, leading to potential threats. The attacks against cloud services by the Lizard Squad illustrate how attackers can leverage shared resources to mask their activities \cite{lizard2014}. This challenge motivates to enhance user profiling and anomaly detection techniques using AI to accurately identify and mitigate malicious activities in heterogeneous environments.}

    \item \textit{External Data Sharing}: Weak security measures can facilitate unauthorized access to confidential data. The Equifax breach in 2017 is a stark reminder, where attackers exploited a vulnerability in an open-source web application framework to access sensitive personal data of 147 million consumers \cite{equifax2017}. {To effectively protect sensitive data during transfers, researchers must explore robust data-sharing frameworks that incorporate end-to-end encryption and fine-grained access controls.}

    \item \textit{Different Levels of Data Sensitivity}: The variation in data sensitivity across different users complicates the application of uniform security mechanisms. For instance, healthcare data is subject to strict regulations like HIPAA, while other data types may not require such stringent measures \cite{mishra2024global}.  {This challenge raises critical concerns for investigating adaptive security solutions that dynamically adjust protections based on the sensitivity of the data being processed can enhance overall security effectiveness.}

    \item \textit{Uncontrolled Network Connectivity}: Adversaries can exploit network pathways to launch attacks against virtual machines (VMs). {The Mirai botnet attack in 2016 demonstrated how compromised IoT devices could be used to exploit network connections and launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on cloud services \cite{yuan2020minimizing}.} 

    \item \textit{Insecure Load Balancing}: Load balancers often prioritize efficiency, which can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities. For example, traditional load balancing strategies may overlook security checks during VM allocation, exposing the infrastructure to threats. {The solution countermeasure should focus on integrating security assessments into load-balancing algorithms to ensure optimal resource distribution while maintaining security, using techniques like threat modeling and risk assessment.}
\end{itemize}



 \subsection{SRM  Objectives} 
 The major research objectives of secure resource allocation and management in cloud environments include:


 \begin{itemize}
     \item \textit{Defense against malicious links among VMs}: To implement measures to detect and block malignant or suspicious connections between VMs to prevent the spread of malware and unauthorized data access.

     \item \textit{Preventing unauthorized access}: To enforce strict network segmentation and access controls to ensure that only authorized VMs can communicate with each other, for reducing the risk of unauthorized data transfers.

     \item \textit{Mitigating malicious effects in multi-tenancy}: To deploy isolation techniques and monitoring to minimize the impact of malicious activities in multi-tenant environments.

     \item \textit{Eliminating security vulnerabilities}: To conduct regular security assessments, manage security loopholes, and perform vulnerability scanning to identify and eliminate weaknesses in the cloud infrastructure.

     \item \textit{Minimizing the sharing of resources}: To employ resource allocation policies that limit the extent of shared resources among tenants,  the risk of cross-tenant attacks and data breaches gets reduced.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}
To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper which aims to carry out a comprehensive comparative study and associated performance evaluation of the cloud cyber threats countermeasure strategies within scope of the resource management. The key contributions of this paper are fourfold:

\begin{itemize}

	\item A critical discussion and comparison considering all the essential details of state-of-the-art works   are provided and their features are analyzed to determine the future research scope addressing the limitation of the respective class based SRM  approaches.
\item {The leading models in each category are implemented on a uniform platform to enable detailed experimental analysis and comparison of key performance metrics.
}
 
 
 \item The research provides insights into trade-offs, notable findings, open issues, and concludes with specific future research avenues concerning the SRM  techniques in cloud and intended emerging computing environments.	
	
\end{itemize}

 \section{Methodology and SRM  Classification}

%{This section elucidates the review methodology in detail.
	 This survey provides a thorough examination of cybersecurity approaches developed to address the wide range of security threats against cloud resource configuration, allocation, and management. A comprehensive range of secure cloud resource management strategies, models, and methodologies published in top-tier journals and conference databases such as IEEE, ACM Digital Library, Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley are explored and analyzed for comparative study. The research papers are organized based on their underlying cyber threat handling strategies and are broadly categorized into three distinct classes: \textit{Defensive}, \textit{Mitigating}, and \textit{Hybrid strategies}. 

  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Defensive strategies}: The defensive SRM strategies that focus on preventing security breaches before they occur. These strategies aim to create a robust security posture that makes it difficult for attackers to penetrate the cloud infrastructure. These strategies emphasises  the implementation of strict access controls, comprehensive encryption protocols, advanced network security measures, well-defined security policies, and proactive vulnerability management. By fortifying the cloud environment, these measures ensure a resilient defense against potential threats.
      \item \textit{Mitigating strategies}: The strategies aim to minimize the impact of security breaches when they occur are referred as `mitigating strategies'. These strategies focus on quickly detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents to reduce damage and restore normal operations. They include incident response, backup and recovery, continuous monitoring and logging, vulnerability management, and comprehensive security training.


      \item \textit{Hybrid strategies}: The hybrid strategies combine both preventive and responsive approaches for comprehensive security. They employ an integrated security framework, proactive detection of VM threats and potential malicious client VMs, adaptive security measures using AI, collaboration and threat intelligence sharing, continuous improvement based on past incidents and ongoing assessments, and holistic security policies covering all aspects of secure cloud resource management.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The survey categorizes research papers on cloud cybersecurity into above three main classes based on similar approaches or overlapping features. Using the Scopus database, detailed bibliometric studies were conducted to gather information on publications and citations from 2002 to the present. Fig. \ref{method}(a), Fig. \ref{method}(b), and Fig. \ref{method}(c) present the bibliometric analysis for \textit{Defensive strategies}, \textit{Mitigating strategies}, and \textit{Hybrid strategies}, respectively. Specifically, the defensive strategies are reviewed in three divisions: \textit{Raising Co-residency Difficulty}; \textit{Eliminating Side Channel}; and \textit{Detecting Malicious Features}. The mitigating strategies are categorized into \textit{Minimizing Resource Sharing}; \textit{Reducing Security Risk}; and \textit{Reducing VM vulnerable attacks}. the hybrid strategies are distributed into \textit{Complimentary Strategy} and \textit{Fusion Strategy}. In the early 2000s, research on cloud security vulnerabilities and resource allocation was limited. However, significant attention and research on cyber threat countermeasures emerged in the second decade, leading to new methodologies for secure workload allocation and execution. This survey meticulously selects and investigates key works for a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis. The increasing number of publications and citations across all three strategies reflects their growing importance and popularity.

 \section{Cyber Threats Defensive  Strategies}
Defensive security strategy focuses on deflecting and detecting the security loopholes and system susceptibilities that leads to sensitive data breaches and loss of data integrity. The  defensive security aims to defend against known attack vectors and prevent or restrict the occurrence of any data breach. This is achieved by using threat intelligence, vulnerability management, advanced testing, network segmentation,  security awareness, etc. The subsequent sections presents  illustrative depiction of the defensive strategy and its significant contributions.
%The illustrative depiction of defensive strategy and respective key contributions are discussed in the subsequent sub-sections.
\subsection{Depiction}
Consider  $m$ clients \{$C_1$, $C_2$, ..., $C_m$\} operates various VMs such as \{$VM_1$, $VM_2$, ..., $VM_q$\} which are hosted on {$n$} servers.  Among the clients, assume  $C^{Adv}$ is a \textit{adversary} who  launches multiple applications on VMs, thus making them malicious ($VM^{Mal}$).  These malicious VMs compromise the vulnerable benign VMs ($VM^{Ben}$) by achieving co-residency and exploiting VM and hypervisor vulnerabilities as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ds}. Correspondingly, the Cloud Resource Manager  (CRM) employs defensive security strategies to prevent the  data breaches via security threats launched by the adversary.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.999\linewidth]{DS}
	\caption{Defensive strategies against cyber threats}
	\label{fig:ds}
\end{figure}
 As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:ds}, the cloud service management unit encapsulates key defensive countermeasures against cyber threats, including \textit{raising co-residency difficulties}, \textit{eliminating side channels}, and \textit{detecting malicious features}. {The mathematical formulation for detecting malicious co-residency and related features is presented in Eqs. (\ref{e1}-\ref{e3}). Eq. \eqref{e1} represents the VM allocation, denoted as $\omega_{ij}^k$, where the $i^{\text{th}}$ VM ($VM_i$) of the $k^{\text{th}}$ client ($C_k$) is hosted on the $j^{\text{th}}$ server ($S_j$). In Eq. \eqref{e2}, the term $\uplus_{ij,k \rightarrow i^{\ast}j,k^{\ast}}$ specifies the relationship between the VMs of the $k^{\text{th}}$ client and the $k^{\ast^{\text{th}}}$ client. This relation takes values from the set $\{ \text{non-malicious} (0), \text{malicious} (1) \}$. The status of the relationship between the two co-resident VMs, $i^{\text{th}}$ and $i^{\ast^{\text{th}}}$, hosted on the same server $S_j$, is denoted by $\Theta_{i,i^{\ast}}$. Eq. \eqref{e3} computes the cyber threat status, $\mathds{CT}$, such that if $\Theta_{i,i^{\ast}} = 1$ (indicating a malicious relationship between $i^{\text{th}}$ and $i^{\ast^{\text{th}}}$ VMs) and $k^{\ast}$ belongs to an adversary client ($C^{\text{Adv}}$), then a cyber threat is successfully identified. Otherwise, no cyber threat is detected. Based on the computed cyber threat status, $\mathds{CT}$, appropriate defensive measures are taken.} If a threat is detected, the system responds by raising difficulties for the intended co-residency and eliminating side channels to defend against the security threat.
 The related literature is discussed in the following subsections.

\begin{gather}
\omega_{ij}^k \mapsto VM_i \times S_j \times C_k \label{e1} \\
\Theta_{i,i^{\ast}} = \omega_{ij}^k \times \omega_{i^{\ast}j}^{k^{\ast}} \times \uplus_{ij,k\rightarrow i^{\ast}j,k^{\ast}} \label{e2}\\
\mathds{CT}= 	\begin{cases}
1, & {If \quad k^{\ast} \in C^{Adv} || \Theta_{i,i^{\ast}}==1 }\\
0, & { {\textit{Otherwise}} } 
\end{cases} \label{e3}

 Han et al. \cite{han2017using} introduced the Previously-Selected-Servers-First (PSSF) scheme to counter co-residency driven VM attacks by limiting benign VMs' exposure to malicious VMs. Servers maintain a record of users whose VMs they have previously hosted, prioritizing these servers for future VMs of the same users. Similarly, Agarwal et al. \cite{agarwal2019secure} proposed the Previously Co-Located Users First (PCUF) method, where VMs are placed based on previous user allocations to reduce co-residency attacks. Yu et al. \cite{yu2013detecting} proposed the VMs Co-residency Detection Scheme (VCDS) to identify VM locations using cache-based side channel attacks and calculate co-residency probabilities. Han et al. \cite{han2016game} developed a two-player Game-based Defense Mechanism (GDM-VMP) for VM placement against side-channel attacks, using clustering and semi-supervised learning to differentiate attackers from legitimate users. Yuchi et al. \cite{yuchi2015enabling} quantified cloud security risks from VM vulnerabilities and proposed a placement algorithm minimizing these risks based on the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Natu et al. \cite{natu2017secure} suggested incorporating security requirements into VM placement policies, proposing Multiple VM Placement Security (MVPS) techniques using Linear Programming, Bin Packing, Graph Coloring, and Genetic Algorithm to reduce co-residency attacks.

Shi et al. \cite{shi2011limiting} presented Chameleon, a dynamic page coloring mechanism for eliminating cache-based side-channel attacks during security-critical operations. Vattikonda et al. \cite{vattikonda2011eliminating} proposed eliminating fine-grained timers (EFGT) by making the timer provided by the RDTSC instruction coarser. Wang and Lee \cite{wang2006covert} suggested Selective Partitioning and Random Permutation Cache (RPCache) to prevent multi-threading covert channels and thwart cache-based side channel attacks. Han et al. \cite{han2020quantify} introduced a deep learning model, Quantifying Co-residency Risks-based Security (QCS), to combat co-located VM attacks by profiling client behavior patterns. Wu et al. \cite{wu2012xenpump} developed XenPump to mitigate timing channel threats by adding latency to hypercalls. Kong et al. \cite{kong2019secure} proposed the Secure Container Deployment Strategy (SecCDS) using Genetic Algorithm to reduce co-residency in container clouds. Varadarajan et al. \cite{varadarajan2014scheduler} proposed a scheduler offering minimum runtime guarantees to prevent cache-based side-channel attacks. The comprehensive and summarised comparison of the aforementioned countermeasure strategies are elucidated in Table \ref{summaryDS}.

%Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2013duppel} developed DÃ¼ppel to mitigate cache side-channel attacks by retrofitting commodity operating systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in public clouds using El-Gamal encryption.

\section{Cyber Threats Mitigating  Strategies}
The cybersecurity threat mitigation strategies focus on minimizing the overall security risk and mitigating vulnerabilities leading to data breaches through the implementation of enhanced security policies and procedures. The detailed explanations and their respective key contributions are presented in the following subsections.
\subsection{Depiction}
As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:ms}, $m$ clients \{$C_1$, $C_2$, ..., $C_m$\} launches different number of  VMs such as \{$VM_1$, $VM_2$, ..., $VM_q$\} which are accompained by {$n$} servers.  Let  $C^{Adv}$ {be} an \textit{adversary} who has launched multiple malicious VMs ($VM^{Mal}$) which establish unauthorised links to  compromise the co-resident benign VMs ($VM^{Ben}$)  and exploit VM and hypervisor vulnerabilities as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ms}. Correspondingly, the Cloud Resource Manager  (CRM) employs  cybersecurity threat mitigation strategies to prevent the  data breaches via security threats launched by the adversary. These stratigies aim to reduce VM  and hypervisor vulnerabilities effects. The cyber threats can be addressed by enabling \textit{minimum resource sharing}, \textit{reducing security risks}, \textit{mitigating VM attacks}.
%here are three major categories of cyber threat mitigation: \textit{Minimum resource sharing}, \textit{Reducing security risks}, \textit{Mitigating VM attacks}.

\section{Hybrid Strategies}
Hybrid countermeasure strategies incorporate integrated approaches employed during cloud resource allocation to combat cyber threats. These strategies fall into two categories: \textit{Complimentary approaches} and \textit{Fusion approaches}, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:hs}. Complimentary approaches combine proactive cyber threat detection with reactive threat handling or mitigating mechanisms. The descriptions of these techniques and their existing key contributions are discussed in the following subsections.
\subsection{Depiction}
 As demonstrated in Fig. \ref{fig:hs}, complementary approaches involve exploring and investigating security risks and analyzing previously occurred threats to develop a knowledge database for proactively predicting cyber threats. Based on this analysis, appropriate threat-handling mechanisms are applied reactively. Additionally, workload execution or resource usage data is analyzed to predict and mitigate potential resource contention, which is often an indicator of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type attack on virtual machines (VMs). The most commonly employed reactive method to address or mitigate security threats involves migrating vulnerable VMs to a secure host or server.

On the other hand, fusion approaches combine multiple techniques working collaboratively to achieve the shared goal of eliminating or mitigating cybersecurity threats (Fig. \ref{fig:hs}). The following sections provide a literature survey of existing complementary and fusion countermeasure approaches designed to address cloud cybersecurity threats.

	\includegraphics[width=0.999\linewidth]{HS}
	\caption{Hybrid strategies against cyber threats}
	\label{fig:hs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Key contributions}
Saxena et al. \cite{saxena2020security} devised a secure resource allocation scheme to address VM placement security concerns, incorporating a VM threat detector and workload predictor. They analyzed inter-VM relations and factors like malicious network traffic and bandwidth utilization for breach detection. Additionally, Saxena et al. \cite{saxena2023sustainable} proposed the Sustainable and Secure Load Management (SaS-LM) Model for enhanced client security and energy conservation in CDCs. Using Dual-Phase Black Hole Optimization, they optimized a neural network to predict congestion and adjust load while ensuring security and sustainability. In another work, Saxena et al. \cite{saxena2021oscmc} introduced the Online Secure Communication Model for Cloud (OSC-MC) to locate and terminate malicious VMs and inter-VM links, resulting in improved network performance and reduced energy consumption. Gill et al. \cite{gill2018secure} presented the SECURE mechanism, which detects and mitigates various threats in cloud environments using a detection engine and an autonomic system for attack response without user intervention.






Several fusion approaches have been proposed to address security challenges in cloud environments. Gaggero et al. \cite{gaggero2018model} introduced the Model Predictive Control-based VM Placement (MPC-VMP) approach, which proactively handles security and workload processing issues while reducing power requirements. Devi et al. \cite{devi2020deep} proposed a Deep Learning-based security model for task classification and scheduling, categorizing tasks into different security levels. He et al. \cite{he2017machine} suggested various machine learning algorithms for DDoS attack detection, leveraging statistical information from cloud servers and VMs. Kesavmoorthy et al. \cite{kesavamoorthy2019swarm} presented a Multi-Agent System based DDoS attack detection and prevention system (MAS-PSO) using Particle Swarm Optimization intelligence. Tariq et al. \cite{tariq2019agent} analyzed and mitigated multiple security risks using software and intelligent agents. Aldawood et al. \cite{aldawood2021secure} proposed a secure graph-based stacking algorithm (Gb-SRS) for secure VM allocation in cloud systems. Tao et al. \cite{tao2021secure} introduced a Secure and Efficient VM Allocation (SeVMA) mechanism to mitigate cross-VM attack threats while ensuring workload balance and energy consumption. Ahamed et al. \cite{ahamed2016security} suggested security-aware energy-efficient dynamic VM consolidation algorithms to reduce operating costs in CDCs. The comprehensive and summarised comparison of the aforementioned research works are elucidated in Table \ref{summaryHS}.
% The evaluation of co-resident watermarking was performed under a large variety of conditions, system loads and hardware configurations, from a local laboratory environment to production cloud environments.

{\textit{Datasets}: The selected approaches are evaluated using two benchmark VM traces from publicly available real workload datasets: the \textit{OpenNebula VM Profiling Dataset} (ONeb) \cite{24mb-vt61-20} and the \textit{Google Cluster Data} (GCD) \cite{reiss2011google}. The ONeb dataset contains information captured by a monitoring system via execution of VM probe programs provided by OpenNebula. It includes details on VM threats, server status, basic performance indicators, VM status, and capacity consumption of VMs and their hosting servers. While the exact values of VM and hypervisor vulnerability scores are not specified in the VM threat database, various risk scores for different VMs are computed using the method described by \cite{saxena2023ai}. This information is used by the VM threat predictor to estimate potential threats before they occur. The GCD dataset provides capacity usage information of CPU, memory, and disk I/O for 672,300 jobs executed on 12,500 servers over 29 days. The dataset includes CPU and memory utilization percentages recorded every five minutes for 24 hours. Users can request varying numbers and types of VMs over time, constrained by the total number of available VMs at the CDC. Experiments are conducted over 80 five-minute intervals to dynamically analyze the performance of various countermeasures. Since the original GCD traces do not include VM threat information, a VM threat database was generated for these traces, reporting attacks on VMs with attributes such as {${S}_id$, ${VM_id}$, ${VM}_i^{CPU}$, ${VM}_i^{BW}$, ${VM}_i^{memory}$, ${R}^{score}_i$, ${V}_i$, ${H}_i$, ${C}_i$, ${N}_i$, ${VM}_i^{status}$, etc}. VM vulnerability (${V}$) and server hypervisor vulnerability (${H}$) are represented as CVSS scores with a normal distribution in the range [0, 10]. Security threats depend on the values of the four types of risks and other relevant information in the threat database {${V}_i$, ${H}_i$, ${C}_i$, ${N}_i$} associated with a VM and its co-residency with malicious VMs (${VM}^{Mal}$)}.




\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Resource Utilization}:
The resource utilization of data centre can be obtained using Eq. (\ref{ru1}) and  Eq. (\ref{ru2}), where if server (${S}_i$) is active, $\gamma_i=1$, else it is $0$ and $Z$ is number of resources and $\mathds{R} \in {{CPU}, {Mem}, etc}$. While the formulation considers only CPU (${CPU}$) and memory (${Mem}$), it is extendable to any number of resources.
\begin{gather}
{RU}_{CDC}= \int\limits_{\substack{t_1\\\mathcal{}}}^{t_2} (\frac{	{RU}_{CDC}^{{CPU}} +  {RU}_{CDC}^{{Mem}} }{|Z|\times \sum_{i=1}^{P}{\gamma_i}})dt\label{ru1}
\\
{RU}_{CDC}^{\mathds{R}}=\sum_{i=1}^{P}{\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{Q}{\omega_{ji} \times VM_j^{\mathds{R}}}}{S_i^{\mathds{R}}}} \quad  \label{ru2} 
\end{gather}
\item \textit{Power Consumption}:
From the existing literature \cite{sharma2016multi}, power consumption for $i^{th}$ server can be formulated as ${PW}_i$ and total power consumption ${PW}_{CDC}$ during time-interval \{$t_1$, $t_2$\} is shown in Eq. (\ref{power2}).
\begin{gather}
\resizebox{0.4\textwidth}{!}{$ 
{PW}_{CDC} = 
\int\limits_{\substack{t_1\\\mathcal{}}}^{t_2} (\sum_{i=1}^{P} {([{{PW}_i}^{max} - {{PW}_i}^{min}] \times {RU} + {{PW}_i}^{idle})}) dt
\label{power2} $}
\end{gather}	
where ${RU}$ is resource utilization, ${{PW}_i}^{max}$, ${{PW}_i}^{min}$ and ${{PW}_i}^{idle}$ are maximum, minimum and idle state power consumption for $i^{th}$ server.

\item \textit{Cyber threats coverage} ($\Xi$): Any malicious activity leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to data is termed a security threat. The likelihood of such threats varies based on the probability of multiple security risks and the learning capability of the threat detector, which depends on the number of cloud users and the size of CDCs. The total threat coverage ($\Xi_{coverage}^{CDC}$) over the time interval {$t_1$, $t_2$} is computed using Eqs. (\ref{attackcoverage1}) and (\ref{attackcoverage2}).

\begin{equation} \label{attackcoverage1}
\int_{t1}^{t2}	\Xi_{coverage}^{z'} = \int_{t1}^{t2}\frac{|CoresidTarget(VM_z, VM_{z'})|}{TotTarget(z')} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{attackcoverage2}
\int_{t1}^{t2}	\Xi_{coverage}^{CDC}= \int_{t1}^{t2}  \Xi_{coverage}^{z'} 	
\end{equation}
where $Xi_{coverage}^{z'}$ is attack coverage of $z^{th}$ malicious user which is defined as the ratio of the number of co-residency of malicious user VMs ($ VM_{z'}$) with target VMs ($VM_z$) i.e $|CoresidTarget(VM_z, VM_{z'})|$ and total number of target VMs of $z'^{th}$ malicious user ($TotTarget(z')$) during time interval [$t_1$, $t_2$].	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparative Results}
The performance of various cyber threat countermeasures across three major categories is thoroughly investigated and compared. These categories include \textit{Defensive strategies}: Previously Selected Server First (PSSF) \cite{han2015using} and Previously Co-located User First (PCUF) \cite{agarwal2019secure}; \textit{Mitigating strategies}: Security-aware Multi-Objective Optimization based VM Placement algorithm (SMOOP) \cite{han2017reducing} and Security and Energy Aware Load Balancing (SEA-LB) \cite{singh2019secure}; and \textit{Hybrid strategies}: Security Embedded Dynamic Resource Allocation (SEDRA) \cite{saxena2020security} and Secure and Sustainable Load Management (SaS-LM) \cite{saxena2023sustainable}. The investigation uses a wide range of heterogeneous cloud applications and varying VM resource utilization. We evaluated and compared these approaches based on cyber threat coverage over time, security success rate for different CDC sizes, resource utilization over time and across various CDC sizes, power consumption over time and for different CDC sizes, and the average number of active servers.



\subsubsection{Security} 
The cyber threat coverage ($\Xi_{CDC}$ (\%)) of all considered countermeasure approaches is compared in Fig. \ref{fig1} for GCD traces (Fig. \ref{fig1}(a)) and ONeb traces (Fig. \ref{fig1}(b)). As observed in Fig. \ref{fig1}, $\Xi_{CDC}$ varies distinctly over time with different countermeasure methods for both traces. However, the hybrid strategies, SEDRA and SaS-LM, consistently produce fewer cyber threats ($\Xi_{CDC}$) compared to defensive and mitigating strategies for both data traces. The defensive strategies such as PSSF and PCUF surpass mitigating strategies including SEA-LB and SMOOP in terms of reducing $\Xi_{CDC}$ (\%). The cyber threat coverage ($\Xi_{CDC}$ (\%)) is reduced in the order: SEDRA $\geq$ SaS-LM $\geq$ PSSF $\geq$ PCUF $\geq$ SMOOP $\geq$ SEA-LB. Figs. \ref{fig2}(a) and \ref{fig2}(b) illustrate the comparative success rate of different countermeasure strategies against cyber threats for varying sizes of CDCs. The box plots represent a comprehensive comparison of the success rate against security attacks in terms of the bottom quartile, bottom whisker, median, top whisker, and top quartile. As discussed above, hybrid strategies like SEDRA and SaS-LM, which apply both proactive and reactive methods to combat upcoming threats and prohibit their successful launch, achieve the highest success rate for both datasets. The defensive strategies PSSF and PCUF achieve the next highest success rate, while the mitigating strategies SMOOP and SEA-LB show the lowest success rate.

The reason behind such trend outcomes is that hybrid strategies include proactive detection of threats and workload management based on previous knowledge of the threat database and workload information, which helps alleviate multiple-risk-based cyber threats and therefore reduce cyber threat coverage. Defensive strategies focus on minimizing the successful creation of malicious links and side channels, reducing co-residency-based attacks specifically. On the other hand, mitigating strategies such as SEA-LB attempt to minimize resource sharing, and SMOOP evaluates and mitigates vulnerabilities of VMs and hypervisors. These strategies aim to reduce the probability of the occurrence of cyber threats rather than eliminate them completely.

	\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Resource utilization}
Fig. \ref{fig3} compares the resource utilization ($RU_{CDC}$(\%)) over time for CDC of size 1000 VMs of the three categories of countermeasures using both GCD and ONeb traces. The resource utilization follows the trend: PCUF $<$ SMOOP $<$ SEA-LB $<$ PSSF $<$ SaS-LM $<$SEDRA for both data traces over time  which depicts $RU_{CDC}$(\%) is independent of  time-period.  Specifically, SEDRA  improves the average utilization of resources up to 12.67\%, 9.4\%, 5.3\%, 4.2\%, and 2.9\%, over PCUF, SMOOP, SEA-LB, PSSF, and SaS-LM, respectively using GCD traces. Similarly, SEA-LB surpasses the average resource utilization of PCUF, SMOOP, SEDRA, PSSF, and SaS-LM by 11.2\%, 8.4\%, 3.8\%, 2.5\%, and 1.3\%, respectively for ONeb data traces. Nonetheless, SEDRA exhibits highest security with 5.3\% and 3.8\% higher resource utilization than SEA-LB. Fig. \ref{fig4} depicts the comparison of resource utilization ($RU_{CDC}$ (\%)) with varying numbers of VMs or sizes of CDCs, reinforcing that resource utilization is independent of CDC size. The hybrid strategy SEDRA outperforms all other strategies in terms of average resource utilization for both data traces across a wide range of VMs within the CDC. Furthermore, in SEDRA and SaS-LM, physical resource allocation to VMs is based on predicted resource utilization, resulting in higher resource efficiency. In contrast, defensive and mitigating strategies like PCUF, SMOOP, PSSF, and SEA-LB do not apply workload prediction, deploying VMs with user-demanded resource capacities, which are often much greater than the actual resource utilization, leading to higher resource wastage.

	\caption{Resource utilization over varying size of CDC }
	\label{fig4}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Power consumption}
The periodic values of power consumption ($PW_{CDC}$ (KWatt)) of defensive, mitigation, and hybrid strategies are compared in Fig. \ref{fig5} for CDCs of size 1000 VMs via bar graphs, where hybrid strategies including SaS-LM and SEDRA have reduced power consumption over defensive strategies: PSSF and PCUF, and mitigating strategies: SMOOP and SEA-LB.  The $PW_{CDC}$ obtained for the varying size of CDC for the compared approaches   is reported in Fig. \ref{fig6} that depicts increase of $PW_{CDC}$ with increasing size of the CDC because of the increasing number of active servers to serve the intended workloads execution. The reason behind such a reduction in power consumption is the minimization of resource wastage and number of active servers in case of the
hybrid strategies due to resource utilization prediction and deployment of VMs with required physical resource capacity equivalent to predicted resource usage of each VM. The reduction in power consumption follows the trend similar to resource utilization: PCUF $<$ SMOOP $<$ SEA-LB $<$ PSSF $<$ SaS-LM $<$SEDRA.

	\label{fig6}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Active servers}
The average number of active servers (${S}_{active}$) are compared in Fig. \ref{fig7}, wherein  SEA-LB and SEDRA show least while PCUF reveal highest number of active servers.  The number of active server follows the trend: PCUF $>$ SMOOP $>$ PSSF $>$ SaS-LM $>$ SEDRA $>$ SEA-LB.  SEDRA provides highest security among all the comparative methods at the cost of 6.72\% (in case of GCD) and  20.8\% (in case of ONeb) more active servers as compared with SEA-LB method. SaS-LM stands third in the list of average number of active servers and provide security equivalent to SEDRA.

\section{Trade-offs and Insights}

In cloud environments, three primary countermeasure strategies including defensive, mitigating, and hybrid, present distinct trade-offs {\cite{yadav2020energy}} between security and resource efficiency. Each strategy offers a different approach to achieving secure resource management, with strengths and limitations based on their focus and adaptability to emerging threats.

\textit{Defensive strategies} prioritize preventing specific security risks, such as co-residency and hypervisor vulnerabilities. These strategies excel at stopping well-known attacks without requiring prior knowledge of threat patterns. However, their rigid nature limits adaptability to unforeseen or evolving threats. Additionally, defensive techniques like raising co-residency difficulty or eliminating side-channel attacks often increase power consumption and activate more servers, leading to low resource utilization and higher operational costs. While effective for single threat scenarios, they exhibit high time and space complexity due to the need for meticulous VM allocation planning.

\textit{Mitigating strategies} focus on reducing the attack surface by optimizing load distribution. For example, by assigning all VMs of a single user to a common server, the risk of inter-user attacks decreases. However, this comes at the cost of placing all VMs at risk if that server is compromised. Mitigating strategies offer better resource efficiency compared to defensive methods but can expose users to higher security risks if a common server is breached.

\textit{Hybrid strategies} combine the strengths of both defensive and mitigating approaches by leveraging proactive and reactive techniques to predict and address threats. By using historical threat data and machine learning models, such as transfer learning, hybrid methods anticipate new security risks while dynamically adjusting resource allocation to maintain efficiency. This balance allows for better optimization of power consumption, resource utilization, and VM consolidation. However, hybrid strategies depend on the accuracy of threat prediction, making them sensitive to false positives or inaccurate analysis. Their success in balancing security and efficiency hinges on the quality of threat detection algorithms and workload estimation techniques.

\subsection{{Trade-off Between Security and Performance}}

{The trade-off between security and performance is a critical consideration in the deployment of cloud security strategies. Defensive strategies enhance security by implementing stringent controls, but this often results in increased latency and resource consumption, affecting overall performance. For instance, rigorous VM placement to prevent co-residency may lead to sub-optimal resource utilization and higher operational costs. Conversely, mitigating strategies aim to optimize performance by improving resource allocation and minimizing user co-residency, which can inadvertently compromise security. By focusing on resource efficiency, these strategies might expose cloud environments to greater risks, especially if a shared server is compromised.} {Hybrid strategies strive to achieve an optimal balance between these two factors. By employing machine learning and predictive analytics, they enhance security while maintaining performance efficiency. However, the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the accuracy of threat predictions and the system's ability to adapt to dynamic environments.}

\subsection{Key Takeaways and Insights}

Key insights from this analysis include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Defensive Strategies}: Best suited for well-known, single-risk attacks. While they do not require prior threat knowledge, they are resource-intensive, leading to high power consumption and the need for many active servers.
    \item \textit{Mitigating Strategies}: Improve resource utilization by minimizing resource sharing but introduce the risk of significant data loss if a common server is compromised. These strategies reduce complexity but sacrifice some security in multi-tenant environments.
    \item \textit{Hybrid Strategies}: Provide a balanced, scalable solution by combining historical data with real-time threat detection. They enhance resource efficiency and security through machine learning and predictive analytics but require continuous monitoring and accurate threat models to be effective.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{Achieving Trade-offs through Optimization}}

{The optimization process for these strategies involves balancing security requirements against resource constraints such as power consumption, active physical machines (APMs), and resource utilization (RU). Defensive strategies optimize for security by carefully allocating VMs to servers, reducing the risk of co-residency or side-channel attacks. This requires solving complex VM placement problems that maximize security while minimizing the number of active servers, thus controlling power consumption and ensuring optimal resource use. Mitigating strategies, conversely, optimize for resource efficiency by distributing VMs in a way that reduces multi-user co-residency. This approach typically minimizes the number of active servers but increases the risk of single-point failures if those servers are compromised. Hybrid strategies employ machine learning models, such as transfer learning, to predict potential threats and adjust VM allocation dynamically. These models optimize the allocation process by predicting threat patterns and consolidating workloads to reduce power consumption while maintaining security through continuous threat monitoring. The optimization challenge lies in balancing the accuracy of threat predictions with resource allocation decisions to ensure efficient use of infrastructure while minimizing vulnerabilities.}

The trade-offs across these strategies reflect a balance between achieving robust security and maintaining efficient resource management. Defensive strategies prioritize security but may compromise efficiency, mitigating strategies favor resource optimization but risk security lapses, and hybrid strategies seek an optimal balance by integrating predictive analytics and real-time adjustments. Future research should focus on refining these optimization processes to enhance both security and resource efficiency in cloud environments. The key parameter-based trade-off among  existing cyber threat countermeasure strategies is presented in Table \ref{tradeoff}.

\end{table*}
The mitigating strategy of minimizing resource sharing (MS1) aims to reduce physical machine sharing among users, leading to more active servers and higher power consumption. It does not require prior threat knowledge and has moderate time and space complexities. On the other hand, reducing VM attacks (MS2) and mitigating VM attacks (MS3) require sophisticated VM allocation planning for different security threats. Hybrid strategies (HS1 and HS2) predict threats and workloads for high resource use and low power consumption but involve high time and space complexities. Proactive threat estimation in hybrids needs prior threat knowledge. Despite complexity, hybrids outperform individual strategies in security, resource use, and power reduction.
The choice of a SRM  strategy should be based on the sensitivity of the workload and the acceptable cost of time and space complexity. This decision should align with the terms and obligations of secure workload execution agreed upon by cloud service providers and stakeholders.
%Ultimately, choosing a strategy depends on workload sensitivity and tolerance for complexity, aligned with provider-stakeholder agreements on secure workload execution.

%The mitigating strategy named minimizing resource sharing targets least possible sharing of physical machines among multiple users which leads to increased number of active servers and high power consumption with lesser resource utilization. However, prior knowledge of security threats is not required and time-complexity and space-complexity requirements are moderate, where same strategy can be applied to single or multiple-risks based attacks. Otherhand, reducing VM attacks and mitigating VM attacks based mitigating strategies have moderate time and space complexities but highly sophisticated VM allocation planning is required where different strategies are needed for different types of security attacks.  The hybrid complimentary strategies focus on predicting threats and workloads which aims to high resource utilization and low power consumption and lesser number of active servers but requires very high time and space complexities depending on the utilized prediction algorithm or mechanism. Additionally, the proactive threat estimation requires prior knowledge of previously occurred cyber threats. The fusion hybrid strategy operates at high time and space complexities depending on the complexity of the integrating strategies. Undoubtedly, the hybrid strategies surpass the individual defensive and mitigating countermeasure strategies with repect to assuring security, utilizing resources, and reducing power consumption at the cost of higher time and space complexity involved with machine learning optimization-based resource and threat prediction and pre-requisite knowledge of existing and currently monitored cyber threats.  Finally, it has been concluded that a SRM  strategy should be selected depending on the sensitivity of the executing workload and the admissible cost of time and space complexity subject to the terms and obligation of secure workload execution agreed among the cloud service providers and the stakeholders.  

\section{Open Issues and Future Directions}

As cloud computing continues to expand, resource management is becoming increasingly complex due to the need to balance performance, scalability, and security. Modern cloud infrastructures must support multi-tenant environments, high availability, and dynamic scalingâall while addressing emerging cyber threats. Securing cloud resource management has become one of the most critical challenges, as vulnerabilities in resource allocation can be exploited, leading to performance degradation, data breaches, and service outages.

This complexity is compounded by the rapid evolution of attack vectors, making static security measures insufficient. To address these concerns, research in secure cloud resource management is focusing on innovative methods that integrate dynamic threat adaptation, AI-driven defense mechanisms, and collaborative frameworks. This section highlights the key open issues and future research trends in this domain, with a focus on advancing cloud resilience and security while maintaining optimal resource utilization. {The key \textit{open issues and future directions} are as follows:}

    \item {\textit{Dynamic Threat Adaptation Using AI and Machine Learning}:  The complexity and variety of modern cyber threats require adaptable defense strategies. Future research should explore \textit{dynamic threat adaptation mechanisms}, utilizing AI and machine learning to continuously learn from new threats and update security policies accordingly. These systems should be capable of detecting abnormal patterns, adapting to novel attack techniques, and providing real-time adjustments to safeguard cloud environments.}

    \item {\textit{Proactive Threat Detection and Automated Incident Response}:  Detecting threats before they escalate is critical to reducing the impact of cyberattacks. Future research should focus on developing \textit{proactive threat detection systems} that leverage predictive analytics and AI-based anomaly detection. Coupled with this, \textit{automated incident response systems} should be further refined to ensure that identified threats are immediately neutralized, minimizing the window of vulnerability and reducing human intervention in mitigating attacks.}

    \item {\textit{Integration of Defensive, Mitigating, and Hybrid Approaches}: The future research should address  the \textit{integration of defensive, mitigating, and hybrid cybersecurity strategies}.

    \item {\textit{Explainable AI (XAI) and Transfer Learning for Enhanced Cybersecurity}:  With the increasing reliance on AI and machine learning in cybersecurity, \textit{Explainable AI (XAI)} offers an opportunity to improve the transparency and interpretability of AI-driven defense mechanisms. Future research should explore how XAI can be applied to \textit{malicious activity detection} to provide clear explanations for AI decisions. Furthermore, \textit{transfer learning} could be leveraged to adapt security solutions developed in one domain to new, unexplored threat landscapes, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of cloud security systems.}

    \item {\textit{Collaborative Cloud Frameworks for Threat Intelligence Sharing}:  Collaborative frameworks that facilitate the \textit{sharing of threat intelligence} across organizational and geographical boundaries are crucial for strengthening global cloud security. Future research should focus on developing \textit{secure, real-time communication protocols} and infrastructure for sharing threat data, tools, and best practices among cloud providers and clients. This collaborative approach will ensure a collective defense against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.}

    \item {\textit{Resilient Cloud Resource Management for Future Threats}:  As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, the resilience of cloud infrastructures must be a central focus of future research. This includes developing mechanisms that allow for the \textit{secure management and allocation of cloud resources} in a way that can withstand and recover from potential breaches. Research should explore new ways to safeguard critical data and services through redundancy, fault-tolerant architectures, and adaptive resource management strategies.}
\end{itemize}





%The future research in secure cloud resource management focus on several critical open issues that encourages innovative attention and exploration.  This includes developing efficient resource allocation \textit{algorithms that balance security and performance needs}, dynamically adjusting allocations based on evolving threats. Also, the \textit{scalable security solutions} are needed for protecting cloud resources across various deployment scenarios, from small-scale to large-scale, multi-tenant environments. Additionally, \textit{advancing dynamic threat adaptation mechanisms}, leveraging AI and machine learning, is crucial for enhancing cloud resilience against evolving cyber threats are the crucial requirement.  The future research directions should prioritize exploring novel approaches for \textit{proactive threat detection}, \textit{automated incident response}, and adaptive security policy enforcement to address evolving cybersecurity challenges in cloud computing. 


%The \textit{integration of defensive, mitigating, and hybrid approaches} provide an immense potential for more effective cyber threat countermeasures by exploring deeper into the underlying causes of multiple security threats. By combining the strengths of each strategy, researchers can develop comprehensive defense mechanisms that offer enhanced protection against a wide range of cyber threats. Furthermore, \textit{incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence} (XAI) and \textit{Transfer Learning approaches for potential malicious activity detection} can provide valuable insights into previously unknown or unidentifiable severe cyber threats. XAI techniques enable the interpretation and understanding of decisions made by intelligent models, enhancing transparency and trust in cybersecurity systems. Transfer learning approach leverages knowledge from one domain to improve performance in another domain, potentially enabling more accurate threat detection and mitigation in cloud environments.

%The cloud collaboration frameworks  and developing mechanisms need to be enhanced further for sharing threat intelligence and best practices across organizational boundaries for future research endeavors. The collaborative initiatives can facilitate the exchange of insights, data, and tools among stakeholders within the cloud ecosystem, enabling organizations to effectively address emerging cyber threats. Additionally, advancements in secure resource allocation and management can contribute to the development of robust and resilient cloud infrastructures capable of mitigating increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. By addressing these open issues and exploring promising research directions, the future research in secure resource allocation and management can significantly enhance the security posture of cloud computing environments and safeguard critical data and assets against cyberattacks.
