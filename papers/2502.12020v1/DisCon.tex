%The work opens exciting perspectives for future works, that shall explore the incorporation of nonlinear elements such as activation functions, the realization of architectures consisting of multiple lattices, alternative Hamiltonian terms that can also induce learning, and the optimization of system parameters for learning performance. Spinor fields can be realized in metamaterials by leveraging symmetry-induced degeneracies~\cite{}
