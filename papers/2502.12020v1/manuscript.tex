\begin{abstract}
Physical information processors can learn from examples if they are modified according to an abstract parameter update equation, termed a learning rule. We introduce a physical model for self-learning that encodes the learning rule in the Hamiltonian of the system. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. One of the modes is driven parametrically into a bi-stable regime, forming a coherent Ising machine (CIM)---that provides the long-term memory that stores learned responses (weights). The CIM is augmented with an additional spinor field that acts as short-term (activation) memory. We numerically demonstrate that, in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions between the long-term memory Ising machine and the short-term memory auxiliary field, the system autonomously learns from examples.
%Physical information processors learn from examples by updating their parameters according to a learning rule. Although a large number of such learning rules have been discovered, these remain largely abstract parameter update equations. We introduce a self-learning physical model, termed Multifield Coherent Ising Machine. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. A subset of modes are parametrically driven into a bistable regime---inducing a long-term memory that stores the weights of the model; the other modes are not parametrically driven and remain a short-term memory. We numerically demonstrate that in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions, the system is capable of autonomous learning.
%Self-learning systems autonomously adapt to improve their fittness at a particular task, in response to feedback and examples---mimicking, in materia, the training process of neural networks. This is accomplished by updating the system parameters according to a learning rule. Although a large number of such learning rules have been discovered, these remain largely abstract parameter update equations. A significant challenge is that the system must present multiple memory time scales; a long-term memory to store the weights of the model, and a short-term memory to perform inference---and the time scales must be coupled according to the learning rule. Here, we introduce a physical model (termed Multifield Coherent Ising Machine) that is capable of supervised learning. The model consists of a network of multi-modal resonators. A subset of modes are parametrically driven into a bistable regime---inducing a long-term memory; the other modes are not parametrically driven and remain a short-term memory. We numerically demonstrate that in the presence of suitable nonlinear interactions, the system is capable of autonomous learning.
