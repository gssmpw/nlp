\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

We first introduce formal notations useful for the rest of the paper (Section \ref{sec:notation}). Then, we review in detail previously proposed evaluation measures for time-series AD methods (Section \ref{acc_measure}). 


\subsection{Time-Series and Anomaly Score Notations}
\label{sec:notation}
We review notations for the time series and anomaly score sequence.
\newline \textbf{Time Series: } A time series $T \in \mathbb{R}^n $ is a sequence of real-valued numbers $T_i\in\mathbb{R}$ $[T_1,T_2,...,T_n]$, where $n=|T|$ is the length of $T$, and $T_i$ is the $i^{th}$ point of $T$. We are typically interested in local regions of the time series, known as subsequences. A subsequence $T_{i,\ell} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$ of a time series $T$ is a continuous subset of the values of $T$ of length $\ell$ starting at position $i$. Formally, $T_{i,\ell} = [T_i, T_{i+1},...,T_{i+\ell-1}]$.	
\newline \textbf{Anomaly Score Sequence: } For a time series $T \in \mathbb{R}^n $, an AD method $A$ returns an anomaly score sequence $S_T$. For point-based approaches (i.e., methods that return a score for each point of $T$), we have $S_T \in \mathbb{R}^n$. For range-based approaches (i.e., methods that return a score for each subsequence of a given length $\ell$), we have $S_T \in \mathbb{R}^{n-\ell}$. Overall, for range-based (or subsequence-based) approaches, we define $S_T = [{S_T}_1,{S_T}_2,...,{S_T}_{n-\ell}]$ with ${S_T}_i \in [0,1]$.


\subsection{Accuracy Evaluation Measures for AD}
\label{acc_measure}

We present previously proposed quality measures for evaluating the accuracy of an AD method, given its anomaly score. We first discuss threshold-based and then threshold-independent measures.

\subsubsection{Threshold-based AD Evaluation Measures} \hfill\\
The anomaly score $S_T$ produced by an AD method $A$ highlights the parts of the time series $T$ considered as abnormal. The highest values in the anomaly score correspond to the most abnormal points. Threshold-based measures require setting a threshold to mark each point as an anomaly or not. Usually, this threshold is set to $\mu(S_T) + \alpha*\sigma(S_T)$, with $\alpha$ set to 3**[1]**, where $\mu(S_T)$ is the mean and $\sigma(S_T)$ is the standard deviation $S_T$. Given a threshold $Thres$, we compute the $pred \in \{0,1\}^n$ as follows:


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\forall i \in [1,|S_T|], pred_i = \left.
\begin{cases}
0,& \text{if: } \textbf{[2]} \\
1,& \text{otherwise }
\end{cases}
\right. 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Threshold-independent AD Evaluation Measures} \hfill\\
Until now, we introduced accuracy measures requiring to threshold the produced anomaly score of AD methods. However, the accuracy values vary significantly when the threshold changes. To evaluate a method holistically using its corresponding anomaly score, two measures from the AUC family of measures are used.
\newline \textbf{AUC-ROC:** The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) is defined as the area under the curve corresponding to TPR on the y-axis and FPR on the x-axis when we vary the anomaly score threshold. The area under the curve is computed using the trapezoidal rule. For that purpose, we define $Th$ as an ordered set of thresholds between 0 and 1. Formally, we have $Th=[Th_0,Th_1,...Th_N]$ with $0=Th_0<Th_1<...<Th_N=1$. Therefore, $AUC\text{-}ROC$ is defined as follows:
%\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&AUC\text{-}ROC = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{N} \Delta^{k}_{TPR}*\Delta^{k}_{FPR}\\
&\text{with: } \left.
\begin{cases}
\Delta^{k}_{FPR} &= FPR(Th_{k})-FPR(Th_{k-1})\\
\Delta^{k}_{TPR} &= TPR(Th_{k-1})+TPR(Th_{k})
\end{cases}
\right. 
\label{equAUCROC}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
