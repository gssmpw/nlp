  abstract =      {Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves are
                   commonly used to present results for binary decision
                   problems in machine learning. However, when dealing
                   with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR)
                   curves give a more informative picture of an
                   algorithm's performance. We show that a deep
                   connection exists between ROC space and PR space,
                   such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only
                   if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the
                   notion of an achievable PR curve, which has
                   properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we
                   show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve.
                   Finally, we also note differences in the two types of
                   curves are significant for algorithm design. For
                   example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly
                   interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms
                   that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not
                   guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

abstract = {Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. ROC graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.}
