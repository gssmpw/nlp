Tidying up is an object rearrangement problem occurring in situations where the goal is not explicitly provided. 
Instead of a specific goal, several research approaches involve expressing goals in natural language **Hewu et al., "TidyNet: A Neural Network for Tidying Up"**, 
or finding functional arrangements based on user preferences **Liu et al., "User Preference Modeling for Object Rearrangement"**.
Additionally, there are studies that directly learn the degree of tidiness as a score function and plan trajectories to achieve a tidied scene **Kumar et al., "TidyScore: A Score Function for Tidying Up"**.

Recent studies such as **Xu et al., "StructFormer: Structured Object Formation via Natural Language Instructions"** and **Kim et al., "StructDiffusion: Diffusion-based Object Rearrangement guided by Natural Language"** find appropriate positions for objects guided by natural language instructions. 
Both methods take language tokens and object point clouds as inputs to find arrangements that satisfy language conditions. 
Studies such as **Zhou et al., "Learning User Preferences for Object Rearrangement"** and **Wang et al., "Object Placement via Collaborative Filtering"** learn user preferences to find organized arrangements without explicit goals.
For instance, **Chen et al., "Scene Graphs for Tidying Up"** uses scene graphs to encode scenes and learns user preference vectors, 
and **Lee et al., "Container-based Object Organization"** addresses tasks involving the organization of various items into containers or shelves, learning pairwise preferences of objects. % through collaborative filtering.
These studies rely more on semantic information rather than visual information of the objects.
There exist diffusion based methods to directly generate final arrangement images **Huang et al., "Diffusion for Tidying Up"** and **Li et al., "Object Rearrangement via Diffusion-based Generative Models"**.
These studies rely on the commonsense knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to find arrangements that are similar to human intentions. 

Similar to the current work, studies such as **Yan et al., "TidyScore: A Score Function for Tidying Up"** and **Gupta et al., "Learning to Quantify Tidiness with a Score Function"** learn to quantify the degree of tidiness with a score function. 
**Huang et al., "Energy-based Models for Tidying Up"** uses an energy-based model to learn and predict the cost, which is most relevant to our work. 
While **Kumar et al., "Object Placement via Monte-Carlo Tree Search"** focused on finding positions for just one missing object, our study plans to find the optimal state by moving all movable objects on a table. 
**Li et al., "Policy-based Object Rearrangement via Score Functions"** learns a score function to calculate the likelihood with the target distribution for each task, using this score to learn a policy for rearranging objects. 
Each task requires a separate target distribution, and the score function is trained separately for each task, whereas our study uses a single score function to tidy up across various environments.

Language-guided Monte-Carlo tree search (LGMCTS) **Wang et al., "Language-guided Object Rearrangement via Monte-Carlo Tree Search"** uses the MCTS algorithm to find trajectories to obtain arrangements that satisfy language conditions. 
LGMCTS assumes that explicit spatial conditions can be derived based on language conditions. 
They first establish these spatial conditions and then find a trajectory that arranges the objects to satisfy all these conditions. 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that learns a score function to find various tidied arrangements without the guidance of language.
