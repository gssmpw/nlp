\section{RELATED WORK}
Tidying up is an object rearrangement problem occurring in situations where the goal is not explicitly provided. 
Instead of a specific goal, several research approaches involve expressing goals in natural language ____, 
or finding functional arrangements based on user preferences ____.
Additionally, there are studies that directly learn the degree of tidiness as a score function and plan trajectories to achieve a tidied scene ____.

Recent studies such as StructFormer ____ and StructDiffusion ____ find appropriate positions for objects guided by natural language instructions. 
Both methods take language tokens and object point clouds as inputs to find arrangements that satisfy language conditions. 
Studies such as ____ and ____ learn user preferences to find organized arrangements without explicit goals.
For instance, ____ uses scene graphs to encode scenes and learns user preference vectors, 
and ____ addresses tasks involving the organization of various items into containers or shelves, learning pairwise preferences of objects. % through collaborative filtering.
These studies rely more on semantic information rather than visual information of the objects.
There exist diffusion based methods to directly generate final arrangement images ____, ____.
These studies rely on the commonsense knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to find arrangements that are similar to human intentions. 

Similar to the current work, studies such as ____ and ____ learn to quantify the degree of tidiness with a score function. 
____ uses an energy-based model to learn and predict the cost, which is most relevant to our work. 
While ____ focused on finding positions for just one missing object, our study plans to find the optimal state by moving all movable objects on a table. 
____ learns a score function to calculate the likelihood with the target distribution for each task, using this score to learn a policy for rearranging objects. 
Each task requires a separate target distribution, and the score function is trained separately for each task, whereas our study uses a single score function to tidy up across various environments.

Language-guided Monte-Carlo tree search (LGMCTS) ____ uses the MCTS algorithm to find trajectories to obtain arrangements that satisfy language conditions. 
LGMCTS assumes that explicit spatial conditions can be derived based on language conditions. 
They first establish these spatial conditions and then find a trajectory that arranges the objects to satisfy all these conditions. 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that learns a score function to find various tidied arrangements without the guidance of language.
