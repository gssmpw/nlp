Our research introduces Mutual Reinforcing Data Synthesis (MRDS) within LLMs to enhance few-shot dialogue summarization tasks. While advancing natural language processing, we acknowledge ethical considerations associated with our methodology.
By leveraging synthetic data generated by LLMs, we reduce reliance on large-scale real-world datasets that may contain sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII). We strive to protect user privacy and adhere to data protection regulations by using publicly available datasets (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and implementing data anonymization techniques.

Our method utilizes LLMs pre-trained on vast corpora that might contain biases and stereotypes. Although we train our synthesis and summarization models on public datasets with daily conversations, we recognize that biases may persist. We encourage future work to identify and reduce biases in synthetic data generation and in models trained on such data.
We are committed to transparency. All experimental details—including data preprocessing, model configurations, and evaluation metrics—are thoroughly documented to ensure reproducibility and allow critical assessment by the research community. By openly sharing our methods and findings, we aim to foster collaboration and uphold ethical standards in AI development.

% Our method utilized the LLM pre-trained on vast corpora of text that might contain biases and stereotypes. Although the synthesis and summarization models are trained on the publicly available datasets and with daily conversation, we recognize that biases may still persist. We encourage future work to focus on identifying and reducing biases in both the synthetic data generation process and the models trained on such data.
