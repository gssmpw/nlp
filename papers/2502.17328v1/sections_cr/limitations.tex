Comparing to the baseline method, training summarization adapters on few shot real data only, our method requires additional computation cost for data synthesis adapter training and sampling.
Also, our method makes an assumption that part of the internal knowledge of LLM is useful for the target domain, which might be incorrect for a highly specialized target domain.
