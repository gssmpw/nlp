%To demonstrate the potential of the inter-model agreement to detect out-of-distribution cases and faulty segmentations in real-time, a real-time application was created using the FAST framework [26]. It shows the
%segmentation output of the GCN and nnU-Net side by side together with a status bar that visualizes the agreement between the models. Fig. 12 shows a screenshot of the application in action. We created a demo video [27]
%that shows the application in use while a clinician is operating a GE Vivid E95 scanner. The video demonstrates
%the effectiveness of the inter-model agreement as a method to detect out-of-distribution and low image quality
%cases. The video is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24230194.
