    \caption{Calibration performance of uncertainty-aware methods on fine-tuned Llama2-7B. Arrows (``$\uparrow$'' or ``$\downarrow$'') indicate whether higher or lower values signify better performance, respectively. The best and second-best results are highlighted in \textbf{bold} and \underline{underlined}, respectively. Additionally, $\pm$ denotes the standard deviation of 3 runs. IB-EDL consistently achieves comparable accuracy while significantly reducing ECE and NLL, thereby greatly mitigating the overconfidence of the LLM.}
