    \caption{Fine-tuning Mistral-7B on noisy datasets. In each training dataset, the labels of $30\%$ samples are randomly perturbed. A robust uncertainty-aware method should not only maintain accuracy but also exhibit low calibration error. Non-EDL methods tend to significantly underperform EDL methods in terms of Accuracy. Therefore, the comparison for ECE and NLL is limited to EDL methods, with the best and second-best values among them highlighted.}
