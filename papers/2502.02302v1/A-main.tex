\begin{abstract}
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significant advantages in handling non-Euclidean data and have been widely applied across various areas, thus receiving increasing attention in recent years.
  The framework of GNN models mainly includes the information propagation phase and the aggregation phase, treating nodes and edges as information entities and propagation channels, respectively. 
  However, most existing GNN models face the challenge of disconnection between node and edge feature information, as these models typically treat the learning of edge and node features as independent tasks. 
  To address this limitation, we aim to develop an edge-empowered graph feature preference learning framework that can capture edge embeddings to assist node embeddings. 
  By leveraging the learned multidimensional edge feature matrix, we construct multi-channel filters to more effectively capture accurate node features, thereby obtaining the non-local structural characteristics and fine-grained high-order node features. 
  Specifically, the inclusion of multidimensional edge information enhances the functionality and flexibility of the GNN model, enabling it to handle complex and diverse graph data more effectively. 
  Additionally, integrating relational representation learning into the message passing framework allows graph nodes to receive more useful information, thereby facilitating node representation learning. 
  Finally, experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

  % Due to the remarkable success in learning graph representation from graph-structured data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN) have gained increasing attention recently. 
  % HGNN model framework primarily consists of an information propagation phase and an aggregation process phase, treating nodes and edges as information entities and propagation channels, respectively. 
  % However, considering edges merely as scalars within the HGNN limits the model's capacity for information expression, overlooking the multidimensional attributes and complex relationships of edges. 
  % Additional, Limited by a single value, it can only alter the scale of information, unable to discern more granular information characteristics.
  % To address these challenges, we propose a model named Heterogeneous Graph Feature Preference Network (HGFPN). 
  % HGFPN utilizes a vector representation for edges, thereby incorporating multidimensional edge information, which offers enhanced functionality and flexibility, enabling it to more effectively handle complex and diverse graph data.
  % By integrating the relation representation learning into the message-passing framework, HGFPN enables nodes to receive more useful information and thus benefiting the node representation learning.  
  % Experiments conducted on four real-world heterogeneous graphs have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model.
  
  % Oldest Version 
  % Due to the remarkable success in learning graph representation from graph-structured data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN) have gained increasing attention recently. 
  % Most of the HGNN models use the message-passing framework which is composed of the information propagation phase and the aggregation process phase, by treating nodes and edges as information entities and propagation channels, respectively.
  % The existing models tend to consider the edge as a scalar, with the numerical value indicating the importance of the corresponding information. 
  % Limited by the single value, only the scale of information can be modified, which cannot differentiate features in information at a finer grain. 
  % To alleviate the above problem, edge representations are represented by vectors instead of scalar values, so as to enhance the effectiveness of information exchange. 
  % Considering the characteristics of edge vectors, we call them relation representations in this paper. 
  % Based on this, we propose a novel model named Heterogeneous Graph Feature Preference Network (\alg), which is aware of the varying importance of each feature element when passing message. 
  % By integrating the relation representation learning into the message-passing framework, \alg~enables nodes to receive more useful information and thus benefiting the node representation learning. 
  % Experiments conducted on four datasets have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed model.
