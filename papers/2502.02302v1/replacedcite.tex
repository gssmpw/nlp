This work relates to node representation learning, graph structure learning, and graph attention 
% graph-structure learning and deep learning models
in training representation, so we review prior studies in each category and discuss the differences and relations.

\par\smallskip\noindent
\textbf{Node Representation Learning.}
Traditional node representation learning methods mainly focus on mapping the original node representation vector (e.g. the adjacency vector) into the continuous low-dimension embedding space ____. 
%
Those works usually extend the classical machine learning models for graph-structured data. 
%
The early works like Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) ____, Isomap ____ and Laplacian Eigenmaps ____ try to adopt the eigen-based methods, so as to keep the spectral properties of node when mapping into the lower space, which is time consuming and uneasy to be parallelized. 
%
Recently, inspired by word2vec ____, DeepWalk ____ adopts random walk to generate node sequences to imitate sentences in corpus, and then feeds them into the Skip-gram framework [26] to train node representations, which can to some extent learn both local and global structure information.
%
Node2vec ____ improves the DeepWalk model by introducing a bias mechanism into the random walk, which can get more efficient node sequences to enhance the model performance. 
%
Besides, Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) ____ focuses on extracting the mesoscopic community structure among nodes. 
%
Furthermore, Attributed Network Embedding with Micromeso structure (ANEM) ____ considers three kinds of information in node representation learning: attribute information, the local proximity structure, and mesoscopic community structure.

\textbf{Graph Attention Learning.} 
The message-passing framework, designed to fit the topological characteristics of graphs, has been widely adopted in various graph neural networks. 
In Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) ____, nodes propagate their information to neighbors and then update their representations by averaging the received information. 
Graph Attention Networks (GAT) ____ improve on this by using an attention mechanism to assign different weights to different neighbors. 
Building on GCN and GAT, several methods have been developed to enhance the message-passing framework: Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN) ____ use a coarsening-refining model to hierarchically aggregate node information; 
Relation-aware co-attentive Graph Convolutional Networks (RecoGCN) ____ integrate a co-attention mechanism to adapt GCN for recommender systems by bridging user, item, and agent relations;

and Graphsage ____ extends GCN to inductive learning and explores various aggregation operations like max pooling and LSTM. 
However, these models often treat each edge as a scalar, limiting edge representation capability. 
To better utilize edge information, some models incorporate edge representation learning: 
CensNet ____ constructs two graphs to represent node and edge adjacency, using shared trainable weights to link node and edge representations. 
Inspired by translation mechanisms ____, edge representations are learned by assuming a transforming relation between edges and their corresponding nodes. 
Vectorized Relational Graph Convolutional Network (VR-GCN) ____ combines translation mechanisms with GCN to train node and relation representations in multi-relation network alignment tasks.

However, those models treat the representation learning of edge as the representation learning of node, without considering node interaction, and thus fail to learn the relation between the connected nodes. 
In this case, these models cannot properly integrate the edge representation learning into the message-passing framework.

% \paragraph*{Learning Topological Relations of Graph}


% This work relates to online learning and copula modeling, so we review prior studies in each category and discuss the differences and relations.
% %
% We note that, in concept-drift ____ or non-stationary online learning ____, the changeables are the statistical properties of variables or the underlying decision function, respectively, as data streaming in, but the number of features carried by each input is fixed in a priori.
% %
% Additionally, in the settings of streaming feature mining____, although the new features constantly emerge, the numbers of instances are known beforehand.
% %
% The dynamics of both the instance and feature spaces differentiate our learning problem from theirs.

% \paragraph*{Online Learning in Variable Feature Space}
% %
% Requiring an input sequence over wide time spans to be described by a fixed set of features is in general impractical.
% %
% In response, the pioneer work____ considered a doubly-streaming setting where new inputs carry consistently more features.
% %
% Later studies extend this setting by allowing the pre-existing features to be missed out afterwards,
% either by following a batch-by-batch regularity____ or at purely random____.
% %
% This line of research shares the main idea of exploiting feature-wise relationship 
% to anchor stationary information in a varied feature space.
% %
% Unfortunately, existing methods all consider a continuous  domain 
% and thus do not scale up to the mixed data setting.
% %
% Our \alg\ filled the gap with Gaussian copula that 
% maps and correlates arbitrary marginals across mixed variables
% and hence is more general. 

% \paragraph*{Copula Modeling with Mixed Data}
% %
% To explore a continuous latent space, most of methods assume that the data are of the same digital type and make a prior guess of the underlying distribution, as directly modeling the multivariate joint distribution for mixed marginals is difficult. 
% %
% In this regard, copulas lend us a tool due to its modeling power. 
% %
% Prior studies____ proposed Gaussian copula by combining the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of each feature, and separating marginal distribution from multivariate distribution, 
% which is suitable for modeling with different marginal distributions, 
% harmonizing continuousness and discreteness.
% %
% %cite copula'
% %
% Subsequent works include Bayesian copula with factorized models____,
% impute missing entries in a mixed data matrix by extending Rank-PC____,
% and solving the time-varying complexities and high-dimensionality  in estimating the 
% covariance matrices____.
% %
% However, most studies focus on modeling offline mixed data,
% with very few attempted online settings____.
% %
% None prior work has considered leveraging Gaussian copula
% to deal with an arbitrarily varying feature space so as to learn effective online learners;
% Our \alg\ algorithm strived to fill the gap.


% Our research is also similar to missing feature imputation of mixed data.
% %
% For MNAR data, we can estimate by modeling missing data distribution, most of method estimating parameters in generalized linear models and maximum likelihood estimation____. However, considering the missing completely at random, make previous assumption for distribution or parameter is not reasonable.
% %
% Other common methods such as low rank matrix completion____, widely used in missing value filling and recommendation systems. But these method is base on the assumption that the data can be well approximated by low rank matrices. Fan, Jicong and Zhang \etc ____ propose a high-rank matrix generation model that maps low-dimensional latent variables to high-dimensional environment space, and recover missing items by solving a polynomial matrix completion (PMC) problem. However these method has strictly assumption about dimensions of the matrix, and it is difficult to find a approximate matrix for mixed data.
% %
% Some of methods propose use graphs to model missing data. paper____use Directed Acyclic Graph to model missing causal mechanisms, and demonstrated the feasibility of using the graph model to restore missing. paper____propose, the missing data with observable data can be a Random Intersection Graphs, and can reconstruct the feature by the correlation of graphs. By contrast, refers to Zhao, Yuxuan \etc____, Gaussian copula for missing feature reconstructing is more flexible and it can handle Sparse Data Stream in online learning.
% %
% These methods is mainly restore the original data, but we focus on reconstruct the correlation of feature through latent vector, so as to obtain a stable feature space.
