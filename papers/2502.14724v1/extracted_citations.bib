abstract = {In this paper we describe an analysis of two double auction markets—the clearing house auction and the continuous double auction. The complexity of these institutions is such that they defy analysis using traditional game-theoretic techniques, and so we use heuristic-strategy approximation to provide an approximated game-theoretic analysis. As well as finding heuristic-strategy equilibria for these mechanisms, we subject them to an evolutionary game-theoretic analysis which allows us to quantify which equilibria are more likely to occur. We then weight the design objectives for each mechanism according to the probability distribution over equilibria, which allows us to provide more realistic estimates for the efficiency of each mechanism.},

Our proof uses ideas from the recently-established equivalence between polynomial time solvability of normal form games and graphical games, establishing that these kinds of games can simulate a PPAD-complete class of Brouwer functions.},

abstract = {This paper provides theoretical bounds for empirical game theoretical analysis of complex multi-agent interactions. We provide insights in the empirical meta game showing that a Nash equilibrium of the meta-game is an approximate Nash equilibrium of the true underlying game. We investigate and show how many data samples are required to obtain a close enough approximation of the underlying game. Additionally, we extend the meta-game analysis methodology to asymmetric games. The state-of-the-art has only considered empirical games in which agents have access to the same strategy sets and the payoff structure is symmetric, implying that agents are interchangeable. Finally, we carry out an empirical illustration of the generalised method in several domains, illustrating the theory and evolutionary dynamics of several versions of the AlphaGo algorithm (symmetric), the dynamics of the Colonel Blotto game played by human players on Facebook (symmetric), and an example of a meta-game in Leduc Poker (asymmetric), generated by the PSRO multi-agent learning algorithm.},

title = {Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-bench and Chatbot Arena},
year = {2023},
publisher = {Curran Associates Inc.},
address = {Red Hook, NY, USA},
abstract = {Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80\% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna. The MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30K conversations with human preferences are publicly available at https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge.},

  abstract = 	 {The Elo score has been extensively used to rank players by their skill or strength in competitive games such as chess, go, or StarCraft II. The Elo score implicitly assumes games have a strong additive—hence transitive—component. In this paper, we investigate the challenge of identifying transitive components in games. As a starting point, we show that the Elo score provably fails to extract the transitive component of some elementary transitive games. Based on this observation, we propose an alternative ranking system which properly extracts the transitive components in these games. Finally, we conduct an in-depth empirical validation on real-world game payoff matrices: it shows significant prediction performance improvements compared to the Elo score.}
