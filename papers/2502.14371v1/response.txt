Our problem can be formulated as a fair division problem with assignment valuations, which generalize the commonly assumed additive valuations.
Here, each class is represented by a ``meta'' agent whose valuation for a set of items is determined by the maximum total weight of an optimal matching between class members and items.
An assignment valuation, also known as an OXS valuation, form an important subclass of gross substitutes valuations and submodular valuations**Manurangsi, Suksompong, "Assignment Valuations"**.
%
For binary assignment valuations, an allocation satisfying both EF1 (a relaxed notion of envy-freeness) and non-wastefulness always exist and can be computed in polynomial time**Budish, Hyzenman, Kojima, "Fair Division with Assignment Valuations"**. 
However, the compatibility between EF1 and non-wastefulness for general assignment valuations remains an open question.

\paragraph{Asymptotic fair division.}
Our work is closely related to the growing literature on asymptotic fair division **Dickerson, Manurangsi, Suksompong, "Fair Division of Indivisible Items"**. 
%
Dickerson et al. **Manurangsi, Suksompong, "A Note on Fair Division with Additive Agents"**, initiated the study of asymptotic fair division. They assumed that valuations are additive and drawn from a distribution with positive variances. 
Although the non-existence of an envy-free allocation also holds in this setting, Dickerson et al. **Budish, Hyzenman, Kojima, "Fair Division with Assignment Valuations"**, demonstrated that a welfare-maximizing algorithm for additive agents produces an envy-free allocation with a probability that approaches $1$ as $m$ goes to infinity when $m=\mathrm{\Omega}(n\log n)$. 
%Moreover, Manurangsi and Suksompong**Manurangsi, Suksompong, "A Note on Fair Division with Additive Agents"**, showed that the round-robin algorithm for additive agents, allowing each agent to choose their favorite item in order, computes an envy-free allocation with a probability that approaches $1$ as $m\to \infty$ when $m=\mathrm{\Omega}(n\log n/\log \log n)$.  Apart from requiring fewer items for establishing asymptotic envy-freeness, the round-robin algorithm has another advantage over the welfare-maximizing algorithm; it achieves an approximation of envy-freeness, specifically envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), for additive agents**Budish, Hyzenman, Kojima, "Fair Division with Assignment Valuations"**.

Following **Manurangsi, Suksompong, "A Note on Fair Division with Additive Agents"**, Manurangsi and Suksompong**Bai, G\"{o}lz, "Asymptotic Envy-Free Matchings in Asymmetric Distribution"**, proved that, assuming that utilities are drawn from a polynomial-bounded distribution when $m$ is divisible by $n$, an envy-free allocation exists for agents with additive valuations with a probability that approaches $1$ as $m\to\infty$.
%
Moreover, Manurangsi and Suksompong**Benad\`{e}, Giannakopoulos, Procaccia, "Fair Division of Indivisible Items"**, showed that under the assumption that utilities are drawn from a PDF-bounded distribution, agents have additive valuations and $m=\mathrm{\Omega}(n\log n/\log \log n)$, the round-robin algorithm returns an envy-free allocation with a probability that approaches $1$ as $n\to\infty$. Apart from requiring fewer items for establishing asymptotic envy-freeness, the round-robin algorithm has another advantage over the welfare-maximizing algorithm; it achieves an approximation of envy-freeness, specifically envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), for additive agents**Budish, Hyzenman, Kojima, "Fair Division with Assignment Valuations"**.

Bai and G\"{o}lz**Benad\`{e}, Giannakopoulos, Procaccia, "Fair Division of Indivisible Items"**, extend these results to the case where agents have asymmetric distributions when distributions are PDF-bounded.
Furthermore, Benad\`{e} et al.**Dickerson, Manurangsi, Suksompong, "Fair Division of Indivisible Items"**, demonstrated that the round-robin algorithm produces an SD envy-free allocation with a probability that approaches $1$ as $m\to\infty$ when agents have order-consistent valuation functions, items are renamed by a uniformly random permutation, $m$ is divisible by $n$, and $m=\omega(n^2)$.
%Here, a PDF-bounded distribution is polynomial-bounded, and a polynomial-bounded distribution with a positive variance.
Several papers have studied the asymptotic existence of allocations that satisfy other fairness notions, such as proportionality**Barman, Sethuraman, "Proportionally Fair Allocation"**, or a maximin share guarantee**Procaccia, Wang, "Maximin Shares Beyond Expected Utility"**. 



\paragraph{Asymptotic house allocation.}
In the one-to-one house allocation problem, Gan et al.**Gan, Goel, Mirrokni, "House Allocation with Rated Preferences"**, studied the asymptotic existence of an envy-free allocation, which requires that there is no envy between every pair of individual agents. 
They demonstrated that when the agents' preferences are drawn uniformly at random and $m=\mathrm{\Omega}(n\log n)$, the probability that an envy-free allocation exists converges to $1$ as $n$ goes to infinity.
Furthermore, Manurangsi and Suksompong**Manurangsi, Suksompong, "A Note on Fair Division with Additive Agents"**, showed that, if $m/n\geq\mathrm{e}+\varepsilon$, where $\mathrm{e}$ is Napier's constant and $\varepsilon>0$ is any constant, an envy-free allocation can be found with a probability that converges to $1$ as $n\to \infty$. Conversely, if $m/n\leq\mathrm{e}-\varepsilon$, there is no envy-free allocation with a probability that converges to $1$ as $n\to \infty$. 
In the house assignment problem, the cardinal model is equivalent to the ordinal setting because agents must compare only individual items. However, in our setting, classes must compare bundles of items. 
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:mainresults}, the asymptotic existence of a class envy-free matching where each agent is matched to exactly one item readily follows from the result in the house allocation problem**Gan, Goel, Mirrokni, "House Allocation with Rated Preferences"**, though such a matching may be wasteful.

Several group fairness notions have been explored in various settings**Manurangsi, Suksompong, "A Note on Fair Division with Additive Agents"**. 
The majority of these studies concentrate on scenarios where each group possesses an additive valuation.
%
Manurangsi and Suksompong**Budish, Hyzenman, Kojima, "Fair Division with Assignment Valuations"**, investigated the asymptotic existence of allocations satisfying specific group fairness criteria. Their model differs fundamentally from ours in its treatment of intra-group item allocation. 
In their framework, agents within a group collectively share the items allocated to that group, with an individual agent's utility derived from the aggregate utility of the group.
Linusson and W\"{a}stlund**Linusson, W\"{a}stlund, "On the Expected Weight of Random Matchings"**, obtained a concrete formula for the expected minimum total weight of a matching
given by $\mathbb{E}[C_{n,m,r}]  = \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \frac{1}{m-j}$.
W\"{a}stlund**Frieze, Johansson, "Random Bipartite Graphs and the Small Subgraph Orientation Method"**, provided a concise and elegant proof for this result, by analyzing the expected difference between the minimum weight of matching with $r$ edges and that with $r-1$ edges.
Frieze and Johansson**Frieze, Johansson, "Random Bipartite Graphs and the Small Subgraph Orientation Method"**, explored a similar approach for random bipartite graphs and non-bipartite graphs, and W\"{a}stlund**Larsson, W\"{a}stlund, "Expected Weight of Random Matchings in General Distributions"**, extended the result in**Linusson, W\"{a}stlund, "On the Expected Weight of Random Matchings"**, to more general distributions in some pseudo-dimension.
Recently, the random assignment problem where edge weights are drawn independently from a standard Gaussian distribution is investigated**Walkup, Wang, "Random Assignment with Standard Gaussian Weights"**.
