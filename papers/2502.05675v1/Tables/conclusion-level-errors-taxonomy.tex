\multirow{4}{*}{Wrong Conclusion} & Wrong Conclusion from False Premise(s)      & This error primarily occurs when the step-by-step rationale generated includes premises that are logically invalid, factually incorrect, irrelevant to solving the question posed, or a combination of these issues.                                                                                 \\ \cmidrule{2-3} 
                                  & Wrong Conclusion from Incomplete Premise(s) & This error occurs when valid and sound premises are provided but fail to fully support the reasoning, leading to the wrong conclusion. A special example is 'Wrong Conclusion from Correct Premises,' where sufficient premises still result in an incorrect conclusion.                 \\ \midrule
Right Conclusion                  & Right Conclusion from False Premise(s)      & This error occurs when the LLM reasons to the correct option while providing a wrong argument. One or multiple premises contain errors which fall under one of the three premise-level error categories and yet lead to the reasoning path choosing the correct option as its final answer. \\ \cmidrule{2-3}
                                  & Right Conclusion from Incomplete Premise(s) & This error occurs when the correct final option is selected, even though the premises provided are incomplete or insufficient to fully justify that conclusion.

                                  & Right Conclusion with Hallucinated Content & This error occurs when the LLM selects the correct option but the generated content does not semantically match the provided options. For example, the LLM might output 'Option D. The suspect is \textit{X},' when the actual content is 'Option D. The suspect is \textit{Y} and committed crime \textit{Z},' due to an LLM hallucination.

% \textit{Our current auto-evaluator system cannot detect this, as it cannot distinguish it from a 'Correct Conclusion from Correct Premises' scenario.}
% Wrong Conclusion being reached due to a contributing premise being untrue or being true but irrelevant in solving the question.

% Wrong Conclusion/Premature Conclusion being reached due to incomplete reasoning/premises not being sufficient to reach a correct conclusion OR Wrong Conclusion being reached even when the premises are correct and sufficient.

% Right conclusion being reached even when some premise is incorrect. This means that reasoning chain is still faulty and there is some misinterpretation in some part of the reasoning chain.

% Right conclusion being reached even when premises are insufficient. This means that reasoning chain is still faulty and there is some misinterpretation in some part of the reasoning chain.

% While the correct option is chosen, the content of the option generated by the LLM reasoner does not match with that of the actual option provided in the legal context.
