Previous studies have explored the use of immersive technologies as therapeutic tools for autism, confirming their success in improving social behaviors and enhancing communication and emotional skills ____. These environments engage and satisfy autistic children, guiding them through a series of social tasks via embodied interactions. In the controlled stimuli of virtual environments, children can explore new behavioral opportunities independently ____. Importantly, these immersive settings provide a safe and inclusive space that reduces the hazards and unpredictability of real-life situations, thereby shielding children from potential harm.


% Immersive environments can primarily be delivered through two types of systems: virtual reality (VR) systems that utilize wearable Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) to create immersive experiences, and projection-based systems, such as Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVE) or desktop systems that project virtual environments into real-world settings ____. However, VR systems have limitations, as many autistic children may resist wearing head-mounted devices ____. In contrast, projection-based CAVE environments are effective for teaching children skills needed to navigate unsafe situations, such as crossing streets or avoiding vehicles. Tzanavari et al. have demonstrated the effectiveness of immersive virtual environments in teaching autistic children how to safely cross pedestrian crosswalks ____. Nonetheless, the current landscape of immersive environment systems presents significant research opportunities that remain largely unexplored.
