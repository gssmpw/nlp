\subsection{Affordance and autistic children}
Affordances refer to the opportunities for perception and action that the environment offers to animals (Gibson, 1979) ____. The term, coined by Gibson, evolved when Donald Norman introduced it to design, distinguishing between perceived and actual affordances (Norman, 1988) __ and highlighting potential everyday inconsistencies between them.
Loveland et al. categorize environmental affordances into three levels: physical transactions, cultural preferences, and social signals reflecting others' meanings (Loveland & Tunell, 1993) ____. Autistic children often struggle with the latter two types (Loveland et al., 2000) __. Difficulties with cultural affordances affect tool usage and may link to neurological issues (Bora et al., 2012) ___. Studies have explored interventions like electrical stimulation to enhance this understanding (Fournier et al., 2010) ___. Understanding social signals involves grasping others' expectations, and research on helping autistic children in this area remains limited (Kasari et al., 2003) __.
Perceptual issues with affordances negatively impact social participation of autistic children and contribute to adverse behaviors, reducing learning opportunities (Mazurek et al., 2014) ___. While emotional signal transmission is crucial for interpersonal coordination (Decety & Jackson, 2006) ___, autistic children's difficulties with social affordances (Simpson et al., 2017) __ lead to challenges in social adaptation and independent living (Hill & Frith, 1988) __.

% The advent of LLMs has revolutionized NLP, paving the way for applications that extend far beyond basic text generation. Models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated the capacity to generate human-like responses from the context of the input text (Vinyals & Le, 2015) ____. LLMs have performed excellently in various language tasks, such as translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015) ____, spurring advancements in conversation generation, and even facilitating the writing of code. Beyond text generation, LLMs have stepped into the realms of decision-making and role-playing, where they not only respond to queries but also simulate complex human-like behaviors. AutoGPT (Brown et al., 2022) ____ and HuggingGPT (Liu et al., 2021) ____ use LLMs to plan, select, execute tasks, and generate operations. In role-playing simulations, LLMs can understand character backgrounds and produce dialogues aligned with characters' motivations (Tang & Tesauro, 2008) ____.
