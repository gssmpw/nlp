In this section, we summarize the multi-contact modeling and solver algorithms that have been utilized in robotic simulation. See also Table~\ref{table:simulator_compare} for the comparison of widely used simulators in robotics.

\subsection{Direct Method}
The conventional approach to handling dynamics equations with multi-contact constraints involves formulating the equations as a linear complementarity problem (LCP) ____ then applying Lemke's algorithms ____ or Dantzig's pivoting algorithms. 
While these direct methods can guarantee accuracy, they often suffer from high computational complexity. Moreover, the LCP-based formulation necessitates polygonal friction cone approximation, leading to undesirable error in friction behavior. 
In robotic simulation software, DART ____, ODE ____, and Bullet ____ provide implementations of Dantzig's method to solve the LCP problem.

\subsection{Per-Contact Iteration}

More widely used in recent years are iterative methods, which typically involve locally performing an impulse projection step to achieve global equilibrium. 
One of the most popular iteration schemes is projected Gauss-Seidel (PGS), which has been extensively developed and adopted in the game and graphics community ____ as well as in robotics ____. 
These methods are known for being simple, robust, and advantageous in generating visually plausible results. 
However, they often experience slow convergence and limited efficiency, especially when the constraints are highly coupled. 
These weaknesses are particularly emphasized in robotic simulation, as the generalized coordinate representation (e.g., robot joint angles) is common, and over-specified contact (i.e., system DOF $<$ constraint DOF) is prevalent in manipulation tasks.
%and complex internal constraints (e.g., finite element).
Several research efforts have aimed to enhance the performance of impulse iteration methods. In ____, the bisection method is presented as a potential replacement for the local projection scheme in PGS, demonstrating its effectiveness in quadruped locomotion simulation. Additionally, a substepping variant of PGS, named temporal Gauss-Seidel (TGS), is introduced in ____, showing its better convergence in various situations.

\subsection{Nonlinear Equation}

Another approach to dealing with multi-contact simulation is to express all required relations in nonlinear equation form and solve them using gradient descent iteration. 
Implicit penalty-based contact, often referred to as regularized contact, exhibits the most natural connection to this approach, as demonstrated in ____. 
However, penalty methods have well-known weaknesses that they often necessitate parameter tuning to achieve plausible results, and high penalty gains can lead to numerical issues.
For the other direction, in ____ construct and solve a nonlinear equation with complementarity smoothing, and ____ we derived a nonsmooth equation using the complementarity function (e.g., Fischer-Burmeister).
While these methods typically exhibit superlinear convergence, the intricate nature of contact conditions frequently leads to lack of robustness or challenges in line search.
