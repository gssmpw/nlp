\section{Conclusion}

The integration of LLM-powered agents into recommender systems has emerged as a significant advancement in recent years. 
In this survey, we systematically categorize existing approaches into three paradigms: recommender-oriented, interaction-oriented, and simulation-oriented. 
We comprehensively analyze these methods through a unified four-module architecture and review current datasets and evaluation methodologies.
Finally, we identify three promising directions for future research.
