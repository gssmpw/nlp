In this study, we investigate the contributions of various LoRAs to multi-LoRA composition in the Fourier domain. To understand the origins of semantic conflicts in multi-LoRA image generation, we perform a frequency-based analysis of their latent feature maps, revealing significant disparities in frequency contributions among different LoRAs. This finding leads us to propose a versatile Fourier-based profiling method to sequence the fusion of dominant LoRAs during inference, which can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-LoRA frameworks. Finally, we introduce a powerful training-free framework called Cached Multi-LoRA, which denoises images by prioritizing the contributions of dominant LoRAs while incorporating supplementary information from cached non-dominant LoRAs. To validate our approach, we evaluate CMLoRA on the \textit{ComposLoRA} testbed and introduce a scalable, automated evaluation framework based on MiniCPM-V, designed to avoid out-of-distribution issues. 
% Our proposed Fourier-based profiling partition can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-LoRA frameworks, providing a versatile approach to enhancing the quality of images generated from multi-LoRAs.
