    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

In this section, we describe the architecture of \sysname{}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}. \sysname{} contains both control plane components and data plane components. The components of the control plane manage the registration of model metadata, autoscaling, model adapter registration, and enforce various types of policies. Data plane components provide configurable components for dispatching, scheduling, and serving inference requests, enabling flexible and high-performance model execution.

\paragraph{The \sysname{} Control Plane.} The \sysname{} control plane streamlines LLM deployment by automating model management, optimizing resource allocation, and enabling intelligent scaling. AIbrix at this moment does not build any abstractions for base models, it still leverage kubernetes deployment for basic lifecycle operations. The LoRA Adapter controller enhances flexibility by enabling multi-LoRA-per-pod deployments, improving scalability and resource utilization. Another controller named RayClusterFleet manages multi-node inference for large scale models served by vLLM.

To bridge inference engines with control plane, \sysname{} features an AI Runtime that acts as a lightweight sidecar, offloading management tasks, enforcing policies, and abstracting engine interactions for systems like vLLM, SGLang (\cite{zheng2024sglang}), and TensorRT-LLM. Complementing this, the Cold Start Manager tracks model artifacts across DRAM, local storage, and cloud storage, ensuring models are loaded on the fastest available node to minimize startup latency. 

Meanwhile, the LLM-Specific Autoscaler enables real-time, millisecond-level scaling, leveraging KV cache utilization and inference-aware metrics to optimize resource allocation dynamically. Together, these components form a highly adaptive control plane, integrating cloud infrastructure and inference engines co-design to deliver scalable, cost-efficient, and high-performance LLM inference.



\paragraph{The \sysname{} Data Plane.} \sysname{} features a data plane that is responsible for handling user requests, managing model instances, executing inference, and optimizing caching strategies to ensure efficient and scalable LLM serving. It is designed to be both application-aware and resource-aware, integrating deep inference optimizations with cloud-native orchestration.

At the entry point, the API Gateway serves as the central request dispatcher, enforcing fairness policies, rate control (TPM/RPM), and workload isolation, while dynamically optimizing traffic based on KV cache locality, token throughput, and GPU heterogeneity. This adaptive routing mechanism ensures efficient inference execution across diverse hardware configurations.

Model execution is facilitated by the Serving Unit, which consists of both the Inference Engine and the AI Runtime sidecar. \sysname{} also introduces a distributed KV Cache Runtime, which extends external cache services to manage dynamically generated KV cache during inference. KV cache reuse is crucial for reducing redundant computation and improving token generation efficiency. The distributed DRAM-based KV cache runtime enables scalable, low-latency cache access across nodes and supports advanced optimizations, such as prefix cache expansion, future prefill/decode disaggregation remote pool (\cite{zhong2024distserve}) and request migration, further improving performance in memory-constrained environments and play a crucial role when certain features are incompatible. For example, in vLLM v0.7.1, when MLA is enabled for Deepseek-R1, prefix cache must be disabled in vLLM.


Together, these components form a highly optimized data plane, ensuring that \sysname{} delivers scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance inference for LLM applications while balancing latency, resource utilization, and workload fairness.

\subsection{\sysname{} Features}

\sysname{} brings together a few innovations to streamline enterprise-grade LLM infrastructure, enhancing scalability and efficiency. 

\subsubsection{High-Density LoRA Management.} 

Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (\cite{hulora}) fine-tuned models has traditionally been constrained by rigid deployments, limiting flexibility and increasing costs. Conventional serving infrastructures treat LoRA adapters as static attachments to a base model, making dynamic scaling impractical. The lack of integrated resource management results in inefficient allocation, unreliable evictions, and suboptimal failure handling.

\sysname{} introduces high-density LoRA management (Figure~\ref{fig:lora}), enabling dynamic adapter loading and unloading, intelligent scheduling, and LoRA-aware routing to enhance inference efficiency. By dynamically registering LoRA adapters, \sysname{} supports high-density deployments, significantly reducing inference costsâ€”particularly beneficial for long-tail scenarios. Leveraging Kubernetes' Service and EndpointSlice mechanisms, \sysname{} optimizes LoRA model discovery and placement, minimizing interference and maximizing resource utilization. Additionally, enhancements to vLLM strengthen LoRA management capabilities, reducing operational overhead and improving inference performance under mixed workloads.

\end{minipage}



\subsubsection{Advanced LLM Gateway and Routing Strategies} 

Traditional API gateways struggle with LLM inference due to the diverse complexities of requests, ranging from simple queries to multi-turn interactions that require intricate token management. Generic routing leads to inefficient traffic distribution and latency spikes. \sysname{} addresses this by providing an LLM-aware gateway, extending the Envoy Gateway (\cite{envoy}) to support instance routing, prefix cache awareness, and least-GPU-memory-based strategies, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:routing}. Unlike conventional systems that blindly distribute requests, \sysname{} analyzes token patterns, prefill cache availability, and compute overhead to optimize traffic flow. This enables advanced routing customization and user-defined strategies. For each pending request, the current version of \sysname{} determines the target instance based on one of the following routing policies: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \texttt{random}: Randomly selects an available instance.
    \item \texttt{throughput}: Selects the instance with the lowest throughput in terms of tokens per second.
    \item \texttt{least-request}: Selects the instance with the lowest number of admitted requests.
    \item \texttt{least-kv-cache}: Selects the instance with the lowest average KV cache usage. 
    \item \texttt{least-latency}: Selects the instance with the lowest average request latency. For each request, this is derived from the sum of its queuing latency and serving latency.
    \item \texttt{prefix-cache-aware}: Prioritizes instances with reusable prefix cache, with a cache hit exceeding the threshold.
\end{itemize}
By selecting a fitting routing strategy, \sysname{} is able to reduce mean latency by 19.2\% and P99 latency by 79\%, ensuring efficient and fair LLM inference at scale. AIBrix team is also working with Google and other contributors on gateway-api-inference-extension \cite{gateway-api-inference-extension} project for future adoption.
    




\subsubsection{Unified AI Runtime with GPU Streaming Loader} 

The domain of inference engines is evolving rapidly, with certain engines quickly surpassing others in terms of performance. Additionally, some engines offer unique features, such as specialized support for specific model optimizations or feature combinations. As a result, users often prefer to leverage different engines based on their performance benefits or feature sets.

However, directly supporting these engines in the control plane is not scalable due to the wide variety of protocols they use. To address this, an abstraction layer is necessary to unify and streamline interactions with these diverse inference engines, allowing for seamless integration and more efficient management. \sysname{} introduces a unified AI runtime (Figure~\ref{fig:runtime}), acting as a bridge between the \sysname{} Control Plane and inference engine pods. This runtime manages models, configures engines, provides observability, and enables vendor-agnostic support. It ensures seamless communication between core components, such as the LoRA adapter controller, autoscaler, and cold start manager, facilitating dynamic, cloud-native resource management.

\end{figure}






\subsubsection{LLM-Specific Autoscaling for Performance Optimization} 
Autoscaling for LLM inference presents unique challenges due to DCGM (\cite{dcgm}) metric limitations, non-linear scaling behaviors, and the inadequacy of traditional indicators like QPS or concurrency. Request complexity and I/O size vary widely, often overwhelming systems before autoscalers can react. Moreover, large model images and slow model distribution introduce a 2-3 minute delay for new pods, making rapid scaling inefficient. \sysname{} mitigates these challenges by supporting configurable LLM-specific autoscaling policies. It bypasses the custom metrics path and maintains sliding window metric aggregation directly in the autoscaler for real-time load reporting. By leveraging advanced autoscaling algorithms such as Knative Pod Autoscaler (KPA) (\cite{kpa}) and \sysname{} Pod Autoscaler (APA) (\cite{huo2023high}), \sysname{} is able to reduce latency by 11.5\%, increases token throughput by 11.4\%, and minimizes scaling oscillations by 33\% compared to native HPA. Future work explores token-based proactive scaling and SLO-driven autoscaling for enhanced efficiency and responsiveness.


\subsubsection{Distributed KV Cache Pool}

The growing demand for large language models necessitates efficient memory management and caching strategies to optimize inference performance and reduce costs. In multi-turn applications such as chatbots and agent-based systems, overlapping token sequences often lead to redundant computations during the prefill phase, resulting in resource wastage and limited throughput. While inference engines like vLLM incorporate built-in KV caching, single-node caches suffer from memory constraints, engine-specific storage limitations, and a lack of support for KV migration and prefill-decode disaggregation.

To address these challenges, \sysname{} introduces a distributed KV cache (Figure~\ref{fig:cachepool}), enabling high-capacity, cross-engine KV reuse while optimizing network and memory efficiency. The system employs a scan-resistant eviction policy to selectively persist hot KV tensors, reducing unnecessary data transfers. Additionally, asynchronous metadata updates minimize overhead, while cache-engine colocation accelerates data transfer through shared memory.

Table~\ref{tab:eval_cache_performance_comparison} presents the performance evaluation of our distributed KV cache using the Bird-SQL benchmark (\cite{birdsql}), conducted on 4 $\times$ Nvidia A10 GPUs. Our results indicate that, even when compared to vLLMâ€™s built-in prefix caching, combining the distributed KV cache with prefix caching improves peak throughput by approximately 50\%, reduces average and P99 TTFT by approximately 60\% and 70\%, respectively, and lowers average and P99 ITL by approximately 30\% and 70\%, respectively. These findings demonstrate significant efficiency gains.

\subsubsection{Mix-Grain Multi-Node Inference Orchestration}
The release of Llama-3.1-405B (\cite{llama3-405b}) and Deepseek-R1 (\cite{deepseek-r1}) has significantly increased the demand for multi-node inference. However, existing frameworks such as vLLM prioritize parallelism over service-oriented requirements like scaling and rolling upgrades, necessitating external orchestration.

While Kubernetes and Ray provide orchestration capabilities, they come with trade-offs: Kubernetes operators offer coarse-grained resource management but can be complex for fine-grained scheduling, whereas Ray excels in distributed communication but lacks holistic resource control.

To address these limitations, \sysname{} introduces a hybrid approach that integrates Ray for fine-grained application orchestration with Kubernetes for coarse-grained resource management. This method simplifies operator design, ensuring adaptability to future paradigm shifts in inference orchestration. We observed that orchestration often changes due to inadequate techniques, such as prefill and decode (P\&D) disaggregation. Maintaining flexibility in orchestration design is crucial. Informed by Bytedance's extensive experience in managing Kubernetes and Ray workloads, \sysname{} leverages adaptive orchestration strategies to overcome workload communication challenges and optimize multi-node inference execution.

    \label{fig:mixgrain}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Cost-Efficient and SLO-Driven Heterogeneous Serving} 

Recent research, such as M\'elange (\cite{griggs2024m}) and QLM (\cite{patke2024queue}), has demonstrated that LLM throughput under specific SLO constraints depends on input/output token counts and model selection within heterogeneous GPU environments.

Additionally, request cost-efficiency varies across GPUs even for identical models, as different GPUs exhibit distinct performance characteristics under varying workloads. Compounding these challenges, production users often face GPU availability constraints, limiting access to consistent GPU types.

To address these issues, \sysname{} introduces a GPU optimizerâ€”an off-path component designed to optimize heterogeneous GPU serving by balancing cost efficiency and SLO adherence. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hetero}, the architecture consists of three key components:


\begin{figure}[ht]%

    \hfill
    \subfloat[\centering \textit{Most requests favor L20 for cost-efficiency, while those with <200 input and <100 output tokens prefer A10.}]{{\includegraphics[width=.45\columnwidth]{plot/hetero/hetero-cost.png}}\label{fig:hetero-cost}}
    \caption{\textit{Selection of accelerator types differ by workloads used.}}
    \label{fig:hetero-accel-types}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figure/hetero.jpeg}
    \caption{\textit{Cost-Efficient and SLO-Driven Heterogeneous Serving.}}
    \label{fig:hetero}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Load Monitor} tracks deployment changes, assumes different model deployments use distinct GPUs, and analyzes \sysname{} Gateway statistics to identify dominant workload patterns.
    
    \item \textbf{GPU Optimizer} dynamically selects the optimal GPU combination to balance cost efficiency and SLO adherence.
    
    \item \textbf{Pod Autoscaler} reads external MetricSource data from the GPU Optimizer to adjust GPU allocation dynamically. Currently, the GPU optimizer supports an ILP-based solution inspired by Melange, requiring pre-deployment profiling. \sysname{} provides toolkits for workload benchmarking and profiling.
\end{itemize}


In our experiment comparing heterogeneous workloads (using A10 (\cite{a10}) and L20 (\cite{l20})) against a homogeneous setup (using only L20), we evaluated a mixed dataset comprising ShareGPT (\cite{sharegpt}) and internal Text2SQL workloads. The heterogeneous configuration resulted in a latency increase of up to 20\% while remaining within the specified SLO. However, this setup achieved a cost reduction of approximately 10\% compared to the homogeneous GPU deployment.





\subsubsection{AI Accelerator Diagnostic and Failure Mockup Tools} 

GPU failures and performance degradation pose significant challenges in large-scale AI deployments. Silent errors, overheating, memory leaks, and intermittent failures can degrade model performance, increase latency, or even cause system crashes. Diagnosing GPU issues is particularly difficult in heterogeneous environments, where different GPU models exhibit inconsistent behavior under varying workloads.

To tackle these challenges, AIBrix Accelerator Tools introduces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPU diagnostics and issue identification.} \sysname{} automates fault detection, helping users proactively identify and resolve GPU-related performance issues before they impact workloads (Figure~\ref{fig:diagnosis}).
    \item \textbf{GPU failure mock-up tools.} \sysname{} simulates GPU failures, allowing developers to test and build resilient AI frameworks capable of recovering gracefully from hardware failures. Currently, both Nvidia GPUs and Ascend 910B NPUs are supported, with plans to extend compatibility to additional accelerators in the near future (Figure~\ref{fig:mockfile}).
\end{itemize}
