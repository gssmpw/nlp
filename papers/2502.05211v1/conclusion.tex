\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Our study contributes a crucial systemization of FL defenses, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the selection, combination, and design of defenses.   
Additionally, we address an often-overlooked aspect in the FL poisoning defense literatureâ€” the \emph{experimental setups employed} to assess defense efficacy.  
After reviewing a variety of defense works, we identify prevalent questionable experimental trends. Through case studies featuring well-known defenses such as TrMean, FLDetector, and FedRecover, we illustrate how the choice of experimental setups can significantly impact robustness claims.
