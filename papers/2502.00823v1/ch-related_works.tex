\textbf{Pure and mixed state tomography:}
In full state tomography of an $N$ dimensional quantum state $\rho$, the goal is to reconstruct its complete classical representation given several independent copies. The associated sample complexity refers to the number of copies required to obtain a classical description of $\rho$ up to an accuracy  $\epsilon$. It has been shown that the sample complexity up to trace distance $\epsilon$ is $\tilde{\Theta}(N r^2/\epsilon^2)$ for incoherent measurements \citep{harrow16sampletomography, kueng2014lowrankmatrixrecovery, chen2023doesadaptivityhelpquantum}, where $r$ is the rank of the density matrix $\rho$.
This result highlights a fundamental separation in the sample complexities between pure and mixed state tomography, as the rank of pure states is $r=1$.
Given the fundamental nature of this separation in quantum information science, one might expect it to persist in the online learning setting.
In fact, \citep{Lumbreras_2022} studies the online learning of properties of quantum states under bandit feedback with adaptive measurements, obtaining a regret scaling of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ for mixed states.
Subsequently, \citep{lumbreras2024learningpurequantumstates} improved this result to $\Theta(\mathrm{polylog}\ T)$ for pure states with rank-$1$ projective measurements, showing an exponential separation.
In contrast, our results demonstrate that, in the general online learning setting, the regret scaling for pure and mixed states is identical.


\textbf{Existing bounds:} \citet{aaronson2019online} showed that the sequential fat-shattering dimension of quantum states with parameter $\delta$ is tight, of order $\Theta(\frac{n}{\delta^2})$. He also uses a result from \citet{arora2012multiplicative} to show that the regret is tight for the $L_1$ loss in the non-realizable case (that is when the data isn't assumed to come from an actual quantum state), being of order $\Theta(\sqrt{nT})$. In this paper, we generalize, although non-constructively, the tightness of regret to the realizable case in \cref{cor:tight_reg_gen}. We also provide lower bounds for sequential fat-shattering dimension for several restricted settings, notably proving almost tightness for pure states in \cref{theo:final_pure}.
