[human]: How many integers are in the solution of the inequality $|x + 5| < 10$?

[bot]: To solve the inequality $|x + 5| < 10$, we break it into two cases based on the definition of absolute value: 
1. $x + 5 < 10$ 
2. $-(x + 5) < 10$, which simplifies to $x + 5 > -10$ 
Solving each case: 
1. $x < 5$ 
2. $x > -15$ 
Combining these, we get $-15 < x < 5$. This inequality means that $x$ can be any number greater than $-15$ and less than $5$. To find how many integers satisfy this condition, we list them: $-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. There are 19 integers that satisfy the inequality $|x + 5| < 10$.

1. $x < -5$ 
2. $x > -15$

[human]: What about $|x + 10| < 10$?

1. $x + 10 < 10$ 
2. $-(x + 10) < 10$, which simplifies to $x + 10 > -10$ 
Solving each case: 
1. $x < 0$ 
2. $x > -20$ 
Combining these, we get $-20 < x < 0$. This inequality means that $x$ can be any number greater than $-20$ and less than $0$. To find how many integers satisfy this condition, we list them: $-19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=3pt,right=3pt,top=3pt,bottom=3pt,title=\textbf{Answer (Ours):}]
To find the number of positive integers that satisfy the inequality $(|x + 10| < 5)$, we need to look for positive integers in the solution set $(-15 < x < -5)$. Since there are no positive integers in this interval, the answer is 0.
