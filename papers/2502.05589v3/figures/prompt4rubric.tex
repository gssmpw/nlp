# Instruction
## Context
**Goal**: Your task is to evaluate the differences between a language 
model's predicted segmentation and the ground-truth segmentation made 
by expert annotators for multiple human-bot conversations. 
Analyze these differences, reflect on the prediction errors, and 
generate one concise rubric item for future conversation segmentation. 
You will be provided with some existing rubric items derived 
from previous examples. 
1. Begin by reviewing and copying the existing rubric items.
2. Modify, update, or replace the existing items if they do not 
adequately address the current segmentation errors.
3. Generate only one new rubric item to minimize segmentation errors 
in the given examples.
4. Select and reflect on the most representative example 
from the provided data.
**Data**: You will receive a segmented conversation example, 
including both the prediction and the ground-truth segmentation.
Each segment begins with "Segment segment_id:". 
Additionally, you will be provided with some existing rubric items 
derived from previous examples. Modify, update, or even replace them 
if they do not adequately explain the current segmentation mistakes.
## Requirements
- Add at most one new rubric item at a time even 
though multiple examples are provided.
- Ensure the rubric is user-centric, concise, and each item 
is mutually exclusive.
- You can modify, update, or replace the existing items 
if they do not adequately 
address the current segmentation errors.
- Present your new rubric item within `<rubric></rubric>`. 
- Provide the most representative example with your reflection 
within `<example></example>`. Here is an example:
```
<reflection>
Your reflection on the prediction errors, 
example by example.
</reflection>
<rubric>
- [one and only one new rubric item]
</rubric>
<example>
Present the most representative example, 
along with your reflection on this example. 
</example>
