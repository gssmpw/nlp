\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a sample weight averaging strategy to address variance inflation of previous independence-based sample reweighting algorithms. 
We prove its validity and benefits with theoretical analyses. 
Extensive experiments across synthetic and multiple real-world datasets demonstrate its superiority in mitigating variance inflation and improving covariate-shift generalization.
