\section{Corrupted Dataset: Duplication}
\label{dadupe}
As we are aware of the circuit and mechanism of the IOI task \textit{a priori}, we augment the data to inhibit the backup/duplication behavior of the  Duplicate Token Heads and Induction Heads by replacing the S2 token with a random single-token name. For example: 
\textit{"When Mark and Rebecca went to the garden, \textcolor{red}{Tim} gave flowers to Rebecca"}.\\

\textbf{Experimental Conclusion}: In the case of this particular corrupted data augmentation, we find that there is no statistically significant change in the model mechanisms across a variety of epochs. However, further explorations are needed to justify the robustness of the model to this type of corruption which we leave for future work.
