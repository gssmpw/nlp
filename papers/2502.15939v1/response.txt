Below we present literature on LLMs and chatbots in healthcare, design principles for chatbots, and research on cultural sensitivity in HCI and with LLMs. 

\subsection{Information-Seeking and Chatbots in Healthcare}
The chiadd{HCI literature has well-established that information seeking and processing are deeply influenced by people's daily lives and their social contexts--both in terms of how one finds and searches for accurate or verifiable information, and how they process and apply it ____ (Gardiner et al., "Designing Information-Seeking Systems"). 
In high-stakes environments such as healthcare, getting access to timely and accurate information becomes even more critical. HCI has long documented how people make sense of health information ____ (Eysenbach, "Health-Related Web-Surfing"), such as through social media ____ (Gruzd et al., "Exploring the Relationship Between Twitter Activity and Traditional Media Coverage"). 
% X ____.
For underserved communities specifically, information gaps are amplified by systemic barriers like limited digital literacy ____ (Mitra, "Understanding Digital Literacy"), distrust in automated systems ____ (Kimura et al., "Distrust in Automated Systems"), contradictory nature of certain cultural and healthcare practices ____ (Rocha et al., "Cultural Beliefs and Healthcare Practices"),  and general difficulties in navigating through existing healthcare systems ____ (Gruen et al., "Navigating the Healthcare System"). Prior work by Yadav et al. \RD{and Wang et al.} has aimed to bridge this gap using chatbots designed to meet the needs of breastfeeding women and adolescent sex education while keeping in mind these constraints ____ (Yadav et al., "Culturally Congruent Chatbot Design").}  
\RD{By incorporating local beliefs and considering social dynamics like family influence ____ (Wang et al., "Adapting Chatbots to Local Beliefs"), they aim to provide culturally congruent health education.
%Their chatbot Feedpal, designed to serve as the first point of contact for breastfeeding mothers ____ (Yadav et al., "FeedPal: A Culturally Congruent Chatbot"), and SnehAI,  designed for SRH awareness among youth ____ (Wang et al., "SnehAI: A Culturally Congruent Chatbot"), adapted their responses to align with local beliefs. By incorporating culturally contextualized responses and considering social dynamics such as family influence their approach highlights how chatbots can be adapted for high-impact, community-driven health education. 
%Yadav et al. emphasize the significance of culturally aware chatbot design in healthcare. 
}
 
% These patterns become more nuanced as one seeks information about more sensitive subjects such as health. 
% These studies further strengthen our proposal of incorporating sociocultural contexts into LLM-based chatbots to account for diverse information-seeking patterns across different communities. 
% Incorporation of such contextualized healthcare information-seeking patterns ____ onto LLMs thus becomes very important in providing care and help. 

Recent studies in HCI and health informatics show a growing interest in utilizing chatbots in configurable healthcare interventions to improve patient engagement due to their anthropomorphic communication styles____ (Purves et al., "Chatbots in Healthcare"). Usage of LLM-based chatbots could possibly mark a new era of digital patient engagement and care delivery ____ (Kidd et al., "Digital Patient Engagement"). The use of LLM-based chatbots for healthcare started with a lot of attention on aiding conversations around mental health ____ (Balestrini et al., "Mental Health Chatbots"), virtual caregiving ____ (Lopes et al., "Virtual Caregivers"), and personalized health information delivery ____ (Wang et al., "Personalized Health Information"). LLMs have been particularly beneficial for these applications, as they can provide desired information while allowing for open-ended questions and conversations ____ (Yadav et al., "Open-Ended Conversations with LLMs"). Their multilingual and personalization capabilities ____ also allow tailoring of interactions to the individual linguistic background and their health literacy levels ____ (Rudin et al., "Health Literacy Levels"). Studies have shown that these models, when paired with factual clinical knowledge, have the potential to offer contextually relevant information in response to user's queries, making them suitable for complex healthcare interactions. 

The rapid advancement of LLMs in healthcare requires frameworks to address ethical concerns ____.
Major issues include ensuring clinically-accurate medical responses ____ (Balestrini et al., "Clinical Accuracy"), privacy concerns ____ (Kimura et al., "Privacy Concerns"), and potential biases ____ (Kidd et al., "Biases"). In response, the World Health Organization has released ethics and governance guidelines for the safe use of LLMs in healthcare____ (WHO, "Ethics Guidelines"). Though these chatbots might be able to help people who have no other options at their disposal ____ (Purves et al., "Helping Those with No Options"), evidence suggests that they have notable risks ____ (Lopes et al., "Risks of LLMs"). Hence, there has been a growing research interest around the design ____ and evaluation of chatbots in healthcare ____ (Wang et al., "Chatbot Design"), and documentation of ethical challenges that they may pose ____ (Rudin et al., "Ethical Challenges").

\subsection{Design of Chatbots}
The design of healthcare chatbots prioritizes usage of high-quality clinical knowledge ____ (Balestrini et al., "Clinical Knowledge"), security, safety ____ (Kimura et al., "Safety and Security"), and accurate comprehension of the user's query. The HCI community has placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of appropriate user experience ____ (Purves et al., "User Experience"), by assessment and incorporation of emotional intelligence ____ (Rudin et al., "Emotional Intelligence") and adaptability ____ to these chatbots. These factors are crucial to the design of the bot given the risks involved in healthcare interactions ____ (Kidd et al., "Healthcare Risks") and the empathy required ____ (Lopes et al., "Empathy in Healthcare"). As with other HCI research, there is a strong emphasis on user-centered design ____ (Wang et al., "User-Centered Design"). One of the primary challenges is ensuring clinical accuracy while maintaining cultural sensitivity ____ (Yadav et al., "Cultural Sensitivity").

\subsection{Cultural Sensitivity in LLMs}

Within the HCI community, researchers have defined cultural sensitivity as the extent to which ethnic, cultural, and local contexts are incorporated in the design, delivery, and evaluation of these chatbots ____ (Rudin et al., "Cultural Contexts"). This may entail aligning with different communication styles, e.g. directness ____ (Kimura et al., "Directness"), tone ____ (Lopes et al., "Tone"), dialect ____ , and adapting to what is preferred locally and culturally ____ (Wang et al., "Local Preferences"). It also includes recognizing cultural variations in family roles in healthcare, including gender norms ____ , differing levels of healthcare access, and health and data literacies____ . 

Recent work by Adilazuarda et \textit{al.} has defined proxies of culture, which can be mapped to certain measurable aspects of LLMâ€™s responses and language ____ (Adilazuarda et al., "Cultural Proxies"). Based on modeling and linguistic analysis, they give guidelines and techniques to improve cultural and linguistic sensitivity ____ . 

% \chiadd{While there are various challenges and misalignments in usage of LLMs in these contexts, there are some specific to healthcare information access ____ which require additional focus. There are differences in how health conditions are understood and described across cultures ____ , hence designing these system requires varying the preferences of array of various qualitative parameters ____ like directness ____ , expectations ____ , level of information ____ , the tone of interactions ____ , etc.}

%Despite advancements in technology, existing AI systems often struggle with cultural misunderstandings due to exclusion of language diversity in the training dataset since the majority of the LLMs are trained in English. Accurate interpretation of user queries requires not only linguistic translation but also a deep understanding of cultural differences that influence interaction patterns. Researchers proposed the inclusion of various techniques such as comprehensive linguistic analysis, cultural context modeling, and user feedback mechanisms to achieve better performance excelling in both cultural sensitivity and linguistic accuracy by reducing potential biases in training data, increasing the adaptability to low-resource languages, and the need for continuous development based on user interactions. Study showed that users find the augmented translated text to be culturally sensitive and provide better interaction experiences to the user.

%\subsection{HCI and Cultural Sensitivity }
%Researchers defined cultural sensitivity as the extent to which ethnic, cultural, and other factors are incorporated in the design, delivery, and evaluation of health communication. In healthcare applications, cultural sensitivity in LLMs-based chatbots plays a critical role, as it helps bridge the gap between patient needs and AI-provided information. This sensitivity ensures that diverse populations are catered to appropriately, with tailored, relevant healthcare advice. By addressing cultural biases and adapting to different languages, chatbots can provide more accurate and culturally appropriate responses, ultimately improving the quality of healthcare interactions.
