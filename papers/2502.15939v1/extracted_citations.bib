abstract="Culture influences human preferences and behaviour. Many HCI products are being designed and developed in cross cultural contexts. Culture's influence needs to be accommodated in the HCI design process. There is a need to understand how the current design processes for HCI products are accommodating for culture's influence. Discussion with HCI designers is one possible method to do this. This paper reports findings of interviews with 30 HCI designers from India. The one on one semi structured qualitative interviews were conducted to understand whether the current design processes under practice are sensitive to culture's influence on design and what are the detriments to accommodate cultural influences in the design process. The key findings suggest that the inclusion of cultural concerns in the design process are directly influenced by the project leadership's awareness and the client's awareness of the impact of culture in acceptance of HCI products. In projects where the client had not specifically asked for cultural sensitivity of the HCI product, design processes did not include the cultural concerns in the development of the product.",

abstract = {We present a computational application to facilitate text chat-based communication between people with different cultural and language background. We focus on end-to-end communication between people with rudimentary and intermediary knowledge of the second language using computer support rather than using a simple connection with automated computer translation. Through a user-centered design process, involving three increasingly hifidelity prototypes, we created a system that allows users who speak different languages to send text messages between them that begins with an automated translation of their message that does a partial translation but normally has words that are not translated well. These poorly translated words are then searched for in a common sense knowledge base for the sender's culture that contains meanings gleaned from a large open source initiative to collect common sense knowledge. Using these additional concepts and words coupled to a translator, the user can select from a list of translations those that are better suited to the intention of the message. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach empirically to show that users find the augmented translated messages are culturally sensitive and provide better communication experiences than without it. Our study used messaging between Portuguese (Brazilian) and English speakers.},

abstract = {Recent large language models (LLMs) have advanced the quality of open-ended conversations with chatbots. Although LLM-driven chatbots have the potential to support public health interventions by monitoring populations at scale through empathetic interactions, their use in real-world settings is underexplored. We thus examine the case of CareCall, an open-domain chatbot that aims to support socially isolated individuals via check-up phone calls and monitoring by teleoperators. Through focus group observations and interviews with 34 people from three stakeholder groups, including the users, the teleoperators, and the developers, we found CareCall offered a holistic understanding of each individual while offloading the public health workload and helped mitigate loneliness and emotional burdens. However, our findings highlight that traits of LLM-driven chatbots led to challenges in supporting public and personal health needs. We discuss considerations of designing and deploying LLM-driven chatbots for public health intervention, including tensions among stakeholders around system expectations.},

abstract = {From ELIZA to Alexa, Conversational Agents (CAs) have been deliberately designed to elicit or project empathy. Although empathy can help technology better serve human needs, it can also be deceptive and potentially exploitative. In this work, we characterize empathy in interactions with CAs, highlighting the importance of distinguishing evocations of empathy between two humans from ones between a human and a CA. To this end, we systematically prompt CAs backed by large language models (LLMs) to display empathy while conversing with, or about, 65 distinct human identities, and also compare how different LLMs display or model empathy. We find that CAs make value judgments about certain identities, and can be encouraging of identities related to harmful ideologies (e.g., Nazism and xenophobia). Moreover, a computational approach to understanding empathy reveals that despite their ability to display empathy, CAs do poorly when interpreting and exploring a user’s experience, contrasting with their human counterparts.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs), especially in high-stakes domains, raises many privacy concerns. Building ethical LLM-based CAs that respect user privacy requires an in-depth understanding of the privacy risks that concern users the most. However, existing research, primarily model-centered, does not provide insight into users’ perspectives. To bridge this gap, we analyzed sensitive disclosures in real-world ChatGPT conversations and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 LLM-based CA users. We found that users are constantly faced with trade-offs between privacy, utility, and convenience when using LLM-based CAs. However, users’ erroneous mental models and the dark patterns in system design limited their awareness and comprehension of the privacy risks. Additionally, the human-like interactions encouraged more sensitive disclosures, which complicated users’ ability to navigate the trade-offs. We discuss practical design guidelines and the needs for paradigm shifts to protect the privacy of LLM-based CA users.},

abstract = {Self-guided mental health interventions, such as “do-it-yourself” tools to learn and practice coping strategies, show great promise to improve access to mental health care. However, these interventions are often cognitively demanding and emotionally triggering, creating accessibility barriers that limit their wide-scale implementation and adoption. In this paper, we study how human-language model interaction can support self-guided mental health interventions. We take cognitive restructuring, an evidence-based therapeutic technique to overcome negative thinking, as a case study. In an IRB-approved randomized field study on a large mental health website with 15,531 participants, we design and evaluate a system that uses language models to support people through various steps of cognitive restructuring. Our findings reveal that our system positively impacts emotional intensity for 67\% of participants and helps 65\% overcome negative thoughts. Although adolescents report relatively worse outcomes, we find that tailored interventions that simplify language model generations improve overall effectiveness and equity.},

abstract = {Large language model (LLM) powered chatbots are primarily text-based today, and impose a large interactional cognitive load, especially for exploratory or sensemaking tasks such as planning a trip or learning about a new city. Because the interaction is textual, users have little scaffolding in the way of structure, informational “scent”, or ability to specify high-level preferences or goals. We introduce ExploreLLM that allows users to structure thoughts, help explore different options, navigate through the choices and recommendations, and to more easily steer models to generate more personalized responses. We conduct a user study and show that users find it helpful to use ExploreLLM for exploratory or planning tasks, because it provides a useful schema-like structure to the task, and guides users in planning. The study also suggests that users can more easily personalize responses with high-level preferences with ExploreLLM.},
