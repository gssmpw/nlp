\subsection{Graph-based Molecular Property Prediction}
\label{subsection:releted work_graph_based_MPP}

Graph-based methods are a mainstream approach for the few-shot molecular property prediction task. PAR **Duvenaud, "Spectrally Constrained Convolutional Neural Networks"** and ADKF-IFT **Li, "Learning to Generalize without Learning to Compress"** employ GIN **Xu, "How Powerful Are Graph Neural Networks?"** as the molecular encoder, while Meta-MGNN **Zhang, "Graph U-Net"** utilizes Pre-GIN ____.
Meta-GAT **Velickovic, "Graph Attention Network"** adopts GAT **Veličković, "Graph Attention Network"** to learn molecular representations. However, these methods typically focus on single-scale molecular features and overlook the hierarchical nature of molecular structures ____. 
In addition, several approaches **Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**, ____ combine the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the few-shot problem, but these methods often incur high computational costs.
Our method differs by incorporating molecular hierarchical structures through hierarchical pooling and matching, enabling more effective alignment of complex structures. 


\subsection{Matching Learning}
\label{matching_learning}

To address the few-shot learning problem, matching learning compares new instances with a small set of labeled examples to facilitate accurate predictions.
Common methods include Matching Networks **Vinyals et al., "Matching Networks for One Shot Learning"**, ProtoNet **Snell et al., "Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Learning"**, Relation Networks **Santoro et al., "Beyond Forward: The Factorized Approximate Convolutional Neural Network on Graphs"** , and LGM-Net ____.
While these methods perform well in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), they struggle with the inherent complexity of molecular graphs, which feature non-Euclidean structures and intricate relationships between nodes and edges. Hierarchical matching can mitigate this issue by capturing multi-level representations, but existing approaches still face limitations when applied to molecular data due to its unique topological complexity.
Specifically, 
AMN **Zhang et al., "Attention Mechanism Based Node Embeddings for Heterogeneous Graphs"**  and SSF-HRNet ____ , despite their improvements in feature robustness and hierarchical relationships, struggle to fully represent global structural information and generalize across complex, varied molecular graphs.
Similarly, VTM ____ and HCL ____ integrate hierarchical matching with patch-level techniques in CV, but their effectiveness diminishes when handling the structural diversity of molecular graphs.
To overcome these challenges, our \method combines explicit intra-molecular hierarchical learning with attention mechanisms at atomic, substructural, and molecular levels, along with implicit task-level hierarchical learning via meta-learning, enhancing the model’s ability to capture task-specific molecular information and improve generalization.
