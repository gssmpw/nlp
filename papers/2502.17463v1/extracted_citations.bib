abstract = {To diagnose Parkinson’s disease (PD) in a clinical setting, generally clinicians utilize several clinical manifestations such as motor impairments and non-motor symptoms and predict the severity level based on unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS). Such a clinical evaluation highly depends on the expertise and experience of the clinicians and results in variation in assessment among clinicians. Hence, to assist the clinicians to diagnose the PD and rate the severity level, we present a gait classification based decision support system using multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM). As the gait alterations are the initial manifestations of PD, we utilize the publicly available vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) dataset and perform the kinematic analysis to extract the spatiotemporal features. To identify the prominent gait biomarkers, this work utilizes a correlation based feature selection approach and employs multi-regression approach to normalize the gait time series data. Moreover, transforming the multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problem using one-versus-one (OVO) strategy, the proposed PD severity rating framework tests the performance of four SVM kernel functions for three different walking tests. Experimental results highlight that the quadratic SVM classifier offers an average accuracy of 98.65% and outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods that utilized gait dataset for PD diagnosis.}

abstract = {While diagnosing Parkinson’s disease (PD), neurologists often use several clinical manifestations of the subject and rate the severity level based on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). This kind of rating largely depends on the expertise of the doctors, which is not only subjective but also inefficient. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning based gait classification system which can assist the clinician to diagnose the stages of PD is presented. Gait pattern, which plays a significant role in assessing the human mobility, is a significant biomarker to classify whether the subject is healthy or affected with PD. Hence, we utilize the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) gait dataset and extract the minimal feature vector using the statistical analysis. Subsequently, the normal distribution of the data is validated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and from the spatial and temporal features of gait pattern, the salient biomarkers are identified using the correlation based feature selection technique. Four supervised machine learning algorithms namely decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble classifier (EC) and Bayes classifier (BC) are used for statistical and kinematic analyses which predict the severity of PD. The classifier efficacy quantified using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity highlights that the proposed framework can effectively rate the severity of PD based on Hohen and Yahr (H&Y) scale. Moreover, comparing the accuracy of the proposed PD classification approach with those of the other state-of-the-art approaches, which utilized the same gait dataset, reveal that the proposed method outperforms several other PD classification methods.}

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis is a complex and challenging task which needs the assessment of various motor and non-motor symptoms. As gait impairment is one of the early and important symptoms of PD, in a clinical setting, physicians generally evaluate the gait abnormality based on visual observations along with other numerous manifestations to assess the severity of PD. As such kind of assessment majorly depends on the experience and expertise of the physicians, there is scope for bias in assessment, leading to misdiagnosis. In this context, to assist the physicians to diagnose PD effectively, this study aims to design and investigate a gait analysis based classifier model using a hybrid convolutional neural network-long short term memory (CNN–LSTM) network to predict the severity rating of PD. For evaluation, we utilize the openly available gait dataset from Physionet that consists of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) signals from three different walking tests. Firstly, the prominent VGRF signals obtained using the variability analysis are decomposed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique to extract the significant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that contain the vital gait features. Secondly, through the power spectral analysis the dominant IMFs of the selected VGRF signals are extracted to train the CNN–LSTM classifier model. To address the data overfitting problem in the classifier model, the proposed approach employs L2 regularization along with dropout techniques. Moreover, to solve the stochastic cost function, CNN–LSTM network utilizes the Adam optimizer for its minimal memory requirement and tuning. Finally, the experiments conducted using the gait patterns from 93 PD subjects and 73 healthy controls substantiate that the proposed CNN–LSTM​ classifier model can achieve a maximum multi-class classification accuracy of 98.32% and offer superior performance compared to several other similar methods which have used gait pattern to diagnose PD.}

abstract = {Deep learning has a huge potential in healthcare for uncovering the hidden patterns from large volume of clinical data to diagnose different diseases. This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture based long short term memory (LSTM) network for severity rating of Parkinson’s disease (PD) using gait pattern. Unlike machine learning (ML) algorithms, the LSTM network avoids the need for hand crafted features and learns the long-term temporal dependencies in the gait cycle for robust diagnosis of PD. The primary advantage of the LSTM network is that it solves the vanishing gradient problem by introducing the memory blocks in place of self-connected hidden units, thereby deciding when to learn new information. Three distinct gait datasets containing vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) recordings for different walking scenarios are used for training the LSTM network. To avoid data overfitting, the proposed approach utilizes dropout and L2 regularization techniques. For solving the cost function, Adam, a stochastic gradient-based optimizer, is employed and the severity of PD is categorized based on unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The experimental results reveal that Adam optimized LSTM network can effectively learn the gait kinematic features and offer an average accuracy of 98.6% for binary classification and 96.6% for multi-class classification, with an accuracy improvement of 3.4% in comparison with the related techniques.}

A dual-branch model is proposed in this paper as an objective diagnostic tool to diagnose PD automatically. In this research, the joint features and independent features of left and right gait are fused innovatively. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) are used to extract the spatial and temporal characteristics of sensors respectively. After the independent features extracted from the branches are collapsed, LSTM is used to incorporate the joint features between the left and right gait. Compared with other methods, the proposed model can learn the correlation between the two feet and extract higher discriminative features to effectively improve the accuracy of Parkinson detection. The model shows the state-of-the-art performance for the public dataset, with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity being 99.22{\%}, 100{\%}, and 98.04{\%}, respectively. A simple, fast, and objective method proposed in this paper was believed to improve diagnostic performance.},

Objective
To compare gait parameters in Parkinson’s disease (PD) during the on-phase of medication cycle with those of healthy elderly control subjects.
Design
A group-comparison study.
Setting
Gait analysis laboratory of a university hospital.
Participants
Fifteen patients with PD and 9 healthy elderly controls.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main outcome measures
Spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters.
Results
The PD spatiotemporal results showed a significant reduction in step length and walking velocity compared with controls. In the kinematics, the major feature of the PD group was a markedly reduced ankle plantarflexion excursion (at 50%–60% of the gait cycle). Most important, the kinetics showed reduced ankle push-off power and hip pull-off power. Unlike the control subjects, the patients with PD did not show any correlation between ankle generation (push-off) power and stride length (r=.19) or with gait speed (r=.29). Correction for walking velocity did not result in significant changes in the kinetics between the groups.
Conclusions
Reduced ankle (push-off) power generation and reduced hip flexion (pull-off) power persisted in PD gait despite being tested in the on-phase of the medication cycle. Lack of a correlation between ankle and hip power generation and walking velocity suggests that peripheral and central factors contribute to lack of forward progression. Patients with PD may benefit from intervention strategies that correct the kinematic and the kinetic gait components.}

Considering the movement disorders caused by PD, the proposed method investigates the gait cycle pattern of subjects based on vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) measured by 16 wearable sensors placed in subjects' shoes. In this study, it is shown that the temporal patterns of the gait cycle are different for healthy persons and patients. Therefore, by using a recurrent structure like LSTM, able to analyze the dynamic nature of the gait cycle, the proposed method extracts the temporal patterns to diagnose patients from healthy persons. To reduce the number of data dimensions, the sequences of corresponding sensors measuring vGRF in different feet are combined by subtraction. This method analyzes the temporal pattern of time series collected from different sensors, without extracting special features representing statistics of different parts of the gait cycle. Indeed, the method can extract temporal features based on learning, without using expert knowledge. Finally, the Accuracy and F1 Score of the model trained with all data is 99.87\%, and 96.66\% respectively.},

In the diagnosis, doctors can judge disease state by observing patients’ gait features without quantification, such a subjective diagnosis has been seen as a problem because diagnostic results may differ among doctors. Moreover, there are some irresistible factors such as fatigue may effects diagnostic procedure. To make use of these observations, we build an automatic deep model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for the gait recognition problem. In our model, a dual channel LSTM model is designed to combine time series and force series recorded from NDs patients for whole gait understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model improves gait recognition performance compared to baseline methods.

  abstract  = {In this paper, an interpretable classifier for Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis based on analyzing the gait cycle is presented. The proposed method utilizes clinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) measured by wearable sensors. Therefore, experts can verify the decision made by the proposed method. Type-2 fuzzy logic is applied to increase the robustness against noisy sensor data. First, the initial fuzzy rules are extracted using a K-Nearest-Neighbor-based clustering approach. Next, a novel quasi-Levenberg-Marquardt (qLM) learning approach is proposed and applied to fine-tune the initial rules based on minimizing the cross-entropy loss function using a trust-region optimization method. Finally, complementary online learning is proposed to improve rules by encountering new labeled samples. The performance of the method is evaluated to classify patients and healthy subjects in different conditions, including the presence of noise or observing new samples. Moreover, the performance of the model is compared to some previous supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. The final Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score of the proposed method are 97.61{\%}, 97.58{\%}, 99.02{\%}, and 98.30{\%}.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder that affects the patient’s nervous system and health-care applications mostly uses wearable sensors to collect these data. Since these sensors generate time stamped data, analyzing gait disturbances in PD becomes challenging task. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective clinical decision-making system (CDMS) that aids the physician in diagnosing the severity of gait disturbances in PD affected patients. This paper presents a Q-backpropagated time delay neural network (Q-BTDNN) classifier that builds a temporal classification model, which performs the task of classification and prediction in CDMS. The proposed Q-learning induced backpropagation (Q-BP) training algorithm trains the Q-BTDNN by generating a reinforced error signal. The network’s weights are adjusted through backpropagating the generated error signal. For experimentation, the proposed work uses a PD gait database, which contains gait measures collected through wearable sensors from three different PD research studies. The experimental result proves the efficiency of Q-BP in terms of its improved classification accuracy of 91.49%, 92.19% and 90.91% with three datasets accordingly compared to other neural network training algorithms.}
