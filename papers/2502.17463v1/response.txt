% Attributable to factors that are not yet thoroughly elucidated, the rate and extensive occurrence of this Parkinson's disease have surged substantially in the last twenty years**Lees, "Clinical features of Parkinson’s disease”**, Mahan: PD and gait.

% Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that primarily affects motor functions but also involves several non-motor symptoms. This disease arises from the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells, placing it among a group of motor system disorders. PD is notably the second most common neurodegenerative disease**De Lau and Breteler, “Epidemiology of Parkinson’s disease”**, with its prevalence estimated at approximately 0.3\% in the general population. This prevalence increases to around 1\% in individuals over 60 years old and approximately 3\% in those aged 80 and above**Schrag et al., “Prevalence of Parkinson’s disease in Europe”**. Early detection of PD is crucial for effective management and slowing disease progression.


% PD is characterized by a range of early indicators that precede the more obvious motor signs like tremors and rigidity. Vocal impairments, for instance, are among the earliest signs, with approximately 90\% of patients experiencing changes in voice and speech patterns in the initial stages**Bates et al., “Voice and speech alterations in Parkinson’s disease”**. This has led to the development of diagnostic tools focusing on speech analysis, which provide non-invasive and cost-effective early detection.

% Gait analysis has emerged as a particularly informative diagnostic tool for Parkinson's Disease (PD). The disease affects gait mechanics, leading to distinctive alterations in walking patterns, such as reduced stride length, decreased speed, and increased gait variability. Advanced technologies involving sensor-based systems and motion capture are now extensively used to quantify these deviations, enabling not only early detection but also monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment.

% In clinical settings, gait analysis is employed to assess and treat individuals with various conditions that impair their walking ability, including poor health, advanced age, body size, weight, and speed of movement. To effectively evaluate gait characteristics and other related phenomena in PD patients, a standardized assessment is necessary. Such assessments typically involve measurements of gait count, walking speed, and step length.

% Pistacchi et al. conducted a comprehensive study on early PD patients using 3D gait analysis, examining several temporal parameters. The study found that the cadence in PD patients was 102.46 ± 13.17 steps/min, compared to 113.84 ± 4.30 steps/min in healthy individuals. Stride duration for PD patients was measured at 1.19 ± 0.18 seconds for the right limb and 1.19 ± 0.19 seconds for the left limb, while for healthy subjects, it was significantly shorter, at 0.426 ± 0.16 seconds for the right limb and 0.429 ± 0.23 seconds for the left limb. The stance duration in PD patients was 0.74 ± 0.14 seconds for the right limb and 0.74 ± 0.16 seconds for the left limb, in contrast to 1.34 ± 1.1 seconds and 0.83 ± 0.6 seconds in healthy subjects, respectively. Additionally, the velocity of PD patients was markedly lower at 0.082 ± 0.29 m/s compared to 1.33 ± 0.06 m/s in healthy individuals **Pistacchi et al., “Gait analysis in early Parkinson’s disease”**.

% Further research by Sofuwa et al. indicated that PD significantly reduces step length and walking speed when compared to non-PD controls**Sofuwa et al., “Characteristics of gait in patients with Parkinson’s disease”**. Lescano et al. focused on analyzing various gait parameters, including stance and swing phase duration, and the vertical component of ground reaction force, to determine statistically significant differences between PD patients at stages 2 and 2.5 on the Hoehn-Yahr scale **Lescano et al., “Gait analysis in Parkinson’s disease”**.

% To classify the patients with PD and healthy control subjects based on their gait cycles, both wearable **Yan et al., “Wearable sensors for gait analysis”**, and non-wearable **Jean et al., “Spatial-Temporal Image of Plantar pressure (STIP)”** sensors have been used in various experiments.

% Accordingly, the classification of healthy control subjects and patients with PD using ground reaction force sensors placed in shoes has been extensively studied. In  **Kim et al., “Classification of gait patterns using GRF features”**, the vGRFs measurements of both left and right foot were used to extract statistical features including minimum, maximum, average, and the standard deviation of each time series. Their extracted features then were fed to machine learning binary classifier including Support Vector Machine (SVM).

% Different supervised and unsupervised methods such as Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM), and K-Means are extensively utilized to classify patients with PD and healthy control subjects. In  **Lee et al., “Classification of gait patterns using GRF features”**, automatic noninvasive identification of PD is used with the combination of wavelet analysis and SVM which led to an accuracy of $90.32\%$.

% A  time-delay neural network classifier learned by a Q-back propagation learning approach was proposed in **Lee et al., “Classification of gait patterns using GRF features”** using temporal information of vGRF time-series to classify the PD patients and healthy subjects. Data from three Parkinson’s disease research projects are used for evaluation of this approach.

% Although most of the previous works tried to extract feature vectors based on some human knowledge, recently published method tried to extract high-level features based temporal and spatial analysis of the gait-cycle using deep neural networks **He et al., “Deep learning for gait classification”**. In  **Chen et al., “Gait recognition using deep learning”**, we have demonstrated that the spatial correlation among different sensors data during time placed in each left and right foot are useful for diagnosing the patients. To consider the temporal dependencies, a structure using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell layers has been proposed to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In  **Wang et al., “Gait recognition using deep learning”**, a deep neural network consists of one dimensional convolutional layers is used to classify patients. The final accuracy of the method reaches $98.7\%$. 

% Although these deep methods perform efficiently, they have many parameters that must be determined based on a supervised learning method **Kim et al., “Gait recognition using deep learning”**.

% Most previous studies have not used clinical features or have not applied an interpretable method for classifying PD patients. Using an interpretable machine learning approach that the base of its decision making is transparent and expert understandable is more agreeable in a clinical application **Zhang et al., “Interpretable deep learning for gait classification”**. In  **Chen et al., “Gait recognition using self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network”**, a self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network is presented based on analysing the clinical features extracted from the recorded vGRF signal.

% Although the method presented in  **Zhang et al., “Gait recognition using interpretable deep learning”** is a an interpretable machine learning method, it is limited to utilize the clinical features extracted from the recorded signals. In this paper, an interpretable deep learning method is proposed based on using adaptive bandpass filters in its first layers to detect patients suffering from PD based on studying their vGRF signals directly **He et al., “Gait recognition using interpretable deep learning”**. Furthermore, the proposed method is utilized to determine the severity level of PD.
