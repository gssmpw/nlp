abstract = {The huge complexity and uncertainty in real life requires the use of advanced automatic learning methods to find out better approximators and suitable relationship in real data behavior. Neuro fuzzy systems have been proved to be excellent universal approximators. In this paper we propose a new based function Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network denoted ”Beta basis function Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network”, the BIT2FNN. The main idea is to involve type-2 beta fuzzy sets in the design process of fuzzy networks. The proposed architecture is based on beta type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedent part, while the consequent part achieves the TSK (Takagi–Sugeno–Kang) fuzzy output strategy. Thanks to the beta function flexibility, the network achieve a good performance and shows a good resistance to noisy data. First order derivatives of type-1 and type-2 Beta functions were developed for the first time for designing fuzzy logic systems based on given input–output pairs. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the learning process of antecedent fuzzy beta parameters and the consequent part. The performance of the proposed model of Beta fuzzy logic system is evaluated with mainly two problems of time series applications : the Mackey Glass Chaotic Time-Series prediction problem with different setting of parameters and levels of noise and the ECG heart-rate Time Series monitoring problem.}

abstract = {The authors have developed and tested a wearable inertial sensor system for the acquisition of gait features. The sensors were placed on anatomical segments of the lower limb: foot, shank, thigh, and hip, and the motion data were then captured in conjunction with 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The method of relational matrix was applied to develop a rule-based system, an intelligent fuzzy computational algorithm. The rule-based system provides a feature matrix model representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of the gait functions (limb-segments accelerations and GRFs) throughout the gait cycle. A comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data was evaluated using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This system was tested and evaluated using two subject groups: 10 healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference fuzzy rule-base, and 4 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects were used as an input test data; and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated. This similarity provides a quantitative assessment of mobility state of the impaired subject. This algorithmic tool may be helpful to the clinician in the identification of pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.}

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder that affects the patient’s nervous system and health-care applications mostly uses wearable sensors to collect these data. Since these sensors generate time stamped data, analyzing gait disturbances in PD becomes challenging task. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective clinical decision-making system (CDMS) that aids the physician in diagnosing the severity of gait disturbances in PD affected patients. This paper presents a Q-backpropagated time delay neural network (Q-BTDNN) classifier that builds a temporal classification model, which performs the task of classification and prediction in CDMS. The proposed Q-learning induced backpropagation (Q-BP) training algorithm trains the Q-BTDNN by generating a reinforced error signal. The network’s weights are adjusted through backpropagating the generated error signal. For experimentation, the proposed work uses a PD gait database, which contains gait measures collected through wearable sensors from three different PD research studies. The experimental result proves the efficiency of Q-BP in terms of its improved classification accuracy of 91.49%, 92.19% and 90.91% with three datasets accordingly compared to other neural network training algorithms.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new interval type-2 fuzzy neural network able to construct non-separable fuzzy rules with various shapes is introduced for function approximation problems. To reflect the uncertainty, the shape of fuzzy sets is considered to be uncertain. Therefore, a new form of shapeable interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on a general Gaussian model able to construct different shapes (including triangular, bell-shaped, trapezoidal) is proposed. To consider the interactions among input variables, input vectors are transformed to new feature spaces with uncorrelated variables proper for defining each fuzzy rule. Next, the new features are fed to a fuzzification layer using proposed interval type-2 fuzzy sets with adaptive shapes. Consequently, interval type-2 non-separable fuzzy rules with proper shapes, considering the local interactions of variables and the uncertainty are formed. For type reduction, the contribution of the upper and lower firing strengths of each fuzzy rule is adaptively selected separately. To train different parameters of the network, the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization method is utilized. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on clean and noisy datasets to show the ability to consider the uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed paradigm is successfully applied to real-world time-series predictions, regression problems, and nonlinear system identification. According to the experimental results, the performance of our proposed model outperforms other methods with a more parsimonious structure. Based on several experiments, the test RMSE of the proposed method is equal to 0.0243 for noisy McGlass time series prediction, 1.92 for Santa-Fe Laser prediction, 0.0301 for Box–Jenkins system identification, 0.0569 for Poland electricity load forecasting, 4.22 for Google stock price tracking, and 13.22 for Sydney stock price tracking.}

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the centroid and generalized centroid of a type-2 fuzzy set (both of which are essential for implementing a type-2 fuzzy logic system), and explain how to compute them. For practical use, we show how to compute the centroid of interval and Gaussian type-2 fuzzy sets. An exact computation procedure is provided for an interval type-2 set, whereas an approximation is provided for both interval and Gaussian type-2 sets. Examples are given that compare the exact computational results with the approximate results.}

abstract = {This paper provides an in-depth review of the optimal design of type-1 and type-2 fuzzy inference systems (FIS) using five well known computational frameworks: genetic-fuzzy systems (GFS), neuro-fuzzy systems (NFS), hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFS), evolving fuzzy systems (EFS), and multi-objective fuzzy systems (MFS), which is in view that some of them are linked to each other. The heuristic design of GFS uses evolutionary algorithms for optimizing both Mamdani-type and Takagi–Sugeno–Kang-type fuzzy systems. Whereas, the NFS combines the FIS with neural network learning systems to improve the approximation ability. An HFS combines two or more low-dimensional fuzzy logic units in a hierarchical design to overcome the curse of dimensionality. An EFS solves the data streaming issues by evolving the system incrementally, and an MFS solves the multi-objective trade-offs like the simultaneous maximization of both interpretability and accuracy. This paper ofers a synthesis of these dimensions and explores their potentials, challenges, and opportunities in FIS research. This review also examines the complex relations among these dimensions and the possibilities of combining one or more computational frameworks adding another dimension: deep fuzzy systems.}

In this study, it is shown that the temporal patterns of the gait cycle are different for healthy persons and patients. Therefore, by using a recurrent structure like LSTM, able to analyze the dynamic nature of the gait cycle, the proposed method extracts the temporal patterns to diagnose patients from healthy persons. To reduce the number of data dimensions, the sequences of corresponding sensors measuring vGRF in different feet are combined by subtraction. This method analyzes the temporal pattern of time series collected from different sensors, without extracting special features representing statistics of different parts of the gait cycle. Indeed, the method can extract temporal features based on learning, without using expert knowledge. Finally, the Accuracy and F1 Score of the model trained with all data is 99.87\%, and 96.66\% respectively.},

abstract = {Background and objectives
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a devastating chronic neurological condition. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been used in the early prediction of PD progression. Fusion of heterogeneous data modalities proved its capability to improve the performance of ML models. Time series data fusion supports the tracking of the disease over time. In addition, the trustworthiness of the resulting models is improved by adding model explainability features. The literature on PD has not sufficiently explored these three points.
Methods
In this work, we proposed an ML pipeline for predicting the progression of PD that is both accurate and explainable. We explore the fusion of different combinations of five time series modalities from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) real-world dataset, including patient characteristics, biosamples, medication history, motor, and non-motor function data. Each patient has six visits. The problem has been formulated in two ways: ❶ a three-class based progression prediction with 953 patients in each time series modality, and ❷ a four-class based progression prediction with 1,060 patients in each time series modality. The statistical features of these six visits were calculated from each modality and diverse feature selection methods were applied to select the most informative feature sets. The extracted features were used to train a set of well-known ML models including Support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extra tree classifier (ETC), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We examined a number of data-balancing strategies in the pipeline with different combinations of modalities. ML models have been optimized using the Bayesian optimizer. A comprehensive evaluation of various ML methods has been conducted, and the best models have been extended to provide different explainability features.
Results
We compare the performance of ML models before and after optimization and using and without using feature selection. In the three-class experiment and with various modality fusions, the LGBM model produced the most accurate results with a 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) accuracy of 90.73% using non-motor function modality. RF produced the best results in the four-class experiment with various modality fusions with a 10-CV accuracy of 94.57% using non-motor modality. With the fused dataset of non-motor and motor function modalities, the LGBM model outperformed the other ML models in both the 3-class and 4-class experiments (i.e., 10-CV accuracy of 94.89% and 93.73%, respectively). Using the Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework, we employed global and instance-based explanations to explain the behavior of each ML classifier. Moreover, we extended the explainability by implementing the LIME and SHAPASH local explainers. The consistency of these explainers has been explored. The resultant classifiers were accurate, explainable, and thus medically more relevant and applicable.
Conclusions
The select modalities and feature sets were confirmed by the literature and medical experts. The various explainers suggest that the bradykinesia (NP3BRADY) feature was the most dominant and consistent. By providing thorough insights into the influence of multiple modalities on the disease risk, the suggested approach is expected to help improve the clinical knowledge of PD progression processes.}

The proposed method utilizes clinical features extracted from the vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) measured by wearable sensors.

First, the initial fuzzy rules are extracted using a K-Nearest-Neighbor-based clustering approach.

ABSTRACT = {Conventional approaches to diagnosing Parkinson’s disease (PD) and rating its severity level are based on medical specialists’ clinical assessment of symptoms, which are subjective and can be inaccurate. These techniques are not very reliable, particularly in the early stages of the disease. A novel detection and severity classification algorithm using deep learning approaches was developed in this research to classify the PD severity level based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) signals. Different variations in force patterns generated by the irregularity in vGRF signals due to the gait abnormalities of PD patients can indicate their severity. The main purpose of this research is to aid physicians in detecting early stages of PD, planning efficient treatment, and monitoring disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises preprocessing, feature transformation, and classification processes. In preprocessing, the vGRF signal is divided into 10, 15, and 30 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time domain vGRF signal in windows with varying time lengths is modified into a time–frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature enhancement. Finally, different types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed as deep learning classifiers for classification. The algorithm performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation (kfoldCV). The best average accuracy of the proposed detection algorithm in classifying the PD severity stage classification was 96.52% using ResNet-50 with vGRF data from the PhysioNet database. The proposed detection algorithm can effectively differentiate gait patterns based on time–frequency spectrograms of vGRF signals associated with different PD severity levels.},

abstract = {Deep learning has a huge potential in healthcare for uncovering the hidden patterns from large volume of clinical data to diagnose different diseases. This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture based long short term memory (LSTM) network for severity rating of Parkinson’s disease (PD) using gait pattern. Unlike machine learning (ML) algorithms, the LSTM network avoids the need for hand crafted features and learns the long-term temporal dependencies in the gait cycle for robust diagnosis of PD. The primary advantage of the LSTM network is that it solves the vanishing gradient problem by introducing the memory blocks in place of self-connected hidden units, thereby deciding when to learn new information. Three distinct gait datasets containing vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) recordings for different walking scenarios are used for training the LSTM network. To avoid data overfitting, the proposed approach utilizes dropout and L2 regularization techniques. For solving the cost function, Adam, a stochastic gradient-based optimizer, is employed and the severity of PD is categorized based on unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The experimental results reveal that Adam optimized LSTM network can effectively learn the gait kinematic features and offer an average accuracy of 98.6% for binary classification and 96.6% for multi-class classification, with an accuracy improvement of 3.4% in comparison with the related techniques.}

Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) are used to extract the spatial and temporal characteristics of sensors respectively. After the independent features extracted from the branches are collapsed, LSTM is used to incorporate the joint features between the left and right gait.

abstract="Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder affecting the nervous system of patients. PD alters the capacity to sustain a steady rhythm in the gait leading to impaired motor skills. The diagnosis of PD is a complex task that encompasses motor and non-motor symptoms. More than 50{\%} of patients suffer from freezing in their legs during walking, generally defined as Freezing of Gait (FOG). Hence, gait evaluation is essential for physicians to detect the disease and track its severity. In this context, intelligent learning algorithms have been recently used to facilitate the diagnostic process. However, an accurate diagnosis is still required. This paper presents an effective and novel approach to diagnose PD using gait analysis, wearable sensors, and deep learning techniques. To achieve this goal, an Artificial Neural Network multiclassifier system (ANN) has been developed. The proposed model predicts the severity of PD by detecting the stage of the disease. It uses a further analysis of movement alteration, supervised learning, and clinical assessment based on Hoehn {\&} Yahr (H{\&}Y) scores. The experimental results indicate a high efficiency of the proposed method in tracking PD severity. The method can make a distinction between idiopathic PD patients and healthy individuals, and classify them in the levels 0, 2, 2.5 and 3 according to the symptoms progress and level of disability. The model achieves an outstanding performance with an accuracy of 97{\%}. Thus, this study emphasizes the use of a prediction learning algorithm that can be helpful and valuable for clinical examinations.",

Such a clinical evaluation highly depends on the expertise and experience of the clinicians and results in variation in assessment among clinicians. Hence, to assist the clinicians to diagnose the PD and rate the severity level, we present a gait classification based decision support system using multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM). As the gait alterations are the initial manifestations of PD, we utilize the publicly available vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) dataset and perform the kinematic analysis to extract the spatiotemporal features. To identify the prominent gait biomarkers, this work utilizes a correlation based feature selection approach and employs multi-regression approach to normalize the gait time series data. Moreover, transforming the multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problem using one-versus-one (OVO) strategy, the proposed PD severity rating framework tests the performance of four SVM kernel functions for three different walking tests. Experimental results highlight that the quadratic SVM classifier offers an average accuracy of 98.65% and outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods that utilized gait dataset for PD diagnosis.}

As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification. We also find that Mel-frequency cepstral and the tunable-Q wavelet coefficients, which give the highest accuracies, contain complementary information in PD classification problem resulting in an improved system when combined using a filter feature selection technique.}

This kind of rating largely depends on the expertise of the doctors, which is not only subjective but also inefficient. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning based gait classification system which can assist the clinician to diagnose the stages of PD is presented. Gait pattern, which plays a significant role in assessing the human mobility, is a significant biomarker to classify whether the subject is healthy or affected with PD. Hence, we utilize the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) gait dataset and extract the minimal feature vector using the statistical analysis. Subsequently, the normal distribution of the data is validated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and from the spatial and temporal features of gait pattern, the salient biomarkers are identified using the correlation based feature selection technique. Four supervised machine learning algorithms namely decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble classifier (EC) and Bayes classifier (BC) are used for statistical and kinematic analyses which predict the severity of PD. The classifier efficacy quantified using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity highlights that the proposed framework can effectively rate the severity of PD based on Hohen and Yahr (H&Y) scale. Moreover, comparing the accuracy of the proposed PD classification approach with those of the other state-of-the-art approaches, which utilized the same gait dataset, reveal that the proposed method outperforms several other PD classification methods.}

abstract = {Here an approach for the diagnosis of neuro-degenerative diseases based on gait dynamics is proposed. The proposed method uses information from a time series of stride intervals, swing intervals, stance intervals and double support intervals of stride-to-stride measures of footfall contact times using force-sensitive resistors. Different features were extracted from these time series and the best of them were selected for the diagnosis. The support vector machines using different kernels were examined for the diagnosis. The radial basis function kernel obtained the best performance for this aim. The results show that features derived from double support intervals are common effective features for the diagnosis of neuro-degenerative diseases using the gait dynamics.}

abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis is a complex and challenging task which needs the assessment of various motor and non-motor symptoms. As gait impairment is one of the early and important symptoms of PD, in a clinical setting, physicians generally evaluate the gait abnormality based on visual observations along with other numerous manifestations to assess the severity of PD. As such kind of assessment majorly depends on the experience and expertise of the physicians, there is scope for bias in assessment, leading to misdiagnosis. In this context, to assist the physicians to diagnose PD effectively, this study aims to design and investigate a gait analysis based classifier model using a hybrid convolutional neural network-long short term memory (CNN–LSTM) network to predict the severity rating of PD. For evaluation, we utilize the openly available gait dataset from Physionet that consists of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) signals from three different walking tests. Firstly, the prominent VGRF signals obtained using the variability analysis are decomposed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique to extract the significant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that contain the vital gait features. Secondly, through the power spectral analysis the dominant IMFs of the selected VGRF signals are extracted to train the CNN–LSTM classifier model. To address the data overfitting problem in the classifier model, the proposed approach employs L2 regularization along with dropout techniques. Moreover, to solve the stochastic cost function, CNN–LSTM network utilizes the Adam optimizer for its minimal memory requirement and tuning. Finally, the experiments conducted using the gait patterns from 93 PD subjects and 73 healthy controls substantiate that the proposed CNN–LSTM​ classifier model can achieve a maximum multi-class classification accuracy of 98.32% and offer superior performance compared to several other similar methods which have used gait pattern to diagnose PD.}

In the diagnosis, doctors can judge disease state by observing patients’ gait features without quantification, such a subjective diagnosis has been seen as a problem because diagnostic results may differ among doctors. Moreover, there are some irresistible factors such as fatigue may effects diagnostic procedure. To make use of these observations, we build an automatic deep model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for the gait recognition problem. In our model, a dual channel LSTM model is designed to combine time series and force series recorded from NDs patients for whole gait understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model improves gait recognition performance compared to baseline methods. We believe the quantitative evaluation provided by our method will assist clinical diagnosis of Neurodegenerative diseases.}

Objective
To compare gait parameters in Parkinson’s disease (PD) during the on-phase of medication cycle with those of healthy elderly control subjects.
Design
A group-comparison study.
Setting
Gait analysis laboratory of a university hospital.
Participants
Fifteen patients with PD and 9 healthy elderly controls.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main outcome measures
Spatiotemporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters.
Results
The PD spatiotemporal results showed a significant reduction in step length and walking velocity compared with controls. In the kinematics, the major feature of the PD group was a markedly reduced ankle plantarflexion excursion (at 50%–60% of the gait cycle). Most important, the kinetics showed reduced ankle push-off power and hip pull-off power. Unlike the control subjects, the patients with PD did not show any correlation between ankle generation (push-off) power and stride length (r=.19) or with gait speed (r=.29). Correction for walking velocity did not result in significant changes in the kinetics between the groups.
Conclusions
Reduced ankle (push-off) power generation and reduced hip flexion (pull-off) power persisted in PD gait despite being tested in the on-phase of the medication cycle. Lack of a correlation between ankle and hip power generation and walking velocity suggests that peripheral and central factors contribute to lack of forward progression. Patients with PD may benefit from intervention strategies that correct the kinematic and the kinetic gait components.}

  abstract = "Postural instability is one of the most disabling symptoms of
              Parkinson's Disease, with important impacts on people safety and
              quality of life since it increases the risk of falls and
              injuries. Home monitoring of changes in postural stability, as a
              consequence of therapies and disease progression, is highly
              desirable for the safety of the patient and better disease
              management. In this context, we present a system for the
              automatic evaluation of postural stability that is suitable for
              self-managing by people with motor impairment directly at home.
              The system is based on an optical RGB-Depth device, which tracks
              the body movements both for system's interaction, thanks to a
              gesture-based human-machine interface, and the automated
              assessment of postural stability. A set of tasks, based on
              standard clinical scales, has been designed for the assessment.
              The user controls the delivery of the tasks through the system
              interface. A machine learning approach is adopted, and some
              kinematic parameters that characterize the user's performance
              during each task execution are estimated and used by supervised
              classifiers for the automatic assessment. Data collected during
              experimental clinical trials were used to train the classifiers.
              This approach supports the compliance of the classifier
              assessments with respect to the clinical ones. The system
              prototype and the preliminary results on its accuracy in the
              assessment of postural stability are presented and discussed.",

  abstract = "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with
              slow progression whose symptoms can be identified at late stages.
              Early diagnosis and treatment of PD can help to relieve the
              symptoms and delay progression. However, this is very challenging
              due to the similarities between the symptoms of PD and other
              diseases. The current study proposes a generic framework for the
              diagnosis of PD using handwritten images and (or) speech signals.
              For the handwriting images, 8 pre-trained convolutional neural
              networks (CNN) via transfer learning tuned by Aquila Optimizer
              were trained on the NewHandPD dataset to diagnose PD. For the
              speech signals, features from the MDVR-KCL dataset are extracted
              numerically using 16 feature extraction algorithms and fed to 4
              different machine learning algorithms tuned by Grid Search
              algorithm, and graphically using 5 different techniques and fed
              to the 8 pretrained CNN structures. The authors propose a new
              technique in extracting the features from the voice dataset based
              on the segmentation of variable speech-signal-segment-durations,
              i.e., the use of different durations in the segmentation phase.
              Using the proposed technique, 5 datasets with 281 numerical
              features are generated. Results from different experiments are
              collected and recorded. For the NewHandPD dataset, the
              best-reported metric is 99.75\% using the VGG19 structure. For
              the MDVR-KCL dataset, the best-reported metrics are 99.94\% using
              the KNN and SVM ML algorithms and the combined numerical
              features; and 100\% using the combined the mel-specgram graphical
              features and VGG19 structure. These results are better than other
