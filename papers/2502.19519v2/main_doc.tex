\begin{abstract}
%This paper presents a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to enhance interactive narrative experiences in single-player role-playing games, specifically addressing the limitations of solo engagement in tabletop games like Dungeons \& Dragons. Building upon the foundation laid by our previous work on ChatRPG, an AI-driven text-based role-playing game, we introduce a new version utilizing the ReAct framework. This enhanced system comprises two ReAct agents: the \textbf{Narrator}, responsible for generating immersive narratives, and the \textbf{Archivist}, which manages memory and context. Our approach significantly improves the systemâ€™s upgradability and extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of advanced features such as multimedia content and enhanced storytelling in future research. Comparative studies between the original and the upgraded systems demonstrate not only maintained performance but also superior user engagement with the latter. This research sets the stage for further exploration into how interactive fiction can be revolutionized through AI advancements, offering a richer and more immersive gaming experience for solo players. The paper details the design and evaluation process, providing insights for future enhancements in AI-driven role-playing games.

%This paper presents an advanced multi-agent system designed to enhance interactive narratives in single-player role-playing games, addressing the limitations of solo engagement in tabletop experiences like Dungeons \& Dragons. We introduce an AI-driven text-based role-playing system leveraging the ReAct framework to include reasoning and action, which builds on a previous system using simplified prompt engineering. Our system integrates two ReAct agents: the Narrator, which generates immersive narratives, and the Archivist, which manages memory and context. This architecture enhances modularity, facilitating future integration of multimedia content and advanced storytelling features. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the agentic system maintains performance while significantly improving user engagement. Our findings contribute to the evolution of AI-driven interactive fiction, highlighting new avenues for enhancing solo role-playing experiences.

This paper presents a game master AI for single-player role-playing games. The AI is designed to deliver interactive text-based narratives and experiences typically associated with multiplayer tabletop games like Dungeons \& Dragons. We report on the design process and the series of experiments to improve the functionality and experience design, resulting in two functional versions of the system.
While v1 of our system uses simplified prompt engineering, v2 leverages a multi-agent architecture and the ReAct framework to include reasoning and action. A comparative evaluation demonstrates that v2 as an agentic system maintains play while significantly improving modularity and game experience, including immersion and curiosity. Our findings contribute to the evolution of AI-driven interactive fiction, highlighting new avenues for enhancing solo role-playing experiences.
