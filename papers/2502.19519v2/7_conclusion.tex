\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we provided an overview of the design and evaluation of two versions of an LLM-enabled text-based role-playing game system for solo players. We began with a simple prompt engineering approach in v1 of ChatRPG and, through user evaluations, uncovered limitations to the approach, yet found that players found it supported enjoyable play. Building from this, we developed v2 of the system following a multi-agent system design to function as an AI game master, consisting of two ReAct agents: the \textbf{Narrator} and the \textbf{Archivist}. The Narrator operates as the system's storyteller, responsible for generating immersive and compelling narratives, while the Archivist functions as the memory core, systematically recording and retrieving essential information about the game environment and character interactions. Together, they aim to emulate the complex decision-making processes of a human game master. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that the redesigned system offers an enhanced user experience. We provided an analysis of the evaluations highlighting themes related to the player experience. We provide implications for the continued research in the area by discussing the ReAct pattern for conversational interactions, limitations of frontier model LLMs, and future directions to explore enhancing player experiences.
