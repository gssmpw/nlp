\section{Introduction}

The following sections provide the text used in the prompts for ChatRPG v1 and the narrator and archivist agents in the game master AI system v2. These files will be shared on the project's Github repository to enable others to reuse the system and adapt it to their needs. 

In addition, the questions used in the comparative evaluation are provided. These questions were used to measure the participant's experience with ChatRPG. The survey is based partly on the Player Experience Inventory (PXI) with additional questions focused on the RPG experience.

\textbf{FindCharacter Utility Tool Prompt}\\
You are an expert game master in a single-player RPG. You need to find a specific character in a list of characters from the game world based on the following instruction: \{instruction\} Once you have determined the correct character, you must return only its exact name, description, and type which you have found in the list, in valid JSON format. Format Instructions: Answer only in valid RAW JSON in the format \{ "name": "The character's name", "description": "The character's description", "type": "The character's type" \}. If the character does not match anyone in the list based on the instructions, return an empty JSON object as such "\{\}". The match must be between the characters that are present in the game and the given content. The match is still valid if a partial match in name or description is possible. Character names and descriptions given as context can be shortened, so partial matches must be made in such cases.\\

\textbf{WoundCharacterTool Instruction Prompt}\\
Find the character that will be hurt or wounded resulting from unnoticed attacks or performing dangerous activities that will lead to injury. Example: Find the character corresponding to the following content: "As Peter, I wield my powered-up energy sword causing the flesh from my fingers to splinter. I pass by Nyanko, the Swift, as I head forwards towards the Ancient Tower." Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Peter Strongbottom", "description": "A stalwart and bottom-heavy warrior."\}, \{"name": "Nyanko, the Swift", "description": "A nimble and agile rogue."\}]\}. The player character is Peter Strongbottom. First-person pronouns refer to them. Expected result: The character that is hurt is Peter Strongbottom. Another Example: Find the character corresponding to the following content: "I accidentally step on a bear trap." Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Tobias Baldin", "description": "A balding adventurer equipped with an axe and a gleaming shield."\}]\}. The player character is Tobias Baldin. First-person pronouns refer to them. Expected result: The character that is hurt is Tobias Baldin\\

\textbf{HealCharacterTool Instruction Prompt}\\
Find the character that will be healed by magical effects such as a healing spell, through consuming a potion, or by resting. Example: Find the character corresponding to the following content: I cast a healing spell on Martin in order to restore his wounds he received from fighting off Arch. Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Alpha Werewolf Martin", "description": "A ferocious and rabid werewolf."\}, \{"name": "Kristoffer, the Submissive", "description": "The most submissive healer in the kingdom"\},\{"name": "Arch", "description": "A powerful dragon roaming the world for worthy opponents."\}]\}. The player character is Kristoffer, the Submissive. First-person pronouns refer to them. Expected result: The character that is healed is Alpha Werewolf Martin. Another Example: Find the character corresponding to the following content: "I drink a healing potion." Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Tobias Baldin", "description": "A stalwart and balding warrior."\}]\}. The player character is Tobias Baldin. First-person pronouns refer to them. Expected result: The character that is healed is Tobias Baldin\\

\textbf{Battle Instruction Prompt}\\
Find the character that will be involved in a battle or combat. You will be provided a list of existing characters and a JSON object of a single character. You must match this single character to a character in the list. You must match the "name" and "description" properties. The most important attribute is the "name" attribute. Example: Find the character corresponding to the following JSON description: \{"name": "Ivan", "description": "The wielder of Earth, Wind, and Fire."\}. Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Ivan Quintessence, the Magician of Elements", "description": "A powerful magician that has mastered the elements of Earth, Wind, and Fire", "type": "Humanoid"\}]. In this case the input character Ivan partially matches the existing character Ivan Quintessence, the Magician of Elements and should therefore be selected. Another example: Find the character corresponding to the following JSON description: \{"name": "Davey the Vampire", "description": "An adventurer wielding a newly upgraded sword and shield."\}. Existing characters: \{"characters": [\{"name": "Davey the Vampire", "description": "A powerful vampire hailing from the Nether", "type": "Humanoid"\}]. In this case the input character Davey the Vampire matches the name of an existing character but their description do not match. Still, Davey the Vampire should be selected as the name property is the most important.



\section{Tool Descriptions}

\subsection{Narrator Tools:}

\textbf{WoundCharacterTool Description}\\
This tool must be used when a character will be hurt or wounded resulting from unnoticed attacks or performing dangerous activities that will lead to injury. The tool is only appropriate if the damage cannot be mitigated, dodged, or avoided. Example: A character performs a sneak attack without being spotted by the enemies they try to attack. A dangerous activity could be to threateningly approach a King, which may result in injury when his guards step forward to stop the character. Input to this tool must be in the following RAW JSON format: \{"input": "The player's input", "severity": "Describes how devastating the injury to the character will be based on the action. Can be one of the following values: \{low, medium, high, extraordinary\}\}". Do not use markdown, only raw JSON as input. Use this tool only once per character at most and only if they are not engaged in battle.\\

\textbf{HealCharacterTool Description}\\
This tool must be used when a character performs an action that could heal or restore them to health after being wounded. The tool is only appropriate if the healing can be done without any further actions. Example: A character is wounded by an enemy attack and the player decides to heal the character. Another example would be a scenario where a character consumes a beneficial item like a potion, a magical item, or spends time in an area that could provide healing benefits. Resting may provide modest healing effects depending on the duration of the rest. Input to this tool must be in the following RAW JSON format: \{"input": "The player's input", "magnitude": "Describes how much health the character will regain based on the action. Can be one of the following values: \{low, medium, high, extraordinary\}\}". Do not use markdown, only raw JSON as input. Use this tool only once per character at most.\\

\textbf{BattleTool Description}\\
Use the battle tool to resolve battle or combat between two participants. A participant is a single character and cannot be a combination of characters. If there are more than two participants, the tool must be used once per attacker to give everyone a chance at fighting. The battle tool will give each participant a chance to fight the other participant. The tool should also be used when an attack can be mitigated or dodged by the involved participants. It is also possible for either or both participants to miss. A hit chance specifier will help adjust the chance that a participant gets to retaliate. Example: There are only two combatants. Call the tool only ONCE since both characters get an attack. Another example: There are three combatants, the Player's character and two assassins. The battle tool is called first with the Player's character as participant one and one of the assassins as participant two. Chances are high that the player will hit the assassin but assassins must be precise, making it harder to hit, however, they deal high damage if they hit. We observe that the participant one hits participant two and participant two misses participant one. After this round of battle has been resolved, call the tool again with the Player's character as participant one and the other assassin as participant two. Since participant one in this case has already hit once during this narrative, we impose a penalty to their hit chance, which is accumulative for each time they hit an enemy during battle. The damage severity describes how powerful the attack is which is derived from the narrative description of the attacks. If the participants engage in a friendly sparring fight, does not intend to hurt, or does mock battle, the damage severity is <harmless>. If there are no direct description, estimate the impact of an attack based on the character type and their description. Input to this tool must be in the following RAW JSON format: \{"participant1": \{"name": "<name of participant one>", "description": "<description of participant one>"\}, "participant2": \{"name": "<name of participant two>", "description": "<description of participant two>"\}, "participant1HitChance": "<hit chance specifier for participant one>", "participant2HitChance": "<hit chance specifier for participant two>", "participant1DamageSeverity": "<damage severity for participant one>", "participant2DamageSeverity": "<damage severity for participant two>"\} where participant\#HitChance specifiers are one of the following \{high, medium, low, impossible\} and participant\#DamageSeverity is one of the following \{harmless, low, medium, high, extraordinary\}. Do not use markdown, only raw JSON as input. The narrative battle is over when each character has had the chance to attack another character at most once.\\


\subsection{Archivist Tools}

\textbf{UpdateCharacterTool Description}\\
This tool must be used to create a new character or update an existing character in the campaign. Example: The narrative text mentions a new character or contains changes to an existing character. Input to this tool must be in the following RAW JSON format: \{"name": "<character name>", "description": "<new or updated character description>", "type": "<character type>", "state": "<character health state>"\}, where type is one of the following: \{[Dynamically updated list of characters]\}, and state is one of the following: \{Dead, Unconscious, HeavilyWounded, LightlyWounded, Healthy\}. The description of a character could describe their physical characteristics, personality, what they are known for, or other cool descriptive features. The tool should only be used once per character.\\

\textit{The list of characters in the UpdateCharacterTool description is inserted dynamically when the tool is called to include all current characters in the campaign.}\\

\textbf{UpdateEnvironmentTool Description}\\
This tool must be used to create a new environment or update an existing environment in the campaign. Example: The narrative text mentions a new environment or contains changes to an existing environment. An environment refers to a place, location, or area that is well enough defined that it warrants its own description. Such a place could be a landmark with its own history, a building where story events take place, or a larger place like a magical forest. Input to this tool must be in the following RAW JSON format: \{"name": "<environment name>", "description": "<new or updated environment description>", "isPlayerHere": <true if the Player character is currently at this environment, false otherwise>\}, where the description of an environment could describe its physical characteristics, its significance, the creatures that inhabit it, the weather, or other cool descriptive features so that it gives the Player useful information about the places they travel to while keeping the locations' descriptions interesting, mysterious and engaging. The tool should only be used once per environment.

\section{User Survey and Interview Questions}
