\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:lim}
Although our framework has been extended to multiple scenarios, future research should further explore its application to multimodal tasks, such as GUI agents. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its generalizability, extending beyond the scope of our current investigation.

While our framework excels in maintaining invocation relationships between tools and in the evolution of basic tools, its ability to construct a complete code project from fundamental components remains to be effectively validated. Future work will be crucial in exploring the boundaries of LLM capabilities and defining the limits of its potential for tool creation.
