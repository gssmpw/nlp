We conduct ablation studies on four key components—GraphRank Retrieval, Tool Merging, Self-Check, and Pruning—to evaluate their influence on tool graph performance. For Open-ended tasks, we use GPT-4o, and for Close-ended tasks, we train with GPT-4o before testing with \textit{Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct}. Additionally, we use vector-based Top-k retrieval as a baseline to examine the impact of tool graph connectivity. We do not conduct ablation without pruning on open-ended tasks  since \ours\ reaches all milestones before the first pruning, as shown in Table \ref{tab:Agent-Ended and signal Task}. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:abl}.

Among these components, Self-Check and Tool Merging have the greatest impact. Removing Self-Check leads to a 16.3\% accuracy drop in Date and slower tech tree mastery in Minecraft, highlighting its crucial role in validating tool invocation and construction. Tool Merging improves efficiency by reducing redundancy in the tool graph; without it, both task accuracy and the tool graph’s effectiveness suffer. Moreover, GraphRank Retrieval accelerates tool evolution by capturing tool dependencies, demonstrating its importance in streamlining the tool selection process.
