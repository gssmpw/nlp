In this paper, we introduce \ours, a framework that dynamically constructs a hierarchical tool graph through two-agent collaboration across multiple scenarios. By modeling dependencies between tools and integrating GraphRank for retrieval, \ours\ enables efficient tool discovery, composition, and reuse, effectively addressing key challenges in tool library construction. Experimental results demonstrate that \ours\ outperforms existing methods in both open-ended and closed-ended tasks, achieving superior task-solving accuracy and adaptability. These findings position \ours\ as a robust and scalable solution for autonomous tool-building, paving the way for more advanced agent systems.
