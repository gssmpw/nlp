\section{More Ablations}
\label{app:apablation}
\subsection{Open-ended Task}
\label{subsec:open-ablation}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:ablation}, AETG significantly outperforms methods that lack certain functional modules in discovering new Minecraft items and skills. It can be observed that the performance is worst when "w/o retrieval" is used, indicating that the absence of retrieval has the greatest impact on overall functionality and plays a crucial role, thereby validating the effectiveness of our retrieval method. The performance with "w/o duplication" is slightly better, indicating its importance is weaker than that of "w/o retrieval." The performance of "w/o check" and "w/o pruning" is better, but still far behind AETG, which further demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of each functional component.

\subsection{Closed-Ended Task}
\label{subsec:closed-ended}
For the Closed-Ended Task, we select Textcraft from the Agent Task and Date from the Single-turn Code Task to evaluate the effectiveness of several components in our method. The results are shown in the Table \ref{tab:closed-toolnumber}.
