\section*{Impact Statement}
We introduce a data-driven method that uses a large language model to generate natural-language captions of voxel-level visual selectivity. Using the method detailed in this paper, we aim to provide a more fine-grained understanding of human visual function than previously achieved. 
We acknowledge that this human brain research could raise concerns regarding individual privacy. Although the present study examined relatively coarse-grained voxel-level data, we cannot dismiss the possibility that future advances in measurement and analysis techniques may enable the extraction of more detailed individual-specific information. In any case, obtaining explicit informed consent from participants remains crucial when collecting and using human brain activity data, as with the NSD dataset used in this study.
