In this study, we introduced \textit{UASTHN}, a novel uncertainty estimation method for Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) in thermal geo-localization, which significantly enhances the reliability of UAV outdoor nighttime localization and navigation. Our CropTTA strategy has demonstrated robust failure detection in challenging TG scenarios. 
% Moreover, CropTTA offers a new uncertainty estimation representation for homography and geo-localization through homography consensus, with seamless integration into any DHE approach. 

Future works will explore the development of an adaptive rejection mechanism and evaluate it on diverse datasets, including daytime, seasonal variations, and dynamic objects.
