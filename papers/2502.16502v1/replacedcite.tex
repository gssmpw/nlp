\subsection{Subpixel edge localization}
Given the prevalence of subpixel edge detection in high-precision fields, a large number of related algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms may be broadly classified into three categories____: moment____, interpolation____, and fitting methods____.

Tabatabai and Mitchell ____ developed the earliest moment-based method on subpixel edge localization, utilizing the relationship between the edge parameters and the gray moments (GMs). 
To obtain invariant under rotation, Ghosal et al.____ proposed Zernike orthogonal moments (ZOMs), but it cannot accurately detect small objects. The orthogonal Fourierâ€“Mellin moments (OFMMs)____ were proposed later to deal with this issue, and the testing accuracy was proven meeting the stringent requirements in medical image analysis or satellite remote sensing. 
Interpolation-based methods leverage interpolating the intensity or the corresponding derivative function of edge pixels to increase the edge information, thereby realizing subpixel edge detection. 
Jensen and Anastassiou____ initially exploited non-linear interpolation to locate subpixel edges, their approach can produce noticeably sharper edges and exhibit a lower error than linear methods. 
Subsequent researchers designed different interpolation schemes____. 
The fitting-based methods usually assume that the curve of edge intensity or gradient variation follows to a functional model, after which subpixel coordinates are obtain from fitting curve using the least square method. 
Nalwa and Binford ____ proposed the first fitting-based method with the hyperbolic tangent function as the model. A blurred edge model ____ was adopted to locate subpixel coordinates as well, and the experiments have demonstrated its good performance on both robustness and accuracy.
Similarly, Hagara and Kulla____ proposed the Erf function to approximate the true edge. Their method is considered to be the most accurate with the high computational cost. 
% Accounting for the blurring effects of the imaging process, a model____ for image gradient distribution around the control points is derived from theoretical analysis with a closed-form solution, this method is simple and is of high precision, and is not affected by the size of the fitting area.

Recently, researchers____ have made remarkable progresses on methods other than that from above three traditional categories.
The method based on the partial area effect____ has been applied in many different fields____, which assumes a valid intensity equation by using the discrete character and regional correlation of edge pixels.
Gioi____ incorporated the classic Canny and Devernay, but using only three pixels makes this approach sensitive to noises. Besides, Seo____ presented a subpixel edge localization method based on the adaptive weighting of gradients (AWG). It has less computational cost and more accuracy than the Erf-fitting method.
And the algorithm based on the intensity integration threshold (IIT)____ locates the subpixel point where the intensity integration reaches the threshold. 
In contrast to these studies, our research delves deeply into the relationship between intensity mapping at subpixel and pixel levels, which leads us to propose a more efficient and streamlined formula.

\subsection{Edge linking}
The following literatures ____ have presented the representative works so far on edge linking at pixel level, which inspired our related research at subpixel level.

As one of the earliest researchers presenting the methods of linking edge pixels, Xie____ proposed the concepts of horizontal edge elements and causal neighborhood windows to realize edge linking. 
Farag and Delp____ used the path metric based on the linear model as well as the A* algorithm to construct a new linking algorithm. Wang and Zhang ____ improved previous linking method by calculating the edge direction within a specific local neighborhood and measuring the geodesic distance. After that, Akinlar and Chome____ introduced smart routing (SR) and predictive edge linking (PEL) to link neighboring anchors and obtain continuous edges.
