\section{\revisedtext{Formative Study}}\label{A:formative participants}

% \rrtext{正如我们在section 3.1中提到的，区分professional的重要标准是有没有接受系统性的训练（更详细的说，即向传承人拜师进行学习），或是经过足够的剪纸经验累积然后从业余变为professional。另外，在我们的采访中，P2-P4都强调他们甚至在3、4岁就自己有剪纸的兴趣，因此家人才请求传承人收这些孩童为徒，同时，收徒也证明师傅认可了他们的天赋。 因此，他们在5-6岁时就已经开始接受系统且专业的训练，而这种幼龄学童在民间剪纸传承中较为常见。 也正因为现在越来越多的new generation对此不感兴趣，所以ICH的传承收到挑战。}
\subsection{\rrtext{Expertise Levels of Paper-cutting}}\label{expert clarification}
\rrtext{As mentioned in~\autoref{A:formative participants}, the key criterion for distinguishing experts (i.e., master and practitioner) is whether they have undergone systematic training (specifically, apprenticing under an inheritor) or have transitioned from amateur to experts status through the accumulation of substantial paper-cutting experience and even been finally recognized as an inheritor. In our interviews, P1-P4 highlighted that they developed an interest in paper-cutting as early as 3-4 years old. Their families subsequently petitioned inheritors to accept these children as apprentices, and the acceptance of such requests indicated the masters' recognition of their talent. As a result, they began receiving systematic and professional training by the age of 5-9. This practice of training young children is relatively common in the Chinese paper-cutting inheritance. However, because this tradition relies on early engagement, the decreasing interest among the younger generation has partially contributed to the challenges faced in the inheritance of ICH, including paper-cutting.}

\revisedtext{As a regionally influenced art form, we utilized the regional distribution as the standard for the selection of 140 paper-cuttings, as illustrated in~\autoref{figure:sample filter}.}

\subsection{\rrtext{Description of Expert Discussion in the Content Analysis}}
\subsubsection{\rrtext{For the Codebook of Core Factors of Paper-cutting Design Ideation}}\label{A:expert discuss ideation}
% 第一轮只基于style 和 function，因此提出应该还考虑题材还有method of expression，第二轮认为植物类和动物类还有瑞兽类都可以归纳为动植物；第三轮认为目前的版本基本合理
\rrtext{The initial version of the codebook was developed solely based on style and function. Thus, in the first round of discussions, the experts recommended adding two dimensions, including subject matter (P1-P2 and P4-P5) and method of expression (P2 and P4-P5), which were accepted through all experts' consensus. During the second round, P2 and P5 suggested merging specific types, such as plants, animals, and mythical creatures into a broader ``flora and fauna'' type. By the third round of discussions, the experts collectively agreed that the current version of the codebook was generally adequate.}

\subsubsection{\rrtext{For the Codebook of Patterns in Paper-cutting}}\label{A:expert discuss pattern}
% 在第一轮讨论中，专家们认为基于unit geometry pattern， 专家认为还有很多虽然也是几何图形，但它们的语义并不是抽象的，而是更practical的，例如月牙纹，云纹，火纹等，故总结出unit semantic pattern。而对于composite pattern，专家认为与decorative pattern对应的就是要实现function，表达核心主题的主体pattern，因此composite pattern应该分为两类。第二轮认为目前的版本基本合理。
\rrtext{During the first round of discussions, the experts observed that, in addition to unit geometry and sawtooth patterns, many \textit{Unit Patterns}, such as crescent, cloud, and fire patterns, possess more practical semantics rather than purely abstract ones. As a result, they recommended introducing a new sub-category within \textit{Unit Patterns}, termed unit semantic patterns. Regarding \textit{Composite Patterns}, the experts suggested distinguishing a type that emphasizes functionality and conveys core themes, referred to as composite primary patterns, as opposed to decorative patterns. Following the second round of discussions, the experts collectively agreed that the current version of the codebook was generally appropriate.}
