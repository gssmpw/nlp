        \centering SFT & Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function f(x) = (2 - x)/log(2 - log(x - 2)). \textcolor{red}{hmm}, let's start by recalling that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has a logarithm in the denominator, there are a couple of things I need to check: first, the argument of the outer logarithm (the one in the denominator) must be positive because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers. Second, the argument of the inner logarithm (the one inside the denominator's argument) must also be positive because we can't take the logarithm of a non-positive number. Let me break this down step by step.... But \textcolor{red}{\textcolor{red}{wait}}, 102 is already the upper bound, so actually, the domain is (2, 102). But we have to make sure that within (2, 102), the expression 2 - log(x - 2) is positive, which we already considered. Let me verify this again. So, starting with the inner logarithm: x > 2. Then, log(x - 2) is defined. Then, the outer logarithm requires that 2 - log(x - 2) > 0, which as we saw, leads to x < 102. So combining x > 2 and x < 102 gives (2, 102). Additionally, we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero, which occurs at x = 102, but since 102 is already the upper limit, the interval is open at 102. Therefore, the domain is (2, 102). Let me check if there are any other restrictions or if I missed something. \textcolor{red}{wait}, another thing to consider: the numerator is 2 - x. The numerator is a linear function, so it's defined for all real numbers. The denominator is log(2 - log(x - 2)), ... Then, log(3 - 2) = log(1) = 0. Then, 2 - 0 = 2, so log(2) is the denominator. That's valid. If x = 100, then log(100 - 2) = log(98), which is positive, so 2 - log(98) would be 2 - log(98), which is positive because log(98) is less than 2 (since $10^2 = 100$). So, denominator is positive. If x approaches 2 from the right, x approaches 2+, so x - 2 approaches 0+, so log(x - 2) approaches -infty, so 2 - log(x - 2) approaches +infty, so denominator is defined. If x approaches 102 from the left, x approaches 102-, so x - 2 approaches 100-, so log(x - 2) approaches log(100-), which is close to 2, so 2 - log(x - 2) approaches 0 from the positive side, so the denominator approaches 0+, making the whole function approach +infty. But x can't be 102. So, in all other points between 2 and 102, the denominator is defined and positive, so the function is defined there. Therefore, the domain is indeed (2, 102). I think that's it. \textbf{Final Answer} The domain of the function is (2, 102). \\

        \centering ThinkPO & Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function f(x) = (2 - x)/log(2 - log(x - 2)), where the log here is base 10. \textcolor{red}{hmm}, let me think step by step about what's required here.  ... But \textcolor{red}{wait}, I need to check if this x > 2 is compatible with the first condition. So maybe I need to solve both inequalities together?Let me start with the second condition: log(x - 2) is defined when x - 2 > 0, so x > 2. So that's the domain from the argument of the inner logarithm. But then, ... So combining x > 2 and x < 102 gives me 2 < x < 102. \textcolor{red}{wait}, but hold on. Let me verify this. If log(x - 2) < 2, then $x - 2 < 10^2 = 100$, so x < 102. But since x - 2 must be positive (because log requires positive argument), x > 2. So indeed, x is in (2, 102). But \textcolor{red}{wait}, when I take log(x - 2) < 2, ... If x approaches 2 from the right, x - 2 approaches 0+, so log(x - 2) approaches -infty, so 2 - log(x - 2) approaches infinity. \textcolor{red}{wait}, but as x approaches 2+, the inner log(x - 2) goes to -infty, so 2 - log(x - 2) goes to +infty. Therefore, the denominator log(2 - log(x - 2)) approaches log(infinity) which is +infty. \textcolor{red}{wait}, but that would mean the denominator is positive and approaching infinity. .... But \textcolor{red}{wait}, is there a point where the denominator could be zero? Let's check. For 2 - log(x - 2) = 0, then log(x - 2) = 2, so $x - 2 = 10^2 = 100$, so x = 102. But x = 102 is the upper bound of the domain. So at x = 102, the denominator is log(2 - log(100)) = log(2 - 2) = log(0), which is undefined. So x cannot be 102. So the domain is (2, 102). But \textcolor{red}{wait}, we also have to consider the numerator. The numerator is 2 - x. So 2 - x can be zero, but if the denominator is non-zero, then the function is defined. If numerator is zero, then f(x) = 0/denominator, which is zero. But division by zero is undefined. \textcolor{red}{wait}, but if numerator is zero, does that make the entire expression zero, but with denominator non-zero? For example, if x = 2, then numerator is 0, denominator is log(2 - log(0)). \textcolor{red}{wait}, x=2 is not in the domain because x - 2 = 0, so log(0) is undefined. ...\textcolor{red}{wait}, but the denominator is log(2 - log(x - 2)). So the denominator is log of something. The logarithm output can be any real number, but in this case, the denominator is used in the function, so as long as the argument inside the log is positive, which we already considered. But the denominator itself can be any real number except zero. \textcolor{red}{wait}, no. \textcolor{red}{wait}, the denominator is log(2 - log(x - 2)), ....\textcolor{red}{wait}, so...Let's compute log(10) is 1 (base 10), so 2 - 1 = 1, log(1) = 0, ...That seems correct.\textcolor{red}{wait}, but let's check another value. If x is 11, then $x - 2 = 9, log(9) = 0.954, 2 - 0.954 = 1.046$, so log(1.046) is a positive number. So denominator is defined and non-zero. If x is 13, then x - 2 = 11, log(11) = 1.041, 2 - 1.041 = 0.959, log(0.959) is negative. But \textcolor{red}{wait}, the original function is defined only if the denominator is log(positive number). So if the denominator is log of a number less than 1, that's negative, but is that allowed? \textcolor{red}{wait}, no. \textcolor{red}{wait}, the denominator is log(2 - log(x - 2)). For the log to be defined, 2 - log(x - 2) must be positive. So if 2 - log(x - 2) is negative, then log of that is undefined (since log of a negative number is not real). .... \textcolor{red}{wait}, x=1 is less than 2,... \textcolor{red}{wait}, no. \textcolor{red}{wait}, the denominator is log(2 - log(x -2)). For log to be defined, the argument must be positive. So if 2 - log(x -2) is positive, then log is defined, regardless of whether it's positive or negative. \textcolor{red}{wait}, no. \textcolor{red}{wait}, .... So intervals (2,12) and (12,102). That should be correct. \\
