The basic idea is to represent images by 4D points (xj,yj,zj,ij) and to define a global energy function based on this representation. For minimization, we propose a technique which does not require computing the derivatives of this criterion with respect to the parameters. It can be understood as an extension of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm or as an application of the formalism proposed by L. Cohen (Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV '95), Boston, June 1995). Two parameters enable us to develop a coarse-to-fine strategy both for resolution and for deformation. Our technique presents the advantage of minimizing a well-defined global criterion, to deal with various classes of transformations (for example, rigid, affine, volume spline, and radial basis functions), to be simple to implement, and to be efficient in practice. Results on real brain and heart 3D images are presented to demonstrate the validity of our approach. We also explain how one can compute basic statistics on the deformation parameters to constrain the set of possible deformations by learning and to discriminate between different groups.},

Semantic segmentation is performed by applying a pre-trained off-the-shelf 2D convolutional neural network over a set of projected images extracted from a panoramic photograph. This allows the network to exploit the visual image features that are learnt in a state-of-the-art segmentation models trained on very large datasets. The study focuses on the adoption of the spherical information from the laser capture and assessing the results using image classification metrics. The obtained results demonstrate that the approach is a promising alternative for asset identification in laser scanning data. We demonstrate comparable performance with spherical machine learning frameworks, however, avoid both the labelling and training efforts required with such approaches.},

	abstract = {This investigation focuses on the performance assessment of a low-cost automotive LIDAR, the Livox Mid-40 series. The work aims to examine the qualities of the sensor in terms of ranging, repeatability and accuracy. Towards these aims a series of experiments were carried out based on previous research of low-cost sensor accuracy, LIDAR accuracy investigation and TLS calibration experiments. The Livox Mid-40 series offers the advantage of a long-range detection beyond 200 m at a remarkably low cost. The preliminary results of the tests for this sensor indicate that it can be used for reality capture purposes such as to obtain coarse as-built plans and volume calculations to mention a few. Close-range experiments were conducted in an indoor laboratory setting. Long-range experiments were performed outdoors towards a building façade. Reference values in both setups were provided with a Leica RTC 360 terrestrial LIDAR system. In the close-range experiments a cross section of the point cloud shows a significant level of noise in the acquired data. At a stand-off distance of 5 m the length measurement tests reveal deviations of up to 11 mm to the reference values. Range measurement was tested up to 130 meters and shows ranging deviations of up to 25 millimetres. The authors recommend further investigation of the issues in radiometric behaviour and material reflectivity. Also, more knowledge about the internal components is needed to understand the causes of the concentric ripple effect observed at close ranges. Another aspect that should be considered is the use of targets and their design as the non-standard scan pattern prevents automated detection with standard commercial software.},

	abstract = {Transverse synchronization of vertical displacements of all jacking-up points is an important monitoring indicator to replace bearings in assembled multigirder bridges during the jacking phase. Currently, using target paper to identify the 3D coordinates of control points reduces the complexity of monitoring operations and improves the stability of data precision. However, the existing planar target locating methods have low accuracy, inefficiency, and subjectivity, which seriously hinders the construction process of bearing replacement. Accurately obtaining the center coordinates of multiple targets from a point cloud in a short monitoring period remains a challenge. This study proposes a high-precision automated algorithm to extract target center points in low-density point clouds to quickly calculate real target center points. First, we construct a standard point cloud model of the target papers for scanning, including color and geometric features. Then, we extract the measured point cloud of the typical jacking operation phase based on the reflection intensity and size information. Next, we map the intensity values of the measured point cloud into the color channel and register the measured point cloud with its standard point cloud model using the normal vector estimation and colored ICP algorithms. Finally, we extract the center point of the measured targets. Numerical experiments and engineering test results show that the proposed method converges quickly with high precision and good robustness, which saves 91.4\% of the time compared with the traditional method. In general, this research can provide effective technical support for 3D laser scanning in monitoring the operation phase of bridge jacking.},

	abstract = {Many applications of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) require the determination of a specific point from a point cloud. In this paper procedure of high precision planar target center acquisition from point cloud is presented. The process is based on an image matching algorithm but before we can deal with raster image to fit a target on it, we need to properly determine the best fitting plane and project points on it. The main emphasis of this paper is in the precision estimation and propagation through the whole procedure which allows us to obtain precision assessment of final results (target center coordinates). Theoretic precision estimations – obtained through the procedure were rather high so we compared them with the empiric precision estimations obtained as standard deviations of results of 60 independently scanned targets. An χ2-test confirmed that theoretic precisions are overestimated. The problem most probably lies in the overestimated precisions of the plane parameters due to vast redundancy of points. However, empirical precisions also confirmed that the proposed procedure can ensure a submillimeter precision level. The algorithm can automatically detect grossly erroneous results to some extent. It can operate when the incidence angles of a laser beam are as high as 80\&deg;, which is desirable property if one is going to use planar targets as tie points in scan registration. The proposed algorithm will also contribute to improve TLS calibration procedures.},

	abstract = {During the registration and georeferencing of terrestrial laser scans, it is common to use targets to mark discrete points. To improve the accuracy of the registration, the uncertainties of the target center estimation (TCE) have to be minimized. The present study examines different factors influencing the precision of the TCE. Here, the focus is on the algorithm and the target design. It is determined that, in general, the uncertainties of the TCE are much smaller than those indicated by the manufacturers. By comparing different algorithms for the first time, it was possible to clearly determine that an algorithm using image correlations yields the smallest standard deviations for the TCE. A comparison of different target designs could not identify an ideal commercially available target. For this reason, a new target, the BOTA8 (BOnn TArget with 8-fold pattern) was developed, which leads to smaller standard deviations than the previous targets. By choosing the best algorithm and improving the target design, standard deviations of     0.5     mm in distance direction and     1.2     arcsec in angular direction for a scan distance up to 100 m were achieved with the laser scanner Leica ScanStation P20. The uncertainties could be reduced by several millimetres and angular seconds compared to the manufacturer’s targets and software.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the registration of LiDAR point clouds. More specifically, we present an automatic method for markerless registration of two such point clouds given in arbitrary local scan coordinates – i.e. without simplifying assumptions such as a common up-vector. Clearly, the critical step of the registration is to find a coarse initial alignment, to be refined with established local methods for fine registration, such as ICP or least-squares surface matching. The proposed approach builds on the 4-Points Congruent Sets (4PCS) algorithm (Aiger et al., 2008), a popular registration tool in computer graphics, and extends it to better deal with the specific challenges of LiDAR data. The main limitations of the original 4PCS method in that context are (i) that it does not cope well with strongly varying point densities, such as they routinely occur in laser scans due to the constant angular sampling from different viewpoints; and (ii) that to remain efficient, huge LiDAR point clouds must be down-sampled so heavily that approximate point-to-point correspondence can no longer be guaranteed. To overcome these drawbacks we propose not to apply 4PCS to the original point cloud (respectively, a randomly or regularly subsampled version of it), but rather to represent the point clouds with sets of distinctive 3D keypoints, and run (a slightly modified) 4PCS on the keypoint sets. The resulting combination, termed Keypoint-based 4-Points Congruent Sets (K-4PCS), proves to be very reliable: with suitable parameter settings, tests in indoor as well as outdoor environments yield 100\% success rates.},
