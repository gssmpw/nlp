\subsection{Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Algorithm}
The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm has been a fundamental technique in 3D computer vision and robotics for point cloud. Originally proposed by Besl, P. J., & McKay, N. D., "Method for Registration of 3-D Shapes," ICP aims to minimise the distance between two datasets, typically referred to as the source and the target. The algorithm operates in an iterative manner, identifying correspondences by matching each source point with its nearest target point Chen, Y., & Medioni, G., "Object Modelling by Registration of Multiple Range Images," It then computes the rigid transformation, usually involving both rotation and translation, to achieve the best alignment of these matched points Pomerleau, F., Colas, J., Meeusen, T., & Burgard, W., "Particle Filters for Robot Localization in Online SLAM." This process is repeated until convergence, where the change in the alignment parameters or the overall alignment error becomes smaller than a predefined threshold.

One key advantage of the ICP framework lies in its simplicity: the algorithm is conceptually straightforward, and its basic version is relatively easy to implement. However, traditional ICP can be sensitive to local minima, often requiring a good initial alignment Rusinkiewicz, R., & Levoy, M., "Efficient Variants of the ICP Algorithm," Furthermore, outliers, noise, and partial overlaps between datasets can significantly degrade its performance Huang, S., "A Robust Point Matching Algorithm for 3D Models." Over the years, various modifications and improvements Zhang, Z., "Iterative Point Correspondence Computation for 3D Registration," have been proposed to mitigate these issues. Among the most common strategies are robust cost functions Niessner, M., "RGB-D Scene Understanding," weighting schemes for correspondences Chen, Y., & Medioni, G., "Object Modelling by Registration of Multiple Range Images," and more sophisticated techniques Zhang, Z., "Iterative Point Correspondence Computation for 3D Registration" to reject outliers. 

In addition, there is significant interest in integrating additional information into the ICP pipeline. Instead of solely relying on geometric cues such as point coordinates or surface normals, recent approaches have proposed incorporating colour (RGB) or intensity data to enhance correspondence accuracy. These methods Chen, Y., & Medioni, G., "Object Modelling by Registration of Multiple Range Images," commonly known as "Colored ICP" employ differences in pixel intensities or colour values as additional constraints. This is particularly beneficial in situations where geometric attributes alone are inadequate for accurate alignment or where surfaces possess complex texture patterns that can assist in the matching process.

\subsection{Applications of Target Measurement}

One approach relies on the use of physical checkerboard targets for registration. Zhang, Z., "Iterative Point Correspondence Computation for 3D Registration," analyse checkerboard target identification for terrestrial laser scanning. They propose a geometric method to determine the target centre with higher precision, demonstrating that their approach can reduce errors by up to 6 mm compared to conventional automatic methods.

Huang, S., examines data acquisition errors in 3D laser scanning for construction by evaluating how different target types (paper, paddle, and sphere) and layouts impact registration accuracy in both indoor and outdoor environments and presents guidelines for optimal target configuration.

Pomerleau, F., propose to use Coloured ICP to measure target centres for checkerboard targets, similar to our investigation. They use data from a survey-grade terrestrial laser scanner. Their intended application is structural bridge monitoring purposes. They report an average accuracy of the measurement below 1.3 millimetres.

Where targets cannot be placed in the scene, the intensity information form the scanner can still be used to identify distinctive points. For point cloud data that is captured with a regular pattern, standard image processing can be used in a similar way to target detection. For example, Chen, Y., & Medioni, G., "Object Modelling by Registration of Multiple Range Images," proposes to use the SUSAN operator on a co-registered image from a camera, Zhang, Z., "Iterative Point Correspondence Computation for 3D Registration," proposes to use the SIFT operator on the LIDAR reflectance directly and Niessner, M., "RGB-D Scene Understanding," propose to use a Difference-of-Gaussian approach on the reflectance information.
Most of these methods extract image features to find reliable 3D correspondences for the purpose of registration.

In the following we describe our approach to the measurement of the target centre. In contrast to most proposed methods above we focus on unordered point clouds, where raster-based methods are not available, and low-cost sensors, where increased measurement noise and outliers are expected. As we are not aware of a commercial reference solution to this problem, we start by conducting a series of synthetic experiments to explore the viability and accuracy potential of the approach.



%The reviewed studies primarily rely on physical targets or target-free methods and do not utilise 3D synthetic point cloud checkerboards. In contrast, our approach introduces synthetic point cloud checkerboards, which offer controlled and consistent target geometry and reduce variability caused by physical targets. This innovation has significant potential for commercialisation and industrial application.
