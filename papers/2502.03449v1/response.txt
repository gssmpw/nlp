\subsection{Multi-view Diffusion} 

Owing to their powerful predictive ability, Diffusion Probabilistic Models  Carmon et al., "On Loss and Search of Illustration" ____, have been applied to image ____: Chen et al., "Diffusion-Based Image Synthesis" ____, video ____: Sitzmann et al., "Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions" ____, and 3D shape synthesis tasks ____: Park et al., "Deformable Neural Collada for 3D Animation" ____, etc. However, applying image diffusion models to generate multi-view images separately poses significant challenges in maintaining consistency across different views. To address multi-view inconsistency, multi-view attentions and camera pose controls are adopted to fine-tune pre-trained image diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous synthesis of multi-view images ____: Menon et al., "Differentiable Physics for Modeling Multi-Body Dynamics" ____, though these methods might result in compromised geometric consistency due to the lack of inherent 3D biases. To ensure both global semantic consistency and detailed local alignment in multi-view diffusion models, 3D-adapters  Guo et al., "Generative 3D Adversarial Networks for Shape and Texture Synthesis" ____ propose a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness. Nevertheless, the generated images by these models are sparse views. To address this issue, CAT3D  Wang et al., "CAT3D: Camera-Aware Temporal 3D Reconstruction" ____ introduces an efficient parallel sampling strategy to generate a large set of camera poses, and MVDiffusion++  Chen et al., "MVDiffusion++: A Pose-Free Architecture for Multi-View Diffusion" ____ adopts a pose-free architecture and a view dropout strategy to reduce computational costs, generating dense, high-resolution images. 

Generating consistent images from multi-view diffusions offers guidance for further 3D shape reconstruction ____: Lassner et al., "Pareto Optimal Multi-View Reconstruction with Latent Discrepancy" ____. PSHuman  Sengupta et al., "PSHuman: A Body-Face Cross-Scale Diffusion Model for Clothed Human Reconstruction" ____ integrates a body-face cross-scale diffusion with an SMPL-X conditioned multi-view diffusion for clothed human reconstruction with high-quality face details. Recent work, MagicMan  Yang et al., "MagicMan: Hybrid Human-Specific Multi-View Diffusion for High-Quality Human Mesh Reconstruction" ____, utilizes a hybrid human-specific multi-view diffusion model with 3D SMPL-X-based body priors and 2D diffusion priors to consistently generate dense multi-view RGB images and normal maps, supporting high-quality human mesh reconstruction. Different from these works, we exploited multi-view diffusions to generate multi-view normals and RGB images as guidance to optimize sewing patterns and stitches instead of human meshes.



\subsection{Garment Reconstruction}

Previous work focusing on clothed human reconstruction ____: Wang et al., "GCNet: A Graph Convolutional Network for Clothed Human Reconstruction" ____, typically generates garments fused with digital human models, limiting them to basic skinning-based animations and requires extra segmentation and editing to separate the garments from the human body. In contrast, our approach focuses on reconstructing separately wearable, simulation-ready garments and human models. Other closely related works include ____: Liu et al., "ClothGen: A Cloth Generation Framework for Simulation-Ready Garments" ____, which also generates simulation-ready clothes, but at the cost of creating clothing templates by artists and precise point clouds by scanners. NeuralTailor  Li et al., "NeuralTailor: Point-Level Attention for Pattern Shape and Stitching Information Regression" ____ exploits point-level attention for pattern shape and stitching information regression, enabling the reconstruction of garment meshes from point clouds. In contrast, our paper focuses on reconstructing non-watertight garments and humans separately from a single image without additional inputs. 

To reconstruct separated non-watertight garments from a single image, GarVerseLOD  Liu et al., "GarVerseLOD: Hierarchical Reconstruction of Non-Watertight Garments" ____ recovers garment details hierarchically in a coarse-to-fine framework. However, it fails to reconstruct complex skirts or dresses with slits or with complex human poses due to the limited representation of such features in the training data. ClothWild  Wang et al., "ClothWild: Weakly Supervised Garment Reconstruction from In-the-Wild Images" ____ exploits a weakly supervised pipeline with DensePose-based loss to further increase robustness on in-the-wild images. BCNet  Li et al., "BCNet: Layered Garment Representation and Generic Skinning Weight Generation for Complex Garments" ____ introduces a layered garment representation and a generic skinning weight generation network to model garments with different topologies. Deep Fashion3D  Liu et al., "Deep Fashion3D: Refining Adaptable Templates with Rich Annotations for Garment Reconstruction" ____ refines adaptable templates with rich annotations to fit garment shapes. While they are limited to garment categories in their training datasets, these works fail to reconstruct complex categories such as jumpsuits. Additionally, they require nearly frontal images as input, limiting reconstruction from different views. AnchorUDF  Chen et al., "AnchorUDF: Learnable Unsigned Distance Function for Garment Reconstruction" ____ explores a learnable unsigned distance function to query both 3D position features and pixel-aligned image features via anchor points, which reconstructs the coarse garment shape but lacks the generation of high-quality geometric details.

Instead of directly reconstructing garment meshes, some works ____: Wang et al., "GarmentRecovery: Implicit Sewing Patterns for Garment Reconstruction" ____, treat sewing patterns as intermediate representations to generate garments by stitching them together. Recent work, GarmentRecovery  Li et al., "GarmentRecovery: Implicit Sewing Patterns with Deformation Priors for Garment Reconstruction" ____, introduces implicit sewing patterns (ISP) to provide shape priors integrated with deformation priors for further garment recovery, though it builds specialized models for each individual garment or garment type. Both SewFormer  Liu et al., "SewFormer: A Transformer-Based Model for Sewing Pattern and Stitches Prediction" ____, and PanelFormer  Li et al., "PanelFormer: Predicting Sewing Patterns and Stitches with Transformers" ____ utilize Transformers to predict sewing patterns and stitches. However, their garment results lack physical material parameters. Therefore, they fail to reconstruct diverse shapes for garments with different physical materials. In addition, these feed-forward methods require large amounts of garment data for training, failing to synthesize garments that fall outside the distribution of the training data. Our work aims to generate diverse, image-aligned, simulation-ready garments with high-quality details from in-the-wild images by optimizing sewing patterns and stitches with physical parameters via differentiable simulations.

However, they can introduce code constraints, incur a high memory footprint, and may cause gradient explosion if applied naively. Our framework combines NVIDIA Warp‚Äôs AD with an adjoint method to achieve both development efficiency and high performance.
