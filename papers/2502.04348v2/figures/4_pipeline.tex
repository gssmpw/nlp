    \caption{A visual overview of the proposed pipeline. Whenever the prompt is given from the user, a trained router predicts which set of blocks can be omitted with minimal loss, among the small number of candidate omission sets. Then, the LLM transformer blocks are loaded from the storage (\textit{e.g.}, flash drive) to the high-speed memory (\textit{e.g.}, GPU RAM) except for the omitted blocks, saving the time and energy for the data communication. Finally, the depth-pruned model operates and generates the text.}
