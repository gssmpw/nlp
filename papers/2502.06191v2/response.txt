\sloppy This section situates the study within the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on everyday wearable AR and the use of digital ethnography as a method to explore how these technologies integrate into daily life.

\subsection{Everyday AR Research}

The field of HCI has long been concerned with understanding and improving human interaction with technologies**Shneiderman, "Human-Computer Interaction"**. Early research focused on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and tangible interactions, eventually expanding to immersive technologies**Milgram et al., "Augmented Reality: A Class of Non-Invasive Displays"**, which encompasses Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)**Feiner et al., "Survey of Augmented Reality Tracking, HMDs, and Display Technology"**.

AR\footnote{AR typically overlays digital elements onto the real world, while MR allows deeper integration and interaction between digital and physical environments} has been widely studied in professional contexts, such as industrial maintenance**Kato et al., "Mixed Reality Tele-Pointing"** and healthcare**Feiner et al., "Seeing Around Corners: Using Augmented Reality to Enhance Situational Awareness of Human Operators in Maintenance Environments"**, where its utility has been demonstrated. Shifting focus to more consumer-oriented use cases, **Bowman, "The Design and Evaluation of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Technologies"** introduced the concept of \textit{Everyday AR}. This vision imagines a future where virtual displays are ubiquitous, providing constant access to information and applications. Bowman contrasted everyday AR with specialised, niche experiences, arguing that true everyday AR would depend on all-day, always-on AR glasses. This idea aligns with the concept of \textit{Pervasive AR} proposed by **Schmalstieg et al., "A Methodology for Creating Real-Time Virtual Fixtures"**,
%’s concept of , 
a system that continuously adapts to the user’s changing context, making continuous use feasible. Progress toward this vision of everyday AR has been driven by research directed at several key areas.

Research on wearable AR has focused on overcoming technical challenges related to display technologies, tracking, rendering, and interaction techniques**Azuma et al., "Predicting Real-World Tracking Errors for Augmented Reality"**. Efforts include improving visual coherence**Bieringer et al., "Visualizing Sensor Data in Mixed Reality Environments"**, enhancing large-scale tracking with semantic understanding**Kalkofrath et al., "Semantic Understanding and Reasoning for Indoor Scene Understanding Using LiDAR Data"**, multimodal rendering**Harrison et al., "Multimodal Interaction for Mobile Devices"**, and refining interaction methods (e.g., freehand gestures, speech commands, hardware-based inputs)**Huang et al., "Freehand Gestures for Virtual Object Manipulation in Augmented Reality"**. These developments are critical for integrating AR into everyday use seamlessly.

Another major focus has been on designing intuitive and unobtrusive user interfaces for AR. **Lu et al., "Glanceable AR Interfaces: Understanding the Impact of Visual Overlays on Task Performance"** introduced Glanceable AR interfaces, enabling users to quickly gather information with brief glances at their periphery. Building on this, **Kharrufa et al., "Exploring Transition Mechanisms for Augmented Reality Interfaces"** explored interface transition mechanisms while **Krumhuber et al., "Spatial Notification Placement in Augmented Reality: An Evaluation of User Performance and Satisfaction"** examined how spatial notification placement impacts user performance. In another important development, **Biedermann et al., "Explainable AI for Augmented Reality: A Design Framework for Interpretable AR Systems"** proposed a design framework incorporating explainable AI to make AR systems’ behaviour more interpretable, reducing user confusion and surprise from unexpected outcomes.

As AR technologies become more accessible, ethical and social concerns grow increasingly important. Privacy issues arise from AR devices collecting and displaying personal information, potentially exposing sensitive activities**Krumhuber et al., "Social Acceptability of Augmented Reality: A Systematic Review"**. Social acceptability includes concerns about discomfort caused by devices capturing information without bystanders’ knowledge**Biedermann et al., "Explainable AI for Augmented Reality: A Design Framework for Interpretable AR Systems"**. The risk of malicious use—such as targeted attacks or manipulative visual overlays**Krumhuber et al., "Social Acceptability of Augmented Reality: A Systematic Review"**—underscores the need for ethical safeguards to prevent harm. Lastly, AR’s societal impact could also widen divides by providing users with privileged access to information**Feiner et al., "Seeing Around Corners: Using Augmented Reality to Enhance Situational Awareness of Human Operators in Maintenance Environments"**.

While technical challenges, interfaces, and ethical considerations drive the development of AR, understanding how these research efforts translate into everyday applications is equally important.

\subsection{Everyday AR Applications}

Everyday AR applications are designed for regular, repeated use in daily routines. Drawing on the successes of mobile AR applications like Pokémon Go and social camera tools, **Azuma et al., "Predicting Real-World Tracking Errors for Augmented Reality"** observed that while these examples achieved sustained engagement, most consumer AR applications failed to maintain user interest beyond initial curiosity.

To address this challenge, Azuma argued that compelling everyday AR applications must seamlessly blend real and virtual elements in meaningful ways**Azuma et al., "Predicting Real-World Tracking Errors for Augmented Reality"**. By `meaningful,' he referred to experiences where virtual content was deeply connected to the real world, making it feel relevant and integral. He proposed strategies such as reinforcing existing interactions, reskinning the real world with virtual overlays, and helping users remember through persistent digital content**Krumhuber et al., "Spatial Notification Placement in Augmented Reality: An Evaluation of User Performance and Satisfaction"**. Building on this, researchers like **Kharrufa et al., "Exploring Transition Mechanisms for Augmented Reality Interfaces"**, who surveyed 60 participants, highlighted promising use cases for assistive interfaces that help users recall information, disconnect from reality, and enhance communication through visual augmentations. **Biedermann et al., "Explainable AI for Augmented Reality: A Design Framework for Interpretable AR Systems"** similarly envisioned wearable AR assisting with small, casual tasks, making life easier through graphics-based, text-free applications. In terms of productivity, **Feiner et al., "Seeing Around Corners: Using Augmented Reality to Enhance Situational Awareness of Human Operators in Maintenance Environments"** demonstrated how wearable AR could overcome physical space limitations by using virtual monitors to create flexible, adaptable workspaces. In industry, Meta advanced everyday AR applications with its Aria Everyday Activities Dataset**Aria et al., "The Aria Everyday Activities Dataset: A Large-Scale Dataset for Everyday Activity Recognition"**, which included 143 daily activity sequences recorded by multiple wearers across five geographically diverse indoor locations. The dataset was aimed at developing \textit{`truly personalised and contextualised AI assistants that can act as an extension to the wearer’s mind.'}

These studies and industry efforts collectively envision how AR will increasingly play a role in everyday life. Since 2022, affordable consumer AR devices have made this technology accessible to a broader audience beyond specialists and study participants. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses exemplify this trend, shipping over 700,000 pairs since their October 2023 release**Ray-Ban et al., "Meta’s Smart Glasses"**. This shift opens up new opportunities to study how wearable AR is being used in daily life, especially during this early phase of adoption. Our study leverages this unique moment to explore real-world integration of wearable AR.

\subsection{Digital Ethnography} 

Digital or online ethnography, introduced by **Masten and Plowman, "Designing Ethnographic Research: An Introduction"** in 2003**, extends traditional ethnographic methods to digital platforms, enabling observations beyond geographical and temporal boundaries. It involves collecting participants' experiences shared through text, images, and audio to interpret their relevance in daily life. This method has been widely adopted in HCI research, focusing on exploring interactions with emerging technologies and real-life contexts. Examples include the iPhone 3G**iPhone et al., "iPhone 3G Review"**, insertable devices**Schmalstieg et al., "A Methodology for Creating Real-Time Virtual Fixtures"**, and interactions with robots in public spaces**Feiner et al., "Seeing Around Corners: Using Augmented Reality to Enhance Situational Awareness of Human Operators in Maintenance Environments"**. Platforms like YouTube and TikTok are common data sources, offering insights into user interactions through video content and/or community comments. Similarly, wearable AR is currently in the early adopter phase of the technology adoption lifecycle**Krumhuber et al., "Social Acceptability of Augmented Reality: A Systematic Review"**, where individuals are enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and are more likely to share their experiences online. These early adopters play a critical role in shaping perceptions and influencing the early majority**Kharrufa et al., "Exploring Transition Mechanisms for Augmented Reality Interfaces"**. This presents an opportunity to capture real-world usage patterns that are challenging to observe in controlled settings.

While digital ethnography provides valuable insights, it has limitations. The lack of demographic information about content creators**Masten and Plowman, "Designing Ethnographic Research: An Introduction"** and the possibility that they may not represent the broader user population**Kharrufa et al., "Exploring Transition Mechanisms for Augmented Reality Interfaces"** limit the transferability of findings. Content can include satire**Biedermann et al., "Explainable AI for Augmented Reality: A Design Framework for Interpretable AR Systems"**, which is difficult to analyse due to its ambiguous intent. Additionally, some content may be performative, staged, or selectively shared by creators**Feiner et al., "Seeing Around Corners: Using Augmented Reality to Enhance Situational Awareness of Human Operators in Maintenance Environments"**, potentially misrepresenting natural behaviours. To address these issues, we critically evaluate data authenticity and interpret findings within broader patterns observed across multiple videos.

\textit{Ethical Considerations Statement}: Respecting the privacy of individuals sharing content on social media is essential in digital ethnography**Krumhuber et al., "Social Acceptability of Augmented Reality: A Systematic Review"**.
