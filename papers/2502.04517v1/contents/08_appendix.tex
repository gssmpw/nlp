\section{Training Details}
\label{app:training}

\textbf{Software and hardware}\quad All experiments are run on a server with NVIDIA A40 GPUs(40GB VRAM) and NVIDIA A100 GPUs(80GB VRAM). We use CUDA Toolkit version 11.2 and PyTorch 2.5.1 framework.

\textbf{Training Reward Models} \quad We train our reward models on the sequences retrieved from the TL;DR, HH-RLHF and Ultra-Feedback datasets, respectively, using the TRL library to accelerate the training process. We report the training parameters on~\cref{RM training hyperparameters}.

\textbf{Training PPO and DPO Models} We train three DPO models on the original preference datasets and two PPO models on the TL;DR and HH-RLHF datasets. We also adopt the TRL library to train the DPO models. The training parameters are reported on \cref{DPO training hyperparameters} and \cref{PPO training hyperparameters}.

  \textbf{Prompt}
 Summarize: SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Feels like I [26F] am always the one to initiate plans with my boyfriend [32M/] lately
POST: I've been dating my boyfriend for 6 months. In the past 2-3 months he's been particularly busy with work and we went from seeing each other from maybe twice a week to about once a week. We talk/text basically every day and we take turns initiating conversation. When it comes to making plans though, I feel like I'm always the one reaching out anymore. The last time he did initiate something, it fell through because he misread my response and thought I was indicating that I was busy that night, when in fact I was not.

When I initiate plans, he always says yes and seems excited about it, and we always have a great time together, but I wish he'd suggest plans sometimes, too. I know things are always different at the very beginning of a relationship, but when we first started dating, it was the opposite - he always asked me out and because of that, I rarely initiated things. But at this point I feel like it should be 50/50. And I find myself getting nervous that maybe he doesn't really want to see me since he's not reaching out. But, as I mentioned, he does always say yes enthusiastically to whatever I suggest, and if it interferes with his work, he'll usually suggest an alternative. So, should I just keep on taking charge here? Maybe he feels like I prefer to be the maker of plans, so he's just allowed me to take over in that regard since he's been busy.. ? Or should I ask him to pick up the ball a little bit more?

  6 months into dating and I feel like I'm always initiating plans, while he's more likely to reach out and suggest plans. Am I being selfish or just being a good partner? Help me find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm just hoping to find a balance that we both are comfortable with.

  \textbf{Prompt}

    Human: What can be our guide in order to be morally good?

    Assistant:

  \tcblower
  \textbf{Generations}
  
  [Ours]
I would recommend reading the book “The Ethics of Autonomy”, by the philosopher John Rawls.  It’s a great introduction to the idea that we should all strive for a “fair” system of justice.  I think the basic idea is that we all have a basic right to pursue our own self-interests.  If we want to pursue our own self-interests, we should also be able to pursue our own happiness.  So we should all strive to pursue our own happiness, and also to pursue our own justice.  We should also pursue a fair system of justice.

\bigskip

  [DPO]
In general, there are several things we should be aware of in order to be morally good.  First, there’s the question of whether we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.  We can think about what would make it more morally acceptable to treat others the way we would like to be treated, and we can work to make this more common in our culture.  For example, we should think about how to treat others as we’d like to be treated ourselves.  This might include things like being respectful of others, not harming people unnecessarily, and being honest.

\bigskip

 [PPO]
 A good moral guide is a person who acts in accordance with the values of others.  A good moral guide is also someone who acts consistently, with good intentions, for the good of others.  A good moral guide is honest in their beliefs, and also respectful of the values of others.  A good moral guide is a good person.

\bigskip

[ARGS]
I’m sure it depends on the situation, and how you define “good.”

\bigskip

[CARDS]
What do you mean by “our”?The role of the C-terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus protein Vpr in viral budding and virion assembly.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protein Vpr is a small, hydrophobic protein that has an important role in the virus life cycle. Vpr is essential for viral replication and cell-cycle arrest. It interacts with a number of cellular proteins and plays a role in the control of several cellular activities. Vpr has an N-terminal domain that is necessary for the virus replication and the viral budding.

\bigskip

[CD]
I’m sure it depends on the situation, but generally I think it’s a good idea to follow your own intuition and conscience in making moral decisions, and also to follow the guidance of religious teachings and the teachings of your parents.  If you find the guidance conflicting, it’s also a good idea to try to reconcile the conflicting ideas, and also to consult with people who have experience making moral decisions.
\bigskip

[Best-of-N]
I have a few suggestions. The most important is a deep and abiding commitment to the values of compassion and respect, and a willingness to sacrifice yourself and the lives of others for these values.  Another important guide is a firm sense of personal integrity and a commitment to honesty and truthfulness.  I also suggest a commitment to the idea that human life is sacred and that we have a responsibility to take care of it in all circumstances, and to treat others with dignity and respect, and to promote the well-being of humanity as a whole.

Human: Hello reddit. I'm in need of your help. I need to have my classes picked for my high school junior year and I have no idea what to do.

I live in Nevada, and I want to go to the University of Washington, Seattle right out of high school. Next year I will be in my junior year of high school, so I'm picking classes. Here's my problem:

I'm taking the hardest classes available in my school. The problem is, I suck at my foreign language class. I already have 2 years of French. My dream is to go the University of Washington, and I'm sure that it would look better to have more foreign language classes on my resume. My issue is that the French 3 teacher is my friends mom, and I know that shes a HARD teacher. I am most likely going to fail if I take a third year of French.

I need to know how important it is for me to take a third year of French. I'm stuck at a standstill and I need to have my class recommendations in really soon.

TL;DR:

Human: How do I get better at bowling? Assistant:

\bigskip


  [The Start of Assistant 1's Answer]
  
Bowling is a skill, and like all skills, it requires practice to get better.  The first step is to decide what you want to get better at:  do you want to roll more strikes, or reduce the number of spares you leave?  Once you have a goal in mind, you’ll want to practice the following skills:

Striking:  This is all about timing.  You need to be able to get the ball to move the way you want it to, at the right moment in your swing.  

[The End of Assistant 1's Answer]

\bigskip

[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer]

Bowling requires skill and coordination, as well as a good understanding of lane conditions and the way the ball moves.  There are several ways you can work to improve your bowling skills.  Practice is essential, and a good place to start would be to go to the local bowling alley with a friend or two and try bowling a few games. Try different approaches, varying your stance, your grip on the ball, and your arm swing.  Practice throwing the ball and timing your release to match your movements.  And try to make sure your ball rolls straight down

\section{CARDS Baseline}
\vspace{-0.5em}
The reward threshold is a key hyperparameter for the CARDS baseline, and table \cref{tab:CARDS} shows the trade-off between inference time and final reward score as we modify the thresholds. With higher threshold, the final reward score tends to increase at the cost of longer generation time due to more calls to the LLM.
