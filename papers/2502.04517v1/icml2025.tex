\begin{abstract}
% Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a critical step for aligning Large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, conventional training algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) usually suffer from high cost and instability. Reward-guided text generation (RGTG) is an emerging method where a reward model is used to score partial sequences during decoding, and the reward score is combined with LLM logits to achieve an output distribution similar to RLHF. However, training the reward models remains to be challenging. Despite multiple methods of training such models have been proposed, they all suffer from certain assumptions and limitations. In this work, we aim to seek alternative methods that are more principled to approach such reward models. We proposed a local constraint that allows LLMs and score partial sequence based on their optimal expansions.

Reward-guided text generation (RGTG) has emerged as a viable alternative to offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). 
RGTG methods can align baseline language models to human preferences without further training like in standard RLHF methods. 
However, they rely on a reward model to score each candidate token generated by the language model at inference, incurring significant test-time overhead.
Additionally, the reward model is usually only trained to score full sequences, which can lead to sub-optimal choices for partial sequences. 
In this work, we present a novel reward model architecture that is trained, using a Bradley-Terry loss, to prefer the optimal expansion of a sequence with just a \emph{single call} to the reward model at each step of the generation process.  
That is, a score for all possible candidate tokens is generated simultaneously, leading to efficient inference. 
We theoretically analyze various RGTG reward models and demonstrate that prior techniques prefer sub-optimal sequences compared to our method during inference. 
Empirically, our reward model leads to significantly faster inference than other RGTG methods. 
It requires fewer calls to the reward model and performs competitively compared to previous RGTG and offline RLHF methods.
