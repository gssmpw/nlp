One counterintuitive phenomenon which we demonstrate is the “windfall of malice”: paradoxically, when a myopically malicious player gains control of a fraction of the flow, the new equilibrium may be more favorable for the remaining rational players than the previous equilibrium.}

title = {Spiteful bidding in sealed-bid auctions},
year = {2007},
publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {We study the bidding behavior of spiteful agents who, contrary to the common assumption of self-interest, maximize a convex combination of their own profit and their competitors' losses. The motivation for this assumption stems from inherent spitefulness or, for example, from competitive scenarios such as in closed markets where the loss of a competitor will likely result in future gains for oneself. We derive symmetric Bayes Nash equilibria for spiteful agents in 1st-price and 2nd-price sealedbid auctions. In 1st-price auctions, bidders become "more truthful" the more spiteful they are. Surprisingly, the equilibrium strategy in 2nd-price auctions does not depend on the number of bidders. Based on these equilibria, we compare the revenue in both auction types. It turns out that expected revenue in 2nd-price auctions is higher than expected revenue in 1st-price auctions in the case of even the most modestly spiteful agents, provided they still care at least at little for their own profit. In other words, revenue equivalence only holds for auctions in which all agents are either self-interested or completely malicious. We furthermore investigate the impact of common knowledge on spiteful bidding. Divulging the bidders' valuations reduces revenue in 2nd-price auctions, whereas it has the opposite effect in 1st-price auctions.},

In fact, no such guarantees exist in general. However, in this paper we show that large games are innately fault tolerant. We quantify the ways in which two subclasses of large games – λ-continuous games and anonymous games – are resilient against Byzantine faults (i.e. irrational behavior), coalitions, and asynchronous play. We also show that general large games have some non-trivial resilience against faults.}

    abstract = {This article studies the effects of altruism, a phenomenon widely observed in practice, in the model of atomic congestion games. Altruistic behavior is modeled by a linear trade-off between selfish and social objectives. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games with player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the pure Nash equilibria of these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of sequential best-response dynamics. In general, pure Nash equilibria are often absent, and existence is NP-hard to decide. Perhaps surprisingly, if all delay functions are affine, the games remain potential games, even when agents are arbitrarily altruistic. The construction underlying this result can be extended to a class of general potential games and social cost functions, and we study a number of prominent examples. These results give important insights into the robustness of multi-agent systems with heterogeneous altruistic incentives. Furthermore, they yield a general technique to prove that stabilization is robust, even with partly altruistic agents, which is of independent interest.In addition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario with a central altruistic institution that can set incentives for the agents. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the minimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more general mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior. These results are closely related to Stackelberg routing and answer open questions raised recently in the literature.},

We analyze the corresponding equilibria and show that the computation of the worst and best Nash equilibrium is NP-hard. Intriguingly, even though the windfall of friendship can never be negative, the social welfare does not increase monotonically with the extent to which players care for each other.

abstract = {The classic prophet inequality states that, when faced with a finite sequence of non-negative independent random variables, a gambler who knows their distribution and is allowed to stop the sequence at any time, can obtain, in expectation, at least half as much reward as a prophet who knows the values of each random variable and can choose the largest one. Following this classic theorem from the 70s, many results have been obtained for several related optimal stopping problems. Moreover, the recently uncovered connection between prophet inequalities and posted price mechanisms, has given the area a new surge. We survey some new developments and highlight some compelling open problems.},

abstract = {Robust optimization is a young and active research field that has been mainly developed in the last 15 years. Robust optimization is very useful for practice, since it is tailored to the information at hand, and it leads to computationally tractable formulations. It is therefore remarkable that real-life applications of robust optimization are still lagging behind; there is much more potential for real-life applications than has been exploited hitherto. The aim of this paper is to help practitioners to understand robust optimization and to successfully apply it in practice. We provide a brief introduction to robust optimization, and also describe important do׳s and don׳ts for using it in practice. We use many small examples to illustrate our discussions.}

Our assumptions about the behavior both of rational players, and of malicious players are strictly weaker than have been previously used to study the price of malice. Rather than assuming that rational players route their flow according to a Nash equilibrium, we assume only that they play so as to have no regret . Rather than assuming that malicious players myopically seek to maximize the social cost of the game, we study Byzantine players about whom we make no assumptions, who may be seeking to optimize any utility function, and who may engage in an arbitrary degree of counter-speculation. Because our assumptions are strictly weaker than in previous work, the bounds we prove on two measures of the price of malice hold also for the quantities studied by Babaioff et al. [2] and Moscibroda et al. [15] We prove tight bounds both for the special case of parallel link routing games, and for general congestion games.},

abstract="The minmax regret problem for combinatorial optimization under uncertainty can be viewed as a zero-sum game played between an optimizing player and an adversary, where the optimizing player selects a solution and the adversary selects costs with the intention of maximizing the regret of the player. The conventional minmax regret model considers only deterministic solutions/strategies, and minmax regret versions of most polynomial solvable problems are NP-hard. In this paper, we consider a randomized model where the optimizing player selects a probability distribution (corresponding to a mixed strategy) over solutions and the adversary selects costs with knowledge of the player's distribution, but not its realization. We show that under this randomized model, the minmax regret version of any polynomial solvable combinatorial problem becomes polynomial solvable. This holds true for both interval and discrete scenario representations of uncertainty. Using the randomized model, we show new proofs of existing approximation algorithms for the deterministic model based on primal-dual approaches. We also determine integrality gaps of minmax regret formulations, giving tight bounds on the limits of performance gains from randomization. Finally, we prove that minmax regret problems are NP-hard under general convex uncertainty.",

abstract = {This paper studies adversarial bandits with corruptions. In the basic adversarial bandit setting, the reward of arms is predetermined by an adversary who is oblivious to the learner's policy. In this paper, we consider an extended setting in which an attacker sits in-between the environment and the learner, and is endowed with a limited budget to corrupt the reward of the selected arm. We have two main results. First, we derive a lower bound on the regret of any bandit algorithm that is aware of the budget of the attacker. Also, for budget-agnostic algorithms, we characterize an impossibility result demonstrating that even when the attacker has a sublinear budget, i.e., a budget growing sublinearly with time horizon T, they fail to achieve a sublinear regret. Second, we propose ExpRb, a bandit algorithm that incorporates a biased estimator and a robustness parameter to deal with corruption. We characterize the regret of ExpRb and show that for the case of a known corruption budget, the regret of ExpRb is tight.},

It has since been taken up and developed by many eminent probabilists and statisticians and has been extended and generalized in many different directions so that now one can say that it constitutes a "field" within mathematics-probability-optimization. The object of this article is partly historical (to give a fresh view of the origins of the problem, touching upon Cayley and Kepler), partly review of the field (listing the subfields of recent interest), partly serious (to answer the question posed in the title), and partly entertainment.
