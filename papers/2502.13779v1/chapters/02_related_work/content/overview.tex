We provide an overview of related work. We start by discussing human-AI interaction from a high-level perspective. Then, we will discuss control theory in the context of HCI, including, a brief overview of computational user modeling and its role in the control loop. Finally, we focus on two types of interfaces with shared variables, discussing what they are and specific examples of control. First, we discuss haptic interfaces, and secondly, we discuss adaptive user interfaces.
