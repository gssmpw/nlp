\section{Thesis Statement}
% In this thesis, we propose \textbf{\method{} as a computational framework for adaptive UIs}.
% By implicitly considering the closed-loop, iterative nature of HCI, \method{} extends existing AUIs by enabling \textbf{permanent and effective adaptation of input and output mechanisms}.
% % \\ \\
% \noindent
% In three case studies, we have demonstrated that \method{} methods \textbf{improve the usability of emerging technologies} by assisting users in accomplishing their high-level goals.
% We have shown that model predictive control supports users in a challenging creative robotic task.
% In addition, we demonstrated that reinforcement learning can learn individual cooperative policies solely by observing a user's gaze interactions with a UI. 
% Finally, we proposed a cognitively plausible hierarchical reinforcement learner that reproduces human task interleaving, being applicable in various HCI tasks.
