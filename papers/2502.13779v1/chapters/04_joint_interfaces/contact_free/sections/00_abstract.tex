%\remove{In this paper we introduce a novel contact-free volumetric haptic feedback device. A symmetric electromagnet is used in combination with a dipole magnet model and a simple control law to deliver dynamically adjustable forces onto a hand-held tool such as a stylus. The tool can be 3D printed and only requires an embedded permanent magnet and thus can be entirely untethered. The force, however, while contact-free, remains grounded via the spherical electromagnet and hence relatively large forces (1N at a 3cm distance) can be felt by the user. The device is capable of rendering both attractive and repulsive forces in a thin shell. While the hardware is custom-built, it consists only of readily available components and we will release all soft- and hardware designs to foster future research. We report findings from a user experiment with 6 participants, characterizing force delivery aspects and perceived precision of our system. We found that, that our system has resolution of at least 25 user discernable locations, for repelling forces, distributed across the hemisphere. }

%% Problem: 
%%  - wireless hand-tool input devices, like mouses and pointers, does not provide haptic feedback forces; 
%%  - while available haptic manipulators needs a mechanical physic chain to control the movement of a holding tool.
%%  - haptic feedback forces are desired to enhance the user experience of physical virtual objects, 
%% - and to enable new modes of multi modal interaction: similar to the clicking or press-key-down sensations.
%%
%% Our approach:
%%  - System: 
%%      - electromagnet, magnetic forces, 
%%      - spherical symmetry, 3 DoF (novel geometry)
%%      - no moving parts on the actuator side, only the hand-tool
%%      - Easy and affordable to fabricate (significance to haptic community) 
%%       - Off-the-shelf electronics
%%      - self-contained input/output, 
%%      - user-in-the-loop control, 
%%      - Modelling:
%%          - Model of B, force and torque given actuation/current
%%          - Non-linear optimization method for tool position estimation given N hall sensors
%%  - Interactions: 
%%      - desktop input/output tool-based
%%      - tool tracking and force feedback, 
%%      - graspable haptics
%%      - untethered, midair feedback
%%      - hot-swappable, exchangeable tool
%%      - applicable to wearable haptics thimble or gloves in certain actuation volume
%%      - grounded forces even if no mechanical link (magnetic action/reaction forces)
%%      - from DC forces to vibration
%%      - User evaluation (JNDs) for,
%%          - perceived forces, 
%%          - positioning resolution
%%  - Applications envision/validation: 
%%      - haptic/tangible complement to
%%          - Spherical displays
%%          - shape changing interfaces
%%      - Desktop handle input with haptic feedback
%%      - virtual surfaces/volumes in VR/AR
%%      - 3D design
%%      - Education, haptic training
%%      - Teleoperation, medical
%%      - Gaming
%%
%%  Conclusions: 
%%  - our affordable, self-contained haptic device with spherical geometry enable simple yet convincing haptics feedback forces.
%%  - user test shows that our systems enables to distinguish attractor/repulsive points, geometrical shapes 
%%  - we demonstrate few applications as desktop device and in VR.
