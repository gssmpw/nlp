\contribution{
    In this chapter, we present \omniUIST, a self-contained 3D haptic feedback system capable of sensing and actuating an untethered, passive tool containing only a small embedded permanent magnet. \omniUIST overcomes the limitations of \omniHap in two significant ways. First, it eliminates the need for external tracking by utilizing a novel gradient-based method to reconstruct the 3D position of the permanent magnet in midair. This is achieved using measurements from eight off-the-shelf Hall sensors integrated into the base. Second, \omniUIST features an improved 3 DoF spherical electromagnet capable of delivering increased forces due to intertwined coils. The fully integrated \omniUIST system, with no moving parts and no need for external tracking, is easy and affordable to fabricate. We detail \omniUISTâ€™s hardware implementation, our 3D reconstruction algorithm, and provide an in-depth evaluation of its tracking and actuation performance. Finally, we demonstrate its capabilities through a set of interactive usage scenarios.
