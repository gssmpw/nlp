     We formulate online user interface adaptation as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. Our approach comprises a user- and interface agent. The \useragent interacts with an application in order to reach a goal and the \interfaceagent learns to assist it. In the depicted example the \useragent interacts with a Virtual Reality toolbar, while the \interfaceagent assigns relevant items for the \useragent. The \interfaceagent does not know the goal of the \useragent. Crucially, our approach does not rely on labeled offline data or application-specific handcrafted heuristics.}
