First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Otmar Hilliges. He believed in me, despite my unconventional background, and gave me the opportunity to explore this  academic world. Under Otmar's supervision and mentorship, I have grown into the researcher I am today. My PhD journey was a long learning experience, filled with both ups and downs. I am immensely grateful for his patience and trust throughout this process. The weekly one-on-one meetings with him were invaluable to my work, and I only came to appreciate them too late.

I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to my committee. Prof. Christian Holz, who was not only a close collaborator but also stepped in as my thesis supervisor when it became necessary, has my sincere gratitude. I am also deeply thankful to Prof. Antti Oulasvirta, who introduced me to the field of computational interaction and whose opinions I value. Antti ignited my initial passion for HCI and research. Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Roderick Murray-Smith, whose work was instrumental in shaping my understanding of interaction, and who graciously agreed to join my committee despite our limited prior interaction.

Furthermore, I want to thank all the external collaborators who played a part in this journey, including Prof. Daniele Panozzo, Dr. Bernhard Thomaszewski, Dr. Tanya Jonker, and Dr. Kashyap Todi. Their fresh perspectives were always invaluable.

A very special thanks goes to all my colleagues and friends at the AIT Lab. Together, we truly achieved more than we could have as individuals. You ensured that the lab was a place of great times, fun, and an enjoyable atmosphere. I had countless discussions with each of you that shaped my research. I want to specifically thank Dr. Juan Z\'arate for always engaging in conversations about science, magnets, and life. I am also grateful to Sammy Christen for patiently listening to my frustrations and for teaching me about Reinforcement Learning. My thanks also go to Dr. Velko Vechev and Dr. Christoph Gebhardt for their unwavering support, whether it was meeting deadlines, answering HCI-related questions, or help TAing. Marcel Buehler deserves thanks for making the office a great place to be, encouraging me to go bouldering, and for bringing me El Tony or a Fr\"uchtbrotli. I also want to thank Prof. David Lindlbauer for our beer-fueled discussions, his selfless can-do attitude during deadlines, and for enabling me to join the UIST Organization Committee. Finally, I am grateful to Prof. Xucong Zhang, Dr. Emre Aksan, Dr. Manuel Kaufmann, Yufeng Zheng, Prof. Jie Song, Prof. Anna Feit, Alex Fan, Mert Albaba, and all the others in the lab for being part of this journey.

I also want to express my gratitude to my friends for patiently listening to my frequent complaints, helping me switch off from work, and ensuring I stayed grounded in reality. A special thanks goes to my friends back in the Netherlands; I know it’s not always easy to stay in touch with someone who has moved away, and I appreciate the effort they  made. I also want to thank Salma Thalji for always being there, for providing me with pragmatic advice, for teaching me that motivation isn't a requirement to accomplish something, and for her understanding. Meeting you on that New York rooftop during the summer school is a memory I will always cherish.

Last but certainly not least, I want to thank my parents for supporting me in countless ways throughout my studies and for offering (sometimes unsolicited) advice when I needed it, even when I didn’t realize I did.
