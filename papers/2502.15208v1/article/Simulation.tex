\section{Real World Paraphrase Simulation}
Initially, we created a simulation experiment to mimic the real-world application of paraphrasing.
In the real world, new human-written and LLM-paraphrased texts are constantly being added to the internet. The text that LLMs paraphrase can often be content that has already been paraphrased by LLMs, sometimes multiple times, for various reasons.
To simulate this scenario, we started by creating a corpus of 1,000 texts. 
At each step, we paraphrased 100 of those texts and added 100 new texts to the corpus.
We sampled 1,000 texts from each stage of the corpus and calculated the perplexity distribution. 
The results \ref{} indicate that the distribution of the corpus became progressively more concentrated over time.
