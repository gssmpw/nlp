ICESat-2 (IS2) by NASA is an Earth-observing satellite that measures high-resolution surface elevation. The IS2's ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice elevation and freeboard products of 10m-200m segments which aggregated 150 signal photons from the raw ATL03 (geolocated photon) data. These aggregated products can potentially overestimate local sea surface height, thus underestimating the calculations of freeboard (sea ice height above sea surface). 
To achieve a higher resolution of sea surface height and freeboard information, in this work we utilize a 2m window to resample the ATL03 data. Then, we classify these 2m segments into thick sea ice, thin ice, and open water using deep learning methods (Long short-term memory and Multi-layer perceptron models). To obtain labeled training data for our deep learning models, we use segmented Sentinel-2 (S2) multi-spectral imagery overlapping with IS2 tracks in space and time to auto-label IS2 data, followed by some manual corrections in the regions of transition between different ice/water types or cloudy regions. We employ a parallel workflow for this auto-labeling using PySpark to scale, and we achieve 9-fold data loading and 16.25-fold map-reduce speedup. To train our models, we employ a Horovod-based distributed deep-learning workflow on a DGX A100 8 GPU cluster, achieving a 7.25-fold speedup.
Next, we calculate the local sea surface heights based on the open water segments. Finally, we scale the freeboard calculation using the derived local sea level and achieve 8.54-fold data loading and 15.7-fold map-reduce speedup. Compared with the ATL07 (local sea level) and ATL10 (freeboard) data products, our results show higher resolutions and accuracy (96.56\%).

%\textcolor{red}{for now 2m we can have any type of granularity based on the data point density}
%ICESat-2 (IS2) altimetry data (ATL03)  has a very high spatial resolution (11m in footprint along the track and 0.7m spacing). The ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice data products, derived from ATL03 data, of 150 signal photons each, have a reduced spatial resolution of 10-150m for strong beams and 20-400m for weak beams. These lower and irregular spatial resolutions of ATL07 and ATL10  can potentially overestimate local sea surface height, underestimate freeboard, and then ice thickness calculations. Freeboard here is the total freeboard and is the thickness of snow and sea ice protruding above the local sea level.
%To achieve higher resolution of sea surface height and freeboard information, we utilize a fixed  2m window to resample ATL03 data. Then,  we classify these 2m elevation segments into thick sea ice, thin ice, and open water using deep learning techniques. To train the deep learning models, we use segmented Sentinel-2 (S2) multi-spectral imagery overlapping with IS2 tracks in space and time to auto-label IS2 training data. 
%Next, we detect the local sea surface based on the open water segments at a 5km radius. Finally, we calculate freeboard based on the derived local sea level. Compared with the ATL07 (local sea level) and ATL10 (freeboard) data products, our results show higher resolutions and accuracy. We employ distributed deep-learning within a training and map-reduce-based sea surface height and freeboard calculation.

%NASAâ€™s ICESat-2 altimetry data (ATL03)  has a very high spatial resolution (11m in footprint along the track and 0.7m spacing). The ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice data products, derived from ATL03 data, of 150 signal photons each, have a reduced spatial resolution of 10 m to 150 m for strong beams and 20 - 400 m for weak beams. These lower and irregular spatial resolutions of ATL07 and ATL10  can potentially overestimate local sea surface height, underestimate freeboard, and then thickness calculations. Freeboard is the thickness of sea ice protruding above the water level.
%To achieve higher resolution of sea surface height and freeboard information, we utilize a fixed  2 m window to resample ATL03 data. Then,  we classify these 2 m elevation segments into thick sea ice, thin ice, and open water using deep learning techniques (LSTM and MLP). To train the deep learning models, we use auto-labeled the 2-m segments based on overlapped segmented Sentinel-2 imagery. Next, we detect the local sea surface of the open water segments for a 5 km radius sliding window (with a 5 km overlap). Finally, we calculate freeboard based on the derived local sea level. Compared with the ATL07 (local sea level) and ATL10 (freeboard) data products, our results show higher resolutions and higher accuracy. We also employ distributed deep-learning (LSTM and MLP) training and map-reduce-based sea surface height and freeboard calculation to reduce processing time.
