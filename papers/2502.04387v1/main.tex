\begin{abstract}
Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. 
This involves a {\em personalization strategy} (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (\textit{e.g.}, in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (\textit{e.g.}, learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose \method{}, a federated {\em learning-to-personalize} method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, \method{} collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that \method{} largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing a range of existing FL methods.


%%%% VERSION WITHOUT LATEX FOR OPENREVIEW (30 Jan 2025 20:56)
% Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing a range of existing FL methods.

% We consider the problem of {\em learning to personalize} a large-scale deep model driven by Federated Learning (FL). Personalization of deep networks typically amounts to adding parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRAs and fine-tuning them on private client data. Hence, personalization involves a {\em personalization strategy} (PS) such as the choice of the PEFT adapter structures (\textit{e.g.}, in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and hyperparameter choices for fine-tuning (\textit{e.g.}, learning rates). Conventional practice is to define the PS manually, but in this paper we aim to solve it in an FL manner. 
% We specifically focus on PEFT adapter structure learning through FL, more concretely FL-based optimal LoRA rank selection. While most existing rank selection methods are prone to overfitting, especially in low-data regimes, we propose a more reliable and robust approach that collaboratively learns the optimal personalized LoRA ranks for each client from a Bayesian sparse model selection perspective.
% We empirically demonstrate our method complements a range of popular FL methods, largely outperforming existing non-FL and FL personalization baselines on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks.

% \section*{Impact Statement} % doesnt count towards the 8 pages
% This paper presents work whose goal is to address the critical challenges of data heterogeneity and language diversity in federated learning. There are many potential societal consequences as well as threats and attacks that may increase privacy risks, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here as our work is orthogonal to many of the current security measures in place.
