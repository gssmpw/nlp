\begin{tabular}{|c|p{1.5cm}|p{8cm}|p{1.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Id} & \textbf{Rule Name} & \textbf{Constraint Summary} & \textbf{Involved Items} \\
\hline
$r_1$ & xml-path-check & When constructor ``{\tt ClassPathXMLApplicationContext(String configLocation)}'' is called, the provided argument should correspond to an existent XML file in the file system. &XML, code \\
\hline
$r_2$ & bean-class-exists & Java classes mentioned by the {\tt class}-attribute of {\tt <bean>} should exist in the project, unless they are library classes. & XML, code \\
\hline
$r_3$ & constructor-arg-type-field-map & When {\tt <constructor-arg>} is specified as a sub-element of {\tt <bean>}, its {\tt type}-attribute value should match a {constructor parameter}'s type name of the corresponding Java class.&XML, code \\
\hline
$r_4$ & constructor-arg-name-field-map & The {\tt name}-attribute value of {\tt <constructor-arg>} should match a {constructor parameter} name in the corresponding Java class.& XML, code \\
\hline
$r_5$ & constructor-index-out-of-bound & The {\tt index}-attribute value of {<constructor-arg>} should fit into the index boundary of at least one constructor in the corresponding Java file. & XML, code \\
\hline
$r_6$ & method-exists & When a {\tt <bean>} has any of the following attributes configured: {\tt init-method} and {\tt destroy-method}, the attribute values should match the names of methods defined in corresponding Java classes. &XML, code \\
\hline
$r_7$ & property-setter-map & The {\tt name}-attribute values of {\tt <property>} items should map to setter methods' names in the corresponding Java class. For instance, if the {\tt name}-attribute of a {\tt <property>} item is ``{\tt pn}'', then there should be a setter named ``{\tt setPn}'' in the corresponding Java class. & XML, code \\
\hline
$r_{8}$ & runwith-no-parameters & If a Java class has ``{\tt @RunWith(Parameterized.class)}'' annotation, then it should also have a method with ``{\tt @Parameters}'' annotation. & annotation, code\\
\hline
$r_{9}$ & runwith-no-test & If a Java class has ``{\tt @RunWith(Parameterized.class)}'' annotation, then it should also have a method with ``{\tt @Test}'' annotation. & annotation, code\\
\hline
$r_{10}$ & runwith-no-suiteclasses & If a Java class has ``{\tt @RunWith(Suite.class)}'' annotation, then the class should also have ``{  \tt @SuiteClasses}'' annotation. & annotation, code \\
\hline
$r_{11}$ & suiteclasses-no-runwith & If a Java class has ``{\tt @SuiteClasses}'' annotation, then the class should also have ``{\tt @RunWith(Suite.class)}'' annotation. & annotation, code \\
\hline
$r_{12}$ & suiteclasses-no-test & If a Java class is annotated with ``{\tt @SuiteClasses}'' or ``{\tt @Suite.SuiteClasses}'', then the Java class mentioned in the annotation attribute should (1) be decorated with either annotation, or (2) have a method in itself or any ancestor class satisfying any of the following requirement: (i) the method is annotated with {\tt @Test}, (ii) the method name starts with ``{\tt test}'', and (iii) the method name is ``{\tt suite}''. & annotation, code
%Suite classes should either be another Suite class with ``{  @SuiteClasses}'' annotation, or it should have a method with ``{  @Test}'' annotation. & JUnit-annotation 
\\
\hline
$r_{13}$ & testParams-not-iterable & Each Java method with ``{\tt  @Parameters}'' annotation should have an iterable return type (e.g., List). & annotation, code \\
\hline

$r_{14}$ & import-resource-path & When ``{\tt @ImportResource}'' is used and its attribute ``{\tt location}'' is configured, the attribute value should be a valid file path corresponding to an existent XML file in the file system. & XML, annotation \\
\hline

$r_{15}$ & bean-exists & The Spring API ``{\tt ApplicationContext.getBean(String str)}'' searches for a bean by name or by type. 
Search-by-type works when the argument {\tt str} is a Java class name (i.e., ending with ``{\tt .class}''), and the class should be either (1) annotated with ``{\tt @Component}'', ``{\tt @Service}'', ``{\tt @Repository}'', ``{\tt @Controller}'', or ``{\tt @RestController}'', or (2) mentioned by the {\tt class}-attribute of any {\tt <bean>} in XML. 
Search-by-name requires either a Java method annotated with ``{\tt @Bean}'' is named with {\tt str}, or a {\tt <bean>} in XML has its {\tt  id}-attribute value as {\tt str}.& XML, annotation, code \\

\section{Evaluation}\label{se:evaluation}

To assess the usefulness of our approach, we conducted three experiments and explored the following research questions (RQs):

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1}: How effectively can RSL express metadata-usage rules?
\item \textbf{RQ2}: How accurately can \tool detect bugs?
\item \textbf{RQ3}: How effectively does \tool reveal real-world bugs?
\end{itemize}
