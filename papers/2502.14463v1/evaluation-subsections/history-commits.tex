\subsection{Fixed Bugs in History Commits}\label{ss:eval-history}

Instead of checking every single commit in the projects, we applied a filtering. We crawled commits where the commit message has 1) bug or fix or error, and 2) metadata or xml or annotation in it. We also made sure that the commits involved changes in .java or .xml files.
\todo{there are some earlier cases where these filterings were not applied}

As we mentioned in \ref{ss:eval-effect-mecheck}, we found \totalInteresting real bugs from \totalInterestingEAs projects. After also checking the latest version of those repositories for the \totalInteresting bugs, we found out that 7 of them has never been addressed by the developers. The other 18 bugs have been fixed or addressed by the developers in later commits.
