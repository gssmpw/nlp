\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


We introduced a novel sensor fusion method for imaging high-speed dynamic 3D scenes. 
By integrating RGB, depth and event cameras, and a novel sensor fusion splatting method, we are able to efficiently image and reconstruct rapid, complex scenes 
while significantly reducing storage and bandwidth requirements compared to traditional high-speed imaging techniques and sensors.
Our approach demonstrates superior performance under complex and challenging conditions, including low light, low contrast, and fast motion, as validated through both synthetic and real-world experiments.
Leveraging a point-based scene representation, the proposed method supports efficient imaging, modeling, and rendering of dynamic scenes, making it highly suitable for a variety of high-speed imaging and post-production applications.
