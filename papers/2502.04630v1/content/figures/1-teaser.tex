  \caption{\textit{High-speed Imaging with Sensor Fusion Splatting.}
  We propose a method to reconstruct high-speed, deforming 3D scene geometries by integrating data from three complementary imaging modalities---RGB, event, and depth cameras, as shown in (a). 
  Using these inputs, we train a set of deformable Gaussians to dynamically represent the scene. 
  This approach enables detailed, time-resolved reconstructions of the scene in challenging conditions such as low light, high dynamic range or rapid scene motion and from a limited baseline (see (b)), allowing novel view synthesis at any timestamp.
