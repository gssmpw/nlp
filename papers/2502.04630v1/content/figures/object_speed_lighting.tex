    \caption{\textit{Evaluation under Varying Object Speeds and Lighting}. 
    We demonstrate the visual performance of our method under varying object speed and lighting conditions. 
    Our method achieves robust reconstruction quality even in scenarios with very fast motion and challenging lighting conditions, including bright, dark and high-dynamic range illumination.}
