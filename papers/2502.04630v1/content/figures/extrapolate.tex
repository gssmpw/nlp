    \caption{\textit{Evaluating Structural Accuracy}. 
    We present images rendered from a viewpoint outside the training camera positions and a top-down view of the extracted point cloud. 
    Our method accurately positions the red ball and captures its 3D structure, unlike other methods that either misplace it, represent it incompletely, or merge it with the green ball.
