  \caption{\textit{Sensor Fusion Imaging Prototype.} Our sensor fusion system consists of RGB, event and depth cameras providing complementary sensory information. A high-speed deforming object placed on a rotating turntable is imaged by these cameras, as illustrated, and the proposed sensor fusion splatting approach is used for reconstruction. The complementary modality sensors and turntable are calibrated to ensure accurate alignment. \todo{improve time illustration.}}
