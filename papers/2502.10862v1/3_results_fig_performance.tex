    \caption{\textbf{Performance and diversity.} 
    Morphological pretraining (\textbf{A}) converges with 70\% improvement from baseline. 
    Simultaneous co-design (from scratch without pretraining; \textbf{B}) achieves similar training loss; 
    but, population diversity (mean pairwise Hamming distance on genotypes) collapses as evolution converges to a single species of similar designs which simplifies shared control.
    Zero shot evolution (using the pretrained controller; \textbf{C}) rapidly improves test performance, but also suffers diversity collapse as evolution compiles slightly modified clones of the designs that are the most compatible with the pretrained model.
    Few-shot evolution (\textbf{D}) resets the pretrained controller at the start of each generation 
    % (spikes in the training curve) 
    and performs 60 finetuning steps per generation. 
    This significantly increases and sustains diversity as well as performance. 
    Solid lines represent 
    the batch (training; blue)
    or
    population (test; orange) means, 
    averaged across three independent trials.
    Shaded regions surrounding the mean curves show the minimum and maximum values across the three trials.
