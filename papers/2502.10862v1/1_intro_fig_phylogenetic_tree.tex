    % Co-design of body (morphology) and brain (control) using a pretrained universal controller.
    A population of 8192 
    initially random designs (a pair of which are shown in the top row)
    were randomly recombined and mutated to produce 8192 offspring, temporarily expanding the population to 16384 designs.
    All designs in the population were driven by the same universal controller, which was rapidly pretrained (before evolution)
    and finetuned for the current population (at every generation of evolution) using analytical gradients
    from differentiable simulation.
    % , which was lightly finetuned started from the pretrained model at each generation. 
    Deleting the worst performing designs and replacing them with the best offspring, and repeating this process for several generations,
    yields a diversity of increasingly performant designs, and ultimately a final population of 8192 winning designs (bottom row), each with their own unique evolutionary history (phylogeny).
    An example phylogenetic tree, colored by loss (decreasing from gray to cyan to pink), is shown for one of winning designs.
