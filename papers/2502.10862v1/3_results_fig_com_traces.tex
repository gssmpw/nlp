    \caption{\textbf{Evolution of phototaxis.}
    The five worst designs in the population are depicted before (top row) and after (bottom row) zero-shot evolution.
    Each design (black dotted footprints) was placed in the center of a randomly generated map.
    Before evolution,
    not all of designs in the population could
    move (gray to white trajectories)
    across any terrain
    toward a light source (gold stars) using the pretrained controller.
    After evolution, they could.
    One of the design principles that evolution discovered is that larger footprints increase locomotion stability.
