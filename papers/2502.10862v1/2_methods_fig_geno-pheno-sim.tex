    Designs are 
    encoded by voxel genotype (\textbf{A}), 
    which is expressed as a
    spring-mass phenotype (\textbf{B}),
    and evaluated in a
    differentiable environment (\textbf{C}).
    The springs (teal lines in B and C) and masses (small orange spheres) are motorized and sensorized, respectively.
