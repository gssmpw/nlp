    \caption{\textbf{Universal control of differentiable robots.}
    Large-scale pretraining and finetuning
    of a universal controller was achieved by
    averaging simulation gradients across the robot's body, world, and goal.
    The controller is shared by an arbitrarily large and morphologically diverse population of robots as
    they undergo morphological evolution.
    The objective is to find designs that can move quickly across a previously-unseen terrain toward a randomly-positioned light source (glowing white spheres).
