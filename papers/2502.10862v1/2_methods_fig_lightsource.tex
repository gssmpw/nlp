    \caption{\textbf{Phototaxis training and testing.}
    During pretraining, simult.~co-design, and few-shot finetuning,
    training light source locations (gray circles) were sampled uniformly within 
    a circle centered on the robot's initial position (blue square).
    At every learning step,
    a batch of 8192 randomly positioned lights was sampled,
    and each was paired with a unique, random morphology and random terrain.
    Test light source locations (orange stars) 
    were identical across all methods for fair comparison.
