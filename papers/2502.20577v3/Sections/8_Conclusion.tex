\section{Limitations and Conclusion}
Despite achieving superior results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, our method has limitations. Specifically, when the input image is in a cornered pose, the result can sometimes deviate from the desired identity. Additionally, issues with color accuracy can arise under extreme brightness conditions. As our approach utilizes the DECA model, minor deviations in expression can occur due to its estimation limits. 

In this paper, we developed an efficient approach for facial image editing using a novel architecture enhanced by the 3D Fusion Controller, Guidance Network, and Identity Preserver Module. Our method excels in retaining identity and accessories while allowing for fine-tuning with minimal steps. This results in high-fidelity images with accurate attribute editing, demonstrating significant advancements over previous \mbox{methods}.
