Facial appearance editing is crucial for digital avatars, AR/VR, and personalized content creation, driving realistic user experiences. However, preserving identity with generative models is challenging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. Traditional methods often require multiple images and still struggle with unnatural face shifts, inconsistent hair alignment, or excessive smoothing effects. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework, InstaFace, to generate realistic images while preserving identity using only a single image. Central to InstaFace, we introduce an efficient guidance network that harnesses 3D perspectives by integrating multiple 3DMM-based conditionals without introducing additional trainable parameters. Moreover, to ensure maximum identity retention as well as preservation of background, hair, and other contextual features like accessories, we introduce a novel module that utilizes feature embeddings from a facial recognition model and a pre-trained vision-language model. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of identity preservation, photorealism, and effective control of pose, expression, and lighting.

% Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, including DiffusionRig, with a 47\% increase in SSIM for novel pose synthesis and a 32\% reduction in FID for novel expression synthesis.


% Consequently, our approach ensures that even with just a single image, we can achieve realistic reenactment while preserving the individual's identity and maintaining the overall scene consistency. 


% We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that our method achieves better performance in identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing approaches.
