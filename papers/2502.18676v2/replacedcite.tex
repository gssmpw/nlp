\section{Related Work}
% Our vision relates to piror research in Explainable AI (XAI), Mixed-Initiative Interaction, and Feed-Forward Interaction, but introduces a fundamentally new paradigm of a continuously thinking AI in human-AI interaction.

% Explainable AI (XAI) has focused on making AI’s decision-making processes transparent to users, often through post-hoc explanations such as model interpretability techniques ____. However, these explanations are typically static and retrospective, providing insight only after a decision is made. In contrast, we propose Thoughtful AI, where AI’s internal thought processes are continuously evolving and interactively shared with users in real-time.

% Our work is also related to Mixed-Initiative Interaction, where both human and AI agents can take turns leading an interaction based on situational needs ____. While mixed-initiative AI systems, such as intelligent assistants, enable more fluid, adaptive collaborations, they still operate in turn-based modes, intervening only at opportune moments. In contrast, Thoughtful AI introduces a full-duplex model of interaction, where AI and humans think in parallel, continuously iterating on ideas rather than exchanging discrete turns.

% Additionally, Feed-Forward Interaction enables users to see AI-generated previews of possible outcomes before committing to an action ____. While this approach enhances predictability, it does not allow AI to actively refine or evolve its thoughts dynamically over time. Thoughtful AI moves beyond passive previewing by establishing a shared cognitive space, where both AI and human thought processes interact, shape, and refine each other throughout the interaction.

% By integrating continuous AI thought, our work introduces a new paradigm that reimagines AI not as a reactive tool but as an active thought partner.
