\section{Discussion and Future Work} 
We introduced Thoughtful AI with four defining traits---\emph{intermediate medium, full-duplex process, intrinsic driver}, and \emph{shared cognitive space}---but these represent only a starting point. Below, we outline key open questions and possible directions for further exploration.

\paragraph{Are There Additional Traits of Thoughtful AI?}
Although our work has focused on these four traits, there may be additional dimensions of thoughtfulness worth exploring. For instance, what additional traits might emerge in more complex or specialized scenarios?

\paragraph{How Can We Mitigate Potential Downsides?}
An AI that continuously generates intermediate thoughts risks overwhelming users with too much information or frequent interruptions. Further, sharing internal reasoning publicly could raise privacy and security concerns. Research is needed to identify interface designs, privacy safeguards, and policies that mitigate these concerns while preserving the benefits of proactivity and collaboration.

\paragraph{What Are the Best Mechanisms for Simulating Thought?}
Current LLM-based techniques show promise, but other approaches such as symbolic reasoning or neuron-level modeling offer different trade-offs in efficiency, interpretability, and control. Future research might explore how different architectures \emph{represent} and \emph{execute} continuous thought.

\paragraph{How Can Thoughtfulness Be Embedded in AI Architecture and Training?}
Related to the simulation question is how to integrate thoughtful behavior at the architectural and training levels. Current practices often rely on prompting an off-the-shelf LLM for reasoning traces (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). However, more direct ways of embedding thoughtfulness could be promising.


\paragraph{How Might Thoughtful AI Influence Human Thinking?}
If AI continuously generates and shares evolving thoughts, how might this reshape human cognitive processes? Will users offload more cognitive tasks to AI? Alternatively, could exposure to AI's thoughts improve human metacognition by encouraging users to articulate and refine their own thought processes? Additionally, how might this affect creative workflows, decision-making, and critical thinking skills? 


\paragraph{What New Interaction Paradigms Can Emerge from Thoughtful AI?}
Finally, Thoughtful AI has the potential to reshape how users and AI collaborate, moving beyond simple chat interfaces. Exploring these new paradigms will be crucial to realizing AI that \emph{thinks with us}, rather than simply \emph{responding to us}.
