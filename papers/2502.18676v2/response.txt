\section{Related Work}
% Our vision relates to piror research in Explainable AI (XAI), Mixed-Initiative Interaction, and Feed-Forward Interaction, but introduces a fundamentally new paradigm of a continuously thinking AI in human-AI interaction.

% Explainable AI (XAI) has focused on making AIâ€™s decision-making processes transparent to users, often through post-hoc explanations such as model interpretability techniques **Lipton et al., "What's Lost in Translation?** ____**Doshi-Velez et al., "Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning"**

% Our work is also related to Mixed-Initiative Interaction, where both human and AI agents can take turns leading an interaction based on situational needs **Cohen et al., "Mixed-Initiative Interaction"** ____**Schank et al., "Dynamic Memory in Conversation"**

% Additionally, Feed-Forward Interaction enables users to see AI-generated previews of possible outcomes before committing to an action **Horvitz et al., "The Lumiere Project: Bayesian User Modeling for Inferring Watch History from Conceptual and Perceptual Cues"** ____**Lang et al., "Feed Forward Interaction in Human-AI Dialogue Systems"**

% By integrating continuous AI thought, our work introduces a new paradigm that reimagines AI not as a reactive tool but as an active thought partner.
