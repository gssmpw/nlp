\section*{Limitations}

%We claim our concerns as following statements:
Our methods may contains the following limitations:

\paragraph{Dependence on LLMs} Our method relies on advanced large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 for generating logic puzzles and verification functions. If the only accessible LLMs have limited capacity, our method may suffer from a high failure rate in synthesizing the questions. However, as LLMs continue to advance, we expect the effectiveness and reliability of our approach to improve accordingly.
%This dependency could introduce biases inherent to these models into the benchmark, potentially affecting the validity and ability of generalization of the evaluation results.

\paragraph{Verification Function Limitations} Although AutoLogi uses program-based verification to handle multiple valid solutions, this approach does not guarantee that the verification functions are perfect, especially in complex conditions. In our experiment, we still find there is about 3\% of validation results contain errors (Section \ref{sec:analysis}).
