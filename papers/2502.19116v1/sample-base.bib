  abstract = {Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a cross-disciplinary approach to understanding, modeling, and creating intelligence of various forms. It is a critical branch of cognitive science, and its influence is increasingly being felt in other areas, including the humanities. AI applications are transforming the way we interact with each other and with our environment, and work in artificially modeling intelligence is offering new insights into the human mind and revealing new forms mentality can take. This volume of original essays presents the state of the art in AI, surveying the foundations of the discipline, major theories of mental architecture, the principal areas of research, and extensions of AI such as artificial life. With a focus on theory rather than technical and applied issues, the volume will be valuable not only to people working in AI, but also to those in other disciplines wanting an authoritative and up-to-date introduction to the field.},

Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},

Next, we will describe the tests we performed, giving the types of input we presented to the utilities. Results from the tests will follow along with an analysis of the results, including identification and classification of the program bugs that caused the crashes. The final section presents concluding remarks, including suggestions for avoiding the types of problems detected by our study and some commentary on the bugs we found. We include an Appendix with the user manual pages for fuzz and ptyjig.},

abstract = {Sequential decision-making processes (SDPs) are fundamental for complex real-world challenges, such as autonomous driving, robotic control, and traffic management. While recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have led to mature solutions for solving these complex problems, SDMs remain vulnerable to learning unsafe behaviors, posing significant risks in safety-critical applications. However, developing a testing framework for SDMs that can identify a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose CureFuzz, a novel curiosity-driven black-box fuzz testing approach for SDMs. CureFuzz proposes a curiosity mechanism that allows a fuzzer to effectively explore novel and diverse scenarios, leading to improved detection of crash-triggering scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a multi-objective seed selection technique to balance the exploration of novel scenarios and the generation of crash-triggering scenarios, thereby optimizing the fuzzing process. We evaluate CureFuzz on various SDMs and experimental results demonstrate that CureFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a substantial margin in the total number of faults and distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios. We also demonstrate that the crash-triggering scenarios found by CureFuzz can repair SDMs, highlighting CureFuzz as a valuable tool for testing SDMs and optimizing their performance.},

pages = {706-717},
abstract = {Nowadays increasing AI techniques, e.g., reinforcement learning, imitation learning, etc., are applied to solve sequential decision-making problems by modeling them as Markov Decision Process (MDP), and achieve superior performance in areas, such as video games, robotics and autonomous driving etc. The reliability of such models is facing severe challenges especially in some safety-critical areas, where failures would bring intolerable disasters. Existing works testing episodic decision-making models are not workable, since they neglect the nature of sequentiality and interactivity in MDP. While other works testing sequential decision-making models are challenged by low testing efficiency because the interaction of MDP is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an optimized fuzzing framework SeqDivFuzz which infers the sequence diversity during the MDP interaction process to effectively and efficiently test sequential decision-making models in blackbox settings. It adapts the existing fuzzing framework, including Seed Selection, Seed Mutation, Feedback Analysis and integrating a module of Diversity Inference to accelerate the fuzzing procedure. The module learns historical in-process information to check the diversity of test cases when running up to checkPoint in the course of MDP, and early terminating those non-diverse ones. We conduct experimental evaluation with four models involving three simulation environments. The results reflect that SeqDivFuzz exposes 12.3%~49.1% more crashes during a 12-hour testing procedure in four pairs of models and environments compared with the state-of-the-art fuzzing framework. The idea of in-process terminating can potentially boost other techniques for testing sequential decision-making models.},

abstract = {The reliability of decision-making policies is urgently important today as they have established the fundamentals of many critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. To ensure reliability, there have been a number of research efforts on testing decision-making policies that solve Markov decision processes (MDPs). However, due to the deep neural network (DNN)-based inherit and infinite state space, developing scalable and effective testing frameworks for decision-making policies still remains open and challenging. In this paper, we present an effective testing framework for decision-making policies. The framework adopts a generative diffusion model-based test case generator that can easily adapt to different search spaces, ensuring the practicality and validity of test cases. Then, we propose a termination state novelty-based guidance to diversify agent behaviors and improve the test effectiveness. Finally, we evaluate the framework on five widely used benchmarks, including autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and gaming scenarios. The results demonstrate that our approach identifies more diverse and influential failure-triggering test cases compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we employ the detected failure cases to repair the evaluated models, achieving better robustness enhancement compared to the baseline method.},
