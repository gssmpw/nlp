abstract = {Recently it was shown that the problem of Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is efficient and it admits provably sub-linear hashing algorithms. Asymmetric transformations before hashing were the key in solving MIPS which was otherwise hard. In the prior work, the authors use asymmetric transformations which convert the problem of approximate MIPS into the problem of approximate near neighbor search which can be efficiently solved using hashing. In this work, we provide a different transformation which converts the problem of approximate MIPS into the problem of approximate cosine similarity search which can be efficiently solved using signed random projections. Theoretical analysis show that the new scheme is significantly better than the original scheme for MIPS. Experimental evaluations strongly support the theoretical findings.},

abstract = {We consider a partial-feedback variant of the well-studied online PCA problem where a learner attempts to predict a sequence of {\$}d{\$}-dimensional vectors in terms of a quadratic loss, while only having limited feedback about the environment's choices. We focus on a natural notion of bandit feedback where the learner only observes the loss associated with its own prediction. Based on the classical observation that this decision-making problem can be lifted to the space of density matrices, we propose an algorithm that is shown to achieve a regret of {\$}O(d{\^{}}{\{}3/2{\}}\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} after {\$}T{\$} rounds in the worst case. We also prove data-dependent bounds that improve on the basic result when the loss matrices of the environment have bounded rank or the loss of the best action is bounded. One version of our algorithm runs in {\$}O(d){\$} time per trial which massively improves over every previously known online PCA method. We complement these results by a lower bound of {\$}\Omega(d\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}.},

@article{lyall12amasterclass,
abstract = {This paper draws on evaluations of a number of interdisciplinary studentship and fellowship schemes to discuss some of the challenges of developing interdisciplinary research skills in early career researchers. It describes efforts to support such capacity-building in the UK through a series of Interdisciplinary Masterclasses which used workshop-based elicitation techniques to develop smallscale studies in order to synthesise experiential knowledge and foster mutual learning. This has enabled us to build important bridges between research and practice, thereby supporting and developing the interdisciplinary careers of early- and mid-career researchers, as well as research managers and leaders. This paper describes an approach to interdisciplinary capacity-building derived from actual practice. Based on learning from these activities, we offer some suggestions for improved supervision and mentoring of interdisciplinary graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers. If we are to develop effective, future interdisciplinary capacity, we advocate that supervisors/mentors need to focus, not just on the research, but on the particular forms of professional support and mentoring required by inexperienced interdisciplinary researchers in terms of career guidance, the development of publications strategies and network building. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@inproceedings{Combes2017,
abstract = {This paper introduces and addresses a wide class of stochastic bandit problems where the function mapping the arm to the corresponding reward exhibits some known structural properties. Most existing structures (e.g. linear, Lipschitz, unimodal, combinatorial, dueling,⋯) are covered by our framework. We derive an asymptotic instance-specific regret lower bound for these problems, and develop OSSB, an algorithm whose regret matches this fundamental limit. OSSB is not based on the classical principle of "optimism in the face of uncertainty" or on Thompson sampling, and rather aims at matching the minimal exploration rates of sub-optimal arms as characterized in the derivation of the regret lower bound. We illustrate the efficiency of OSSB using numerical experiments in the case of the linear bandit problem and show that OSSB outperforms existing algorithms, including Thompson sampling.},

@article{hazan09efficient,
abstract = {We study online learning in an oblivious changing environment. The standard measure of regret bounds the difference between the cost of the online learner and the best decision in hindsight. Hence, regret minimizing algorithms tend to converge to the static best optimum, clearly a suboptimal behavior in changing environments. On the other hand, various metrics proposed to strengthen regret and allow for more dynamic algorithms produce inefficient algorithms. We propose a different performance met- ric which strengthens the standard met- ric of regret and measures performance with respect to a changing compara- tor. We then describe a series of data- streaming-based reductions which trans- form algorithms for minimizing (standard) regret into adaptive algorithms albeit incurring only poly-logarithmic computational overhead. Using this reduction, we obtain efficient low adaptive-regret algorithms for the problem of online convex optimization. This can be applied to various learning scenarios, i.e. online portfolio selection, for which we describe experimental results showing the advantage of adaptivity.},

@article{kulis09kernelized,
abstract = {Fast retrieval methods are critical for large-scale and data-driven vision applications. Recent work has explored ways to embed high-dimensional features or complex distance functions into a low-dimensional Hamming space where items can be efficiently searched. However, existing methods do not apply for high-dimensional kernelized data when the underlying feature embedding for the kernel is unknown. We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions, making it possible to preserve the algorithm's sub-linear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings, this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks. We validate our technique on several large-scale datasets, and show that it enables accurate and fast performance for example-based object classification, feature matching, and content-based retrieval. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

@article{McMahan2009,
abstract = {Bandit problems are a classic way of formulating exploration versus exploitation tradeoffs. Auer et al. [ACBFS02] introduced the EXP4 algorithm, which explicitly decouples the set of A actions which can be taken in the world from the set of M experts (general strategies for selecting actions) with which we wish to be competitive. Auer et al. show that EXP4 has expected cumulative regret bounded by O(√ T A log M), where T is the total number of rounds. This bound is attractive when the number of actions is small compared to the number of experts, but poor when the situation is reversed. In this paper we introduce a new algo-rithm, similar in spirit to EXP4, which has a bound of O(√ T S log M). The S parameter measures the extent to which expert recommendations agree; we always have S ≤ min {\{}A, M {\}}. We discuss practi-cal applications that arise in the contextual bandits setting, including sponsored search keyword ad-vertising. In these problems, common context means many actions are irrelevant on any given round, and so S {\textless}{\textless} min {\{}A, M {\}}, implying our bounds offer a significant improvement. The key to our new algorithm is a linear-programing-based exploration strategy that is optimal in a certain sense. In addition to proving tighter bounds, we run experiments on real-world data from an on-line advertising problem, and demonstrate that our refined exploration strategy leads to significant improvements over known approaches.},

abstract = {We propose a quantization based approach for fast approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). Each database vector is quantized in multiple subspaces via a set of codebooks, learned directly by minimizing the inner product quantization error. Then, the inner product of a query to a database vector is approximated as the sum of inner products with the subspace quantizers. Different from recently proposed LSH approaches to MIPS, the database vectors and queries do not need to be augmented in a higher dimensional feature space. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, consisting of the concentration results under mild assumptions. Furthermore, if a small sample of example queries is given at the training time, we propose a modified codebook learning procedure which further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on a variety of datasets including those arising from deep neural networks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art.},

@article{Jun2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Institute of Mathematical Statistics. All rights reserved. A key challenge in online learning is that classical algorithms can be slow to adapt to changing environments. Recent studies have proposed “meta” algorithms that convert any online learning algorithm to one that is adaptive to changing environments, where the adaptivity is analyzed in a quantity called the strongly-adaptive regret. This paper describes a new meta algorithm that has a strongly-adaptive regret bound that is a factor of √log(T) better than other algorithms with the same time complexity, where TT is the time horizon. We also extend our algorithm to achieve a first-order (i. e., dependent on the observed losses) strongly-adaptive regret bound for the first time, to our knowledge. At its heart is a new parameter-free algorithm for the learning with expert advice (LEA) problem in which experts sometimes do not output advice for consecutive time steps (i. e., sleeping experts). This algorithm is derived by a reduction from optimal algorithms for the so-called coin betting problem. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both learning with expert advice and metric learning scenarios.},

abstract = {Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving many real-world interactive machine learning problems. Despite multiple recent successes on statistically and computationally efficient methods, the practical behavior of these algorithms is still poorly understood. We leverage the availability of large numbers of supervised learning datasets to compare and empirically optimize contextual bandit algorithms, focusing on practical methods that learn by relying on optimization oracles from supervised learning. We find that a recent method (Foster et al., 2018) using optimism under uncertainty works the best overall. A surprisingly close second is a simple greedy baseline that only explores implicitly through the diversity of contexts, followed by a variant of Online Cover (Agarwal et al., 2014) which tends to be more conservative but robust to problem specification by design. Along the way, we also evaluate and improve several internal components of contextual bandit algorithm design. Overall, this is a thorough study and review of contextual bandit methodology.},

We derive instance specific nonasymptotic and asymptotic lower bounds which generalize those of the IID setting. We analyze the Track-and-Stop strategy, initially proposed for the IID setting, and we prove that asymptotically it is at most a factor of four apart from the lower bound. Our one-parameter Markovian bandit model is based on the notion of an exponential family of stochastic matrices for which we establish many useful properties. For the analysis of the Track-and-Stop strategy we derive a novel concentration inequality for Markov chains that may be of interest in its own right.},

In this paper, we propose a nonadaptive active learning approach on graphs, based on generalization error bound minimization. In particular, we present a data-dependent error bound for a graph-based learn-ing method, namely learning with local and global consistency (LLGC). We show that the empirical transductive Rademacher complexity of the function class for LLGC provides a natural criterion for active learning. The resulting active learning approach is to select a subset of nodes on a graph such that the empirical transductive Rademacher complexity of LLGC is minimized. We propose a simple yet effective sequential optimization algorithm to solve it. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods on graphs.},

abstract = {Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is the basis of many algorithms that use a probabilistic approach to find nearest neighbors.We describe an algorithmfor optimizing the parameters and use of LSH. Prior work ignores these issues or suggests a search for the best parameters. We start with two histograms: one that characterizes the distributions of dis- tances to a point's nearest neighbors and the second that characterizes the distance between a query and any point in the data set. Given a desired performance level (the chance of finding the true nearest neighbor) and a simple computational cost model, we return the LSH parameters that allow an LSH index to meet the performance goal and have the minimum computational cost. We can also use this analysis to connect LSH to deterministic nearest-neighbor algorithms such as k-d trees and thus start to unify the two approaches. KEYWORDS},

abstract = {The generalized linear bandit framework has attracted a lot of attention in recent years by extending the well-understood linear setting and allowing to model richer reward structures. It notably covers the logistic model, widely used when rewards are binary. For logistic bandits, the frequentist regret guarantees of existing algorithms are {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}(\kappa\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}, where {\$}\kappa{\$} is a problem-dependent constant. Unfortunately, {\$}\kappa{\$} can be arbitrarily large as it scales exponentially with the size of the decision set. This may lead to significantly loose regret bounds and poor empirical performance. In this work, we study the logistic bandit with a focus on the prohibitive dependencies introduced by {\$}\kappa{\$}. We propose a new optimistic algorithm based on a finer examination of the non-linearities of the reward function. We show that it enjoys a {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}(\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} regret with no dependency in {\$}\kappa{\$}, but for a second order term. Our analysis is based on a new tail-inequality for self-normalized martingales, of independent interest.},

@inproceedings{jun19bilinear,
abstract = {We introduce the bilinear bandit problem with low-rank structure in which an action takes the form of a pair of arms from two different entity types, and the reward is a bilinear function of the known feature vectors of the arms. The unknown in the problem is a {\$}d{\_}1{\$} by {\$}d{\_}2{\$} matrix {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}\backslashTheta{\}}{\^{}}*{\$} that defines the reward, and has low rank {\$}r \backslashll \backslashmin{\{}d{\_}1,d{\_}2{\}}{\$}. Determination of {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}\backslashTheta{\}}{\^{}}*{\$} with this low-rank structure poses a significant challenge in finding the right exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In this work, we propose a new two-stage algorithm called “Explore-Subspace-Then-Refine” (ESTR). The first stage is an explicit subspace exploration, while the second stage is a linear bandit algorithm called “almost-low-dimensional OFUL” (LowOFUL) that exploits and further refines the estimated subspace via a regularization technique. We show that the regret of ESTR is {\$}\backslashwidetilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}((d{\_}1+d{\_}2){\^{}}{\{}3/2{\}} \backslashsqrt{\{}r T{\}}){\$} where {\$}\backslashwidetilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}{\$} hides logarithmic factors and {\$}T{\$} is the time horizon, which improves upon the regret of {\$}\backslashwidetilde{\{}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}(d{\_}1d{\_}2\backslashsqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$} attained for a na{\"{i}}ve linear bandit reduction. We conjecture that the regret bound of ESTR is unimprovable up to polylogarithmic factors, and our preliminary experiment shows that ESTR outperforms a na{\"{i}}ve linear bandit reduction.},

In this paper, we introduce online convex programming. In online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in F before seeing the cost function for that step. This can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. We introduce an algorithm for this domain, apply it to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of in nitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized in nitesimal gradient ascent (GIGA) is universally consistent.},

abstract = {Copyright 2016 by the authors. We introduce a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in which arms must be sampled in batches, rather than one at a time. This is motivated by applications in social media monitoring and biological experimentation where such batch constraints naturally arise. This paper develops and analyzes algorithms for batch MABs and top arm identification, for both fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. Our main theoretical results show that the batch constraint does not significantly affect the sample complexity of top arm identification compared to unconstrained MAB algorithms. Alternatively, if one views a batch as the fundamental sampling unit, then the results can be interpreted as showing that the sample complexity of batch MABs can be significantly less than traditional MABs. We demonstrate the new batch MAB algorithms with simulations and in two interesting real-world applications: (i) microwell array experiments for identifying genes that are important in virus replication and (ii) finding the most active users in Twitter on a specific topic.},

abstract = {Active and semi-supervised learning are important techniques when labeled data are scarce. We combine the two under a Gaussian random field model. Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The semi-supervised learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, the mean of which is characterized in terms of harmonic functions. Active learning is performed on top of the semisupervised learning scheme by greedily selecting queries from the unlabeled data to minimize the estimated expected classification error (risk); in the case of Gaussian fields the risk is efficiently computed using matrix methods. We present experimental results on synthetic data, handwritten digit recognition, and text classification tasks. The active learning scheme requires a much smaller number of queries to achieve high accuracy compared with random query selection. 1.},

To do this, we first define a generative model for the data using a pairwise Gaussian random field (GRF) which depends on the graph. We show that, under certain conditions, reconstructing a graph signal from a subset of its samples by least squares is equivalent to performing MAP inference on an approximation of this GRF which has a low rank covariance matrix. We then show that a sampling set of given size with the largest associated cut-off frequency, which is optimal from a sampling theoretic point of view, minimizes the worst case predictive covariance of the MAP estimate on the GRF. This interpretation also gives an intuitive explanation for the superior performance of the sampling theoretic approach to active semi-supervised classification.},

We describe a graphical language based on hidden Markov models for defining prediction strategies, and we provide both existing and new models as examples. The models include efficient, parameterless models for switching between the input strategies over time, including a model for the case where switches tend to occur in clusters, and finally a new model for the scenario where the prediction strategies have a known relationship, and where jumps are typically between strongly related ones. This last model is relevant for coding time series data where parameter drift is expected. As theoretical contributions, we introduce an interpolation construction that is useful in the development and analysis of new algorithms, and we establish a new sophisticated lemma for analyzing the individual sequence regret of parameterized models.},

In addition, ever persistent issues are those of scalability to large data sets and the question of kernelizability. We propose a unified approach to Mahalanobis metric learning: an online regularized metric learning algorithm based on the ideas of composite objective mirror descent (comid). The metric learning problem is formulated as a regularized positive semi-definite matrix learning problem, whose update rules can be derived using the comid framework. This approach aims to be scalable, kernelizable, and admissible to many different types of Bregman and loss functions, which allows for the tailoring of several different classes of algorithms. The most novel contribution is the use of the trace norm, which yields a sparse metric in its eigenspectrum, thus simultaneously performing feature selection along with metric learning.},

We show our sample complexity matches the achievable lower bound up to a constant factor in an extreme case. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the methods by simulations based on both synthetic setting and real-world data, in which our method shows vast improvement over existing ones.},

abstract = {Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is the basis of many algorithms that use a probabilistic approach to find nearest neighbors.We describe an algorithmfor optimizing the parameters and use of LSH. Prior work ignores these issues or suggests a search for the best parameters. We start with two histograms: one that characterizes the distributions of dis- tances to a point's nearest neighbors and the second that characterizes the distance between a query and any point in the data set. Given a desired performance level (the chance of finding the true nearest neighbor) and a simple computational cost model, we return the LSH parameters that allow an LSH index to meet the performance goal and have the minimum computational cost. We can also use this analysis to connect LSH to deterministic nearest-neighbor algorithms such as k-d trees and thus start to unify the two approaches. KEYWORDS},

abstract = {We present the first provably sublinear time algorithm for approximate $\backslash$emph{\{}Maximum Inner Product Search{\}} (MIPS). Our proposal is also the first hashing algorithm for searching with (un-normalized) inner product as the underlying similarity measure. Finding hashing schemes for MIPS was considered hard. We formally show that the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS, and then we extend the existing LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on an interesting mathematical phenomenon in which inner products, after independent asymmetric transformations, can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing scheme for MIPS possible. In the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework, we provide an explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. The proposed construction and the extended LSH framework could be of independent theoretical interest. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We evaluate the method, for retrieving inner products, in the collaborative filtering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens datasets.},

abstract = {Active search is a learning paradigm for actively identifying as many members of a given class as possible. A critical target scenario is high-throughput screening for scientific discovery, such as drug or materials discovery. In these settings, specialized instruments can often evaluate multiple points simultaneously; however, all existing work on active search focuses on sequential acquisition. We bridge this gap, addressing batch active search from both the theoretical and practical perspective. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy for this problem, then prove a lower bound on the performance gap between sequential and batch optimal policies: the “cost of parallelization.” We also propose novel, efficient batch policies inspired by state-of-the-art sequential policies, and develop an aggressive pruning technique that can dramatically speed up computation. We conduct thorough experiments on data from three application domains: a citation network, material science, and drug discovery, testing all proposed policies with a wide range of batch sizes. Our results demonstrate that the empirical performance gap matches our theoretical bound, that nonmyopic policies usually significantly outperform myopic alternatives, and that diversity is an important consideration for batch policy design.},

abstract = {We investigate the following data mining problem from Computational Chemistry: From a large data set of compounds, find those that bind to a target molecule in as few iterations of biological testing as possible. In each iteration a comparatively small batch of compounds is screened for binding to the target. We apply active learning techniques for selecting the successive batches. One selection strategy picks unlabeled examples closest to the maximum margin hyperplane. Another produces many weight vectors by running perceptrons over multiple permutations of the data. Each weight vector votes with its ± prediction and we pick the unlabeled examples for which the prediction is most evenly split between + and - . For a third selection strategy note that each unlabeled example bisects the version space of consistent weight vectors. We estimate the volume on both sides of the split by bouncing a billiard through the version space and select unlabeled examples that cause the most even split of the version space. We demonstrate that on two data sets provided by DuPont Pharmaceuticals that all three selection strategies perform comparably well and are much better than selecting random batches for testing.},

abstract = {We address reinforcement learning problems with finite state and action spaces where the underlying MDP has some known structure that could be potentially exploited to minimize the exploration rates of suboptimal (state, action) pairs. For any arbitrary structure, we derive problem-specific regret lower bounds satisfied by any learning algorithm. These lower bounds are made explicit for unstructured MDPs and for those whose transition probabilities and average reward functions are Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. the state and action. For Lipschitz MDPs, the bounds are shown not to scale with the sizes S and A of the state and action spaces, i.e., they are smaller than c log T where T is the time horizon and the constant c only depends on the Lipschitz structure, the span of the bias function, and the minimal action sub-optimality gap. This contrasts with unstructured MDPs where the regret lower bound typically scales as SA log T. We devise DEL (Directed Exploration Learning), an algorithm that matches our regret lower bounds. We further simplify the algorithm for Lipschitz MDPs, and show that the simplified version is still able to efficiently exploit the structure.},

It describes efforts to support such capacity-building in the UK through a series of Interdisciplinary Masterclasses which used workshop-based elicitation techniques to develop smallscale studies in order to synthesise experiential knowledge and foster mutual learning. This has enabled us to build important bridges between research and practice, thereby supporting and developing the interdisciplinary careers of early- and mid-career researchers, as well as research managers and leaders. This paper describes an approach to interdisciplinary capacity-building derived from actual practice. Based on learning from these activities, we offer some suggestions for improved supervision and mentoring of interdisciplinary graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers. If we are to develop effective, future interdisciplinary capacity, we advocate that supervisors/mentors need to focus, not just on the research, but on the particular forms of professional support and mentoring required by inexperienced interdisciplinary researchers in terms of career guidance, the development of publications strategies and network building. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In many information processing tasks, one is often confronted with very high dimensional data. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the meaningful feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering, classification and retrieval. In this paper, we consider the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning scenarios, which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. Based on Laplacian regularized least squares which finds a smooth function on the data manifold and minimizes the empirical loss, we propose two novel feature selection algorithms which aim to minimize the expected prediction error of the regularized regression model. Specifically, we select those features such that the size of the parameter covariance matrix of the regularized regression model is minimized. Motivated from experimental design, we use trace and determinant operators to measure the size of the covariance matrix. Efficient computational schemes are also introduced to solve the corresponding optimization problems. Extensive experimental results over various real-life data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms.},
