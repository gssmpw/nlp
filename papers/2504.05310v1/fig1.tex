\\(a.) On traditional small query set. \hspace{96pt} (b.) On traditional large query set.

\caption{Recall at first 1000 results for \sys{} $t$ parameter values from $t=0.000$ to $t=0.040$ at the interval of $0.005$. Baseline result is at $t=0$ denoted by dot. On ESCI small and large query sets respectively. Robustness of \sys{} is clearly evident across seed size parameter ($t$) values on traditional ESCI product search queries. Further, we also note that BM25 performs the best followed by TAS-B.}
