\label{sec:statement}

In this paper, we demonstrate how pre-training on low-level 4D representations from human video data can benefit robotic action prediction. This suggests that effective pre-training can be achieved without the need for large-scale robotic datasets by bridging the gap between human-centric visual data and robotic applications, unlocking new possibilities for scalable and data-efficient robotics. Finally, we note that this paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% This paper presents research aimed at advancing the field of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics by proposing an innovative approach to pre-training robotic models using 4D representations derived from human video data. By enabling more data-efficient and transferable robotic learning, our work has the potential to improve the deployment of robotic systems across diverse environments, leading to advancements in automation, assistive technologies, and human-robot collaboration.

% However, we recognize that the widespread adoption of such models could introduce ethical considerations, including concerns related to data privacy, potential biases in human-centric training data, and the responsible deployment of autonomous systems in real-world settings. Ensuring that our methods are used in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner is crucial to their ethical application. Future research should address these challenges by incorporating diverse datasets and developing robust evaluation frameworks to mitigate biases and ensure reliability in safety-critical applications.

% Overall, we believe that the societal benefits of our contributions outweigh the potential risks, and we encourage further dialogue within the community to ensure weâ€™re tackling ethical challenges head-on and making the most of its potential.
