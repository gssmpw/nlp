\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

In this work, we have introduced a novel reaction policy that can be applied to two-character boxing interaction generation.
The reaction policy includes a diffusion-based predictor for forecasting the next motion latent, paired with an online motion decoder optimized for the online generation. Our method effectively reduces error accumulation, enables real-time online generation, and can produce extended motion sequences. Additionally, it offers controllability through sparse signals, making it well-suited for online interactive environments.

However, several limitations to our approach should be addressed in future work. First, the current method is primarily designed for interactions between two individuals, and extending it to handle multi-person scenarios remains a challenge. Second, our method does not account for interactions with the environment or objects, which are essential for many real-world applications. Overcoming these limitations will be crucial for making the method more versatile and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.
