\section{Application: Generating Reactive Motion with Sparse Signals}
Introducing sparse control is essential for making our method practical in real-world applications, particularly in VR online interactive environments. In these settings, capturing detailed and dense input data can be challenging due to hardware limitations, computational costs, or user comfort. Sparse control addresses this by allowing the system to generate high-quality motion based on minimal input signals.

To demonstrate that our method is well-suited for VR online interactive environments, we also conducted experiments showing that it can be controlled by sparse signals.
The sparse signals are the head and two-hand positions and rotations relative to the previous frame's agent root coordinate.
To enable the controlling feature, we retrain the reaction policy by adding the sparse signals as conditions to the two transformer models in \Figref{fig:pipeline}. The loss and other training settings remain unchanged.
We evaluate the quality of the generated motion using FID scores, motion jitter, foot sliding, and position and rotation errors to highlight the controllability of our approach.
We compare our method with \blcamdm~\citep{2024_camdm}, an auto-regressive method that generates diverse motions based on control signals. The results, presented in \Tabref{tab:control}, show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline across all evaluated metrics.
We also provide qualitative results in \Figref{fig:sparse} and in the supplementary materials.

        \textbf{Qualitative results of generating reactive motions from sparse signals.} We compare our method with \blcamdm. Our approach successfully generates realistic motion while effectively adhering to the sparse signals (annotated by \red{red dots} in the figures). In contrast, \blcamdm{} struggles to achieve the same level of responsiveness and accuracy, as shown in the \red{red circles}.
