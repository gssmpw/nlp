\section{Alternative Views}
% \jt{I do not get the meaning "Alternative Views" here. Do you mean more facets of data posioning beyond threat, trust and mechnisam??}

While this work presents multi-faceted studies on data poisoning, alternative views also offer valuable insights in exploring the depth of threat-centric data poisoning. One line of research examines the scaling laws of data poisoning in LLMs \citep{bowen2024scaling}, analyzing how model size impacts vulnerability. Another focuses on domain-specific challenges, such as in medical and clinical applications \citep{alber2025medical, das2024exposing}, proposing tailored defenses for these sensitive areas. Additionally, some studies link data poisoning to other threats like jailbreak attacks \citep{rando2023universal}, highlighting its broader implications beyond traditional consequences.

\section{Conclusion}
This position paper argues that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can drive advancements in LLM development. 
% We outline the LLM development lifecycle and highlighting its inherent complexity. Besides, 
We identify fundamental limitations of current threat-centric approaches to data poisoning.
% , which fail to fully address this complexity. To overcome these challenges, we 
and propose three novel perspectives: practical threat-centric, trust-centric, and mechanism-centric data poisoning. 
% We support our position with extensive references and detailed examples.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This study introduces some potential research directions for data poisoning attacks. While some directions, e.g., trust-centric and mechanism-centric data poisoning, have no potential negative impacts, threat-centric data poisoning may lead to negative impacts. However, we believe that the LLMs can be more reliable if researchers can iterate the data poisoning attacks and their defenses to avoid real impacts after the LLMs are deployed in real applications.
