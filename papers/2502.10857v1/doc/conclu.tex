\label{sec:conclu}
Automating EDA flow by interfacing EDA tools via APIs is imperative to enhance efficiency in electronic design processes.
In this study, we first introduce the ChipLlama-powered agent, collaborating with few-shot prompts for EDA flow automation.
Specifically, ChipLlama models are expert LLMs instruction fine-tuned for the EDA flow automation, which achieve the SOTA performance in EDA script generation and demonstrate versatility across different platforms.
Meanwhile, different few-shot CoT prompts can guide LLMs to generate different task planning pathways for divergent thoughts generation.
Building with divergent thoughts generation and decision-making, we present EDAid, a novel multi-agent collaboration system that utilizes multiple agents for EDA tasks.
This system adeptly handles intricate EDA tasks assigned by designers, thereby automating the EDA workflow effectively.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our EDAid.
Moreover, extensive experiments show the significant performance of our ChipLlama models compared to other LLMs in automating the EDA flow.
In conclusion, we anticipate that our work can catalyze the evolution of next-generation EDA tools, inspiring advancements in the field.
