\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduce MaskGWM, the first DiT-based driving world model trained on web-scale datasets with masking strategy during training. By introducing a novel video dual-branch mask reconstruction, our model excels in both numeric metrics on fidelity and generation ability. Additionally, our mask policy also accelerate the training process and read memory consumption. Our extensive experiments showcase \ourmethod\  achieves the state-of-the-art performance on generation quality on nuScene, zero-shot ability on Waymo and long-time prediction ability on OpenDV-2K. These results furtehr indicates that our method can serve as a greate training programs to enable long driving video prediction.
% We introduce MaskGWM, the first DiT-based driving world model trained on web-scale dataset. By introducing a novel video mask reconstruction with spatial branch concentrates on scene context and the temporal branch on motion context, our model excels in both numeric metrics on fidelity and generation ability. Additionally, our mask policy also reduces training speed and memory consumption. Our extensive experiments include generation quality on nuScene, zero-transfer ability on Waymo and long-time prediction ability on OpenDV-2K,  validates the efficacy of our proposed method. Furthermore, our method provide a useful training recipe to enable long driving video prediction, which is demonstrate by state-of-the-art metric on long-horizon rollout and code will be public for future research.
