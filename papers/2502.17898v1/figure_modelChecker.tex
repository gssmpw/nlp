  \caption{\textit{\ours{} Model Checker ---} Pipeline of the model checker described in Section \ref{sec:modelChecker}. The model checker takes in the LLM-generated plan in PRISM language and the set of rules from the previous stage, and then evaluates the plan against these rules. The plan's validity, along with any violated rules, is sent to both the user and the LLM agents to refine future solutions.
