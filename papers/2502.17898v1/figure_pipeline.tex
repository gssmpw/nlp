  \caption{\textit{\ours{} Rule Translator ---} Pipeline of the rule translator described in Section \ref{sec:ruleTranslator}. The translator extracts a set of constraints from the user's initial natural language input that must be adhered to for a correct plan. These constraints are mapped to appropriate LTL properties within the temporal constraint template (Table \ref{fig:template}) for model checking. Using this template, the constraints are converted into LTL and PRISM language for model checking, and then presented back in natural language for user verification.
