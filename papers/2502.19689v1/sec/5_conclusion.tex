\section{Conclusion}\label{sec5}

This paper proposes an effective method for reconstructing the 3D motion of a point based on a monocular camera. First, temporal polynomials are used to represent the point motion as an additional constraint. Ridge estimation is introduced to the least squares estimation system to mitigate the ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions, thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Second, an efficient algorithm is proposed for automatically selecting the optimal order of the temporal polynomials. Third, the geometric relationships among camera motion, target point motion, and the temporal polynomial are analyzed. The \textit{reconstructability} for temporal polynomials is defined to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. Simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate our method achieves high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Especially under limited observation conditions, our method can maintain stable reconstruction results. Future work involves optimizing the UAV's observation trajectory to improve the \textit{reconstructability}.
