\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we introduce the design space for IE from LRDs using LLMs, with challenges of data structuring, model engagement, and output refinement. We consider the design choices within those challenges. We examine the effects of these choices on the overall performance through OFAT and full-factorial exploration of the parameters. Finally, we show that a well-designed general purpose LLM can provide a cost-effective alternative to the the specialized models for IE from LRDs.
