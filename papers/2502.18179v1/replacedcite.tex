\paragraph{IE using LLMs.} Transformer-based models like BERT____, GPT____, and RoBERTa____ have advanced NLP with self-attention and large-scale pretraining but struggle with layout-rich documents (LRDs). To address this, layout-aware and multimodal models have emerged. LayoutLM____ integrates spatial features, with later versions____ and models like GPT-4V____ and Gemini Pro____ enhancing document understanding through multimodal learning. LayoutLLM____ and structural-aware approaches____ further improve extraction accuracy, while end-to-end models like Donut____ bypass OCR for direct document image processing. Additionally, ChatUIE____ adopts a chat-based approach for flexible IE, while ReLayout____ enhances document understanding through layout-aware pretraining, advancing LLMs for real-world use.

\paragraph{Strategies for IE from LRDs.} Graph-based models like GCNs____ and AliGATr____ enhance relation extraction by capturing textual-visual relationships. Reading order is critical; Token Path Prediction (TPP)____ resolves OCR layout ambiguities, while global tagging____ mitigates text ordering issues for better extraction. For structured data, TabbyPDF____ targets table extraction, DocExtractor____ processes forms, and LMDX____ unifies OCR, preprocessing, and postprocessing for document IE. Additionally, XFORMPARSER____ offers a simple yet effective multimodal and multilingual approach for parsing semi-structured forms.

\paragraph{Preprocessing, Chunking, Prompting, Postprocessing, and Evaluation Techniques.} Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting____ enhances reasoning in complex LRD extraction tasks, while diverse prompt-response datasets____ improve LLM robustness. Instruction-finetuned LLMs have also demonstrated effectiveness in domain-specific applications, such as clinical and biomedical tasks, where zero-shot and few-shot learning enable adaptive extraction without extensive fine-tuning____. Postprocessing techniques, including text normalization, entity resolution____, and majority voting____, refine extracted data by correcting OCR and extraction errors for greater accuracy.

Despite advancements, current studies often focus on isolated components rather than evaluating full IE pipelines. Key stages such as OCR, chunking, and postprocessing are frequently assessed independently, leading to an incomplete understanding of their interplay. Our research bridges this gap by systematically evaluating strategies across all pipeline stages to identify optimal configurations for leveraging pre-trained models.
