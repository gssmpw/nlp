    \caption{Overview of the test suite for extracting information from layout-rich documents using LLMs in six stages.
    The process begins with OCR-based text extraction and Markdown conversion with LLM assistance, followed by chunking to manage token limits, experimenting with different chunk sizes. Each chunk is processed to generate a prompt, exploring Few-shot and CoT prompting with varying numbers of examples. These examples consist of a document example and extracted key-value pairs in a structured format, along with a new document and the required task for the LLM. LLMs generate structured JSON outputs, which are then decoded and reconciled. Post-processing involves experimenting data cleaning and entity mapping. Finally, evaluation is conducted using two different evaluation techniques.}
