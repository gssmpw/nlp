\section{Limitations and Future Directions}

Despite its contributions, this benchmark has limitations. While it covers diverse Arabic document types, it lacks full representation of historical manuscripts and low-resource dialects. Future work should expand to include these, along with scanned records from government, academic, and financial institutions.

Another key limitation is in table and chart recognition, where OCR models struggle with structure preservation, header detection, and merged cell parsing. Though our benchmark introduces challenges in these areas, further refinements are needed for robust multimodal OCR capable of jointly processing text, tables, and figures. Future advancements should focus on dataset expansion, novel evaluation metrics, deep learning refinements, and cross-lingual OCR innovations to enhance Arabic VLMs.

%By addressing these challenges, we aim to push the boundaries of Arabic document analysis and ensure that Arabic OCR systems achieve the same level of robustness and accuracy as their English counterparts.
