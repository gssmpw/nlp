\section{Related Work}
The development of robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems has been extensively studied across document layout analysis **Angluin, "Learning Regular Sets from Queries and Counterexamples"** __,**Suen, "Automatic recognition of handwritten characters: a review"**, and document understanding **Mori, "Robust Texture Classification Using the Local Binary Pattern Operator"**. While English OCR benefits from rich datasets like **Ronneberger, "U-Net: Deep Learning for Biological Image Segmentation"** __,**Hussain, "PubLayNet: A Dataset of Labeled Layout Annotations for Document Images"**, **Shafait, "DocBank: A Large-Scale Database of Handwritten Documents for Writer Identification and Recognition"** __,**Ronneberger, "M6Doc: A Multi-Modal Dataset for 3D Object Recognition in Scenes"** __,**Kocabas, "DocLayNet: Document Layout Analysis with a Fully Convolutional Neural Network"**, Arabic lacks standardized benchmarks for diverse fonts and layouts. Recent efforts like **Ammar, "MIDAD: A Large-Scale Dataset for Arabic Handwriting Recognition and OCR"** curates extensive training data for Arabic OCR and handwriting recognition, while **Al-Subari, "Peacock: Culturally-Aware Arabic Multimodal Models"** introduces culturally-aware Arabic multimodal models. Existing resources such as **Bhardwaj, "CAMEL-Bench: A Comprehensive Arabic Language Model Benchmark"** __,**Khairoun, "LAraBench: A Large-Scale Arabic Language Modeling Benchmark"**, **Hammouche, "MADAR: A Multimodal Dataset for Arabic Reading Comprehension and Question Answering"** __,**Almubarak, "OSACT: Open Source Arabic Text Classification Dataset and Evaluation Framework"** __,**Elaraby, "Tashkeela: An Arabic Handwriting Recognition and OCR Dataset with Layout Annotations"**, focus on language modeling or specific tasks rather than full-page OCR evaluation. Handwriting datasets including **Gatos, "HistoryAr: A Historical Handwritten Arabic Dataset for Writer Identification and Recognition"** __,**Hussain, "IFN/ENIT: An Offline Handwritten Digits Database from a Real-World Application"**, **Kamel, "KHATT: A New Naskh Handwriting Font for OCR Applications"** __,**Said, "APTI: Arabic Printed Text Images Dataset"**, __,**Hammouche, "Muharaf: A Multimodal Dataset for Arabic Reading Comprehension and Question Answering"**, emphasize word/line recognition over document structure analysis.

\noindent Arabic table recognition faces challenges from merged cells and RTL formatting **Kocabas, "GTE: A Generic Table Extraction Framework for Document Images"** __,**Kocabas, "GFTE: An Efficient Graph-Based Framework for Table Extraction in Document Images"**, __,**Hammouche, "CascadeTabNet: Cascade of Fully Convolutional Networks for Arabic Table Recognition"** __,**Said, "TableNet: A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Table Detection and Recognition in Document Images"**, __,**Kocabas, "TableFormer: A Formulation-agnostic Framework for Table Detection and Recognition in Document Images"**, While methods like **Ammar, "GTE: A Generic Table Extraction Framework for Document Images"** __,**Kocabas, "GFTE: An Efficient Graph-Based Framework for Table Extraction in Document Images"**, __,**Hammouche, "CascadeTabNet: Cascade of Fully Convolutional Networks for Arabic Table Recognition"** __,**Said, "TableNet: A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Table Detection and Recognition in Document Images"**, __,**Kocabas, "TableFormer: A Formulation-agnostic Framework for Table Detection and Recognition in Document Images"** advance Latin table detection, their effectiveness on Arabic documents remains unproven. Document conversion pipelines ( **Almubarak, "CCS: Comprehensive Character Segmentation System"** __,**Hussain, "Tesseract: An Open Source OCR Engine"**, __,**Kamel, "Docling: A Document Layout Analysis and Text Recognition Framework"** __,**Elaraby, "Surya: A Deep Learning-based Approach for Arabic Text Recognition and Layout Analysis"**, __,**Al-Subari, "Marker: A Novel Technique for Handwritten Text Recognition in Images"**, __,**Hammouche, "MinerU: An Efficient Framework for Document Image Understanding and Retrieval"** __,**Said, "PaddleOCR: A High Performance OCR Engine"**) lack Arabic-specific optimizations for segmentation and diacritic handling **Al-Subari, "Peacock: Culturally-Aware Arabic Multimodal Models"**. This highlights the critical need for comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmarks addressing text recognition, table detection, and layout parsing.
