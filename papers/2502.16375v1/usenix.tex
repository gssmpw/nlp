% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

Our study examines user preferences for onboarding processes (offline vs. online), credential types (e.g., biometrics, government-issued IDs), and issuer types (government vs. private companies). Additionally, we propose design implications, including verification choice facilitation, credential portability, dynamic multi-factor verification, and decentralized issuance standards.}

\subsection*{Abstract}
%Digital identity verification became a foundational trust mechanism in digital ecosystems to protect users from malicious online activities such as scams, phishing, and misinformation. 
%With the rise of AI-powered deception, identity verification systems are increasingly important to distinguish between AI and humans. Personhood credentials (PHCs) emerged as an alternative approach, enabling individuals to verify with digital service providers that they are a person without disclosing additional information. 
%With the rise of AI-powered deception, an identity verification system is increasingly important to distinguish between AI and humans. 
Building on related concepts, like, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), proof-of-personhood, anonymous credentials, personhood credentials (PHCs) emerged as an alternative approach, enabling individuals to verify to digital service providers that they are a person without disclosing additional information.
%Building on related concepts, like, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), proof-of-personhood, anonymous credentials, PHCs can be verified through zero-knowledge- proofs. 
However, new technologies might introduce some friction due to users’ misunderstandings and mismatched expectations. Despite their growing importance, limited research has been done on users’ perceptions and preferences regarding PHCs. To address this gap, we conducted competitive analysis, and semi-structured online user interviews (N=23) to provide concrete design recommendations for PHCs that incorporate user needs, adoption rules, and preferences. Our study (i) surfaces how people reason about unknown privacy and security guarantees of PHCs compared to current verification methods; (ii) presents the impact of several factors on how people would like to onboard and manage PHCs, including, trusted issuers (e.g. gov), ground truth data to issue PHC (e.g biometrics, physical id), and issuance system (e.g. centralized vs decentralized). In a think-aloud conceptual design session, participants recommended conceptualized design, such as periodic biometrics verification, time-bound credentials, visually interactive human-check, and supervision of government for issuance system. We propose actionable designs reflecting users’ preferences.

Despite their growing importance, limited research has been done on users’ perceptions and preferences regarding PHCs.
To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-method analysis, including competitive analysis, and semi-structured online user interviews (N=23) to provide concrete design recommendations for PHCs that incorporate user needs, adoption rules and preferences. Our study (i) surface how people reasons about unknown privacy and security guarantees of PHCs compared to current verification methods; (ii) present the impact of several factors on how people would like to onboard and manage PHC, including, trusted issuers (e.g. gov), ground truth data to issue PHC (e.g biometrics, physical id), and issuance system (e.g. centralized vs decentralized).
%uncovers the challenges and opportunities of PHC covering usability, privacy, and security aspects.Participants expressed different factors that influences their perceptions and preferences of verification methods, such as issuers of such credentials, types of such issuance system, and data needed (e.g., biometric, physical ID, etc) to issue credentials.
