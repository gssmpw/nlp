 \section{Method Overview}
Building on the existing literature, it is clear that while significant progress has been made, a critical gap remains in understanding the key factors required to operationalize personhood credentials that balance privacy, security, and trustworthiness online. This challenge becomes even more pressing with the rise of increasingly advanced AI, which enables bad actors to scale their operations, exacerbating issues such as impersonation, fake identities, and non-human interactions. As outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:method}, our study comprises: (1) a competitive analysis of current verification tools and an analysis of Reddit data to identify challenges. These insights inform the design of a user study aimed at (2) investigating usersâ€™ perceptions (RQ1), identifying factors influencing their preferences for personhood credentials (RQ2), and conceptualizing a design framework (RQ3) to address these challenges.

\section{Formative Understanding of PHCs}

In this section, we outline our formative analysis of existing personhood verification systems, which informed the design rationale for developing our user study(Section~\ref{user-study}).

%\subsection{Competitive Analysis \& Cognitive Walkthrough}
\paragraph{Competitive Analysis.} No prior studies have explored personhood credentials systems' usability and security issues. To address this gap, we systematically consolidated metadata from both practical implementations and state-of-the-art systems, including the World app, BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Gitcoin Passport, and Federated Identities (OAuth). We chose these systems based on their popularity, diversity in platform type (centralized vs. decentralized), and relevance to the domain of digital identity\fixme{add citations of research papers from lit review}. Table~\ref{tab:identity_verification} provides an overview of different attributes of how existing systems operate and their design trade-offs. We found 15 apps categorized into six groups. Five of these were centralized, primarily government-based personhood verification systems. The data requirements for issuing credentials varied, including behavior filters, biometrics (such as face, selfie, iris, or video), social graph and vouching mechanisms, physical ID verification, and, in some cases, combinations of these methods. 

%which helps us conduct a cognitive walkthrough. 

%we analyzed 15 popular systems in terms of their features, such as issuance system (centralized vs decentralized), types of data requirements for issuing credentials, types of  service providers of those systems. 
%Our competitive analysis allowed us to explore and identify multi-criteria to assess aspects such as privacy, usability, and security

\paragraph{Cognitive Walkthough}
For the cognitive walkthrough, we focus 
%on evaluating a system's usability and privacy by simulating 
how a user would navigate and identify potential usability and security issues. Two experts (experts in UI/UX and verification systems, in our case) evaluated if users can successfully use an
application interface and complete core tasks, signing up with the application and receiving the personhood credential. While some apps are proof of concepts or can't have access, such as, Aadhar Card, Estonia's digital ID and China's social credit system, we documented the workflow based on white papers. 
%For evaluating the current verification process of some applications, we have utilized cognitive analysis of UI/UX, data requirement and privacy issue 
%We have selected some popular centralized and decentralized platforms such as World app, Bright ID, Proof of Humanity, Passport Gitcoin, Federated Identities (OAuth), Aadhar Card, Estonia's digital ID and China's social credit system . 
Working as two evaluators, we first independently generated an initial list of evaluation results of those apps while considering the following questions set.
%For cognitive analysis of UI/UX, we have considered a few questions set: 
%\tanusree{from where did we get these questions? My impression was- we are doing cognitive analysis of ui/ux and data requirement, privacy issues, questions here doesn't reflect the goal of cognitive walkthrough}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How intuitive is the registration and verification process for both new and experienced users?
    \item How effectively does the platform provide feedback during different steps of registration and verification?
    \item How do we as users felt regarding the data requirements in the verification systems?
%\end{itemize}
%The following 2 questions have been utilized for data requirement analysis
%\begin{itemize}
    \item What type of data (e.g., personal and biometric, etc) are required for issuing the credentials?
    \item In which stage, are these credentials requested from users? How we as users felt regarding the data requirements in the verification systems
%\end{itemize}
%We have also analyzed the privacy concerns using these 2 questions:
%\begin{itemize}
    \item How does the platform manage users' data to ensure users' privacy and security?
    \item What are the potential risk factors regarding users' privacy in the platform?
\end{itemize}

The competitive analysis aimed to evaluate and compare the verification processes of the \fixme{it should be a total of 15} eight selected verification systems (Table~\ref{tab:identity_verification}).
%The following predefined criteria were utilized to ensure a structured and consistent evaluation of the platforms:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Type of platform
%     \item Free or paid
%     \item Required data
%     \item Stage where data is required
%     \item Centralized or decentralized
%     \item Advantage
%     \item Disadvantage
%     \item UI/UX issue
%     \item Privacy related issue
% \end{itemize}
Throughout this cognitive walkthrough, (a) we conducted a qualitative assessment of the user interface and user experience, focusing on ease of use, clarity, and overall usability; (b) we created test accounts to study and asses the workflow and documented the key steps, required information and potential privacy and security issues.
% We collected data for analysis using the following approach:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item We analyzed the user interface and the user experience qualitatively and focused on ease of use, clarity and usability.
%     \item We created test accounts to study and asses the whole account creation workflow and documented the key steps and required information.
% \end{itemize}
Finally, we structured the data according to aforementioned criteria to highlight notable differences and their implications on usability and privacy.

  %  \item We reviewed official resources such as documentation and privacy policy to evaluate privacy concerns.

\subsection{Results of UI/UX}
\tanusree{Silvia: why do we have only 3 apps in the analysis?Ayae created a list a long ago. please complete the analysis for all the apps from this list}  \tanusree{I am not sure why facebook is in the analysis. we talked about only including verification apps, facebook is not one of them}
\fixme{look at the Suggetsions in comment}
The eight \fixme{15 systems} systems evaluated manifest diverse approaches to user experience, emphasizing accessibility, intuitiveness, and transparency\fixme{write in active sentence or active voice, it reads like chatGPT and reviewer will think the same}. Platforms such as World App and BrightID developed on decentralized technologies, 
%though their intricate verification methods, 
including zero-knowledge proofs\fixme{add citation} and social connections \fixme{add as footnote what social connection means here and citation}, may confuse non-technical users. Proof of Humanity requires video submissions \fixme{what kind of video, is it their face? then talk about privacy, this doesn't seem to be a blockchain issue rather privacy issue}, a process potentially intimidating for individuals less familiar with blockchain platforms. 

In contrast, Federated Identities (OAuth) streamlines login processes via well-known third-party providers\fixme{who is the third-party provider for them}, ensuring ease of use for most users \fixme{is that all? }. 

Government-supported systems like Aadhaar and Estonia e-Card feature structured interfaces but come with limitations: Aadhaarâ€™s biometric registration may challenge rural populations, while Estoniaâ€™s dependence on smart-card hardware might exclude those without the necessary devices. \fixme{add about Japan My Number Card.} 

Passport Gitcoin, focused on Web3 integration, struggles with clarity for users new to decentralized identity concepts. Finally, Chinaâ€™s Social Credit System delivers a seamless yet opaque experience, leaving users uncertain about the data influencing their scores.\par
Data requirements across the systems vary significantly in scope and sensitivity. Decentralized platforms like World App, BrightID, and Proof of Humanity emphasize minimal data collection but still require sensitive information, such as Ethereum addresses, social graphs, or video proofs, to ensure authenticity. Centralized systems, including Aadhaar and Estonia digital ID, require extensive personal and biometric dataâ€”fingerprints and iris scansâ€”to ensure seamless service delivery. Passport Gitcoin, designed for Web3 wallet integration, relies on centralized storage, demanding significant user trust. Federated Identities (OAuth) achieves a balance by sharing limited data through third-party providers but this comes with the risk of overexposure. Chinaâ€™s Social Credit System stands out for its vast data collection, encompassing financial, social, and daily activities, raising alarm over pervasive monitoring and privacy intrusion.\par
Privacy concerns are critical across the eight systems, influenced by their data management practices. Decentralized platforms like World App and BrightID prioritize privacy, yet linking personal data to public blockchainsâ€”as seen in Proof of Humanityâ€”poses inherent risks. Centralized systems like Aadhaar and Estonia e-Card depend on centralized databases, making them vulnerable to surveillance risks. Federated Identities (OAuth) simplifies access but could expose user data to third-party providers without explicit consent. Passport Gitcoin presents privacy challenges because users' information can be shared with third-party service providers. Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s Social Credit System exemplifies extreme privacy erosion, extensively monitoring citizen behavior with minimal transparency about data use. Striking a balance between privacy and functionality remains a universal challenge for all these systems.

\fixme{citations to be added} We have evaluated 15 systems to present diverse approaches to user experience, emphasizing usability, accessibility, intuitiveness and transparency.
\fixme{citation didn't work} CAPTCHA\cite{Captcha} and reCAPTCHA\cite{reCaptcha} are 2 common human verification tools used across many websites. While CAPTCHAs add an additional step for users when they are trying to access a website, reCAPTCHAS come into play by removing any external verification. Rather, reCAPTCHAs track users' activities which has raised privacy concerns as there is lack of transparency between user and reCAPTCHA authority. Users are not sure how the tracking data will be used. Platforms such as World app\cite{WorldWhitepaper} and Bright ID\cite{BrightID} are developed on decentralized technologies which include zero-knowledge proofs but do not present a clear and concise terms and conditions and privacy policy, which may create reluctance for new users to start using them. In figure 1(a), the on-boarding screen of World App appears with a consent checkbox to obtain explicit consent from the users that they agree to the "Terms and Conditions" and acknowledge the "Privacy Notice" of World App. But the terms and conditions and privacy notice are not mentioned in the same screen, tapping on the link buttons redirects users to a different screen, thus creating an obstacle in their user journey. If the necessary terms and conditions were presented clearly and concisely on the on-boarding screen, it would have informed users about the app's policies and ensure a smoother user journey. 1(b) represents the Bright ID license agreement, but it is too long to read. Users may not have enough patience to go through the details as it is time consuming and tap the agree button to continue. But this action may create privacy risks as users don't know what type of access they are providing to the application.

Proof of Humanity\cite{PoH}\cite{PoHexplainer} offers a unique approach to verification with a social identification system. But the verification process requires users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet which will be publicly linked to users' account. Thus, users' wallet holdings and transaction history will be linked to users' identity which users may not prefer. In contrast, Federated Identities OAuth\cite{OAuth} provides streamlined login process via well known third-party service provides, also known as identity providers such as Google, Facebook etc. It ensures ease of use as users need to specify the identity provider during the login or authentication process and grant access to their specific data. But, data is shared across multiple platform which may raise privacy concerns among users. DECO\cite{zhang2020deco} and CanDID\cite{maram2021candid} are decentralized and privacy preserving oracle protocols where DECO allows users to prove the authenticity of website data obtained over TLS (Transport Layer Security) without revealing sensitive information. But Oracle has access to users' data which pose as a privacy risk. CanDID provides users with control of their own credentials but privacy depends on the honesty and integrity of verifiers and decentralized identity validators. Idena\cite{idenaWhitepaper}, Humanode\cite{Humanode} and Civic Pass\cite{CivicPass} - all are blockchain based person identification system where Idena performs validation by conducting flip tests and Humanode and Civic Pass are developed on crypto-biometric network. Though Idena does not collect any personally identifiable information, the behavioral data collected can be used in future for pattern analysis. Humanode and Civic pass both require biometric verification (face scan) which can create concerns among users about how their sensitive credential (face) will be managed by the systems. It is noteworthy that, most of the platforms are decentralized (World App, Bright ID, Proof of Humanity, Idena, Humanode, Civic), some requiring cryptocurrency wallet (Proof of Humanity, Civic Pass) and some requiring biometric verification (Proof of Humanity, Humanode, Civic Pass).    %citations to be added
\par
Government issued identity documents such as Aadhaar Card, Estonia's e-ID, China's social credit system and Japan's My Number Card are controlled and managed by central government. Citizens' sensitive credential can be at high risk if the government's security system is not robust enough to prevent any kind of hacking or data breaching. China's social credit system monitors citizen data extensively without maintaining complete transparency about data use and management. ID.me is another online identity network that enables individuals to verify their legal identity digitally. But privacy concerns arises as a single company holds a large amount of personal data and users have limited control over their data. %citations to be added
\par
Usability across these different platforms are critical. CAPTCHAs have become increasingly difficult to solve, often leading users to leave the website or platform without completing their user journey. Accessibility remains another issue as visually impaired users are unable to solve any CAPTCHA that is text or image based. reCAPTCHA comes with the solution of these problems but trading of users' privacy as users' data is being tracked down by the authority. From Figure 3 and 4, it is apparent that World app and Bright ID provide a simple and intuitive account creation form but an introductory video or step by step guide would be more helpful to guide users to navigate throughout the applications and perform necessary actions.
 \begin{figure}
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Fig/world app account creation.png}
 	\caption{World App's account creation process is simple but doesn't inform users about how they should navigate or use the app \fixme{silvia, is there a reason you added all these UIs? why all of the uis are randomly placed, I shared examples so many times, i am not seeing anything I gave instruction.}}

 \label{fig:Bright ID's on-boarding process}
 \end{figure}
The principle of error prevention could make the user journey of registration in Proof of Humanity more user-friendly. As there is no option to correct or update any mistake, it may increase user frustration. Idena's validation test (flip test) (Figure 4) can be inconvenient for new users as they may struggle to find the meaningful story in the provided time and collect points to validate them.
 \begin{figure}
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Fig/idena.png}
 	\caption{Idena validation test interface requiring users to select meaningful stories within a time limit which can be challenging for new users \fixme{anyone reading this caption would not understand anything}}
    
 \label{fig:Selecting meaningful story for validation process on Idena}
 \end{figure}
The platforms requiring video selfie or face scan (Proof of Humanity, Humanode, Civic Pass) may create another challenging situation for users as proper lighting and optimal devices are necessary for taking the appropriate photo or video for biometric verification. Aadhaar card\cite{Aadhaar}\cite{AadhaarEnrollment}, Estonia's e-ID and Japan's My Number Card are all government based credentials but completing all the formalities and getting the card takes a long time, sometimes creating user frustration. The existing systems and platforms that we have evaluated can hardly strike a balance between privacy, functionality and usability.   %citations to be added

\subsection{Reddit Analysis}
%\tanusree{ishan to add}
We first collected \fixme{X} posts and  \fixme{X} comments on December 24th, 2024, using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)~\footnote{https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}. We gathered the data from various relevant subreddits, ensuring a broad and comprehensive understanding of what users discuss on identify verification or personhood verification. Through qualitative analysis of this Reddit data, we were able to uncover detailed insights into the rich and prevalent usage of verification systems. This analysis highlighted users' current usage, potential challenges and risks they encounter. These findings provide a solid foundation to explore these themes further in subsequent in-depth interviews.

\paragraph{Data Collection}
 To comprehensively cover content related to our research questions on personhood verification, we first created a list of search keywords by identifying close terminologies related to \textit{``personhood verification''} (general keywords) and \textit{``bot check''} (technology-focused keywords), etc. We utilized a combination of general and technology-focused keywords in our search. We employed general terms such as Personhood Verification, Identity Proof, Human Check and Bot Check. These keywords were designed to capture posts authored by or discussing personhood verification. For the technology focus, we used terms such as \fixme{add}. These keywords targeted discussions specifically about the use of popular tools and platforms. We conducted open searches combining these keywords across Reddit to gather data from various subreddits.
 Other than open searches, we also applied specific criteria to select subreddits, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant discussions: these subreddits should focus either on the personhood verification community or technology. We chose subreddits with the most active users online during our browsing sessions. The full list of subreddits and search keywords used is detailed in Table\fixme{need to find out the subreddit most prevalent discussing these topic}. 

\paragraph{Analysis}
Two researchers reviewed each post and categorized related posts or comments into five overarching high-level themes: \fixme{need to add after data analysis}. Within these categories, 53 level-2 themes were identified, such as \fixme{need to add after data analysis}. During the analysis process, researchers regularly convene to discuss discrepancies and emerging themes in the codebook, aiming to reach a consensus. These categories allowed us to investigate RQ2 and partially address RQ1.

\section{ User Study Method}
\label{user-study}
This section outlines the method for exploring users' perceptions and preferences of personhood credentials. We conducted semi-structured interviews with \fixme{21} participants from the US, the EU/UK in October 2024.
%We started with a round of pilot studies (n=5) to validate the interview protocol. Based on the findings of pilot studies, we revised the interview protocol and conducted the final round of interviews (n=17). 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

\subsection{Participant Recruitment}
We recruited participants through (1) social media posts, (2) online crowdsourcing platforms, including CloudResearch and Prolific. Respondents were invited to our study if they met the selection criteria: a) 18 years or older and b) living in the US or the EU/UK. Participation was voluntary, and participants were allowed to quit anytime. Each participant received a \$20 Amazon e-gift card upon completing an hour-and-a-half interview.

\subsection{Participants}
We interviewed \fixme{21} participants, 9 from the US and 12 from the EU/UK. The majority of the participants (70\%) were in the age range of 25-34, followed by 17\% were 35-44 years old. The participants were from the United States and various countries, namely Spain, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Participants had different backgrounds of education levels, with 82\% of participants holding a Bachelorâ€™s degree and 64\% holding a graduate degree. 64\% of participants had CS background, while 52\% of them had a technology background. All participants reported using online services that required them to verify their identity. Table~\ref{table:demographics} presents the demographics of our participants. We refer to participants as P1,. . . ,21.



\subsection{Semi-Structured Interview Procedure} \label{sec:study_protocol}
%\fixme{explain in details why the study designed in a certain way. please read papers to learn more. data minimization and advertisement paper. The method section is too bland. We have a wonderful study design. Scenario-specific study design, describe scenarios and why chose this scenario. Mainly method should include all design rationale, and example questions when necessary to clarify your rational}

We started with a round of pilot (Appendix~\ref{pilot}) studies (n=5) to validate the interview protocol. Based on the findings of pilot studies, we revised the interview protocol

\textbf{Open Ended Discussion.} We designed the interview script based on our research questions outlined in the introduction section~\ref{sec:introduction}. We added the interview script to the supplementary materials. At the beginning of the study, we received the participantsâ€™ consent to conduct the study. Once they agreed, we proceeded with a semi-structured interview. The study protocol was structured according to the following sections: (1) Current practices regarding digital identity verification; (2) Prior understanding of PHC; (3) Watching an educational video on PHC and post understanding of PHC (4) Scenario-based session to investigate users' perceptions of PHC; (5) Design session to explore users' preferences and design implications; (6) Post-survey.

In the first section, We first asked a set of questions to understand participants' current practices of online platforms they often use and the types of identity verification methods they had experience with. This is to understand their familiarity with different types of verification, such as biometrics, physical IDs, etc, and methods that might have worked well based on their prior experience.
%of online identity verification. When participants mentioned certain types of online services that required identity verification, we inquired about their experience with verification method. Was it easy to use, or did you run into any issues?"} We further inquired about any challenges participants faced with identity verification - \textit{"Did you encounter any challenges when using this method?"} 
%If biometrics didnâ€™t naturally come up in prior discussions, we prompted to consider them- \textit{"Have you ever used services where you had to verify yourself through face, fingerprints, or iris scans, or other biometrics?"} If they mentioned any experience with biometric verification, we followed up with questions like- \textit{"What worked well? Were there any concerns you had?"}
We then asked about participants' current understanding of personhood credentials either from prior knowledge or from intuition by just hearing the word, for instance, we asked-\textit{``Do you know the term 'Personhood Credentials'?  Can you explain what it means by just hearing the term?''} We also asked if they knew how personhood credentials work, particularly how it has been handled by the different services they use. In the pilot interviews, The majority of the participants could not provide substantial responses on their understanding 
of how personhood credentials work, before starting the second part of the interview, we showed them an informational video on personhood credentials.
%Most of the participants were unfamiliar with this term, so we then asked \textit{ Can you explain what you think it means by just hearing the term?"} 
%Before proceeding with the third section of the interview, we assessed participants' understanding of PHC with knowledge questions.
We showed them an introduction video on PHC. The video provides an overview of PHCs, covering their definition, the steps involved in issuing and using them, and implications of it online services. Based on the discussion of former literature\cite{adler2024personhood}, we designed the video with clear, easy-to-understand visuals and audio to make the concepts accessible to users. We created a survey to assess participants' understanding of PHC before and after showing the video, including, the same knowledge questions. We also asked some open-ended questions to evaluate whether our introduction video helped participants better understand PHC \textit{''How would you explain your understanding of personhood credentials?''} 
%We further asked what benefits and concerns came to mind for them.

In the second section, we focused on scenario-based discussions, exploring specific applications of PHC to understand participants' perceptions and identify ways to improve PHC design for various services. We examined the following six scenarios: (1) Financial service, (2) Healthcare service, (3) Social Media, (4) LLM applications, (5) Government Portal, and (6) Employment Background Check.
We covered a wide range of use cases of online identity verification via these six scenarios since they encompass diverse user needs, security levels, and privacy requirements. \fixme{please see the comment with iffalse tag and make it concise, we talked about it before}
\iffalse
Firstly, financial system is a critical scenario for identity verification where high level of security protections are expected as exemplified by KYC. Thus, such services continue to develop transformative digital identity verification to ensure the security and integrity of financial transactions\cite{parate2023digital}. The second scenario is healthcare systems, which also have high privacy requirements due to the confidentiality of medical data. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of online healthcare services and in response to this digital transformation, the recent study has proposed blockchain-based decentralized identity management systems \cite{javed2021health}. Thirdly, we consider the scenario of social media, which faces the critical challenges of online identity as shown in spreading misinformation and harmful content from fake or anonymous accounts \cite{ceylan2023sharing}. The fourth scenario is designed with a specific context of interacting with Large language models (LLMs). The former study discussed vulnerability in dialog-based systems where adversaries can exploit the training process to introduce toxicity into responses \cite{weeks2023first}. Thus, such vulnerabilities indicate identity verification may also be important for LLM applications. Fifth, government services are familiar situations that require people to verify their identity. Various countries have developed their own electronic ID schemes \cite{stalla2018gdpr}. Lastly, we also cover the scenario of employment background checks needing precise identity verification to ensure the reliability of applicants. The current background check system involves vulnerable processes that increase the risk of identity theft and unauthorized data access.\cite{blowers2013national}. Such challenges underline the relevance of PHCs, which can mitigate risks by providing a secure framework for verification.

We have also incorporated various types of credentials for each scenario to maintain diversity in our discussion with participants as shown in \ref{table:scenario}. For instance,
%we  We have multiple existing verification methods, including 
humanness verification (e.g., selfie, video call), document-based verification (e.g., government-issued ID), and biometrics information. We selected types of credentials for each scenario based on former literature and existing PHC as explained in the section \ref{subsec:verification_practice}. %\fixme{cite worldcoin, and other app and literature}. \fixme{from here to end of this paragraph ---These needs to go to the literature review section on the current usecase of PHC.

%% Let me find the former literature to explain why we select these credentials
For each of the six scenarios, we explored participants' perceptions of using PHC in hypothetical situations that align with the research focus as well as to help participants can relate PHC concepts to real-world applications. This is particularly useful for this study where where user perceptions and expectation under specific conditions are crucial to devising solutions \cite{carroll2003making}.

We asked about their feelings, perceived benefit and risks. We also nudge them to think about any privacy and security perception around using PHC and types of data (e.g., iris, face, government id, etc )involved in issuing PHC. 
%began by asking \textit{"How did you feel about using PHC to verify your identity when opening your bank account?"} To dive deeper, we also asked about potential benefits:\textit{"What potential benefits do you see in using PHC in this online banking context?"}. We also inquired about these aspects- \textit{"Do you think using PHC improves the security of your bank account? Why?", "Did this method of identity verification make you feel more confident about your privacy? why?"} Additionally, we discussed their comfort levels for providing credentials (e.g., Government-issued ID, biometric information) and asked about any concerns about data collection-\textit{"Were you comfortable providing your government-issued ID and using facial recognition? Why?"}

%\textbf{Design Session.}
%\fixme{need to explain how and why you design the design session, where you designed, how participants were unstructured and so on.} \ayae{reflected in the following paragraph}

In third section, we investigated participants' preferences for PHC in context of who issue PHC, and what types of data are needed to issue PHC to address RQ2. First. we asked about the preferred types of credentials and the preferred stakeholders to issue and manage their PHC- \textit{``What types of credential would you prefer to use as personhood verification? ; Which organizations or stakeholders would you prefer to issue and manage your PHC?''} However, these questions alone can only find optimal ways within the scope of currently existing options and cannot generate new design implications. Therefore, we instructed participants to brainstorm solutions by sketching their ideas on Zoom whiteboard or pen and paper, using a think-aloud protocol. Nevertheless, it is difficult to develop new ideas from scratch, so we shared sketch notes to kick off the sketch session when necessary, as shown in \ref{fig:sketchnote}. By arranging the components that constitute the architecture of PHCs on the left side, we lowered the barrier to sketching. Additionally, we described the main issues or concerns that the participants identified during the interview at the top of the sketch notes. Participants can develop their ideas at the center of the whiteboard by locating the above components or creating new shapes, lines, or text boxes for their sketches. 

Lastly, we introduced the decentralized PHC system architecture with another instructional video. The rationale for why we introduced it after the sketch session is that participants may organically come up with the idea of decentralized systems on their own, and we intended to avoid priming them. Then, we asked them to explain their understanding of the decentralized PHC and preferred issuance system (centralized or decentralized)- \textit{"Would you prefer to get multiple PHCs from different issuers depending on the situation or application you're using, or would you rather have a single PHC from one issuer?"}

\textbf{Post-Survey.}
%%\fixme{need to explain how and why you design the design session, where you designed, how participants were unstructured and so on.}
For the closing of our interviews, we conducted a post-survey to understand their PHC preference quantitatively. It included questions about credential preference, issuer preference, and issuance system preference for the same scenarios (e.g., financial, medical, etc) we considered in section 2 in our interview.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Once we got permission from the participants, we obtained interview data through the audio recording and transcription on Zoom. We analyzed these transcribed scripts through thematic analysis \cite{Braun2012-sz, Fereday2006-yv}. Firstly, all of the pilot interview data was coded by two researchers independently. Then, we compared and developed new codes until we got a consistent codebook. Following this, both coders coded 20\% of the interview data of the main study. We finalized the codebook by discussing the coding to reach agreements. Lastly, we divided the remaining data and coded them. After both researchers completed coding for all interviews, they cross-checked each otherâ€™s coded transcripts and found no inconsistencies. Lower-level codes were then grouped into sub-themes, from which main themes were identified. Lastly, these codes were organized into broader categories. Our inter-coder reliability (0.90) indicated a reasonable agreement between the researchers.
