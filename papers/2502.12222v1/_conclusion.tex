\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In conclusion, experimental results showed that IMPACTX is able to include XAI strategies into the ML pipeline positevely affecting the performance. Furthermore, IMPACTX computes valid explanations for its outputs at inference time, without relying on external XAI methods after the inference process. In particular, the experimental assessment shows the  effectiveness of the incorporated latent explanation predictor $LEP$ in extracting useful knowledge. This knowledge can be used both to the ML task and to provide explanations about the model's outputs. It's noteworthy that $LEP$ is constructed based on explanations related to true classes extracted by a specific XAI method from the training set where the model was trained, while the decoder $D$ is able to provide useful explanations regarding the model outputs. As future research, it could be valuable to explore the impact of this approach by employing different XAI methods, architectures, and datasets than those used to train the IMPACTX framework.  Furthermore, in this study IMPACTX was trained using the two-stage training approach described in sec. \ref{sec:training}, and this choice was primarily driven by computational resource constraints. Thus, it may be interesting in future work to compare two-stage training with single-stage training. 
Finally, we note that the qualitative analysis of the IMPACTX attribution maps seems to indicate that the ML system, together with its reliability in explaining the model decisions confirmed by the MoRF curves, tends to focus on aspects similar to those that could be obtained by human attention when making decisions. 
Although this aspect should be better investigated in future work, this possible alignment suggests that the model has effectively learned to prioritise features that are inherently relevant to the task, similar to how a human would approach the same task. Notably, it seems that such a human-like focus not only enhances the interpretability of the model's decisions, but also contributes to improved performance in performing the ML tasks, as shown in sec. \ref{sec:res}.
