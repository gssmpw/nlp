\section{Limitations} \label{sec:limitation}

This work primarily focuses on commonly studied domains involving single-agent scenarios, such as robotics, household tasks, and computer-based tasks. We acknowledge that LLM planning is also applied in other areas, including the natural sciences \cite{o2023bioplanner, liu2024multimodal}, the Internet of Things \cite{cui2024llmind}, and multi-agent scenarios. However, these studies follow similar methodologies and evaluations, suggesting our survey's comprehensiveness. We focus on six commonly used performance criteria and exclude others, such as security and personalization, due to limited research in these areas. Instead, we discuss them in our future directions section.
