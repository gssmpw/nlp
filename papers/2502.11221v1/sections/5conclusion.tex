\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In our survey, we explore the landscape of modern LLM planners, proposing key performance criteria and discussing evaluation challenges. Our proposed criteria offer a structured approach to assess LLM planners across diverse domains. By systematically analyzing existing systems, datasets, and evaluation strategies, we aim to provide a foundation for future research in this space. We encourage researchers to build on our findings to create robust, highly adaptable, and efficient LLM planners.
