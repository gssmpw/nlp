	abstract = {Insider threat detection has become a paramount concern in modern times where organizations strive to safeguard their sensitive information and critical assets from malicious actions by individuals with privileged access. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of insider threat detection, highlighting its significance in the current landscape of cybersecurity. The review encompasses a broad spectrum of methodologies and techniques, with a particular focus on classical machine-learning approaches and their limitations in effectively addressing the intricacies of insider threats. Furthermore, the survey explores the utilization of modern deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) based methods as promising alternatives, shedding light on their advantages over traditional methods. The comprehensive analysis of results from experiments utilizing NLP and large language models to detect malicious insider threats on the CMU CERT dataset reveals promising insights. Studies surveyed in this paper indicate that these advanced techniques demonstrate notable efficacy in identifying suspicious activities and anomalous behaviors associated with insider threats within organizational systems. Additionally, the survey underscores the potential of NLP and large language model-based approaches, which can enhance threat detection by deciphering textual and contextual information. In the conclusion section, the paper offers valuable insights into the future directions of insider threat detection. It advocates for the integration of more sophisticated time-series-based techniques, recognizing the importance of temporal patterns in insider threat behaviors. These recommendations reflect the evolving nature of insider threats and emphasize the need for proactive, data-driven strategies to safeguard organizations against internal security breaches. In conclusion, this survey not only underscores the urgency of addressing insider threats but also provides a roadmap for the adoption of advanced methodologies to enhance detection and mitigation capabilities in contemporary cybersecurity paradigms.},

	abstract = {The growth of edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing have been accompanied by new security issues evolving in the information security infrastructure. Recent studies suggest that the cost of insider attacks is higher than the external threats, making it an essential aspect of information security for organizations. Efﬁcient insider threat detection requires stateof-the-art Artiﬁcial Intelligence models and utility. Although signiﬁcant have been made to detect insider threats for more than a decade, there are many limitations, including a lack of real data, low accuracy, and a relatively low false alarm, which are major concerns needing further investigation. In this paper, an attempt to fulﬁll these gaps by detecting insider threats with the novelties of the present investigation ﬁrst developed two deep learning hybrid LSTM models integrated with Google's Word2vec LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) GLoVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) LSTM. Secondly, the performance of two hybrid DL models was compared with the state-of-the-art ML models such as XGBoost, AdaBoost, RF (Random Forest), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) and LR (Logistics Regression). Thirdly, the present investigation bridges the gaps of using a real dataset, high accuracy, and signiﬁcantly lower false alarm rate. It was found that ML-based models outperformed the DL-based ones. The results were evaluated based on earlier studies and deemed efﬁcient at detecting insider threats using the real dataset.},

Traditional approaches to handling vast and complex climate data often create barriers due to the need for specialized expertise. Our framework, based on the GPTs platform from OpenAI, overcomes this challenge by enabling users without technical knowledge to easily access and interpret climate datasets and simulations. Through natural language interaction, stakeholders can engage with data and explore various policy scenarios effectively. This approach not only simplifies the decision-making process but also opens doors for a wider range of stakeholders to contribute to policy development and strategic planning in the public sector.

This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.},

User behavior analysis is the mainstream method of insider threat detection, but due to the lack of ﬁne-grained detection and the inability to effectively capture the behavior patterns of individual users, the accuracy and precision of detection are insufﬁcient. To solve this problem, this paper designs an insider threat detection method based on user historical behavior and attention mechanism, including using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to extract user behavior sequence information, using Attention-based on user history behavior (ABUHB) learns the differences between different user behaviors, uses Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to learn the evolution of different user behavior patterns, and ﬁnally realizes ﬁne-grained user abnormal behavior detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, experiments are conducted on the CMU-CERT Insider Threat Dataset. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of this method is 3.1\% to 6.3\% higher than that of other comparative model methods, and it can detect insider threats in different user behaviors with ﬁne granularity.},

There are still substantial problems despite the fact that insider threats are harder to identify. The goal of this research is to assess and identify insider threats using a machine learning (ML) technique. The goal of this research is to identify potential insider threats by continuous learning of their behaviors. The initial step is to gather and prepare the insider dataset. The data is first preprocessed to create smaller, more manageable chunks, such as weekly, daily, and hourly behavioural data. The next step is feature extraction, whereby the necessary features are culled from each data instance; this includes but is not limited to HTTP features, E-mail capabilities, file features, and USB characteristics. These are the primary types of characteristics, and insider detection may make use of features from across each of them. Next, one of the most effective ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF) classifier, is given the characteristics. At last, the RF sorts information into "insider" and "normal" categories according to the characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ML-based identifying insider threats model at the microlevel.},

	abstract = {Data is critical for large as well as small organizations as customer trust depends upon the privacy of information maintained. The key tool that every organization uses for assessing resources is the Internet. The use of technology and the Internet comes with a cost. This cost is in the form of cyber-attacks that exist over the Internet. One of the hardest attacks to detect is the insider That occurs from within the organization. The organization must distinguish between the employers as well as the insiders. This paper purposed an optimization-based strategy for the detection of insider threats. Spider monkey optimization is applied to detect the sentiments present within the R4.2 cert data set. This data set has been generated by the university of Carnegie Mellon and is used to detect insider threats. The overall process of insider threat detection Starts with downloading the data set from github. The downloaded files have been compressed so to use them; they must be extracted. A large number of files are contained within the cert dataset. For the proposed work(SMLDA optimization), email and psychometric datasets are shortlisted. After extracting the dataset, pre-processing phase is applied. Within pre-processing, noise in terms of missing values is tackled. This is achieved by rejecting records containing null values within individual cells of the dataset. after preprocessing, dataset features are extracted using the content field of the dataset along with the natural language processing toolbox. Feature selection is performed using the Spyder monkey approach. Selection will be based on the contribution factor calculated with linear discriminant analysis. Using SMO, the highest contribution document built with LDA will be selected. In the end, the polarity of the document is calculated using the TextBlob library. The result of the SMO-driven sentiment analysis (anger, neutral, negative, positive, and sad) is compared with the plain LDA approach. SMOdriven sentiment analysis generates a classification accuracy of 99\% and the LDA approach generates a classification accuracy of 90\%. Furthermore, it was discovered that negative and sad sentiments most resulted in insider threats.},

As this problem is being researched by security communities using the traditional machine learning techniques.

As these techniques are not able to identify the difference in the behavior of normal and malicious user because such characteristics like complexity, high dimensionality, lack of labelled threats, the nature (subtle and adaptive) of insiders, heterogeneity and the data related to personality and psychological traits is hard to collect as these do not capture motivations behind attacks. As compared to the traditional techniques, advanced machine learning techniques provide better detection for insiders, but the detection still has some limitations like lack of labelled data and adaptive attacks. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for psychological sentiment analysis based on the email and the network browsing done by the insiders using LDA and SMO. After demonstration, the technique is then being compared with traditional methods and the malicious insiders with negative emotions are detected. This research is built to identify the emotions of the insiders based on the text and sentiment analysis of the emails and the webpages browsed.},

	abstract = {Traditionally cyber security has focused on defending against external threats, over the last decade we have seen an increasing awareness of the threat posed by internal actors. Current approaches to reducing this risk have been based upon technical controls, psychologically understanding the insider’s decision-making processes or sociological approaches ensuring constructive workplace behaviour. However, it is clear that these controls are not enough to mitigate this threat with a 2019 report suggesting that 34\% of breaches involved internal actors. There are a number of Insider threat frameworks that bridge the gap between these views, creating a holistic view of insider threat. These models can be diﬃcult to contextualise within an organisation and hence developing actionable insight is challenging. An important task in understanding an insider attack is to gather a 360-degree understanding of the incident across multiple business areas: e.g. co-workers, HR, IT, etc. can be key to understanding the attack. We propose a new approach to gathering organic narratives of an insider threat incident that then uses a computational approach to map these narratives to an existing insider threat framework. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) we exploit a large collection of insider threat reporting to create an understanding of insider threat. This understanding is then applied to a set of reports of a single attack to generate a computational representation of the attack. This representation is then successfully mapped to an existing, manual insider threat framework.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is useful for understanding and grouping emotions including positive and negative in writing using natural language processing techniques. One form of sentiment analysis can be seen from people's reviews of products or services provided by a company. Reviews are excerpts, interpretations, and comments. Review can be interpreted as a form of assessment someone to something. regular review given to a product or service. good and bad reviews, may affect the reputation of the hotel. Good review indicates that the quality of service products must be maintained by the hotel. while the reviews are bad signifies that the quality of the service product must be evaluated and repaired by the hotel. Tripadvisor is a website that focuses on in the tourism sector such as tourist attractions, hotels, and restaurants. everyone can see the service rating a tourist attraction through Tripadvisor. Data hotel visitor reviews found on Tripadvisor, only classified by rating only stars from a scale of 10 to 50. Hotel visitors also provide various reviews to share their experiences during visit the hotel. Like experience dine, stay overnight, swim in the pool, etc. To facilitate the classification process based on review of the visitor's experience, then this research was made. In this research carried out sentiment analysis to distinguish negative reviews and positive using named entity method recognition. In previous research, the accuracy generated from the named entity recognition method reach 90\%.},

Trying to find what kind of people are in high risk for the organization, about one million of tweets were analyzed by sentiment analysis methodology. Dataset made by the web service “Sentiment140” was used to find possible malicious insider. Based on the analysis of the sentiment level, users with negative sentiments were classified by the criteria and then selected as possible malicious insiders according to the threat level. Machine learning algorithms in the open-sourced machine learning software “Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)” were used to find the possible malicious insider. Decision Tree had the highest accuracy among supervised learning algorithms and K-Means had the highest accuracy among unsupervised learning. In addition, we extract the frequently used words from the topic modeling technique and then verified the analysis results by matching them to the information security compliance elements. These findings can contribute to achieve higher detection accuracy by combining individual’s characteristics to the previous studies such as analyzing system behavior.},

In this paper, we present findings from a narrative literature review of 69 papers with the purpose to identify the dimensions of cybersecurity culture and how these may be targeted by the organization. The results show that cybersecurity culture is understood as a sub-component of organizational culture comprised of layers that are increasingly more observable. Further, key practices for developing cybersecurity culture resemble those highlighted in the literature on safety culture: management support; policy; awareness and training; involvement and communication; and learning from experience. We conclude with a brief discussion of whether cybersecurity culture and safety culture are two distinct sub-components of organizational culture or can be understood to be overlapping.},

Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing to gather positive and negative feedback on a piece of writing on social media. Academics have been forced to research sentiment analysis by exponential growth in business and ecommerce companies. This study examined emotions in two distinct domains: one for electronics product evaluations and another for film reviews. Due to the enormous volume of data gathered for analysis, it is referred to as massive data. This vast data is multidimensional and includes useless information. Furthermore, this data complicates the analysis since it reduces the effectiveness of machine learning categorization algorithms. As a consequence, the data must be cleansed and pertinent features identified. Numerous methods have been used to eliminate noise from data and identify essential components. There are two methods for determining suitable features: feature selection and feature extraction. The research is split into three stages: the first step involves converting unstructured data to structured data and choosing relevant and feature information. Second, machine learning classification algorithms are employed in conjunction with feature selection approaches, and third, machine learning algorithms are used in conjunction with ensemble learning methods.},

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate the potential of synthetic resumes as a means for the rapid generation of training data and their effectiveness in data augmentation, especially in categories marked by sparse samples. The widespread implementation of machine learning algorithms in natural language processing (NLP) has notably streamlined the resume classification process, delivering time and cost efficiencies for hiring organizations. However, the performance of these algorithms depends on the abundance of training data. While selecting the right model architecture is essential, it is also crucial to ensure the availability of a robust, well-curated dataset. For many categories in the job market, data sparsity remains a challenge. To deal with this challenge, we employed the OpenAI API to generate both structured and unstructured resumes tailored to specific criteria. These synthetically generated resumes were cleaned, preprocessed and then utilized to train two distinct models: a transformer model (BERT) and a feedforward neural network (FFNN) that incorporated Universal Sentence Encoder 4 (USE4) embeddings. While both models were evaluated on the multiclass classification task of resumes, when trained on an augmented dataset containing 60 percent real data (from Indeed website) and 40 percent synthetic data from ChatGPT, the transformer model presented exceptional accuracy. The FFNN, albeit predictably, achieved lower accuracy. These findings highlight the value of augmented real-world data with ChatGPT-generated synthetic resumes, especially in the context of limited training data. The suitability of the BERT model for such classification tasks further reinforces this narrative.},

	abstract = {Historically, the harm caused by insiders has proven to be one of the greatest concerns for any organization. As such, it has received considerable attention from both the industrial and research communities. Existing works mainly focused on modeling the employees’ normal biometric behavior (e.g., human to device interaction pattern) to detect anomalous behavior which corresponds to the insider activity. However, it is unattainable to stop the insider at the ﬁnal moment when the malicious act is being carried out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which performs employee proﬁling based on aspect-based sentiments and social network information and examine its applicability for early detection of potential insider threats. On the contrary to the traditional sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis provides more ﬁne-grained information on the employee. Our framework employs a combination of deep learning techniques such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and skipgram to build temporal sentiment proﬁles for the employees. It then performs anomaly detection on the proﬁles and ranks the employees based on their respective anomaly score. Due to the absence of relevant benchmark dataset, we augmented the publicly available real-world Enron email corpus with an insider threat scenario to evaluate our framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that the augmentation is indeed reﬂected in the augmented employee’s anomaly ranking (i.e., from normal to abnormal) and her close associates are indeed placed closely to her when the proﬁles are visualized in the 2D space. The proﬁles obtained from our framework can also be used to complement any existing expert and intelligent systems with additional capabilities in handling textual information such as, integration with proﬁles obtained from biometric behavior to form a more comprehensive threat detection system.},

	abstract = {An insider threat is a threat that comes from people within the organization being attacked. It can be described as a function of the motivation, opportunity, and capability of the insider. Compared to managing the dimensions of opportunity and capability, assessing one’s motivation in committing malicious acts poses more challenges to organizations because it usually involves a more obtrusive process of psychological examination. The existing body of research in psycholinguistics suggests that automated text analysis of electronic communications can be an alternative for predicting and detecting insider threat through unobtrusive behavior monitoring. However, a major challenge in employing this approach is that it is difficult to minimize the risk of missing any potential threat while maintaining an acceptable false alarm rate. To deal with the trade-off between the risk of missed catches and the false alarm rate, we propose a unified psycholinguistic framework that consolidates multiple text analyzers to carry out sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and topic modeling on electronic communications for unobtrusive psychological assessment. The user scenarios presented in this paper demonstrated how the trade-off issue can be attenuated with different text analyzers working collaboratively to provide more comprehensive summaries of users’ psychological states.},
