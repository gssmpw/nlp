\subsection{Trends}

Research by Wang, "Insider Threat Research with Natural Language Processing" in their review of insider threat research with natural language processing determine the viability of research using the CERT dataset Chen et al., "CERT Dataset: A Benchmark for Insider Threat Detection". Use of the CERT dataset is common among NLP insider threat researchers to establish a performance benchmark Saeed, "NLP-Based Insider Threat Detection: A Survey"__, as well as researchers focusing on custom machine learning models Zhang, "Custom Machine Learning Models for Insider Threat Detection _____. Observed trends include manual labeling by Liu et al., "Manual Labeling for NLP Tasks" and automated labeling by Kim, "Automated Labeling of NLP Data ____ of data fields for efficient data matching. Concerns are noted on accuracy of automated labeling. Technology trends lean on performance for insider threat models to improve detection Zhang et al., "Improving Insider Threat Detection with LLMs ____ and influence organizational policy _____. Performance trending can be seen in LLM performance ranking by Lee, "LLM Performance Ranking: A Study".

\subsection{Challenges}

  Wang researched measurement improvement of software approval ratings through NLP sentiment analysis by capturing statistical values from qualitative perceptions. Where Li used manual labels as the ``gold standard", Kim used automated labeling for insider threat machine learning analysis of secondary social media data, presenting research with label fidelity issues. Chen applied web scraping techniques, NLP, and machine learning analysis to assist the research community, where their research is more appropriately applied to policy influence. Zhang implemented an insider threat profiling mechanism based on sentiment analysis, and Li addresses bias in data retrieval using LLMs.

\subsection{Gaps}

Chen demonstrated policy influence, where Lee performed research on LLMs in public-sector decision making. Previously noted examples in the use of LLMs with sentiment analysis by Saeed along with research combining web scraping, LLM, and sentiment analysis was demonstrate the burgeoning state of the field Wang _____. Use of LLM generated synthetic data is is observed by Kim for improving job recommendations by reducing bias. Zhang applied synthetic data to improve job stratification. Similarly, Li utilized synthetic data to draw skill requirements for job roles from online job postings.

By both generating synthetic datasets using LLMs and analyzing publicly available data, this study assesses the viability of synthetic data generation in this domain, and the comparative accuracy and validity of LLMs in identifying indicators of insider threats. Contributions of this research will address the use of synthetically generated job reviews to discover insider threat sentiment compared to a curated dataset. Policy influence to encourage organizational, informational, and reputational policy are its contributions.
