	abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of generative AI (GAI). ChatGPT is based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Use of AI in Cybersecurity can prove to be beneficial as the security analysts are employing AI models for improved detection of threats and quicker response to incidents. The interaction with LLMs needs to be skillfully and tactfully created to get precise and concise response. This technique of crafting queries to interact with the LLM is called prompt engineering. Prompt engineering in vulnerability detection and management is a new trend in the industry to manage cybersecurity threats and weaknesses proactively and effectively. This paper presents an extensive review of the field of prompt engineering in cybersecurity. It is primarily based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, encompassing a wide range of sources to provide a thorough overview of the current state and advancements in AI. The review delves into various aspects of prompt engineering, synthesizing key findings and theories from a multitude of scholarly articles and industry reports. This approach ensures a holistic understanding of the AI models including LLMs and how generative AI, in terms of prompt engineering, can be used for cyber-defense.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is essential for comprehending public opinion, particularly when considering e-commerce and the expansion of online businesses. Early approaches treated sentiment analysis as a document or sentence-level classification problem, lacking the ability to capture nuanced opinions about specific aspects. This limitation was addressed by the development of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which links sentiment to specific aspects that are mentioned explicitly or implicitly in the review. ABSA is relatively a recent field of sentiment analysis and the existing models for ABSA face three main challenges, including domain-specificity, reliance on labeled data, and a lack of exploration into the potential of newer large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, PaLM, and T5. Leveraging a diverse set of datasets, including DOTSA, MAMS, and SemEval16, we evaluate the performance of prominent models such as ATAE-LSTM, flan-t5-large-absa, DeBERTa, PaLM, and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our findings reveal nuanced strengths and weaknesses of these models across different domains, with DeBERTa emerging as consistently high-performing and PaLM demonstrating remarkable competitiveness for aspect term sentiment analysis (ATSA) tasks. In addition, the PaLM demonstrates competitive performance for all the domains that were used in the experiments including the restaurant, hotel, books, clothing, and laptop reviews. Notably, the analysis underscores the models’ domain sensitivity, shedding light on their varying efficacy for both ATSA and ACSA tasks. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of model applicability and highlight potential areas for improvement in ABSA research and development.},

By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

	abstract = {Insider threat detection has become a paramount concern in modern times where organizations strive to safeguard their sensitive information and critical assets from malicious actions by individuals with privileged access. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of insider threat detection, highlighting its significance in the current landscape of cybersecurity. The review encompasses a broad spectrum of methodologies and techniques, with a particular focus on classical machine-learning approaches and their limitations in effectively addressing the intricacies of insider threats. Furthermore, the survey explores the utilization of modern deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) based methods as promising alternatives, shedding light on their advantages over traditional methods. The comprehensive analysis of results from experiments utilizing NLP and large language models to detect malicious insider threats on the CMU CERT dataset reveals promising insights. Studies surveyed in this paper indicate that these advanced techniques demonstrate notable efficacy in identifying suspicious activities and anomalous behaviors associated with insider threats within organizational systems. Additionally, the survey underscores the potential of NLP and large language model-based approaches, which can enhance threat detection by deciphering textual and contextual information. In the conclusion section, the paper offers valuable insights into the future directions of insider threat detection. It advocates for the integration of more sophisticated time-series-based techniques, recognizing the importance of temporal patterns in insider threat behaviors. These recommendations reflect the evolving nature of insider threats and emphasize the need for proactive, data-driven strategies to safeguard organizations against internal security breaches. In conclusion, this survey not only underscores the urgency of addressing insider threats but also provides a roadmap for the adoption of advanced methodologies to enhance detection and mitigation capabilities in contemporary cybersecurity paradigms.},

Anomaly based insider detection approaches are generally associated with high false positives; thus, there has been increased focus on including prediction of user psychology and attack motivations. However, data relating to psychological profile and personality trait of employees are challenging to collect, and do not generally adequately capture attack motivations such as disgruntlement (e.g. towards certain behavior). Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate how one can build a user psychological profile based on the sentiment analysis of their network browsing and email content. We then evaluate our approach using real-world datasets, and the findings suggest that our approach can proactively and accurately detect malicious insiders with extreme or negative emotional tendencies. This is the first work to build user profile and predict insider threats using sentiment analysis of their browsing and email content.},

There are still substantial problems despite the fact that insider threats are harder to identify. The goal of this research is to assess and identify insider threats using a machine learning (ML) technique. The goal of this research is to identify potential insider threats by continuous learning of their behaviors. The initial step is to gather and prepare the insider dataset. The data is first preprocessed to create smaller, more manageable chunks, such as weekly, daily, and hourly behavioural data. The next step is feature extraction, whereby the necessary features are culled from each data instance; this includes but is not limited to HTTP features, E-mail capabilities, file features, and USB characteristics. These are the primary types of characteristics, and insider detection may make use of features from across each of them. Next, one of the most effective ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF) classifier, is given the characteristics. At last, the RF sorts information into "insider" and "normal" categories according to the characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ML-based identifying insider threats model at the microlevel.},

	abstract = {Data is critical for large as well as small organizations as customer trust depends upon the privacy of information maintained. The key tool that every organization uses for assessing resources is the Internet. The use of technology and the Internet comes with a cost. This cost is in the form of cyber-attacks that exist over the Internet. One of the hardest attacks to detect is the insider That occurs from within the organization. The organization must distinguish between the employers as well as the insiders. This paper purposed an optimization-based strategy for the detection of insider threats. Spider monkey optimization is applied to detect the sentiments present within the R4.2 cert data set. This data set has been generated by the university of Carnegie Mellon and is used to detect insider threats. The overall process of insider threat detection Starts with downloading the data set from github. The downloaded files have been compressed so to use them; they must be extracted. A large number of files are contained within the cert dataset. For the proposed work(SMLDA optimization), email and psychometric datasets are shortlisted. After extracting the dataset, pre-processing phase is applied. Within pre-processing, noise in terms of missing values is tackled. This is achieved by rejecting records containing null values within individual cells of the dataset. after preprocessing, dataset features are extracted using the content field of the dataset along with the natural language processing toolbox. Feature selection is performed using the Spyder monkey approach. Selection will be based on the contribution factor calculated with linear discriminant analysis. Using SMO, the highest contribution document built with LDA will be selected. In the end, the polarity of the document is calculated using the TextBlob library. The result of the SMO-driven sentiment analysis (anger, neutral, negative, positive, and sad) is compared with the plain LDA approach. SMOdriven sentiment analysis generates a classification accuracy of 99\% and the LDA approach generates a classification accuracy of 90\%. Furthermore, it was discovered that negative and sad sentiments most resulted in insider threats.},

As this problem is being researched by security communities using the traditional machine learning techniques. These techniques use feature engineering and some use anomaly-based detection which are based on high false positives. As these techniques are not able to identify the difference in the behavior of normal and malicious user because such characteristics like complexity, high dimensionality, lack of labelled threats, the nature (subtle and adaptive) of insiders, heterogeneity and the data related to personality and psychological traits is hard to collect as these do not capture motivations behind attacks. As compared to the traditional techniques, advanced machine learning techniques provide better detection for insiders, but the detection still has some limitations like lack of labelled data and adaptive attacks. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for psychological sentiment analysis based on the email and the network browsing done by the insiders using LDA and SMO. After demonstration, the technique is then being compared with traditional methods and the malicious insiders with negative emotions are detected. This research is built to identify the emotions of the insiders based on the text and sentiment analysis of the emails and the webpages browsed.},

Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing to gather positive and negative feedback on a piece of writing on social media. Academics have been forced to research sentiment analysis by exponential growth in business and ecommerce companies. This study examined emotions in two distinct domains: one for electronics product evaluations and another for film reviews. Due to the enormous volume of data gathered for analysis, it is referred to as massive data. This vast data is multidimensional and includes useless information. Furthermore, this data complicates the analysis since it reduces the effectiveness of machine learning categorization algorithms. As a consequence, the data must be cleansed and pertinent features identified. Numerous methods have been used to eliminate noise from data and identify essential components. There are two methods for determining suitable features: feature selection and feature extraction. The research is split into three stages: the first step involves converting unstructured data to structured data and choosing relevant and feature information. Second, machine learning classification algorithms are employed in conjunction with feature selection approaches, and third, machine learning algorithms are used in conjunction with ensemble learning methods.},

One form of sentiment analysis can be seen from people's reviews of products or services provided by a company. Reviews are excerpts, interpretations, and comments. Review can be interpreted as a form of assessment someone to something. regular review given to a product or service. good and bad reviews, may affect the reputation of the hotel. Good review indicates that the quality of service products must be maintained by the hotel. while the reviews are bad signifies that the quality of the service product must be evaluated and repaired by the hotel. Tripadvisor is a website that focuses on in the tourism sector such as tourist attractions, hotels, and restaurants. everyone can see the service rating a tourist attraction through Tripadvisor. Data hotel visitor reviews found on Tripadvisor, only classified by rating only stars from a scale of 10 to 50. Hotel visitors also provide various reviews to share their experiences during visit the hotel. Like experience dine, stay overnight, swim in the pool, etc. To facilitate the classification process based on review of the visitor's experience, then this research was made. In this research carried out sentiment analysis to distinguish negative reviews and positive using named entity method recognition. In previous research, the accuracy generated from the named entity recognition method reach 90\%.},

	abstract = {An insider threat is a threat that comes from people within the organization being attacked. It can be described as a function of the motivation, opportunity, and capability of the insider. Compared to managing the dimensions of opportunity and capability, assessing one’s motivation in committing malicious acts poses more challenges to organizations because it usually involves a more obtrusive process of psychological examination. The existing body of research in psycholinguistics suggests that automated text analysis of electronic communications can be an alternative for predicting and detecting insider threat through unobtrusive behavior monitoring. However, a major challenge in employing this approach is that it is difficult to minimize the risk of missing any potential threat while maintaining an acceptable false alarm rate. To deal with the trade-off between the risk of missed catches and the false alarm rate, we propose a unified psycholinguistic framework that consolidates multiple text analyzers to carry out sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and topic modeling on electronic communications for unobtrusive psychological assessment. The user scenarios presented in this paper demonstrated how the trade-off issue can be attenuated with different text analyzers working collaboratively to provide more comprehensive summaries of users’ psychological states.},

	abstract = {Historically, the harm caused by insiders has proven to be one of the greatest concerns for any organization. As such, it has received considerable attention from both the industrial and research communities. Existing works mainly focused on modeling the employees’ normal biometric behavior (e.g., human to device interaction pattern) to detect anomalous behavior which corresponds to the insider activity. However, it is unattainable to stop the insider at the ﬁnal moment when the malicious act is being carried out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which performs employee proﬁling based on aspect-based sentiments and social network information and examine its applicability for early detection of potential insider threats. On the contrary to the traditional sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis provides more ﬁne-grained information on the employee. Our framework employs a combination of deep learning techniques such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and skipgram to build temporal sentiment proﬁles for the employees. It then performs anomaly detection on the proﬁles and ranks the employees based on their respective anomaly score. Due to the absence of relevant benchmark dataset, we augmented the publicly available real-world Enron email corpus with an insider threat scenario to evaluate our framework. The evaluation results demonstrate that the augmentation is indeed reﬂected in the augmented employee’s anomaly ranking (i.e., from normal to abnormal) and her close associates are indeed placed closely to her when the proﬁles are visualized in the 2D space. The proﬁles obtained from our framework can also be used to complement any existing expert and intelligent systems with additional capabilities in handling textual information such as, integration with proﬁles obtained from biometric behavior to form a more comprehensive threat detection system.},

Dataset made by the web service “Sentiment140” was used to find possible malicious insider. Based on the analysis of the sentiment level, users with negative sentiments were classified by the criteria and then selected as possible malicious insiders according to the threat level. Machine learning algorithms in the open-sourced machine learning software “Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)” were used to find the possible malicious insider. Decision Tree had the highest accuracy among supervised learning algorithms and K-Means had the highest accuracy among unsupervised learning. In addition, we extract the frequently used words from the topic modeling technique and then verified the analysis results by matching them to the information security compliance elements.

	abstract = {Traditionally cyber security has focused on defending against external threats, over the last decade we have seen an increasing awareness of the threat posed by internal actors. Current approaches to reducing this risk have been based upon technical controls, psychologically understanding the insider’s decision-making processes or sociological approaches ensuring constructive workplace behaviour. However, it is clear that these controls are not enough to mitigate this threat with a 2019 report suggesting that 34\% of breaches involved internal actors. There are a number of Insider threat frameworks that bridge the gap between these views, creating a holistic view of insider threat. These models can be diﬃcult to contextualise within an organisation and hence developing actionable insight is challenging. An important task in understanding an insider attack is to gather a 360-degree understanding of the incident across multiple business areas: e.g. co-workers, HR, IT, etc. can be key to understanding the attack. We propose a new approach to gathering organic narratives of an insider threat incident that then uses a computational approach to map these narratives to an existing insider threat framework. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) we exploit a large collection of insider threat reporting to create an understanding of insider threat. This understanding is then applied to a set of reports of a single attack to generate a computational representation of the attack. This representation is then successfully mapped to an existing, manual insider threat framework.},

Subsequently, we detect statistically abnormal behavior with respect to these features using state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, and declare this abnormal behavior as a proxy for insider threat activity. We test our approach on a real world data set with artiﬁcially injected insider threat events. We obtain a ROC score of 0.77, which shows that our proposed approach is fairly successful in identifying insider threat events. Finally, we build a visualization dashboard that enables managers and HR personnel to quickly identify employees with high threat risk scores which will enable them to take suitable preventive measures and limit security risk.},

Recent studies suggest that the cost of insider attacks is higher than the external threats, making it an essential aspect of information security for organizations. Efﬁcient insider threat detection requires stateof-the-art Artiﬁcial Intelligence models and utility. Although signiﬁcant have been made to detect insider threats for more than a decade, there are many limitations, including a lack of real data, low accuracy, and a relatively low false alarm, which are major concerns needing further investigation. In this paper, an attempt to fulﬁll these gaps by detecting insider threats with the novelties of the present investigation ﬁrst developed two deep learning hybrid LSTM models integrated with Google's Word2vec LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) GLoVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) LSTM. Secondly, the performance of two hybrid DL models was compared with the state-of-the-art ML models such as XGBoost, AdaBoost, RF (Random Forest), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) and LR (Logistics Regression). Thirdly, the present investigation bridges the gaps of using a real dataset, high accuracy, and signiﬁcantly lower false alarm rate. It was found that ML-based models outperformed the DL-based ones. The results were evaluated based on earlier studies and deemed efﬁcient at detecting insider threats using the real dataset.},

User behavior analysis is the mainstream method of insider threat detection, but due to the lack of ﬁne-grained detection and the inability to effectively capture the behavior patterns of individual users, the accuracy and precision of detection are insufﬁcient. To solve this problem, this paper designs an insider threat detection method based on user historical behavior and attention mechanism, including using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to extract user behavior sequence information, using Attention-based on user history behavior (ABUHB) learns the differences between different user behaviors, uses Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to learn the evolution of different user behavior patterns, and ﬁnally realizes ﬁne-grained user abnormal behavior detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, experiments are conducted on the CMU-CERT Insider Threat Dataset. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of this method is 3.1\% to 6.3\% higher than that of other comparative model methods, and it can detect insider threats in different user behaviors with ﬁne granularity.},

Those who have authorized access to sensitive organizational data are placed in a position of power that could well be abused and could cause signiﬁcant damage to an organization. This could range from ﬁnancial theft and intellectual property theft to the destruction of property and business reputation. Traditional intrusion detection systems are neither designed nor capable of identifying those who act maliciously within an organization. In this paper, we describe an automated system that is capable of detecting insider threats within an organization. We deﬁne a tree-structure proﬁling approach that incorporates the details of activities conducted by each user and each job role and then use this to obtain a consistent representation of features that provide a rich description of the user’s behavior. Deviation can be assessed based on the amount of variance that each user exhibits across multiple attributes, compared against their peers. We have performed experimentation using ten synthetic data-driven scenarios and found that the system can identify anomalous behavior that may be indicative of a potential threat. We also show how our detection system can be combined with visual analytics tools to support further investigation by an analyst.},

Previous research has estab­ lished that personality factors are an important determinant of the likelihood that an individual will engage in insider threat behaviors. The present article asserts that dark personality traits, non-clinical personality char­ acteristics that are typically associated with patterns of anti-social and otherwise noxious interpersonal behav­ iors, may be particularly useful for understanding and predicting insider threat behaviors. Although some relationships between insider threats and dark traits have been documented, most attention has been devoted to a limited subset of dark traits. To address this issue, we critically review contemporary models of dark traits and their potential value for understanding both malicious and non-malicious insider threats, supplemented by discussions of subject matter expert ratings concerning the relevance of dark traits for both insider threat be­ haviors and cybersecurity personnel job performance. We then review potential assessment issues and provide evidence of possible moderators for the relationships under investigation. Finally, we develop avenues for future research, an agenda for improving the measurement of dark traits, and guidance for how organizations may implement the assessment of dark traits in their organizational processes.},

Yet, labor shortages in the hospitality industry have been amplified in recent years. The tight job market requires organizations to use aggressive and proactive recruitment strategies. Since online employee reviews can attract both active and passive job seekers, organizations are increasingly advertising their jobs on these sites. This study draws on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and tests the boundary condition of work experience on the effects of overall starratings and employer awards on job seekers’ application intention. Through an experimental survey, the current study sought to fill the gap regarding the impacts of employee-generated starratings and employer awards on job seekers’ application intentions. Both star-ratings and employer awards are positively related to organizational prestige. Hospitality work experience moderates the relationship between star-ratings and organizational prestige. The relationship is stronger for novice job seekers than for experienced job seekers. Organizational prestige, in turn, increases job seekers’ application intentions. Our findings extend the recruitment literature and highlight the potential usage of ELM as an explorative framework in hospitality recruitment research. The study also provides suggestions for hospitality employers to attract job seekers.},

The nature of insider threats is more challenging than external threats, as insiders have a privileged access to sensitive assets of an organization. In fact, there are several studies that reviewed the insider threat detection approaches from taxonomical and theoretical perspectives. However, the protection against insider threat incidents requires empirical defense solutions. Hence, our study uniquely focuses on empirical detection approaches that are validated with empirical results. We propose a 10-question model that highlights different prospective of empirical detection approaches. Signiﬁcant factors are also proposed to reveal the extent to which the detection approaches are effective against insider threat incidents (e.g., feature domains, protection coverage, classiﬁcation techniques, simulated scenarios, performance and accuracy metrics, etc.). The objective of this paper is to enhance researchers’ efforts in the domain of insider attack by systemizing the detection techniques in comparable manner. It also highlights the challenges and gaps for further research to institute more effective solutions that can predict, detect, and prevent emerging attack incidents. Some recommendations for future research directions are also presented.},

Recent industry surveys and academic literature provide unequivocal evidence to support the signiﬁcance of this threat and its prevalence. Despite this, however, there is still no unifying framework to fully characterise insider attacks and to facilitate an understanding of the problem, its many components and how they all ﬁt together. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and put forward a grounded framework for understanding and reﬂecting on the threat that insiders pose. Speciﬁcally, we propose a novel conceptualisation that is heavily grounded in insiderthreat case studies, existing literature and relevant psychological theory. The framework identiﬁes several key elements within the problem space, concentrating not only on noteworthy events and indicators – technical and behavioural – of potential attacks, but also on attackers (e.g., the motivation behind malicious threats and the human factors related to unintentional ones), and on the range of attacks being witnessed. The real value of our framework is in its emphasis on bringing together and deﬁning clearly the various aspects of insider threat, all based on realworld cases and pertinent literature. This can therefore act as a platform for general understanding of the threat, and also for reﬂection, modelling past attacks and looking for useful patterns.},

	abstract = {This paper examines some of the key issues relating to insider threats to information security and the nature of loyalty and betrayal in the context of organisational, cultural factors and changing economic and social factors. It is recognised that insiders pose security risks due to their legitimate access to facilities and information, knowledge of the organisation and the location of valuable assets. Insiders will know how to achieve the greatest impact whilst leaving little evidence. However, organisations may not have employed effective risk management regimes to deal with the speed and scale of change, for example the rise of outsourcing. Outsourcing can lead to the fragmentation of protection barriers and controls and increase the number of people treated as full time employees. Regional and cultural differences will manifest themselves in differing security threat and risk proﬁles. At the same time, the recession is causing signiﬁcant individual (and organisational) uncertainty and may prompt an increase in abnormal behaviour in long-term employees and managers e those traditionally most trusted e including members of the security community. In this environment, how can organisations know who to trust and how to maintain this trust? The paper describes a practitioner’s view of the issue and the approaches used by BT to assess and address insider threats and risks. Proactive measures need to be taken to mitigate against insider attacks rather than reactive measures after the event. A key priority is to include a focus on insiders within security risk assessments and compliance regimes. The application of technology alone will not provide solutions. Security controls need to be workable in a variety of environments and designed, implemented and maintained with people’s behaviour in mind. Solutions need to be agile and build and maintain trust and secure relationships over time. This requires a focus on human factors, education and awareness and greater attention on the security ‘aftercare’ of employees and third parties.},

	abstract = {Insider threats, as one type of the most challenging threats in cyberspace, usually cause significant loss to organizations. While the problem of insider threat detection has been studied for a long time in both security and data mining communities, the traditional machine learning based detection approaches, which heavily rely on feature engineering, are hard to accurately capture the behavior difference between insiders and normal users due to various challenges related to the characteristics of underlying data, such as high-dimensionality, complexity, heterogeneity, sparsity, lack of labeled insider threats, and the subtle and adaptive nature of insider threats. Advanced deep learning techniques provide a new paradigm to learn end-to-end models from complex data. In this brief survey, we first introduce commonly-used datasets for insider threat detection and review the recent literature about deep learning for such research. The existing studies show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models can improve the performance of insider threat detection. However, applying deep learning to further advance the insider threat detection task still faces several limitations, such as lack of labeled data, adaptive attacks. We discuss such challenges and suggest future research directions that have the potential to address challenges and further boost the performance of deep learning for insider threat detection.},

Next, we build theory on how content in the open-ended comments of an employer review relates to the positivity or negativity of the reviews’ favorability rating. We test our hypotheses via a text-mining analysis of approximately half a million employer reviews. The results reveal an intriguing discrepancy. Although instrumental, impersonal, and cognitive content is more prevalent in employer reviews, symbolic, personal, and emotional content dominates employer reviews’ favorability rating. In terms of practical implications, this result shows that merely inspecting the frequency of attributes mentioned in employer review text comments as a basis for changing company policies of employer branding efforts might be misguided. We discuss implications for theory and future research, and provide our dictionary for further scholarly and practical use.},

In this paper, we present findings from a narrative literature review of 69 papers with the purpose to identify the dimensions of cybersecurity culture and how these may be targeted by the organization. The results show that cybersecurity culture is understood as a sub-component of organizational culture comprised of layers that are increasingly more observable. Further, key practices for developing cybersecurity culture resemble those highlighted in the literature on safety culture: management support; policy; awareness and training; involvement and communication; and learning from experience. We conclude with a brief discussion of whether cybersecurity culture and safety culture are two distinct sub-components of organizational culture or can be understood to be overlapping.},

We introduce a novel parallelization strategy that harnesses the combined compute of CPU, GPU, and Neural Processing Unit (NPU) to significantly reduce TTFT latency. Our methodology involves a detailed analysis of llama.cpp to identify parallelizable segments, followed by the implementation of a heterogenous execution model using OpenVINO™[2]. The results demonstrate a {\textasciitilde}6X performance improvement in TTFT latency when using our heterogenous compute approach, as compared to the native implementation of llama.cpp running on CPU.

This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p {\textless} 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.},

In the context of NLP, high-quality annotations play a pivotal role in training and evaluating machine-learning models. The study encompasses three core NLP tasks: topic classification, tweet sentiment analysis, and emotion classification, each reflecting a distinct aspect of text analysis. The research methodology incorporates a meticulously curated dataset sourced from a variety of text data, spanning diverse topics and emotions. Human annotators, proficient in the Turkish, Indonesian, and Minangkabau language, were tasked with producing high-quality annotations, adhering to comprehensive annotation guidelines. Additionally, fine-tuned Turkish LLMs were employed to generate annotations for the same tasks. The evaluation process employed precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, tailored to each specific NLP task. The findings of this study underscore the nuanced nature of annotation quality. While LLM-generated annotations demonstrated competitive quality, particularly in sentiment analysis, human-generated annotations consistently outperformed LLM-generated ones in more intricate NLP tasks. The observed differences highlight LLM limitations in understanding context and addressing ambiguity. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on annotation sources in Turkish, Indonesian, and Minangkabau NLP, emphasizing the importance of judicious selection between human and LLM-generated annotations. It also underscores the necessity for continued advancements in LLM capabilities, as they continue to reshape the landscape of data annotation in NLP and machine learning.},

The widespread implementation of machine learning algorithms in natural language processing (NLP) has notably streamlined the resume classification process, delivering time and cost efficiencies for hiring organizations. However, the performance of these algorithms depends on the abundance of training data. While selecting the right model architecture is essential, it is also crucial to ensure the availability of a robust, well-curated dataset. For many categories in the job market, data sparsity remains a challenge. To deal with this challenge, we employed the OpenAI API to generate both structured and unstructured resumes tailored to specific criteria. These synthetically generated resumes were cleaned, preprocessed and then utilized to train two distinct models: a transformer model (BERT) and a feedforward neural network (FFNN) that incorporated Universal Sentence Encoder 4 (USE4) embeddings. While both models were evaluated on the multiclass classification task of resumes, when trained on an augmented dataset containing 60 percent real data (from Indeed website) and 40 percent synthetic data from ChatGPT, the transformer model presented exceptional accuracy. The FFNN, albeit predictably, achieved lower accuracy. These findings highlight the value of augmented real-world data with ChatGPT-generated synthetic resumes, especially in the context of limited training data. The suitability of the BERT model for such classification tasks further reinforces this narrative.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) is a widely-used tool for simulating the molecular and materials properties. It is a common wisdom that molecular dynamics simulations should obey physical laws and, hence, lots of effort is put into ensuring that molecular dynamics simulations are energy conserving. The emergence of machine learning (ML) potentials for MD leads to a growing realization that monitoring conservation of energy during simulations is of low utility because the dynamics is often unphysically dissociative. Other ML methods for MD are not based on a potential and provide only forces or trajectories which are reasonable but not necessarily energy-conserving. Here we propose to clearly distinguish between the simulation-energy and true-energy conservation and highlight that the simulations should focus on decreasing the degree of true-energy non-conservation. We introduce very simple, new criteria for evaluating the quality of molecular dynamics estimating the degree of trueenergy non-conservation and we demonstrate their practical utility on an example of infrared spectra simulations. These criteria are more important and intuitive than simply evaluating the quality of the ML potential energies and forces as is commonly done and can be applied universally, e.g., even for trajectories with unknown or discontinuous potential energy. Such an approach introduces new standards for evaluating MD by focusing on the true-energy conservation and can help in developing more accurate methods for simulating molecular and materials properties.},

	abstract = {Insider threats cause greater losses than external attacks, prompting organizations to invest in detection systems. However, there exist challenges: 1) Security and privacy concerns prevent data sharing, making it difficult to train robust models and identify new attacks. 2) The diversity and uniqueness of organizations require localized models, as a universal solution could be more effective. 3) High resource costs, delays, and data security concerns complicate building effective detection systems. This paper introduces FedITD, a flexible, hierarchy, and federated framework with local real-time detection systems, combining Large Language Models (LLM), Federated Learning (FL), Parameter Efficient Tuning (PETuning), and Transfer Learning (TF) for insider threat detection. FedITD uses FL to protect privacy while indirect integrating client information and employs PETuning methods (Adapter, BitFit, LoRA) with LLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT) to reduce resource use and time delay. FedITD customizes client models and optimizes performance via transfer learning without central data transfer, further enhancing the detection of new attacks. FedITD outperforms other federated learning methods and its performance is very close to the best centrally trained method. Extensive experiment results show FedITD’s superior performance, adaptability to varied data, and reduction of resource costs, achieving an optimal balance in detection capabilities across source data, unlabeled local data, and global data. Alternative PETuning implementations are also explored in this paper.},

Prompt leaks, templated answer structure, and canned responses across different interactions are readily noticed by people, but there is no standard score to measure this aspect of model behavior. In this work we empirically investigate diversity scores on English texts. We find that computationally efficient compression algorithms capture information similar to what is measured by slow to compute n-gram overlap homogeneity scores. Further, a combination of measures—compression ratios, self-repetition of long n-grams and Self-BLEU and BERTScore—are sufficient to report, as they have low mutual correlation with each other. The applicability of scores extends beyond analysis of generative models; for example, we highlight applications on instructiontuning datasets and human-produced texts. We release a diversity score package to facilitate research and invite consistency across reports.},

The generated datasets were assessed for sentiment alignment, textual diversity, and data generation cost. Results demonstrated high sentiment alignment across all methods, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Supply-Word exhibited the highest diversity and coverage of PDT terms, although with increased generation costs. Despite minor biases toward positive sentiments, in situations with limited test data, LLM-generated synthetic data offers significant advantages, including scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in dataset production.},
