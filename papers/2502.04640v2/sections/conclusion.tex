\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed \nameshort, a scalable and initialization-free solver for global bundle adjustment, leveraging learned depth and convex optimization. By relaxing scaled bundle adjustment as a convex SDP and solving it efficiently with Burer-Monteiro factorization and a CUDA-based trust-region Riemannian optimizer, \nameshort achieved certifiable global optimality at extreme scales. Integrated into the \xmsfm pipeline, it maintains the accuracy of existing SfM methods while being significantly faster and more scalable.  

\textbf{Limitation and future work}. First, while our \nameshort solver outperforms baselines in speed, it can be sensitive to noise and outliers. Future work includes refining the filtering process and developing better methods to handle outliers. Second, our GPU solver is built on the \texttt{cuBLAS} dense matrix-vector multiplication library, whereas SLAM camera sequences often have sparse patterns. Extending the \nameshort solver to support sparse matrix-vector multiplications would enhance its applicability to SLAM. Third, our \xmsfm pipline still has components that potentially can be accelerate 100 to 1000 times through CUDA implementation, e.g., filtering and matrix construction.
