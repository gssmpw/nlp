\subsection{Polynomial optimization and Moment-SOS hierarchy}
As a general modeling and optimization tool, polynomial optimization problems (POPs) are prevalent in various fields such as control~\cite{majumdar2013icra-controldedsign-sos}, perception~\cite{yang2022pami-outlierrobust-geometricperception}, and optimal transport~\cite{mula2022arxiv-momentsos-optimal-transport}. 
The celebrated Moment-SOS Hierarchy~\cite{lasserre2001siopt-global} offers a powerful tool to solve POP to global optimality asymptotically. By leveraging the duality between moment relaxation and sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, POP is solved by a series of monotonically growing SDPs. Under certain constraint qualification conditions~\cite{nie2023siopt-moment-momentpolynomialopt}, finite convergence can be observed~\cite{yang2022pami-outlierrobust-geometricperception,teng2023arxiv-geometricmotionplanning-liegroup}. To enhance scalability, researchers exploit various sparsity patterns, including correlative sparsity~\cite{lasserre2006msc-correlativesparse}, term sparsity~\cite{wang2021siam-tssos}, and ideal sparsity~\cite{korda2023mp-ideal-sparsity}, which significantly improves computation.

\subsection{Semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers}
For small to medium-scale general SDPs, the interior point method~\cite{helmberg1996siam-interiorpoint-sdp} is the preferred choice due to its robustness and high accuracy, with several academic and commercial solvers available~\cite{tutuncu2003mp-sdpt3-sdpsolver,sturm1999oms-sedumi-sdpsolver,aps2019ugrm-mosek-sdpsolver}. As SDP size increases, first-order methods, particularly ADMM-style algorithms~\cite{wen2010mp-admmsdp,chen2017mp-sgsadmm,li2018mp-sgs-ccqp,chen2021mp-alm-admm-equivalence}, become more popular due to their affordable per-iteration time and memory cost. Among these, sGS-ADMM~\cite{chen2017mp-sgsadmm,li2018mp-sgs-ccqp} demonstrates superior empirical performance. Several academic first-order SDP solvers are available~\cite{odonoghue2023-scs-sdpsolver,zheng2017ifac-cdcs-sdpsolver,yang2015mp-sdpnalplus-sdpsolver}. In real-world applications~\cite{yang2022pami-outlierrobust-geometricperception,teng2023arxiv-geometricmotionplanning-liegroup}, many SDPs exhibit a low-rank property, prompting the development of specialized algorithms~\cite{burer2003springer-bm,tang2023arxiv-feasible-lowranksdp} and solvers~\cite{yang2023mp-stride,wang2023arxiv-manisdp}. However, these algorithms often underperform for large-scale multiple-cone SDPs. While GPU-based interior point SDP solvers have been deployed on supercomputers~\cite{fujisawa2012sc-extremely-sdp-interiorpoint}, all existing first-order SDP solvers are currently implemented on CPUs.
