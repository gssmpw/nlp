\section{Breakdown plot of run time}
\label{app:breakdown-time}

We present time breakdown plots (\prettyref{fig:replica-time-2000}, \prettyref{fig:replica-time-100}, \prettyref{fig:mipnerf-time}), for three different cases. Depth estimation scales linearly with the number of frames, making it more significant in smaller datasets. Matching and indexing become dominant in larger datasets, as exhaustive matching time grows quadratically with the number of frames. Solver time remains consistently minimal across all datasets.
