\section{Depth Models}
\label{app:depthcomparison}

We compare the performance of different depth estimation models on the Mip-Nerf datasets. The models we consider are \textbf{Unidepth}~\cite{piccinelli2024unidepth}, \textbf{Depth-pro}~\cite{bochkovskii2024depth}, \textbf{DepthAnything-V2}~\cite{yang24depthv2}, and \textbf{Metric3D-v2}~\cite{yin24metric3d}. We evaluate these models using ATE/RTE and runtime as detailed in \prettyref{sec:exp}. The results are shown in \prettyref{tab:depthcomparison}.

All four models produce accurate results, demonstrating the robustness of our \xmsfm pipeline to different depth models. Unidepth is the fastest, while DepthAnything-V2 and Metric3D-v2 are slightly slower but occasionally more accurate. Depth-Pro is the slowest yet consistently stable in accuracy.
