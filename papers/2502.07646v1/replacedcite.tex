CAMs____ belong to a subclass of the Additive Noise Models (ANMs)____, which are causal models that assume nonlinear causal functions with additive noise terms, but the causal effects can be non-additive. Another important causal model is the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM)____, which assumes linear causal relationships with non-Gaussian noise.

A key extension of these causal models involves cases with hidden common causes____. To address such scenarios, methods like the Repetitive Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithm____ and the CAM-UV (Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Variables) algorithm____ have been developed.

Estimation approaches for causal discovery can be generally categorized into three groups: constraint-based methods____, score-based methods____, and continuous-optimization-based methods____. Additionally, a hybrid approach that combines the ideas of constraint-based and score-based methods has been proposed for non-parametric cases____.
