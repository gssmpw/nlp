  abstract = 	 {Existing score-based causal model search algorithms such as \textitGES (and a speeded up version, \textitFGS) are asymptotically correct, fast, and reliable, but make the unrealistic assumption that the true causal graph does not contain any unmeasured confounders. There are several constraint-based causal search algorithms (e.g \textitRFCI, \emphFCI, or \emphFCI+) that are asymptotically correct without assuming that there are no unmeasured confounders, but often perform poorly on small samples. We describe a combined score and constraint-based algorithm, \emphGFCI, that we prove is asymptotically correct. On synthetic data, \textitGFCI is only slightly slower than \emphRFCI but more accurate than \textitFCI, \textitRFCI and \textitFCI+.}

  abstract = 	 { The data drawn from biological, economic, and social systems are often confounded due to the presence of unmeasured variables. Prior work in causal discovery has focused on discrete search procedures for selecting acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), specifically ancestral ADMGs, that encode ordinary conditional independence constraints among the observed variables of the system. However, confounded systems also exhibit more general equality restrictions that cannot be represented via these graphs, placing a limit on the kinds of structures that can be learned using ancestral ADMGs. In this work, we derive differentiable algebraic constraints that fully characterize the space of ancestral ADMGs, as well as more general classes of ADMGs, arid ADMGs and bow-free ADMGs, that capture all equality restrictions on the observed variables. We use these constraints to cast causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem and design differentiable procedures to find the best fitting ADMG when the data comes from a confounded linear system of equations with correlated errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through simulations and application to a protein expression dataset. Code implementing our methods is open-source and publicly available at https://gitlab.com/rbhatta8/dcd and will be incorporated into the Ananke package. }

  abstract =  {Understanding causal relations of systems is a fundamental problem in science. The study of causal discovery aims to infer the underlying causal structure from uncontrolled observational samples. One major approach is to assume that causal structures follow structural equation models (SEMs), such as the additive noise model (ANM) and the post-nonlinear (PNL) model, and to identify these causal structures by estimating the SEMs. Although the PNL model is the most general SEM for causal discovery, its estimation method has not been well-developed except for the bivariate case. In this paper, we propose a new causal discovery method based on the multivariate PNL model. We extend the bivariate method to estimate multi-cause PNL models and combine it with the iterative sink search scheme used for the ANM. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real-world causal discovery problems and show its effectiveness. }

  abstract =  {Discovery of causal relationships from observational data, especially from mixed data that consist of both continuous and discrete variables, is a fundamental yet challenging problem. Traditional methods focus on polishing the data type processing policy, which may lose data information. Compared with such methods, the constraint-based and score-based methods for mixed data derive certain conditional independence tests or score functions from the data’s characteristics. However, they may return the Markov equivalence class due to the lack of identifiability guarantees, which may limit their applicability or hinder their interpretability of causal graphs. Thus, in this paper, based on the structural causal models of continuous and discrete variables, we provide sufficient identifiability conditions in bivariate as well as multivariate cases. We show that if the data follow our proposed restricted Linear Mixed causal model (LiM), such a model is identifiable. In addition, we proposed a two-step hybrid method to discover the causal structure for mixed data. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data empirically demonstrate the identifiability and efficacy of our proposed LiM model. }

Our approach is score-based, and revolves around minimizing a penalized loss subject to an acyclicity constraint. To solve this problem, we leverage a recent algebraic result characterizing the acyclicity constraint as a smooth equality constraint. The resulting algorithm, which we call DYNOTEARS, outperforms other methods on simulated data, especially in high-dimensions as the number of variables increases. We also apply this algorithm on real datasets from two different domains, finance and molecular biology, and analyze the resulting output. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for learning dynamic Bayesian networks, our method is both scalable and accurate on real data. The simple formulation and competitive performance of our method make it suitable for a variety of problems where one seeks to learn connections between variables across time.}

  abstract =  {There are numerous algorithms proposed in the literature for learning causal graphical probabilistic models. Each one of them is typically equipped with one or more tuning hyper-parameters. The choice of optimal algorithm and hyper-parameter values is not universal; it depends on the size of the network, the density of the true causal structure, the sample size, as well as the metric of quality of learning a causal structure. Thus, the challenge to a practitioner is how to “tune” these choices, given that the true graph is unknown and the learning task is unsupervised. In the paper, we evaluate two previously proposed methods for tuning, one based on stability of the learned structure under perturbations (bootstrapping) of the input data and the other based on balancing the in-sample fitting of the model with the model complexity. We propose and comparatively evaluate a new method that treats a causal model as a set of predictive models: one for each node given its Markov Blanket. It then tunes the choices using out-of-sample protocols for supervised methods such as cross-validation. The proposed method performs on par or better than the previous methods for most metrics.}
