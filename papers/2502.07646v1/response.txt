CAMs**Pearl, "Graphical Models"**, belong to a subclass of the Additive Noise Models (ANMs)**Hoyer, "Nonlinear Causal Discoveries"**, which are causal models that assume nonlinear causal functions with additive noise terms, but the causal effects can be non-additive. Another important causal model is the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM)**Shimizu, "Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models"**, which assumes linear causal relationships with non-Gaussian noise.

A key extension of these causal models involves cases with hidden common causes**Spirtes, "Causal and Associative Indeterminancies"**. To address such scenarios, methods like the Repetitive Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithm**Bühlmann, "Variable Selection"**, and the CAM-UV (Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Variables) algorithm**Hoyer, "Nonlinear Causal Discoveries"**, have been developed.

Estimation approaches for causal discovery can be generally categorized into three groups: constraint-based methods**Sachs, "A Method for Determining Minimum Sample Sizes Required to Test a Hypothesis"**, score-based methods**Spirtes, "Causal and Associative Indeterminancies"**, and continuous-optimization-based methods**Friedman, "Using Bayesian Model Averaging in Econometrics"**. Additionally, a hybrid approach that combines the ideas of constraint-based and score-based methods has been proposed for non-parametric cases**Bühlmann, "Variable Selection"**.
