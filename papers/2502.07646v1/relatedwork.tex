CAMs~\citep{Buhlmann14CAM} belong to a subclass of the Additive Noise Models (ANMs)~\citep{Hoyer09NIPS}, which are causal models that assume nonlinear causal functions with additive noise terms, but the causal effects can be non-additive. Another important causal model is the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM)~\citep{Shimizu06JMLR}, which assumes linear causal relationships with non-Gaussian noise.

A key extension of these causal models involves cases with hidden common causes~\citep{Hoyer08IJAR,Zhang10UAI-GP,Tashiro14NECO,Salehkaleybar2020learning}. To address such scenarios, methods like the Repetitive Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithm~\citep{Maeda20AISTATS} and the CAM-UV (Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Variables) algorithm~\citep{maeda21a} have been developed.

Estimation approaches for causal discovery can be generally categorized into three groups: constraint-based methods~\citep{Spirtes91PC,Spirtes95FCI}, score-based methods~\citep{Chickering2002}, and continuous-optimization-based methods~\citep{Zheng18Neurips,Bhattacharya21ABC}. Additionally, a hybrid approach that combines the ideas of constraint-based and score-based methods has been proposed for non-parametric cases~\citep{Ogarrio16Hybrid}.
