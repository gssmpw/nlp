\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Ambiguity Resolution in NLP} Numerous studies have focused on ambiguity in natural language tasks using strategies like generating multiple answers ____, asking clarification questions ____, and estimating uncertainty ____. Similar to our work, ____ use iterative prompting to refine and generate alternative interpretations in the context of question answering, while ____ first detect ambiguous questions and then resolve them through clarification requests. 

 \paragraph{Ambiguity in Semantic Parsing} Ambiguity has been studied across semantic parsing tasks, from code generation ____ to $\lambda$-calculus translation ____,  and logical form prediction ____. In the domain of text-to-SQL parsing, recent work has emphasized the fact that benchmarks often overlook ambiguity by providing single interpretations ____. Existing approaches focus on detecting column ambiguity through counterfactual examples ____, special-purpose decoding ____, and resolving ambiguity through clarification questions ____. Our work uses explicit disambiguation before parsing and thus extends to different types of ambiguities, question styles, and database formats.

\paragraph{Intermediate Representations in Text-to-SQL} Intermediate representations are commonly used to bridge the gap between natural language and database queries. Several approaches decompose complex questions into a sequence of simpler operations expressed in natural language   ____, modular execution plans ____, or simplify the parsing task by augmenting questions with SQL keywords that mention necessary computation steps ____. Building on this work, we also use intermediate representations to make implicit information explicit but focus on resolving ambiguity.

\paragraph{Learning to Correct LLM Outputs} More recently, various approaches have been proposed to correct systematic biases in LLM outputs. For example, ____ propose a model-agnostic module that learns correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred outputs. ____ use a corrector model to iteratively review imperfect generations from a base model. 
Similarly,  critique generators can be developed using reinforcement learning  ____  or through fine-grained feedback ____. Such correction approaches are most effective when guided by external tools ____. We follow this paradigm using a specialized infilling model to correct systematic  LLM biases towards certain interpretations and validate our output through SQL execution.
