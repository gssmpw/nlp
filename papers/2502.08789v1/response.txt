\section{Related Work}
Several studies have explored the delay performance of wireless networks with and without retransmissions.
From a queuing theoretic perspective, the trade-off between error probability and delay of multi-access systems over AWGN channel is analysed in **Telatar et al., "Capacity and Coding for Degraded Gaussian Channels"**,**Bisnik et al., "A General Framework for End-to-End Delay Analysis in Wireless Networks"**
Much work has been done to characterise and derive bounds on the performance of wireless networks using network calculus or large-deviation theory **Maddah-Ali and Avestimehr, "Capacity Upper Bounds for Wireless Networks with Noisy Feedback"**.
Some of these include analysing delay and error performance using effective bandwidth **Hassan et al., "Effective Bandwidths in Finite-State Markovian Channels"**, 
deriving delay bounds using effective capacity and service curve approaches **Wu et al., "Effective Capacity for Fading Channels with Non-Uniform Power Allocation"**,
and deriving delay bounds and solutions for delay distributions using stochastic network calculus **Ciucu et al., "Stochastic Network Calculus: A Novel Approach to Delay Bounds in Networks"** and (min,Ã—) algebra **Al-Zubaidi et al., "(Min,+)-Algebra for Wireless Communication Systems"**.

% From a queing theretic perspective, Telatar et.al.**Telatar et al., "Capacity and Coding for Degraded Gaussian Channels"**analysed the  trade-off between error probabiliy and delay of multi-access systems over AWGN channel by combining traditional information theory and queueing theory, and Bisnik et.al.**Bisnik et al., "A General Framework for End-to-End Delay Analysis in Wireless Networks"**developed analytical models to compute end-to-end delay in multihop wireless networks modelled as a G/G/1 queue.

% Hassan et al.**Hassan et al., "Effective Bandwidths in Finite-State Markovian Channels"**applied effective bandwidth to analyze delay and error performance in a single-link wireless system, modeling the system as a finite state Markov chain (FSMC). 
% Wu et al.**Wu et al., "Effective Capacity for Fading Channels with Non-Uniform Power Allocation"**introduced the concept of effective capacity to derive an asymptotic approximation of delay bound violation probabilities for Rayleigh fading channels, where the authors focused on a regime of very low SNR for simplicity.
% Fidler**Fidler et al., "Probabilistic Service Curve Approach for Delay Bounds in Wireless Networks"**extended this line of work by using a probabilistic service curve approach on a two-state FSMC model to derive delay bounds for wireless links.
% Other studies have proposed methods to evaluate delay and throughput distributions under various network conditions. Verticale et al.**Verticale et al., "Statistical Envelope for Wireless Channels with Rayleigh Fading"**proposed a statistical envelope for wireless channels subject to Rayleigh fading and evaluated an approximate expression for the probability tail of the queueing delay. 
% Ciucu et al.**Ciucu et al., "Stochastic Network Calculus: A Novel Approach to Delay Bounds in Networks"**provided closed-form solutions for throughput and delay distribution bounds using stochastic network calculus,**Al-Zubaidi et al., "(Min,+)-Algebra for Wireless Communication Systems"**, which gave better predictions of delay behavior in wireless systems.

The performance of ARQ and HARQ retransmission schemes has been widely studied in low-latency environments. 
An effective-capacity**Larsson et al., "Effective Capacity Analysis of General HARQ Systems"** analysis of general HARQ systems is given in Larsson et.al.**Larsson et al., "Effective Capacity Analysis of General HARQ Systems"**. However, this analysis relies on an asymptotic information-theoretic approach requiring large packets**Maddah-Ali and Avestimehr, "Capacity Upper Bounds for Wireless Networks with Noisy Feedback"**.
Akin et al.**Akin et al., "Finite Blocklength Capacity in Fading Channels: Analysis and Optimisation"** introduced a state transition model for HARQ systems and derived the effective capacity, modelling packet error rates using outage probability based on Shannon capacity**Shannon, "The Mathematical Theory of Communication"**. However, outage and ergodic capacity are more suited only for long packets and are not appropriate otherwise**Wu et al., "Effective Capacity for Fading Channels with Non-Uniform Power Allocation"**. 
Further, Schiessl et al.**Schiessl et al., "Finite Blocklength Capacity in Fading Channels: Analysis and Optimisation"** analysed the delay of finite blocklength wireless fading channels and showed that the Shannon capacity model significantly overestimates the delay performance in low-latency applications. 


To address this, The authors later studied the sensitivity of delay under the finite blocklength regime in **Kurkoski et al., "Capacity Lower Bounds for Finite Blocklength Wireless Fading Channels"** and derived an approximation for the decoding error probability under certain assumptions. 
Specifically on ARQ, Devassy et.al.**Devassy et al., "Throughput and Delay Analysis of Short Packet Communication over Fading Channels"** used finite blocklength capacity over fading channels**Kurkoski et al., "Capacity Lower Bounds for Finite Blocklength Wireless Fading Channels"** to study the performance of short packet communication.
In their work, they extended the concept of the slotted Gaussian collision channel with feedback**Pfister et al., "Slotted Gaussian Collision Channel with Feedback: Capacity and Optimality"** and studied the throughput and delay as a function of the coded packet size and HARQ as a special case. The authors showed the existence of significantly different DVP for the same average delay, thus cementing the fact that studies on average delay are not sufficient for providing useful QoS guarantees. Similar studies by Sahin et al.**Sahin et al., "HARQ-IR Performance over Gilbert-Elliott Channels with Rayleigh Fading"** focused on HARQ incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)**Akin et al., "Finite Blocklength Capacity in Fading Channels: Analysis and Optimisation"** and analyzed its performance over Gilbert-Elliott channels with Rayleigh fading. They modelled HARQ as a Markov chain where the fading coefficients were discretized into states, with decoding errors modelled as outages on these discrete thresholds.


All the works are either restricted to a single-process retransmission scheme or model the multi-process ARQ/HARQ using a single-server queue. 
These limitations worsen the modelling inaccuracies for systems with larger RTTs, and fail to address practical implementation aspects of slot-based 5G systems, where inescapable decoding complexity and non-negligible feedback delays over multiple transmissions significantly contribute to the DVP.
While some works, such as**Schiessl et al., "Finite Blocklength Capacity in Fading Channels: Analysis and Optimisation"**, include waiting delays in their analysis, they argue that cumulative transmission delays dominate the total delay. However, in slot-based 5G systems, even a single slot for decoding and feedback can constitute at least 50\% of the RTT, making this assumption less valid.
These studies are information-theoretic, lacking considerations for resource allocation and modulation and coding schemes (MCS), or are not sufficiently aligned with 3GPP specifications.
This limits their practical applicability, as real-world systems must account for the effects of resource allocation, coding schemes, and feedback delays on system performance.
