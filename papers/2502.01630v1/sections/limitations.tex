\section{Limitations}
Our work has several limitations. First, our constructed temporal reasoning benchmark consists of multiple-choice questions, while real multi-session dialogues involve users interacting with LLM agents in a generative manner. A benchmark that incorporates generative temporal reasoning questions could more accurately reflect the agents' reasoning abilities in practical scenarios. We plan to extend our current benchmark to support generative question-answering in future work.

Additionally, we observe that the LoCoMo dialogues contain some temporal ambiguities that can affect reasoning over related events. For instance, if a speaker mentions on a Tuesday that an event occurred "last Monday," it is unclear whether the event happened the previous day or on the Monday of the prior week. However, in real applications, LLM agents could potentially resolve such ambiguities by asking follow-up clarifying questions.
