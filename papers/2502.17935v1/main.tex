\begin{abstract}
  In-game team communication in online multiplayer games has shown the potential to foster efficient collaboration and positive social interactions. Yet players often associate communication within ad hoc teams with frustration and wariness. Though previous works have quantitatively analyzed communication patterns at scale, few have identified the motivations of how a player makes in-the-moment communication decisions. In this paper, we conducted an observation study with 22 \textit{League of Legends} players by interviewing them during Solo Ranked games on their use of four in-game communication media (chat, pings, emotes, votes). We performed thematic analysis to understand players' in-context assessment and perception of communication attempts. We demonstrate that players evaluate communication opportunities on proximate game states bound by player expectations and norms. Our findings illustrate players' tendency to view communication, regardless of its content, as a precursor to team breakdowns. We build upon these findings to motivate effective player-oriented communication design in online games.
