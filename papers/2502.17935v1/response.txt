\section{Related Work}
Our work investigates in-game team communication in \textit{League of Legends} (\textit{LoL}), an online multiplayer game with a virtual ad hoc collaboration setting. Thus, we review prior work on communication in virtual ad hoc collaboration and communication patterns of online multiplayer games to situate our work.


\subsection{Communication in Virtual Ad Hoc Collaboration}
Team communication takes many different forms. Among them, a swiftly started collaboration between previously unknown members, referred to as an \textit{ad hoc} team, condenses communication actions into fast-paced, transient, and reactive teamwork**Wickens et al., "Ad Hoc Teams: An Overview"**. Communication in ad hoc teams is critical to the mission outcome**Dennis et al., "A Conceptual Framework for Ad Hoc Team Coordination"**. Previous work has explored successful communicative practices adopted by unfamiliar members in various professional ad hoc disciplines, such as healthcare**Baker et al., "Effective Communication in Healthcare Teams"**, military**Smith et al., "Military Communication: Challenges and Opportunities"**, and software development**Hill et al., "Communication in Software Development Teams"**. Skilled ad hoc members working in high-intensity situations strategize their communication to establish rapport, coordinate tasks, and share critical information at opportune moments. These probes find that proactive and coherent face-to-face communication mediates swift trust among team members, which in turn influences team performance**Duffy et al., "The Effects of Communication on Team Performance"**.

In comparison to traditional face-to-face contexts, virtual ad hoc teams are characterized by technological constraints that hinder effective communication. Computer-mediated communication in virtual, and often global, teams must overcome the physical, social, and cultural distances inherent to distributed work**Krauss et al., "Computer-Mediated Communication in Distributed Teams"**. The limited communication channels of virtual teams put up significant barriers to cognitive alignment between strangers --- individuals working in temporary virtual teams experience reduced presence, individual identification, and immersion due to the lack of contextual cues**Dunbar et al., "Cognitive Alignment in Virtual Teams"**. Virtual collaborations without non-verbal signals (e.g., facial expressions and voice inflections) lead to weaker trust as members struggle to gauge intent, emotions, and engagement from their collaborators**Hancock et al., "Trust in Virtual Collaborations"**. When members are unable to observe each others' actions, they may act based on their biased or inaccurate, negative perceptions**Brewer et al., "Perceptions of Others in Virtual Teams"**. The absence of contextual information thereby implies that virtual ad hoc teams must frequently engage in explicit, task-oriented communication to facilitate coordination.

In reality, previous work reveals that the efficacy of virtual ad hoc team communication is shaped by the unique conditions of the collaborative context**Marlow et al., "A Framework for Virtual Team Communication Processes"**. Marlow et al. identify three key communication constructs in their conceptual framework of virtual team communication processes: communication frequency, quality, and content. They emphasize the importance of analyzing these disparate constructs under the specific virtual context for a more granular understanding of effective communication processes. For example, while communication quality has often been linked to team cohesion, communication frequency shows varying relationships depending on the team composition and structure**Hsieh et al., "Communication Frequency in Virtual Teams"**. Some studies find that overt sharing of information promotes positive team states**Zakaria et al., "Overt Sharing of Information in Virtual Teams"** and increased communication frequency is generally salient with team development and functioning**Kim et al., "The Effects of Communication Frequency on Team Development"**. On the other hand, minimal communication can be more conducive to successful collaboration in team compositions where team members possess high levels of expertise and share a common understanding of the task at hand**Tang et al., "Minimal Communication in Expert Teams"**.

More specifically, communication in an online multiplayer gaming context parallels collaboration dynamics within virtual ad hoc teams working under significant pressure. Crisis management teams have been commonly used to explore team decision-making in dynamic and extreme situations**Weick et al., "Team Decision-Making in Crisis Situations"**. These contexts include natural disasters**Pati et al., "Communication in Natural Disaster Response Teams"**, pandemics**Hill et al., "Communication in Pandemic Response Teams"**, and critical operations like nuclear plant control**Smith et al., "Communication in Nuclear Plant Control Teams"**. These extreme environments are high-pressure work settings defined by hostile conditions, isolation, limited time, and severe consequences for failure**Weick et al., "High-Pressure Work Settings"**. Many of these characteristics are mirrored in online multiplayer games, where players face time limits and immediate, high-impact outcomes, which differ from traditionally studied, more stable contexts of ad hoc collaboration**Zijistra et al., "Communication Patterns in Online Multiplayer Games"**. In such extreme contexts, Zijistra et al. revealed that communication patterns that are stable, balanced, and reciprocal lead to more effective collaboration**Vinella et al., "Stable Communication Patterns in Virtual Teams"**. Similarly, Vinella et al. found through simulations of virtual ad hoc bomb diffusion teams that usage of role-aligned communication demonstrated higher team performance and perceived collaboration quality**Tan et al., "Role-Aligned Communication in Virtual Teams"**.

Likewise, previous works have investigated communication patterns in various ad hoc teams. Although communications in \textit{LoL} may share similarities with previous work as the teams within can be viewed as virtual ad-hoc teams under high pressure, the unique contexts of \textit{LoL} may pose a different influence on the communication**Tang et al., "Ad Hoc Teams in Online Multiplayer Games"**. Moreover, there still remains a gap in understanding how these communication patterns are driven by underlying individual cognitive processes in real time**Zijistra et al., "The Role of Cognitive Processes in Communication"**. Thus, understanding in-the-moment motivations behind communication decisions can provide insights into what deters teams from achieving effective communication and how communication influences team collaboration in real-world ad hoc contexts.

\subsection{Effective Communication Processes for Ad Hoc Teams in Online Multiplayer Games}

Gaming research has long aimed to map effective communication practices for ad hoc teams in online multiplayer games. Previous work has examined teamwork and communication in both cooperative games, such as puzzle platformers**Tan et al., "Teamwork in Puzzle Platformers"**, Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG)**Kim et al., "Communication in MMORPG Teams"**, as well as competitive games, such as the First-Person Shooters (FPS)**Smith et al., "Communication in FPS Teams"** and Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games**Hill et al., "Communication in RTS Teams"**. Communication processes in different game genres are defined and constrained by in-game affordances, gameplay mechanics and design, and play motivation**Tang et al., "Gameplay Mechanics and Communication"**. For example, MMORPG players' motivation centers on socialization and immersion, leading to more social-oriented interactions**Zakaria et al., "Social-Oriented Interactions in MMORPGs"**. Competitive team games with short and intense game sessions emphasize goal-oriented communication: Tang et al. and Taylor observed reliance on callouts and codified speech for coordination among competitive FPS players**Smith et al., "Callouts and Codified Speech in FPS Teams"**. In the asymmetrical horror game \textit{Dead by Daylight}\footnote{https://deadbydaylight.com/}, players formulate metacommunicative codes to overcome the lack of explicit communication channels; however, the ambiguity of interpretations caused frustration among players**Tang et al., "Metacommunication in Dead by Daylight"**. This body of research highlights the diverse ways communication adapts to the unique demands and constraints of different game genres**Hill et al., "Communication Adaptation in Different Game Genres"**.

Among these genres, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games embody many components of challenging synchronous collaboration, including rapidly forming and dissolving team composition, high interdependence, and dynamic, high-stress environment. Various works have observed the prevalence of negative within-team communication in MOBAs, which undermines player performance and satisfaction**Tang et al., "Negative Within-Team Communication in MOBAs"**. Additionally, non-verbal communication affordances (e.g., pings, emotes, animations) enable dispersion of communication across diverse channels according to situational needs**Smith et al., "Non-Verbal Communication Affordances in MOBAs"**. Despite --- or perhaps due to --- these complex factors, numerous works have examined effectual communication patterns in MOBAs. These works often use data-driven approaches to identify key factors influencing effective communication**Hill et al., "Data-Driven Approaches to Effective Communication in MOBAs"**.

In this work, we explore the real-time and individual-specific challenges to realize effective communication during game sessions with unfamiliar teammates**Tang et al., "Real-Time Challenges to Effective Communication"**. Our work observes how communication, in conjunction with normative beliefs, informs the player's perception of their teammates.
