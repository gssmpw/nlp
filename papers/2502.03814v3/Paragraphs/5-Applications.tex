\section{Application}\label{sec:5-application}
The integration of LLMs into MRS has enabled advancements across a variety of application domains, each with unique challenges and opportunities. These applications leverage LLMs' capabilities in understanding, planning, and coordinating tasks, offering solutions ranging from indoor to outdoor scenarios. The adaptability of LLMs has driven innovation in tasks requiring precise navigation, task allocation, and dynamic decision-making, demonstrating their potential to address both structured and unstructured environments.

In this section, we categorize studies based on their application scenarios, focusing on two primary domains. First, the household domain highlights MRS addressing indoor challenges such as navigation, task decomposition, and object manipulation. These systems often emphasize collaboration among heterogeneous robots to execute intricate tasks, from identifying targets in multi-room settings to organizing household appliances. Second, applications in construction, formation, target tracking, and game illustrate the versatility of LLMs in specialized fields. These studies showcase MRS solving complex problems in outdoor or competitive environments, such as drone formations for search-and-rescue missions, robotic soccer strategies, and navigation in hazardous areas. Together, these domains underscore the growing impact of LLMs in advancing MRS capabilities across diverse real-world contexts.\\

\noindent \textbf{Household.} The household domain represents a significant focus in studies with well-defined application scenarios, addressing challenges such as navigation, task allocation, and task decomposition. For example, Wu \etal~\cite{wu_camon_2024} and Yu \etal~\cite{yu_co-navgpt_2023} investigated navigation and multi-target localization in complex indoor environments, such as identifying objects across multiple rooms, showcasing advancements in spatial awareness and adaptability. Furthermore, Mandi \etal~\cite{mandi_roco_2024}, Yu \etal~\cite{yu_mhrc_2024}, Kannan \etal~\cite{kannan_smart-llm_2024}, and Xu \etal~\cite{xu_scaling_2024} explored task decomposition and multi-robot collaboration to execute intricate tasks, such as preparing sandwiches or organizing dishwashers. Chen \etal~\cite{chen_scalable_2024} emphasized task allocation for heterogeneous MRS in multi-floor indoor settings, tackling coordination challenges in dynamic environments. Notably, they proposed an EMOS framework, an embodiment-aware operating system that facilitates effective collaboration among heterogeneous robots through a novel ``robot resume" approach, enabling robots to interpret their physical constraints from URDF files autonomously rather than relying on predefined roles. These studies address the temporal sequencing of subtasks while leveraging diverse robot capabilities, demonstrating the potential of MRS to solve complex, real-world problems in home environments.\\

\noindent\textbf{Others including Construction, Formation, Target Tracking and Game.}
Several studies focused on applications in open-world environments, highlighting the versatility and innovative potential of LLM-integrated robotic systems. For instance, Wang \etal~\cite{wang_dart-llm_2024} and Sueoka \etal~\cite{sueoka_adaptivity_nodate} explored the use of LLMs in orchestrating robotic systems for excavation and transportation tasks, showcasing their applicability in construction and complex terrain rescue operations. In drone formations applications, Lykov \etal~\cite{lykov2024flockgpt} emphasized the coordination and adaptability needed for outdoor tasks such as search-and-rescue missions and environmental monitoring. Similarly, Wu \etal~\cite{wu_hierarchical_2024} addressed open-world target tracking by integrating danger zone recognition, providing robust solutions for autonomous navigation in hazardous environments. These scenarios further demonstrate the potential of LLMs in dynamic and structured environments. Brienza \etal~\cite{brienza_llcoach_2024} introduced \textbf{LLCoach}, a framework for robotic soccer applications, where LLMs enhance strategic decision-making and team coordination. Collectively, these studies underscore the potential of LLM-driven MRS to tackle diverse and complex challenges across various domains.
