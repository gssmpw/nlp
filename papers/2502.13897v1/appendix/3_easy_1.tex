    \texttt{"prompt":} \texttt{"}Read the dataset (input file: \texttt{"}Fish.csv\texttt{"}). Encode the dataset to divide it into training and test sets. From the dataset's four categories of Bream, Roach, Parkki, and Perch, randomly select 2 samples from each category for the test set. The remaining samples will be used as the training set. Output the number of samples in the training and test sets in a CSV file named \texttt{"}sample\_counts.csv\texttt{"}.\\ \\ Next, implement the KNN algorithm with K values of 1, 5, 15, and 100 to classify all samples in the test set. Output the classification results of the test samples to a CSV file named \texttt{"}classification\_results.csv\texttt{"}.\texttt{"},
