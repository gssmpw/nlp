\textbf{Prompt}:\\
I currently have a structured dataset named date.csv with 6 columns and 5960 rows of data. The first column is named X, the second column is named Y, both of which are structural parameters set for simulation. The following four columns, ff, ft, tt, and tf, represent the simulation results. Now, I need to train a model that can accurately predict the four simulation results for other structural parameters. The model and related content will be saved in the results folder. The model should be saved as "model.pkl" and the final accuracy should be saved in "acc.txt".\\
