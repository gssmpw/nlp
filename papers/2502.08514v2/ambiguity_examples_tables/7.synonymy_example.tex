\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Ambiguous example: Emission Law}}
\newline
\textbf{Source document excerpt:}
The new legislation mandates that all vehicles sold after 2030 must be zero-emission models.
\newline
\textbf{Summary sentence:}
The recently passed law requires that automobiles available for purchase post-2030 be free from exhaust emissions.
\newline
\textbf{Explanation:}
This is a positive example of Synonymy/Paraphrasing because the summary sentence conveys the same meaning as the source, but uses different words and sentence structure. Terms like “legislation” become “law,” “vehicles” become“automobiles,” and “zero-emission” is paraphrased as “free from exhaust emissions.” While the core meaning remains the same, the extensive paraphrasing makes it more challenging to evaluate the factual accuracy of the summary, as an evaluator would need to carefully consider whether each paraphrased element truly maintains the original meaning.

\textbf{\textcolor{teal}{Non-ambiguous example: Exercise Benefits}}
\newline
\textbf{Source document excerpt:}
The research indicates that regular exercise can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
\newline
\textbf{Summary sentence:}
The study shows that frequent physical activity can greatly lower the chances of heart problems.
\newline
\textbf{Explanation:}
An annotator might be tempted to mark this as a Synonymy/Paraphrasing issue because several terms have been replaced with synonyms (e.g., “exercise” with “physical activity,” “reduce” with “lower”). However, this level of paraphrasing is not significant enough to affect the evaluability of the summary sentence. The changes are straightforward and commonly understood equivalents that don’t introduce any real ambiguity or difficulty in assessing the statement’s accuracy. While paraphrasing has occurred, it doesn’t meaningfully impact the ability to evaluate the factual accuracy of the summary.
