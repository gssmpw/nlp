You are given a document and a summary (summarizing only a part of the document). You will go over the document in the <doc></doc> tags carefully and try to understand it fully. Then you look at the summary in <summary></summary> tags carefully. Your task is to identify whether the summary is factually consistent with the given document. A summary is factually consistent with the document if it can be entailed (either stated or implied) by it.

    \%s
    \newline
    </summary>
    \newline
    \newline
    Determine if the summary is factually consistent with the document provided above. You should go over each sentence of the summary one by one and check whether there is an error or not. A summary is non-factual if there is at least one error in it. Provide your evaluation between <label></label> tags with values 1 (consistent) or 0 (inconsistent) and add your explanations in <explanation></explanation> XML tags.
