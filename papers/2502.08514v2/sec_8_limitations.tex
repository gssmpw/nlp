\section*{Limitations}
Our work has some limitations.
First, we have not used a large set of LLMs for our experiments as the primary goal of our work was to show the relative improvement of \method compared to other baseline settings with a specific LLM and how this approach can help with faithfulness evaluation regardless of the underlying LLM.
Second, our faithfulness evaluation is aimed at generating a final binary label for the non-ambiguous summaries for our choice of datasets. However, \method can be modified to ask for a faithfulness rating rather than a binary label. This can further improve the evaluation of summarizers on a finer-grained level. This can be a direction for future work.
Finally, ambiguity annotation is only done on sentence-level. More analysis is required to see whether ambiguities can span over a sentence.
% \sm{what is the IAA for the fine grained ambiguity taxonomy annotation? if it is low, it should be discussed here}.
