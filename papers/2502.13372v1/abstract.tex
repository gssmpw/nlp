While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations
from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all of
spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. 
%
We introduce \dslname{}, a motion verification DSL based on
first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a
motion graphics animation.
%
We identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use
to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions,
the relative positioning of objects, etc.).
%
We implement these properties as predicates in \dslname{} and provide an execution
engine that can apply a \dslname{} program to any input
SVG-based motion graphics animation.
%
%% pipeline
We then demonstrate how \dslname{} can be used in an LLM-based
synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations.
%
Given a text prompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding \dslname{} program. 
%
Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed
and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation.
%that supports iterative creation
%of motion graphics animations that better match a text prompt than
%one-shot methods.
%Our pipeline supports both human-in-the-loop and
%fully automatic iteration.
%
To evaluate our pipeline, we build a synthetic dataset of
5600 text prompts paired with 
ground truth \dslname{} verification programs.
%
We find that while our LLM-based pipeline is able to automatically generate a
correct motion graphics animation for 58.8\% of the test prompts
without any iteration, this number raises to 93.6\% with up to 50
correction iterations.
