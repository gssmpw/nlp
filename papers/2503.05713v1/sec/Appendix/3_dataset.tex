\section{Dataset Details}
\label{appendixdata}
The full list of songs we selected are detailed in Tables \ref{tab:en_list}, \ref{tab:zh_list}, \ref{tab:fr_list}, \ref{tab:ko_list}. The lyrics of these
songs will not be publicly released but will be available upon request for research purposes only, ensuring their appropriate use. The songs are selected from leaderboards on music platforms such as Apple Music, with release years ranging from 1930 to 2012. We manually ensure that all of the songs are copyright protected. U.S., China, France, and Korea are all signatories to the Berne Convention \cite{berne_convention}, which is an international treaty that ensures that works created in one member country are automatically protected by copyright in all other member countries without the need for formal registration \cite{ricketson2022international}. This means that a Chinese song is automatically protected by U.S. copyright law as soon as it is created and fixed in a tangible medium (e.g., recorded or written down).
