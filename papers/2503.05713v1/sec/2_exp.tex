\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Dataset}
We construct a multilingual dataset consisting of copyrighted song lyrics in four languages: English, Chinese, French, and Korean. Lyrics represent a distinct form of copyrighted content, differing notably from other text sources such as book chapters. They exhibit rhyming and repetitive patterns, which can influence model memorization and reproduction \cite{doi:10.1021/acsenergylett.2c02758}. Moreover, song lyrics are widely shared, discussed, and searched for on social media, forums, and dedicated lyrics websites, increasing their likelihood of being incorporated into the training data of language models.
Dataset details are presented in Appendix \ref{appendixdata}.

\subsection{Language Models}
For open-source models, we evaluate Meta’s Llama-3-70B \cite{meta2024llama3}, Mistral AI’s Mistral-7B \cite{jiang2023mistral} and Mixtral-8x7B \cite{jiang2024mixtral}. For API-based models, we test OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo \cite{openai2024chatgptapis} and GPT-4o \cite{openai2024gpt4o}, Anthropic’s Claude-3.5-Haiku \cite{anthropic2024claude3}, as well as Google’s Gemini-2.0 \cite{google2024gemini2}.
For prompt, we adopt direct probing using the format of "\textit{What are the lyrics of the song [TITLE] by [SINGER]?}" and instruct the LLM to respond in the language of the song. More details can be found in Appendix \ref{appendixa}.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Following previous works \cite{karamolegkou2023copyright, liu-etal-2024-shield}, we primarily use the Longest Common Substring (LCS) and ROUGE-L scores to measure the volume of verbatim reproduction. To assess the model’s ability to decline requests for copyrighted content, we adopt the Refusal Rate. Additionally, for models with low refusal rate, we leverage GPT-4o to further assess the Hallucination Rate, which quantifies the proportion of fabricated lyric in the lyric generated, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of potential copyright infringement. Details of the metrics can be found in Appendix \ref{appendixmetric}.
