\section{Conclusions and Limitations}
In this paper, we proposed neural flow shortcut samplers (\ours), a flow-based sampler that learns a velocity field to satisfy the continuity equation.
To estimate the intractable time derivative of the log-partition function in the continuity equation, we introduced velocity-driven Sequential Monte Carlo with control variates, effectively reducing estimation variance.
Our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to SOTA approaches like FAB and iDEM, while outperforming flow-based samples like LFIS, which suffers from high variance due to the utilisation of importance sampling.
We also discuss limitations and potential future work in \cref{sec:appendix-limit-future-work}.
