\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose ChineseEcomQA, a scalable question-answering benchmark designed to rigorously assess LLMs on fundamental e-commerce concepts. ChineseEcomQA is characterized by three core features: Focus on Fundamental Concept, E-Commerce Generalizability, and Domain-Specific Expertise, which collectively enable systematic evaluation of LLMs' e-commerce knowledge. Leveraging ChineseEcomQA, we conduct extensive evaluations on mainstream LLMs, yielding critical insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our findings not only highlight performance disparities across models but also delineate actionable directions for advancing LLM applications in the e-commerce domain.
