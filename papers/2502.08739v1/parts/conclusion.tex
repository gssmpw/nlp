\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

We performed a structured study of real faults reported in open-source Hybrid Quantum-Classical architectures. Current instances of such architectures are concentrated around NISQ algorithms such as  Variational Quantum Eigensolvers and
Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithms. We designed and validated a search query and defined rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria. We analysed
5000 closed issues on GitHub and selected 529 of them. 
 We validated the results externally in two rounds with two independent groups of experts through semi-structured interviews and surveys, respectively. These led to updates and additions to the documented faults and their classification. 


We plan to incorporate our dataset into a toolbox for generating faulty implementations of Hybrid Quantum-Classical architectures. This will serve as a means for evaluating future techniques for testing, quality assurance, and repair of such architectures, which is a direction of our ongoing research. We would like to further investigate other views that can be used to classify our dataset of real faults. \break
