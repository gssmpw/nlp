\paragraph{Internal Threats} 
An internal threat to validity are the potential biases in data processing. To mitigate it, we cross-validated the results between two authors, as well as with two independent groups of domain experts through interviews and a validation survey, respectively. The interview questions remained general to avoid leading the interviewees towards our taxonomy. We insisted on balancing the profiles of interviewees to represent diverse views. We decided to represent our dataset in a structural taxonomy. However, different representations may be considered, for instance around the symptoms and common patterns in the labels, creating a multi-view taxonomy in the future. 
%; this will constitute future work.

\paragraph{External Threats}
Hybrid Quantum-Classical architectures are relatively new, and their  implementations undergo constant revisions. It is challenging to capture structural faults not solely caused by the evolving  implementations. It is also challenging to know to what extent our taxonomy can be generalised to future architectures. While we expect that noise-related problems  may be mitigated, other faults in this taxonomy inherent to the hybrid classical-quantum architecture should remain relevant.
