\subsection{Proof for Satisfaction of Marginal Constraints.}
% In this section, we will first show that our procedure satisfying the marginal conditions for our coupling $q(\rvx_0, \rvx_1)$:
% \begin{equation}
%     \int q(\rvx_0, \rvx_1) d\rvx_1 = q_0(\rvx_0), \int q(\rvx_0, \rvx_1) d\rvx_0 = q_1(\rvx_1).
% \end{equation}

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item For independent couple $q(x_0) = \int q(\mathcal{S}) \int q(x_1 | \mathcal{S}) q(x_0) dx_0 d_\mathcal{S}$ and $q(x_1) = \int q(\mathcal{S}) \int q(x_1 | \mathcal{S}) q(x_0) dx_1 d_\mathcal{S}$, we just need to show $\int q(x_0, x_1 | \mathcal{S}) dx_0 = q(x_1 | \mathcal{S})$ and $\int q(x_0, x_1 | \mathcal{S}) dx_1 = q(x_0)$.
%     \item $q(x_0, x_1 | \mathcal{S})$ is independent, so we can decompose it into $\prod q(x_0^i, x_1^i | \mathcal{S})$.
%     \item we can show $\int q(x_0^i, x_1^i | \mathcal{S}) dx_0 = q(x_1^i | \mathcal{S})$ and $\int q(x_0^i, x_1^i | \mathcal{S}) dx_0 = q(x_1^i)$
%     \item $q(x_0| \mathcal{S})$ and $q(x_1| \mathcal{S})$ are independent, so we can decompose it into $\prod q(x_1^i | \mathcal{S})$ and $\prod q(x_0^i)$.
%     \item The first part is done.
%     \item The second part is to show adding noise will not affect $q(x_0^i)$

% \end{itemize}

% In particular, the proof will be divided into four parts.
% %
% First, we will introduce the main theorem to apply to obtain the results, and show the random subsampling of a Dense Gaussian noise will converge to Gaussian distribution if the sample superset is large enough.
% %
% Second, by a proper construction, we can show that subsampling of a dense point superset can converge to direct subsampling of the surfaces when the size of the superset is also large enough.
% %
% Third, by considering our random subsampling procedure, we can show that our sampling is still random subsampling for Gaussian noise superset and point superset.
% %
% Lastly, we show that even introduction of the coupling interpolation, the results mariginal remain the same due to careful considerations.
