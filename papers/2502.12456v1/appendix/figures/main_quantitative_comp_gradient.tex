Quantitative comparisons of generation quality for our framework against the training pairs obtained by 1-step Wasserstein Gradient Flow. 
%
We also show 1-NNA-CD (top) and 1-NNA-EMD (bottom) for Chair (left), Airplane (middle), and Car (right).
%
% We present evaluation metrics across various inference steps, \ie, from 1 steps to 100 steps, for five methods: (i) ours, (ii) diffusion model with v-prediction~\cite{salimans2022progressive}, and three flow matching models with different coupling methods: (iii) independent coupling~\cite{lipman2022flow}, (iv) Minibatch OT ~\cite{tong2023improving,pooladian2023multisample}, and (v) Equivariant OT~\cite{song2024equivariant,klein2024equivariant}.
%
Note that a value closer to $50\%$ indicates better performance.
