\para{Score-based Generative Models.} 
% \ednote{Is there a name to summarize all these models?}
Recently, diffusion models~\cite{sohl2015deep,ho2020denoising, song2019generative} have gained popularity in generating data of various formats, especially
images~\cite{rombach2022high,ramesh2022hierarchical} and videos~\cite{blattmann2023stable,videoworldsimulators2024}.
%
These generative models employ an iterative process to transform a known distribution, typically a Gaussian, into a desired data distribution.
%
\citet{song2020score} demonstrate that these models can be generalized to a continuous time setting, solving an SDE with an ODE that shares the same marginal.
%
\citet{lipman2022flow} train a vector field to trace a linear interpolation between training pairs from data and noise distribution (further details in Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}). %$(\rvx_0, \rvx_1)$ sampled randomly from noise and data distributions.
%
%The resulting trained field also defines an ODE trajectory that directly transforms noise into data samples (further details in Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}).
% Similar to the ODE approach, Flow Matching~\cite{lipman2022flow} was recently introduced to estimate a vector field, which is used to define a trajectory to move noises directly to data samples (details to be covered in Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}).
%
We also focus on the flow matching models and aim to employ them effectively for 3D point cloud generation.

\para{Relation of Flow Matching with Optimal Transport (OT).}
Flow matching is closely related to the Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which aims to find a map with minimal transport cost between two distributions.
% The Optimal Transport (OT) problem aims to define a coupling between two distributions so that a transport cost can be minimized, and the Flow Matching model has been shown to have a close connection with the OT problem.
%
As for flow matching, the trajectory flows can be taken to define the map that solves the OT problem.
%By pairing the endpoints of a trajectory from a flow matching model, we can define a map that solves the OT problem.
%
However, when the flow models are trained with random pairs, the trajectories are usually curved, so using pairs from the OT map can lead to straighter trajectories that improve the efficiency, as~\citet{pooladian2023multisample,tong2023improving} show.
%Although this trajectory forms a valid map, it is typically highly curved when trained with random pairs.
%
%\cite{pooladian2023multisample,tong2023improving} shows that training the model with pairs from the OT map results in straighter trajectories.
Since the OT map is usually unavailable, various methods are introduced to obtain better training pairs as we discuss in Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}.
%
%The first approach is to approximate the OT map so that more optimal train pairs can be sampled (to be discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}).

% OT map.
%
% Minibatch OT~\cite{pooladian2023multisample,tong2023improving} solves a discrete OT at the batch level to reduce transport distances between the pairs, whereas

% %Additionally, 
% Equivariant OT~\cite{song2024equivariant,klein2024equivariant} considers invariant group elements specifically for molecular data.
%particular data, such as molecules, to obtain more optimal training pairs.
%
Another approach to obtain better pairs is to iteratively straighten the trajectory from a flow matching model.
%
Rectified Flow~\cite{liu2022flow} obtains training pairs by simulating ODE trajectories of pre-trained models.
% \phil{TODO: why not talk about Rectified Flow first according to the publication time?} \ednote{Because I want to highlight the difference of this approach from our which is not our focus.}
%
However, this involves an expensive ODE simulation and introduces errors in the straightening process.
%
In this work, we mainly study the limitations of existing OT solutions on the first approach and derive a new solution that is specific for point cloud generation.
% aim to develop an OT approximation procedure without replying on simulation, specifically for point cloud generation.

\para{3D Point Cloud Generation.}
Point cloud generation has been studied extensively using various generative models including VAEs~\cite{kim2021setvae}, \rebuttal{Energy-based models~\cite{xie2021generative}}, GANs~\cite{achlioptas2018learning,shu20193d,li2021sp}, and flow-based models~\cite{yang2019pointflow,kim2020softflow}.
%
Recently, diffusion models~\cite{zeng2022lion,zhou2021pvd,luo2021diffusion,pang2024SE3,zhao2025decompose} have achieved great success in producing high-quality generation results. 
%
However, these methods often ignore point clouds' permutation-invariant nature \rebuttal{in training} by treating them as high-dimensional flat vectors.
%
PSF~\cite{wu2023psf} uses Rectified flow~\cite{liu2022flow} to generate point clouds, addressing permutation issues implicitly through flow straightening.
%
This approach is computationally expensive due to multiple sample inferences needed for constructing training pairs.
%
In this work, we focus on constructing an efficient, high-quality OT approximation for permutation-invariant point cloud generation \rebuttal{based on the flow matching models}.
