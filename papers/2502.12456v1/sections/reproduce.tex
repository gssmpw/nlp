\section{Reproducibility Statement}
We demonstrate our efficiency in enabling the reproduction of this work's results.
%
In particular, we describe the dataset (ShapeNet~\cite{chang2015shapenet}) and the data splits employed in training and evaluation of this work in Section~\ref{sec:experiment}.
%
We also cover the evaluation protocol used in this work for assessing performance.
%
Additionally, we include implementation details, such as training specifics, network architecture, and shape normalization for evaluation in Appendix~\ref{sec:implementation_details}.
%
Lastly, we outline the procedure of our superset computation and describe the hyperparameter choices in Appendix~\ref{subsec:approx_details}.
