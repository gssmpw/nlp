\para{Baselines.} 
We evaluate against the same baselines from Figure~\ref{fig:main_quantitative_comp} for the shape completion task.


\para{Quantitative Comparisons.}
Figure~\ref{fig:completion_comp} (left) shows the evaluation metrics (CD \& EMD) against various inference steps.
%
We observe that our model can achieve reasonable generation quality with only five inference steps, while other approaches typically require about 50 steps to obtain similar quality.
%
For Equivariant OT, it can produce comparable performance to our approach at two inference steps but fails to improve further with additional steps.
%
Minibatch OT shows poor metrics, even with inference steps, as its batch-level OT is computed under different partial shapes. 
%
This violates assumptions that OT should be computed between training instances with the same condition.

\para{Qualitative Comparisons.}
We present a visualization of shape completion results for various methods in Figure~\ref{fig:completion_comp} (right).
%
Our approach produces a reasonable-looking shape with only five inference steps, while other methods still generate noisy shapes.
%
Furthermore, Minibatch OT generates a shape that does not correspond to the input due to violating the training assumption. 
%
Equivariant OT fails to produce shapes of similar visual quality even with increased inference steps.
