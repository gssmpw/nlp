\section{Method}

In Section~\ref{subsec:preliminaries}, we begin by covering preliminaries of training a continuous normalizing flow and recent OT flows.
%
Section~\ref{subsec:points_challenges} explores the challenges of applying existing OT approximation methods to 3D point clouds.
% In Section~\ref{subsec:points_challenges}, we then examine the nature of 3D shapes represented as point clouds and 
% study the challenges of directly applying existing OT approximation methods.
%
To tackle these challenges, we introduce our approximate OT approach in Section~\ref{subsec:ot_approx} that precomputes OT maps in an offline fashion, and in Section~\ref{subsec:coupling_interpolation}, we explore a simple hybrid and less optimal coupling approach that makes target flows easier to learn.
%
% Using a more optimal map can lead to a straighter path, but the trained flow model becomes more Lipschitz in earlier steps, resulting in poorer performance.
%worse generation results.
% doing so makes the training flows more challenging \phil{TODO: any better word than challenging? which sounds vague here}.
%
%To mitigate this difficulty
%Concerning this, We introduce a hybrid coupling method, blending OT map with independent coupling, for a straighter generation path while maintaining quality (Section~\ref{subsec:coupling_interpolation}).
% Concerning this, we introduce a method to construct a less ``optimal'' hybrid coupling by blending our OT map with independent coupling, enabling a relatively straight generation path while maintaining high-quality generation (Section~\ref{subsec:coupling_interpolation}).
% \phil{TODO: instead of interpolation, how about ``we introduce a method to blend between the OT map and independent coupling''?  The word ``interpolation'' seems to hint a smoothly-varying weight, leading one to misunderstand the process as having a weight that is smoothly varying from 0 to 1 during the training.  This doesn't match the method in Sec 3.4, right?}
%
%We demonstrate that by selecting an appropriate blending
% phil{TODO: blending?} 
%parameter, we can achieve a straighter generation path while maintaining high-quality generation.

% \phil{TODO (To NOTE): if the contents in the above paragraph overlap too much with those in the introduction, we may greatly shorten it.}
