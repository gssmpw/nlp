Comparison of OT Approximation Methods. % measured over 32 training batches.
%
\textbf{Left:} Average OT distance across batch sizes. Minibatch OT (blue) fails to reduce distances much compared to independent coupling (red dash). Equivariant OT (orange) significantly reduces distance values.
%
%We also show the OT distance obtained our OT approximation method (detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:ot_approx}).
Our OT approximation is on par with Equivariant OT.
%
\textbf{Right:} Computational time for OT across batch sizes. Minibatch OT (blue) maintains a reasonable computational time ($\sim$1 second) with batch size $B=256$. Equivariant OT (orange) grows quadratically starting from 2.2 seconds with $B=1$.
%
%Note that we only consider permutations in Equivariant OT.
