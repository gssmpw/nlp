  Comparisons with other training paradigms on the shape completion task.

  Left: Quantitative comparisons with other alternatives using different inference steps.
  Right: Qualitative comparisons with other methods show the completion generated by 2, 5, and 100 steps, respectively. 
  % \CL{The plots to the left: The captions and insets are too small- can we make the two plots and the texts larger? 'CD' and 'EMD' not aligned vertically}
  % \av{it would be nice if the fonts for the plots on the left side were larger.}
