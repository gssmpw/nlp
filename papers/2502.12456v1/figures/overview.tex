    	\caption{Different coupling types between Gaussian noise (left) and point clouds (right), \rebuttal{where coupled noise and surface points share the same color}:
%
(a) Independent Coupling randomly maps noises to point clouds.
%
(b) Minibatch OT computes OT map in batches of noises and point clouds.
%
(c) Equivariant OT follows the similar minibatch OT but aligns points via permutation.
%
(d) Our approach precomputes dense OT on data and noise supersets, then subsamples it to couple point clouds with slightly perturbed noise.
%
\rebuttal{Note that only (c) and (d) can produce high-quality OT.}
