Quantitative comparisons with other point cloud generation methods using 1-NNA-CD (top) and 1-NNA-EMD metrics (bottom) for Chair (left), Airplane (middle), and Car (right).
%
We present evaluation metrics across various inference steps,~\ie, from 1 step to 100 steps, for five methods: (i) ours, (ii) PVD~\cite{zhou2021pvd}, (iii) LION~\cite{zeng2022lion}, (iv) PSF~\cite{wu2023psf} without rectified flow, and (v) DiT-3D~\cite{mo2023dit3d}.
%
% Note that values closer to $50\%$ indicate better performance. 
% Exact numerical values for the plots are provided in the Appendix. 
% \av{it would be nice if we could use large font sizes for legends, axis labels, figure titles.}
