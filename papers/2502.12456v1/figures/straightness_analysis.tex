Analysis of trajectory straightness using different couplings to obtain training pairs.
%
Left: We plot the square norm of the difference between successive vector fields, i.e., $|| v_{\theta, t+1}(x_{t+1}) - v_{\theta, t}(x_t) ||$, as a measure of trajectory curvature.
%
Right (a-c): Trajectory samples obtained by models trained with (a) independent coupling, (b) our OT approximation, and (c) our hybrid coupling with $\beta = 0.2$.
%
Note that we subsample the point cloud to 30 points for a better trajectory visualization. 
% \av{the fonts on the figures are too small.} \ednote{The legend is still small. To be fixed after rendering.}
