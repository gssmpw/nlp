\section{Semi-Structured Interview Guides}\label{a-interview-guides}
\textit{All participants were first provided with a brief introduction to the study, offered a chance to ask questions, and asked for their informed consent to participate and be recorded:}
\newline\newline\noindent Thank you for taking the time to join this Zoom! [Interviewer introduces themselves.] I am asking you to participate in a research study intended to help us understand how educators and edtech providers are conceptualizing and measuring the potential risks posed by the use of large language models in education, with the goal of creating an educator-centered framework to guide the development of future edtech tools. If you consent to participate in this study, you will be asked to participate in a 30-to-45-minute interview about how you conceive of and measure potential risks posed by the use of large language models in education. We will also create an audio-video recording of the Zoom meeting for the purposes of creating a de-identified transcript of our conversation. Following the transcription, we will destroy the Zoom media recording. The de-identified transcript will be stored securely. Participation in this study is completely voluntary. We do not anticipate any risks associated with participation, and there are no benefits other than contributing to our understanding of this topic. Do you have any questions about this study that I can answer? Do you consent to participate in this research? 
\newline\newline\noindent \textit{Next, we asked a separate set of questions of edtech providers and educators. Because we followed a semi-structured interview process, not all interviewees were asked all questions, the question order varied across interviews, and some interviewees were asked follow-ups not listed here in response to statements that they made.}

        \item Information hazards: concerns related to privacy or students sharing sensitive information
        \item Socioeconomic harms: students of different backgrounds being differentially-equipped to make use of the tool    \end{itemize}
    \item If tool has been deployed, are there any additional risks that you identified post-deployment? 
\end{itemize}

Risk Measurement and Mitigation:
