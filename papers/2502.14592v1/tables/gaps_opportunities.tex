\Description{A table summarizing the mitigation strategies that edtech providers and educators reported practicing to address harms from LLMs in education. To address toxic or biased content, privacy violations, and hallucinations, edtech providers rely on: 
(1) human oversight, (2) technical guardrails, and (3) limiting their use of LLMs. Educators (1) mediate student interaction with tools by: (a) critiquing LLM outputs, (b) training students on safe LLM use, and (c) reviewing LLM-generated content before it reaches students; and (2) limit their use of LLMs. To address academic dishonesty, edtech providers use technical guardrails. Educators (1) mediate student interaction with tools by: (a) directly addressing suspected academic dishonesty and (b) changing teaching practices to account for AI capabilities; and (2) rely on technical guardrails including : (a) AI detectors and (b) lockdown browsers. To address the harm of inhibiting student learning, edtech providers measure tool helpfulness by: (a) reviewing user feedback, (b) A/B testing users' academic performance, and (c) performing risk-benefit analysis. Educators (1) mediate student interaction with tools by providing opportunities to critique LLM outputs or consider alternate solutions to those proposed by LLMs and limiting their use of LLMs. Edtech providers did not report mitigation strategies for addressing the harm of inhibiting student social development; educators reported limiting their use of LLMs. Neither group reported mitigation strategies for increasing educator workload. Edtech providers did not report mitigation strategies for addressing the harm of decreasing educator autonomy; educators reported educating themselves on the LLM ecosystem by: (a) attending professional development sessions or external courses and (b) conducting independent research. Neither group reported mitigation strategies for exacerbating systemic inequalities in education.}
