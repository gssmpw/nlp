\caption{Potential harms from LLM-based edtech that edtech providers and educators proactively raised (i.e., mentioned in response to an open-ended question and not a direct prompt) at least once. While technical harms and human-LLM interaction harms were salient to both edtech providers and educators, harms from broader impacts were more salient to educators.}

\Description{A table summarizing the concerns that edtech providers and educators independently raised about potential harms from LLMs in education (i.e., without being specifically prompted about the harm). The harms raised independently by both edtech providers and educators were: toxic or biased content, privacy violations, hallucinations, academic dishonesty, and inhibiting student learning. The harms raised independently only by educators were: inhibiting student social development, increasing educator workload, decreasing educator autonomy, and exacerbating systemic inequalities in education.}
