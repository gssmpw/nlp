abstract = {Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method of system discovery that has been shown to successfully recover governing dynamical systems from data [6], [39]. Recently, several groups have independently discovered that the weak formulation provides orders of magnitude better robustness to noise. Here we extend our Weak SINDy (WSINDy) framework introduced in [28] to the setting of partial differential equations (PDEs). The elimination of pointwise derivative approximations via the weak form enables effective machine-precision recovery of model coefficients from noise-free data (i.e. below the tolerance of the simulation scheme) as well as robust identification of PDEs in the large noise regime (with signal-to-noise ratio approaching one in many well-known cases). This is accomplished by discretizing a convolutional weak form of the PDE and exploiting separability of test functions for efficient model identification using the Fast Fourier Transform. The resulting WSINDy algorithm for PDEs has a worst-case computational complexity of O(ND+1log⁡(N)) for datasets with N points in each of D+1 dimensions. Furthermore, our Fourier-based implementation reveals a connection between robustness to noise and the spectra of test functions, which we utilize in an a priori selection algorithm for test functions. Finally, we introduce a learning algorithm for the threshold in sequential-thresholding least-squares (STLS) that enables model identification from large libraries, and we utilize scale invariance at the continuum level to identify PDEs from poorly-scaled datasets. We demonstrate WSINDy's robustness, speed and accuracy on several challenging PDEs. Code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/MathBioCU/WSINDy_PDE.}

    abstract = {Equation discovery aims to directly extract physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain in nonlinear systems. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require handcrafted representation rules and complex optimization algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically extracting governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse candidate equations in string form and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. The best equations are preserved and further refined iteratively using the reasoning capacity of LLMs. We propose two alternately iterated strategies to collaboratively optimize the generated equations. The first strategy uses LLMs as a black-box optimizer to achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy instructs LLMs to perform evolutionary operations for a global search. Experiments are conducted on various nonlinear systems described by partial differential equations, including the Burgers equation, the Chafee–Infante equation, and the Navier–Stokes equation. The results demonstrate that our framework can discover correct equations that reveal the underlying physical laws. Further comparisons with state-of-the-art models on extensive ordinary differential equations showcase that the equations discovered by our framework possess physical meaning and better generalization capability on unseen data.},
