\section{Conclusion}
We derived asymptotically tight finite-time bounds on the mean square error for the two-time-scale stochastic approximation, without PR averaging, driven by martingale noise. 
This was used to obtain finite-time bounds on the Wasserstein-1 distance between their Polyak-Ruppert averages and a Gaussian limit, which provides a non-asymptotic central limit theorem for TSA-PR. 
An important theoretical implication of our result is that it provides the first $n^{-1/2}$ finite-time bound on the expected error, which closes the gap between rates achievable for single- and two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms.
