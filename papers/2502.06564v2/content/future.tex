\section{Related Work and Future Directions}

\subsection{Related Work}
We refer to \cite{DK_book} for a survey on the area of high-dimensional robust statistics. The following is a non-exhaustive selection of related work.

The filtering algorithm was proposed in \cite{DiakonikolasKK016}, and was especially useful in the Gaussian setting for various robust estimation problems. Sum-of-squares was first used in robust statistics in \cite{KS17} and \cite{HL18}. Apart from robust covariance estimation, sum-of-squares approach in robust statistics was used for robust mean estimation \cite{KS17, pmlr-v167-kothari22a, robust-sparse-mean-estimation, neurips-symmetric}, robust regression \cite{KlivansKM18, robust-regression-bakshi, liu2024robust}, robust sparse and tensor PCA \cite{d2023higher}, robust clustering \cite{HL18, BDH+20, BDH+22, dmitriev2024robust}.

%Fast algorithms for robust estimations were developed for robust mean estimation \cite{fast}, robust covariance estimation \cite{fast-covariance}, robust PCA \cite{fast-pca}.


\subsection{Future Directions}

As was mentioned before, one promising direction is optimizing the sample complexity of robust PCA for elliptical distributions. 

Another promising direction is to determine whether it is possible to estimate the \emph{location} parameter with $\poly(d)$ samples in time $\poly(d)$ up to error $\tilde{O}(\e)$. For spherically symmetric distributions it was done in \cite{neurips-symmetric}. However, it is not clear how to use our result in their analysis. There are several things that do not work with their analysis if the distribution is not exactly spherically symmetric. As an example, as a part of their analysis, they show a lower bound for all small enough vectors $\Delta$:
\[
\sum_{i\in J} f(x_i + \Delta)f(x_i + \Delta)^\top \succeq \E f(x)f(x) - \tilde{O}(\e)\Id_d\,,
\]
where $f_j: x_{ij}\mapsto f_j(x_{ij})$ are bounded  Lipschitz functions (applied entry-wise), and $J$ is a subset of $[n]$ of size at least $(1-\e)n$.
For spherically symmetric $x$, it is possible to condition on the absolute values, and use the fact that the signs are independent of absolute values and are iid. It implies that that the conditional distribution is sub-Gaussian, and it is enough to derive this bound. However, if $x$ is elliptical and not exactly spherically symmetric, this argument does not work. 

Although it is not clear to us how to extend the analysis to the non-spherical setting, we conjecture that nearly optimal and efficient\footnote{\cite{chen2018robust} showed that \emph{Tukey's median} estimator (computable in exponential time) $O(\e)$-close to the location (in Huber's contamination model).} estimation of the location parameter should be possible.
