MARL has been applied in many real-world applications such as finance, transportation, manufacturing ____ as well as chemistry and biology ____. For instance, ____ introduced a simulation environment to model dynamic interactions among governments, households, firms, and financial intermediaries. ____ utilized a cooperative MARL approach to control the traffic signals in different road networks. 


MARL has also been used to solve the route choice problems considering different aspects of the problem. ____ explored Q-learning for route selection, emphasizing reward-shaping techniques aiming to eliminate traffic congestion. Another study approached route choice as a congestion game aiming for a collective equilibrium in the traffic network ____. ____ proposed a regret-minimization approach ____ that relies on external traffic data, which may limit its applicability in scenarios where such information is incomplete or inaccurate. In a different vein, ____ addressed route choice in a centralized multi-agent setting using a macroscopic traffic simulation. ____ address the route assignment problem to develop policies for CAVs that prevent unbounded delays in traffic networks. ____ introduced AV-specific behavioral reward formulations in mixed-traffic environments.
