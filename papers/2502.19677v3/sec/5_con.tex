\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a differential handling network (DHNet) aimed at accurately deblurring images by processing different blur regions. Specifically, we design a DHBlock consisting of VBlock and DDRE. The VBlock utilizes the Volterra kernel  to explore non-linearity within the network to map complex input-output relationships. Meanwhile, the DDRE integrates prior knowledge from a well-trained model to estimate spatially variable blur information, allowing the router to map the learned degradation representation and assign weights to experts based on the degree of degradation and the size of the regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our DHNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
