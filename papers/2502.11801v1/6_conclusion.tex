\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose the 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for inpainting real-world 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. With the conduction of our Inferring Depth-Guided Inpainting Masks, we are allowed to obtain precise inpainting masks by considering rendered depth maps and visible background information from other views. With these depth-guided inpainting masks properly obtained, our Inpainting-guided 3DGS Refinement optimizes a newly initialized 3DGS model and performs 3D inpainting simultaneously. In our experiments, we quantitatively and qualitatively show that our 3DGIC is able to handle scenes with various ranges of camera views and perform favorably against existing 3D inpainting approaches.
