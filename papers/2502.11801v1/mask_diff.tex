    \caption{\textbf{How inpainting masks affect 2D Inpaint results.} We can see that using the original object mask (red branch) for inpainting creates inconsistent content against the visible area. On the contrary, our mask (blue branch) locates only the area not seen by other views, providing a more reliable inpainting result.
