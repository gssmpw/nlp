When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes. %Our 3DGIC is composed of two unique stages: Inferring Depth-Guided Inpainting Masks and 3D Inpainting with Cross-View Consistency. The former produces depth-guided inpainting masks by observing background contents across different views, while the latter performs 3D inpainting with cross-view consistency for updating newly initialized Gaussians. 
Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.
