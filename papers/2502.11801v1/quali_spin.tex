    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative results on the SPIn-NeRF~\cite{mirzaei2023spin} dataset.} Two different views of the same scene are shown for each inpainting example. We compare rendering results against MVIP-NeRF~\cite{chen2024mvip}, MALD-NeRF~\cite{lin2024maldnerf}, and GScream~\cite{wang2024gscream}. We can see from the regions highlighted by the red boxes that our 3DGIC performs better in terms of multi-view consistency and rendering fidelity
