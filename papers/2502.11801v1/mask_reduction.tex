    Taking $\{I_1, M_1\}$ at view $\xi_1$ as an example reference view, the original background region $I^B_1$ can be first produced. We then project the background region $I^B_2$ from $\xi_2$ to $\xi_1$, updating ${I'}^B_1$ and the associated inpainting mask $M'_1$. By repeating this process across camera views, the final inpainting mask $M'_1$ contains only the regions that are \textit{not} visible at any training camera views.}
