\section{Claude-Specific Engineering} \label{Claude-SI}
While both of Claude's Sonnet models achieved poor performance during the robustness experiment, it can be noted that a single common error arose consistently. When running an NPT simulation, MDCrow requires that all parameters be passed to the simulation tool. However, both Sonnet models consistently neglected to provide a value for pressure, even when directly prompted to do so. The \texttt{claude-3-opus} made this mistake a single time. This is a relatively simple fix, providing MDCrow with a default pressure of 1 atm when no pressure is passed.

    \caption{Performance of MDCrow with three Claude models on 10 tasks. As the number of subtasks increase, we all subtasks completed for both prompt types. The top row shows MDCrow's performance as-is, and the bottom row shows MDCrow's performance when given a direct fix for missing parameters. There is a clear change in performance after the fix for both \texttt{claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022} and \texttt{claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620}.}

As can be seen in Figure \textbf{\ref{fig:SI_claude}}, including this fix drastically improves the performance of these models, with performance comparable to the top models. However, no other models made this mistake, and no other model-specific optimization was conducted. Thus, for all experiments shown in this paper, MDCrow does not accommodate this Claude-specific missing parameter fix.
