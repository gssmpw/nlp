\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Microarchitecture reverse engineering}
The conditional and indirect branch predictors on Intel and AMD x86 CPUs have been extensively reverse engineered for microarchitectural attack research~\cite{HornSpectre,Kocher2018spectre,JumpOverAslr,SetAndForget,ExploreBranchPredictor,Indirector}, software defense against branch-based side-channel attacks~\cite{HalfAndHalf}, and better microarchitectural understanding~\cite{Demystifying,VladimirPaper,VladimirThesis}.
Apple's M-Series CPUs have received significantly less attention.
Researchers have reversed engineered some details of the M1's microarchitectures~\cite{M1Explore,DougallM1} and well as its memory-dependent prefetcher~\cite{Augury,gofetch}, but to our knowledge, the structure of the M1's BPU has not been explored.
Our reverse engineering methodology is similar to that of prior work on Intel BPUs~\cite{HornSpectre,VladimirPaper,HalfAndHalf,Indirector}, but adapted to the unique aspects of the M1, such as unavailability of Hyper-Threading for executing the two experimental paths.



\paragraph{Spectre attacks on Apple's M-Series CPUs}
Hetterich and Schwarz~\cite{BranchDifferent} and Leaky.page~\cite{leakyPage} demonstrated the feasibility of Spectre v1 attacks
on the M-Series CPUs.
PACMAN used a Spectre v1-like attack to leak kernel pointer authentication code (PAC~\cite{PAC}) verification results to userspace~\cite{Pacman}.
Spook.js~\cite{spookjs} and iLeakage~\cite{iLeakage} mounted in-browser Spectre v1 attacks.
These attacks all employ \emph{in-place} mistraining~\cite{canella2019systematic} (i.e., training the victim branch by invoking it), whereas our work enables out-of-place mistraining.

\paragraph{Mitigations}
Out-of-place mistraining of the indirect branch predictor has been mitigated in hardware by introducing BPU flushing mechanisms~\cite{ibrs,csv2} or by isolating entries of different security domains~\cite{AppleSecurityPatent,ExynosBPU}.
To our knowledge, no such mechanisms are available for the conditional branch predictor.
Half\&Half~\cite{HalfAndHalf} is a software-only approach for partitioning the conditional branch predictor into isolated halves (e.g., user-level and OS kernel), but it is applicable only to Intel CPUs.
