The problem of differentially private moments (and the related problem of covariance estimation) has a rich history of development, with optimal results known in the central model of privacy \citep{smith2011privacy} as well as the \emph{local model of privacy}~\citep{duchi2013local}, and also in the worst-case setting. \citet{dp_covariance_wishart_dist} proposes three differentially private algorithms for approximating the second-moment matrix, each ensuring positive definiteness. The related setting of covariance estimation has been studied in the worst-case setting when the data comes from a bounded $\ell_2$ ball by several works for approximate differential privacy~\citep{achlioptas2007fast, blum2005practical, dwork2014analyze, mangoubi2022re,mangoubi2023private,upadhyay2018price} with the works of \citet{dp_covariance} and \citet{kapralov2013differentially} presenting a pure differentially private algorithm. %

Covariance estimation is also used as a subroutine in mean-estimation work under various distributional assumptions~\citep{kamath2024broader}.  %
However, none of these approaches are directly applicable to the continual release model 
and they offer improvements over the Gaussian mechanism only in a very high privacy regime.
