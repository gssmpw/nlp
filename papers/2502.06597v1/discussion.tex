\section{Summary and Discussion}
In this work we studied the problem of jointly estimating the first and second moment of a continuous data stream in a differentially private way.
%
We presented the \method (\acronym) method, which solves the problem 
by exploiting the recently proposed matrix mechanism with carefully 
tuned noise level. 
%
As a result, \acronym produces unbiased estimates of both moments
while requiring less noise to be added than baseline methods, at 
least is the high privacy regime. 
%
We applied \acronym to private Gaussian density estimation and model 
training with Adam, demonstrating improved performance in high-privacy 
regimes both theoretically and practically. 

Despite the promising results, several open question remain. 
%
In particular, would like to explore if postprocessing is indeed 
the optimal strategy in a low-privacy regime, or if a better 
privacy-utility trade-off is still possible.
%
Furthermore, we plan to explore the possibility of problem-specific 
factorizations, which could be fused with the proposed method.
