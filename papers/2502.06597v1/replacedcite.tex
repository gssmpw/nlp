The problem of differentially private moments (and the related problem of covariance estimation) has a rich history of development, with optimal results known in the central model of privacy ____ as well as the \emph{local model of privacy}____, and also in the worst-case setting. ____ proposes three differentially private algorithms for approximating the second-moment matrix, each ensuring positive definiteness. The related setting of covariance estimation has been studied in the worst-case setting when the data comes from a bounded $\ell_2$ ball by several works for approximate differential privacy____ with the works of ____ and ____ presenting a pure differentially private algorithm. %

Covariance estimation is also used as a subroutine in mean-estimation work under various distributional assumptions____.  %
However, none of these approaches are directly applicable to the continual release model 
and they offer improvements over the Gaussian mechanism only in a very high privacy regime.
