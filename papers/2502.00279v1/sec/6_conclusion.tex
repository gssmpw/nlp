\section{Conclusion}
we addressed the challenge of limited information about the class distribution in unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning. We propose to explicitly estimate the unlabeled class distribution as an initial step then pass it to existing pseudo labeling approaches.
Leveraging connecting to non-ignorable missingness, we introduce the doubly robust estimator which has strong theoretical guarantee for the distribution estimation. We show improved results on 3 different datasets, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Imagenet-127, and that even inaccurate class label distributions do not lead to degraded accuracy in CIFAR-10.
