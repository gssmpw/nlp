\begin{abstract}
The rapid adoption of AI across diverse domains has led to the development of organisational guidelines that vary significantly, even within the same sector. This paper examines AI policies in two domains, news organisations and universities, to understand how bottom-up governance approaches shape AI usage and oversight. By analysing these policies, we identify key areas of convergence and divergence in how organisations address risks such as bias, privacy, misinformation, and accountability. We then explore the implications of these findings for international AI legislation, particularly the EU AI Act, highlighting gaps where practical policy insights could inform regulatory refinements. Our analysis reveals that organisational policies often address issues such as AI literacy, disclosure practices, and environmental impact, areas that are underdeveloped in existing international frameworks. We argue that lessons from domain-specific AI policies can contribute to more adaptive and effective AI governance at the global level. This study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers seeking to bridge the gap between local AI practices and international regulations.\looseness=-1

% In the recent years, organisations in diverse domains had to quickly adapt to the challenges posed by generative AI. Yet even within a single domain, such as news organisations, guidelines can diverge significantly or even conflict, reflecting varied interpretations of risk, accountability, and ethical considerations. Moreover, there is often a mismatch between the prescribed uses of AI and the real functionality scope of these models, which further complicates the regulatory landscape. 
% Meanwhile, broader frameworks like the EU AI Act seek to govern AI at an international level, but many key details for its implementation in the local organizations are currently unspecified. 
% We raise the question: could the analysis of local bottom-up guidelines help to identify key points to be discussed and eventually adapted in international legislation?
% %could analysis of local bottom-up guidelines help to identify the key points that need more clarity from the legislators? %Addressing this issue is key to shaping a more coherent, context-sensitive AI governance that balances real-world needs with overarching legislative goals. 
% We survey organisational AI guidelines from two domains (universities and news organisations) and identify the key points on which the local organisations agree and diverge, which may inform the development of both local guidelines and international legislation.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the rapid adoption of AI technologies across diverse domains has exposed significant gaps in governance, with multiple organisations scrambling to quickly develop their policies. Our comparative analysis of AI guidelines in universities and news organisations highlights both shared and domain-specific challenges, such as the need for clear accountability mechanisms, addressing biases, and managing domain-specific applications like personalised learning and content generation. We have also identified multiple challenges that are known in academic research, but not addressed by the current policies. These findings underscore the fragmented nature of current governance efforts and the critical need for cohesive policies that balance local organisational needs with broader societal and technological imperatives, while recognizing and supporting areas where more research is needed for better policies. %Furthermore, our study reveals a gap between the intended uses of AI outlined in policies and the actual capabilities and limitations of these technologies. Misaligned expectations not only complicate the implementation of responsible AI practices but also risk eroding trust in AI systems. 
By identifying these gaps and challenges, this paper offers actionable insights for refining international legislation and informs the critical future directions of research. Ultimately, bridging the disconnect between local practices, academic research, and global standards is essential for ensuring the safe, fair, and effective deployment of AI across diverse contexts.
