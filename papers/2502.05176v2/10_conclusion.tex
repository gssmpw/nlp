\label{sec:conclusion}
% We presented AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based 360° inpainting method for unbounded 3D scenes. Our approach introduces improved unseen mask generation, reference-guided 3D inpainting with diffusion priors, and the 360-USID dataset. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across complex geometries and viewpoints. Future work will focus on computational efficiency, dynamic scenes, and language-guided editing capabilities.

We presented AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based 360° inpainting method for 3D scenes in unbounded environments. Our approach effectively addresses the challenges of object removal and hole filling in complex 3D scenes. Key contributions include leveraging multi-view information through improved unseen mask generation, integrating reference-guided 3D inpainting with diffusion priors, and introducing the 360-USID dataset for comprehensive evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate AuraFusion360's superior performance over existing methods, particularly in complex geometries and large view variations. While this work represents a significant advancement in 3D scene editing, future work will focus on computational efficiency, dynamic scenes, and language-guided editing capabilities.
% future directions include improving computational efficiency, handling dynamic scenes, and integrating more advanced language models for intuitive editing.
