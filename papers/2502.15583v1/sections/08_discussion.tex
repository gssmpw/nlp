### Artifact Summary
The artifact contains codes and instructions needed to carry out experiments in the evaluation section of our paper, details including:
+ We run EL-Rec on Criteo Kaggle dataset from (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Kaggle_Display_Advertising_Challenge_dataset/5732310) on AWS p3.8xlarge instance and record the training time of one epoch and compare with the baselines (Facebook DLRM and TT-Rec) described in the paper.

+ The source code and associated scripts are available at the anonymous repository (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). One can follow the instructions in the repo to verify the results in the paper. One needs to use the same hardware and software version, but this artifact is functional under more settings.

### Relevant Platform Details
