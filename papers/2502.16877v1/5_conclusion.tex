\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this paper introduces APINT, the pioneering full-stack framework to accelerate PiT. APINT integrates a novel PiT protocol and GC-friendly circuit generation, effectively reducing the latency of GC. Additionally, APINT includes a netlist scheduling and an accelerator equipped with compiler speculation, resolving both the memory bottleneck and wire dependency while operating nonlinear functions of the transformer. As a result, APINT achieves a substantial reduction in latency, performing 12.2$\times$ and 2.2$\times$ faster online and offline, respectively, compared to the baseline method on CPU. 
Meanwhile, the APINT accelerator reduces its latency by an average of 3.3$\times$ and system energy consumption by 4.6$\times$ compared to the SOTA GC accelerator.
% Moreover, the APINT accelerator reduces latency by x27.6\% as well as system energy consumption by 78.1\%, compared to the SOTA GC accelerator.
