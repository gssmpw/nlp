\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{s:con}
Bad partitioning in TEE projects can lead to vulnerabilities during data transmission between the normal world and TEE. 
To address this problem, we designed \ccSysName, a tool that can identify security risks arising from bad partitioning by analyzing three types of data interactions: output, input, and shared memory. 
Additionally, we created the first partitioning errors benchmark, \ccBenchName, consisting of 110 test cases to evaluate the effectiveness of \ccSysName.
From the evaluation results, \ccSysName can help to find bad partitioning issues in TEE applications.
In the future, we aim to explore automated solutions for fixing bad partitioning issues in TEE applications based on the detection results.
