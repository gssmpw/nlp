abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) games, in the education sector, have the potential to enable new forms of learning and transform the learning experience. However, it remains unclear how these AR games whose designs are based on diverse game genres can be used to leverage the conventional education process in the context of different theoretical paradigms and models used in learning. This chapter addresses these challenges by providing an analysis of game genres, learning paradigms, theories and models used in different AR games in the field of education. Hence, we present a selected number of previous studies of AR games in the field of education, which are classified by year of publication, school subject, research method, game genres, AR systems, learning environment, learning paradigms and theories, target group(s) and study sample size. The classified data is analysed to identify how AR games designed based on diverse game genres can be used to benefit the educational process in the context of different theoretical paradigms and models used in learning.",

abstract="Intense stress, discomfort or sedentary behaviour are factors that have a negative impact on people's well-being and efficiency. A number of prototypes have been developed to help people address these issues. In parallel, gamification techniques have been successfully used in applications that aim to improve people's health by encouraging them to change their behaviour. In this chapter, we focus on the use of Ambient systems and/or Augmented Reality systems and discuss the potential of playful and gamified systems to improve people's well-being. We first describe several prototypes that aim to improve people's well-being. Then, we discuss the potential of gamification and projection-based AR systems in the context of well-being, and introduce the notion of playful projection-based ambient systems. We conclude by describing a scenario and discussing technical considerations for its implementation.",

abstract="Augmented Reality (AR) and its applications are being used in many applications, including gaming, education, industry, research, and art. Gamification refers to the merging of games with interactive media (video games, Virtual and Augmented Realities, for example) to allow for the completion of difficult digital labour of research in a more fun, intuitive fashion. In this chapter, the merging of gamification and Augmented Reality-based art is discussed, its impact in terms of digital labour as well as examples of Augmented Reality that exhibit gamification or elements of it. Speculative design fictions of gamified Augmented Reality are examined to determine possible future outcomes of this genre. Lastly historical experiments in user interface design are mentioned to propose future solutions for Augmented Reality applications, artistic installations and gamification scenarios.",
