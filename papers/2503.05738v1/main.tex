% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2025} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2025} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}


% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
% \usepackage{icml2025}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2025}

% For theorems and such
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{amsthm}

\usepackage{multirow}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2025
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.
