Possible future developments concern the implementation and use of our static analysis technique:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The practical application of the type system through the implementation of typing algorithms in an experimental programming language.
    \item The application of our techniques in a actual Property-Based Testing system.
    \item Also provide for an under-approximated interpretation of History Expressions: while not intended for verifying resource correctness against policies, it can help identify bugs in resource usage by analysing behaviours that can be statically guaranteed within the program.
\end{enumerate}
