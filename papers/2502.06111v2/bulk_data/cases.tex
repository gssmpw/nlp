\subsubsection{Example Text from README}

Below are case studies of how models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, LLaMA 3.1, and Mistral) extract the commands from a Repository.

\begin{mybody}
\textbf{REPOSITORY ID:} 3DDFA\_V2 \\\\
\textbf{README} \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
Requirements
See requirements.txt, tested on macOS and Linux platforms. The Windows users 
may refer to FQA for building issues. Note that this repo uses Python3. The 
major dependencies are PyTorch, numpy, opencv-python, and onnxruntime, etc. 
If you run the demos with --onnx flag to do acceleration, you may need to 
install libomp first, i.e., brew install libomp on macOS.

Usage

# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2.git
cd 3DDFA_V2

# 2. Build the cython version
sh ./build.sh

# 3. Run demos
# Running on a still image
python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg --onnx

# Running on videos
python3 demo_video.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi --onnx

# Running on webcam
python3 demo_webcam_smooth.py --onnx

The implementation of tracking is simply by alignment. If the head pose > 90 
degrees or the motion is too fast, the alignment may fail. A threshold is 
used to trickly check the tracking state, but it is unstable.
