\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce \dcad, a large-scale multilingual dataset designed to address the increasing demand for high-quality and diverse training data for multilingual LLMs.
Our dataset spans 2,282 languages, providing comprehensive coverage across various geographic regions, scripts (159 scripts), and larger coverage of high/medium resource languages (155 languages).
To avoid manually setting thresholds during the data cleaning process, we propose a novel framework that reframes data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. 
This dynamic approach ensures effective identification and removal of anomalous data from noisy datasets.
We evaluate \dcad on the FineTask benchmark and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed data cleaning framework and the high quality of the \dcad dataset.
