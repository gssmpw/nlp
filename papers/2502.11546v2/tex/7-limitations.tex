\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitation}
This work has the following limitations:
\textbf{(i)} Although the proportion of high/medium/low resource languages in \dcad has greatly increased compare to existing multilingual datasets, a significant portion of the languages are still very low resource languages. Future work will explore to collect data for extremely low-resource languages through other modalities (e.g., images) through technologies like OCR.
% \textbf{(ii)} We evaluate the new data cleaning framework only on four classical anomaly detection algorithms; however, since the framework is algorithm-independent, it should also be effective with the latest anomaly detection algorithms~\cite{batzner2024efficientad}.
\textbf{(ii)} Due to computational limitations, we evaluate our framework and dataset only on the LLaMA-3.2-1B model. However, we expect similar evaluation results on larger models, such as 7B, 13B and even 70B models.
