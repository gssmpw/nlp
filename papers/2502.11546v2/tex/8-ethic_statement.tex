\section*{Ethics Statement}
Our dataset integrates existing multilingual datasets, such as MaLA~\cite{ji2024emma} and Fineweb-2~\cite{penedo2024fineweb-2}, and includes newly extracted data from Common Crawl, providing large-scale and high-quality training corpora to support the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs).
Additionally, we propose a novel data cleaning method to filter out potentially toxic documents, reducing potential ethical concerns. 
However, performing fine-grained analysis on such a vast dataset (46.72TB) remains a significant challenge.
To address this, we will release the dataset for the community to explore and research extensively.
Furthermore, since our dataset is derived from open-source datasets, we will adhere to the open-source policies of these datasets to promote future research in multilingual LLMs, while mitigating potential ethical risks.
Therefore, we believe our dataset does not pose greater societal risks than existing multilingual datasets.
