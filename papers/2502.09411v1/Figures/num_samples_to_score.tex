   \caption{\textbf{Retrieval dataset size vs. CLIP score on ImageNet (left) and Aircraft (right).} 
   Dashed lines represent the scores of the base models.
   Even relatively small, unspecialized retrieval sets can already improve results. More data leads to further increased scores. However, small sets may not contain relevant retrieval examples, and their use may harm results, particularly for stronger models.
