   Using references broadens the generation capabilities of image generation models. Given a text prompt, \emph{ImageRAG} dynamically retrieves relevant images and provides them to a base text-to-image model (T2I). 
   \emph{ImageRAG} works with different models, such as SDXL (A) or OmniGen (B, C), and different controls, e.g. text (A, B) or personalization (C).
