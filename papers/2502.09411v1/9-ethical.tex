\section*{Ethical statement}
The development of \emph{ImageRAG} introduces enhancement possibilities for image generation models, enabling rare or fine-grained concept generation. While these advancements hold promise for creative industries, personalized content creation, and scientific visualization, they also raise ethical concerns, including potential misuse for harmful content such as deepfakes and the use of private data.  
Therefore, transparency in data usage and adherence to privacy regulations are essential.
We condemn any misuse of the proposed technology, and actively research tools to identify and prevent malicious usage of generative models \citep{agarwal2020detecting,knafo2022fakeout,sinitsa2024deep}.
