\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we explore how to apply RAG over pretrained text-to-image models, using a simple yet effective method. We show that using relevant image references improves T2I models abilities to generate rare concepts and demonstrate how we can dynamically retrieve relevant references with a simple approach utilizing a VLM. We experiment with two models representing two model types and show how our method can be applied to multiple different models.
We conclude that using image references broadens the applicability of text-to-image generation models, requiring minimal modifications to enhance generation possibilities.
