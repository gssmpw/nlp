\begin{keypoints}
\item We use machine learning to identify important precursor regions for matching in a model-analog prediction framework.
\item We predict 2-meter temperature with lead times from one to ten years and for five different regions.
\item We find improved performance over other analog prediction methods and over initialized decadal predictions.

\begin{abstract}
Multi-year-to-decadal climate prediction is a key tool in understanding the range of potential regional and global climate futures.
Here, we present a framework that combines machine learning and analog forecasting for predictions on these timescales.
A neural network is used to learn a mask, specific to a region and lead time, with global weights based on relative importance as precursors to the evolution of that prediction target.
A library of mask-weighted model states, or potential analogs, are then compared to a single mask-weighted observational state.
The known future of the best matching potential analogs serve as the prediction for the future of the observational state.
We match and predict 2-meter temperature using the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset for observations, and a set of CMIP6 models as the analog library.
We find improved performance over traditional analog methods and initialized decadal predictions.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Plain Language Summary}
Accurate prediction of the climate, from the next year to the next decade, is important for adaptation and mitigation in many societal sectors.
In particular, temperature plays a key role on these time scales for agriculture, human health, and infrastructure planning.
In this work, we develop and test a framework for making predictions on multi-year-to-decadal timescales, utilizing machine learning and an established method called analog forecasting.
Analog forecasting compares the climate state from which one wants to predict to a library of potential analog states.
The forecast is then the known future of the best matching analog states, which presumes that the analogs evolve similarly to the real world.
Here, our analogs come from a subset of Earth system model runs from the CMIP6 dataset.
The machine learning component contributes by learning the regions that are most important in determining if two climate states will evolve similarly, ensuring that the analog selection encodes information specific to the prediction task.
We find that our method improves on current prediction methods for these timescales in several regions and lead times.
