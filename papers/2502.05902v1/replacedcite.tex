\subsection{Omni-Directional Image Machine Vision}
ODI-oriented machine vision research emphasizes understanding the object deformation caused by non-uniform sampling due to sphere-to-planar projection.
%
Preliminary works focused on modifying and adapting regular convolution kernels to produce deformation-aware features.
%
In special, Su \textit{et al.}____ made the first attempt that leverages the knowledge distillation to obtain adaptive kernel sizes for 2D convolution filters.
%
%
%
The following studies have directed their attention toward the adaptation of sampling grid positions of convolution filters____.
%
SphereNet____, for instance, is a notable work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of this methodology in tasks such as classification and object detection.
%
Zhao \textit{et al.}____ further leveraged a non-regular grid for each pixel based on its distortion level and convolved the sampled grid using square kernels shared by all pixels, facilitating end-to-end training.
%
Apart from adapting 2D CNN kernels, another approach involves establishing spherical convolution kernels to achieve rotational equivariance and invariance.
%
For instance, Esteves \textit{et al.}____ made the first attempt to implement spherical harmonic domain CNN filters via group convolutions.
 %
Meanwhile, Yang \textit{et al.}____ and Perraudin \textit{et al.}____ took a different approach by leveraging a graph to represent the spherical image and achieving resilient isometric equivariance transformation through via hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization.

\subsection{Omni-Directional Image Super-Resolution}
Preliminary ODR-SR models adopted a naive strategy that straightforwardly adopted the checkpoints of planar image SR models and fine-tuned them on the ODIs, resulting in limited performance____.
%
LAU-Net____ proposed the first ODI-SR approach that considered the non-uniform sampling characteristics of ODR images. Specifically, a tile-based strategy was introduced, where the ERP images were first split into several regions according to latitude, and the upsampling factors were adaptively assigned.
%
Yoon \textit{et al.}____ explored the usage of icosahedron projection to minimize sphere-to-planar distortion and proposed a new kernel weight-sharing scheme aligned with the icosahedron projection.
%
Although these methods successfully enhance the performance of ODI-SR by incorporating the spherical characteristics of ODI, the specially designed models involve tedious operations, posing significant obstacles to both running speed and practical implementation and hindering further research of ODI-SR.
%
Moreover, other works have tended to incorporate sphere-to-planar knowledge as side information into the feature extraction process, such as the stretching ratio or distortion map____.
%
However, the naive incorporation method and the sole focus on the feature extraction process prevent these approaches from achieving state-of-the-art performance.
%

\subsection{Implicit Image/Neural Representation}
The implicit neural representation (INR) originates from the modeling of 3D object-shape surfaces____ and involves leveraging a multi-layer perceptron function to map coordinates to the signal.
%
Inspired by INR's favorable capacity for recovering fine details of shapes, it has started to be employed in representing planar images, such as in image restoration____ and image compression____.
%
Preliminary INR involves learning a specific mapping function for a single image, raising concerns about inference time in practical implementation scenarios.
%
As such, recent works tend to explore an implicit representation function space shared by different images____, where the extracted deep features are also regarded as inputs alongside the coordinates for mapping to the signals, denoted as implicit image function.
%
In the context of image SR, the implicit image function has obtained significant progress, especially in arbitrary-scale image SR, such as SIREN____ and LIIF____, since the coordinate-to-signal function is well-aligned with continuous image representation.
%
Furthermore, in the ODR-SR domain, SphereSR____ made the first effort to incorporate INR into spherical coordinates to achieve arbitrary-scale SR processing.
%
However, the spherical implicit image function is performed on a reprojected icosahedron surface and involves a complex convolutional kernel modification process to align with the icosahedron ODI pixel representation. This inevitably limits the performance and inference speed.
