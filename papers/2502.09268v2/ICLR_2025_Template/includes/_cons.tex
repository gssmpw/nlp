\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.5em}
The innovation of our method lies in its ability to internalize the classical internal model control principle into the modern VLA framework, thereby enhancing the robot's ability to handle environmental perturbations and maintain performance integrity. 
In the proposed robust GEVRM model, we leverage video generation models to obtain highly expressive target states.
Meanwhile, we effectively align state representations based on prototype contrastive learning to simulate robot responses and evaluate external perturbations.
As demonstrated by the GEVRM's state-of-the-art performance in simulated and realistic visual manipulation tasks, it effectively enhances the expressiveness of the goal state and exhibits strong resilience to external perturbations. 
Therefore, our work greatly expands the reliability and robustness of robotic systems in deployment scenarios and is an important step forward in the field of embodied general intelligence.
A promising work is to consider incorporating more general high-quality video generation models into the VLA framework to cope with complex and diverse manipulation tasks of real-world robots.
