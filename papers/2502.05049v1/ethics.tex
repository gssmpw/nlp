This work follows the guidelines and the ethical considerations by \cite{eysenbach2001ethical,moreno2013ethics,ramirez2020detection}.
All the results provide aggregated estimates and do not include any information on individuals to maximize privacy and minimize potential harm. However, we recognize that our methods, despite being designed to be privacy-respectful and transparent, could have dual-use implications that pose risks to users. For instance, similar techniques could be repurposed to target individuals based on inferred characteristics, potentially leading to misuse in contexts such as advertising or surveillance. We acknowledge that our work could draw additional attention to Reddit users and their behaviors, potentially increasing the platform's visibility as a target for analysis. Moreover, while we aim to highlight the ethical considerations of socio-demographic inference, our study could inadvertently encourage others to apply similar techniques in ways that we cannot control. Balancing these risks, we believe that the benefits of advancing ethical and privacy-conscious methodologies in computational social science outweigh the potential harms. By demonstrating a more responsible approach to socio-demographic inference, we hope to set a precedent for future research that prioritizes user autonomy and transparency.
Finally, the users in our study were fully aware of the public nature and free accessibility of the content they posted since the subreddits are of public domain, are not password-protected, and have thousands of active subscribers.
Reddit’s pseudonymous accounts make the retrieval of the true identity of users unlikely.
Nevertheless, as a further privacy measure, the authors’ names were anonymized before using the data for analysis.
Therefore, our research did not require informed consent.
