\spara{Pipeline for Ground Truth Collection of Socio-Demographics.}
Our objective is to establish a reliable ground truth for socio-demographic attributes. We started by selecting the 10,000 most active subreddits based on comment activity from 2016 to 2020, with the activity distribution shown in Fig.\ref{fig:subreddits-distribution}. To identify political opinions and gender, we defined specific regular expressions (regex). For political opinions, we used patterns such as ``I'm a democrat/republican'' or ``I am a registered democrat/republican,'' excluding regex containing negations. An overview of these regex patterns is provided in Fig.\ref{fig:regex-pol} and Fig.~\ref{fig:regex-pol2}. 
For gender, we used patterns indicating gender and age, such as ``F - AGE'' or ``M - AGE.''

Using these regex patterns, we labeled users based on their comments and submissions for political opinion, gender, and age over the period from 2016 to 2020. %
The age attribute was then converted into the birth year in order to take into account %
the timing of the disclosure. Bots were removed using an external list of identified bots.

Subsequently, we retrieved all comments and submissions from the selected 10,000 subreddits for all labeled users. To ensure data reliability, we eliminated users with inconsistent declarations over the selected time period (2016 to 2020), affecting 96 out of 15,293 users.


Sociodemographic disclosure distributions are reported in appendix.
