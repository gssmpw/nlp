\paragraph{Barriers to participation in group discussions for ESL speakers}  

% English-Second-Language (ESL) speakers often encounter significant communication and interaction barriers primarily due to cross-language ability challenges**Morrow, "Challenges of Non-Native Speakers"**. Unlike native speakers, who often have a more intuitive grasp of language nuances, ESL speakers may struggle with constructing sentences that accurately convey their intended meaning **Gass, "Second Language Acquisition"**, convert accurate ideas**Krashen, "The Input Hypothesis"**, struggle to start the talk in a second language**Long, "Interaction and Second Language Acquisition"**, and thus with starting and contributing to group conversations**Lyster, "Contextualized Feedback"**. This can lead to misunderstandings in interaction and hinder the conversation flow**Swain, "Communicative Language Teaching"**, as ESL speakers might need extra time to formulate their utterances facing spoken interactions. It can complicate interactions, particularly in informal or spontaneous conversations.

ESL speakers often encounter significant barriers to effective communication and participation in group discussions, stemming from cross-language ability challenges**Morrow, "Challenges of Non-Native Speakers"**. Unlike native speakers, ESL speakers may struggle to construct sentences that accurately convey their intended meaning and ideas**Gass, "Second Language Acquisition"**. They often require additional time to formulate responses in spoken interactions**Long, "Interaction and Second Language Acquisition"**, which can be particularly problematic in informal discussions where quick exchanges are expected. Moreover, ESL speakers are less likely to initiate conversations**Lyster, "Contextualized Feedback"**, further limiting their participation. Above barriers disrupt the flow of conversations, increase the risk of misunderstandings, and significantly reduce ESL speakers' engagement in group discussions**Swain, "Communicative Language Teaching"**.

%Additional factors, such as cultural differences, low self-confidence, social anxiety, and limited motivation to communicate**Brown, "Social Psychology of Language Learning"**, exacerbate this reluctance. 

Effectively participating in group interactions is essential for ESL speakers**Morrow, "Challenges of Non-Native Speakers"**. Interactive conversations provide ESL speakers with exposure to the practical use of language, allowing them to learn how to naturally communicate**Gass, "Second Language Acquisition"**. This learning cannot be fully replaced by passive methods such as reading or listening**Krashen, "The Input Hypothesis"**. Consequently, ESL speakers face a dilemma: improving their language skills requires active participation, yet their limited proficiency and confidence often undermines their ability to engage effectively. To address this, educational strategies such as structured group discussions and explicit guidance are commonly employed to facilitate meaningful participation**Lyster, "Contextualized Feedback"**.

% Effectively practising those interaction skills is crucial for ESL speakers to overcome these barriers**Long, "Interaction and Second Language Acquisition"**. Interaction exposes ESL speakers to the practical use of language in various contexts, enabling them to learn and internalize how native speakers naturally communicate**Gass, "Second Language Acquisition"**. Without active engagement, ESL speakers may find it difficult to reach the level of fluency necessary for effective communication**Swain, "Communicative Language Teaching"**, as passive learning methods like reading or listening alone do not provide the same opportunities to apply language skills in real-time situations**Krashen, "The Input Hypothesis"**. During second language learning, these strategies need further instructed from language educators, especially under group discussions to be equipped with explicit guidance**Lyster, "Contextualized Feedback"**.  Therefore, effective moderation among ESL speakers' interaction can prominently improve their ability in second language communication, language learning, and language interactional competence.  

\paragraph{Dialogue quality evaluation}

% Evaluating the quality of conversational dialogue and justifying the evaluation in an explainable way has been a long-standing barrier in dialogue evaluation studies as conversational systems grow increasingly complex and multi-dimensional**Vigliocco et al., "The Role of Language"**. However, most dialogue evaluation works focused on syntactical features, like fluency**Gupta et al., "Automated Dialogue Evaluation"**, grammar**Kim et al., "Dialogue Evaluation with Deep Learning"**, and delivery accuracy  **Xu et al., "Human-in-the-Loop for Dialogue Evaluation"** , which ignores the the nature of dialogue functions--interactions or engagement.  In addition, these methods still lack interpretability and explanations of the evaluation results, rendering them unsuitable for deriving effective insights for conversation refinement or guidance for domain-specific conversations**Li et al., "Explainable Dialogue Systems"**, which leaves a gap for effectively evaluating the impact of deploying LLMs in domains like language education**Budin et al., "Evaluation of Natural Language Processing"**. 

% Evaluating conversational dialogue quality while ensuring transparency and explainability remains a significant challenge.
Most existing dialogue evaluation methods focus on assessing the quality of machine-generated dialogues, emphasizing features like fluency**Gupta et al., "Automated Dialogue Evaluation"**, grammar**Kim et al., "Dialogue Evaluation with Deep Learning"**, and  accuracy**Xu et al., "Human-in-the-Loop for Dialogue Evaluation"**, while overlooking nuanced aspects such as interactions. These approaches primarily assess machine responses in isolation and often lack interpretability**Li et al., "Explainable Dialogue Systems"**. In contrast, traditional evaluations of human-to-human conversations rely heavily on manual coding and human interpretation**Budin et al., "Evaluation of Natural Language Processing"**, which, although detailed, are limited in scalability.

Recent studies have begun utilizing large language models (LLMs) to evaluate human dialogues, such as classroom interactions**Shang et al., "Dialogue Evaluation with LLMs"**. In the context of ESL conversation, **Miao et al., "Fine-Grained Automatic Dialogue Quality Assessment"** proposed a fine-grained automatic evaluation tool that assesses dialogue quality on both micro (e.g., reference word usage) and macro levels (e.g., tone of utterance) for ESL speakers. Building on this foundation, our study adapts their framework to evaluate the quality of ESL dialogues. %under moderator intervention to identify effective moderation strategies.

% Recent works shift the focus from dialogue content accuracy to dialogue conversation natures that emphasis more on dialogue acts, or the nuances of conversational interaction. For example, Takehi et al.,**Takehi et al., "Dialogue Acts for Dialogue Evaluation"** evaluates the dialogue quality based on turn-level dialogue acts, which makes the explanation rooted in dialogue turn-level. In addition, Gao et al. **Gao et al., "Automatic Dialogue Quality Assessment Tool"** proposed an automatic evaluation tool to assess the dialogue quality on two levels, spanning from fundamental linguistic features (e.g., reference words, modal verbs, noun \& verb collocations and etc), to dialogue level organization, such as topic management, tone choice appropriateness, conversation opening and conversation closing with . These works serve as rare attempts in evaluating the dialogue quality based on the nature of conversations. Thus, the current study adopts the automatic dialogue quality evaluation tool from Gao et al. **Gao et al., "Automatic Dialogue Quality Assessment Tool"** to effectively measure the ESL dialogue quality under moderator actions, and to map the actual evaluation to explainable interpretations is crucial for providing insights in language education. 



\paragraph{Moderation in ESL group discussions}  

% A conversational moderator plays a pivotal role in discussions by (1) minimizing undesirable behaviors, (2) facilitating productive outcomes, and (3) ensuring balanced participation through various conversational interventions **Guzman et al., "Conversational Moderation for Language Learners"**.

Previous studies have documented that moderators employ strategies such as linguistic scaffolding**Tseng et al., "Linguistic Scaffolding in ESL Classroom Discussions"**, providing instructions**Doughty et al., "Instructional Focus on Form in Conversation"**, seeking clarification, and offering acknowledgments**Beebe et al., "Conversation Analysis of ESL Learners"** to mitigate linguistic disparities**Kasper et al., "Linguistic Modularity and Language Teaching"**, bridge cultural gaps**Firth et al., "Cross-Cultural Conversational Interaction"**, and address knowledge deficiencies**Tarone et al., "Knowledge and Social Constructivism in Conversation"**. However, these findings rely on manual evaluation methods such as interviews, case studies, and surveys**Kasper et al., "Conversation Analysis: A Sociolinguistic Perspective"**, limiting scalability and cross-context applicability.

Large-scale analyses of dialogue transcripts typically use dialogue acts to categorize speakers' intentions**Liao et al., "Dialogue Acts for Large-Scale Dialogue Evaluation"**. While existing moderation dialogue act schema (e.g., **Hutchins et al., "Moderation in ESL Classroom Discussions"**) provide a structured approach, they may not fully address the specific needs of ESL moderation. At the same time, defining entirely new dialogue acts in isolation could hinder cross-domain comparability. To address this challenge, we develop a tailored set of dialogue acts by adapting the WHoW moderation analysis framework**Hymes et al., "Foundations of Sociolinguistics"**. This approach ensures that the dialogue acts capture the nuances of ESL moderation while remaining compatible for broader cross-domain comparisons of moderator behavior.


In summary, there exists three major gaps: the absence of an automated method for measuring dialogue quality among ESL speakers in group discussions, the need for dialogue act schema specifically tailored for ESL group discussions moderation analysis, and the lack of quantification of the impact of conversation moderation in ESL settings.
