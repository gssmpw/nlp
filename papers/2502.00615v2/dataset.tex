\subsection{Dataset and Filtering Process}
%\footnote{The dataset provides two versions: one dated August 30, 2024, and another enriched with Weaver metrics, dated September 4, 2024. For this study, we use the latter.}, consisting of 15,117,217 nodes (including 658,078 libraries and 14,459,139 releases) and 134,119,545 edges (119,660,406 dependency edges and 14,459,139 versioning edges)
Our study uses the Maven Central Neo4j dataset~\cite{msrdata,10.1145/3643991.3644879}, which contains a comprehensive graph of the entire Maven ecosystem. In this study, we used the dataset updated till September 4, 2024. To prepare the data for analysis, we used Neo4j to extract release information of all libraries in the ecosystem. We observed that not all libraries have release data. After excluding those libraries, we retained 635,003 libraries (96.5\% of the original libraries). For our study, we define an \textit{observation window} spanning 10 years, from September 4, 2014, to September 4, 2024. This window focuses on relatively newer libraries whose complete lifecycles can be observed within this period. We excluded older libraries created before the start of the observation window, reducing the dataset to 581,424 unique libraries. Additionally, we excluded too new libraries (created for less than one year), and those with only a single release, as they lack sufficient data for meaningful analysis. After this filtering, our final dataset for answering two RQs contains 403,048 unique libraries, accounting for 61.3\% of the original libraries.

%The Maven ecosystem has been active for over 20 years. \AM{need reference of this?} 

\subsection{Definitions}
We define the key terminology used in this study below.

\noindent \textbf{Abandoned and Active Libraries}: Libraries with no releases in the last two years of our observation window are classified as \textit{abandoned}; otherwise, they are considered \textit{active}. We acknowledge the threats associated with this definition and discuss them in detail in Section~\ref{threats}.

\noindent \textbf{Abandonment Date}: The date of the latest release for an abandoned library.

\noindent \textbf{Lifespan of a Library}: The time span between a library's first release and its latest release.

\noindent \textbf{Lifespan of a Release}: The time span between a target release and its subsequent release.

\noindent \textbf{Release Speed of a Library}: The average rate of releases over a specific time interval, measured in releases per day, month, or year. This metric was introduced by Damien et al.~\cite{jaime2022preliminary}.
