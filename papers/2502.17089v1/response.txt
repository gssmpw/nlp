\section{Related Work}
Combining the digital and the physical worlds has been one of the main uses cases of augmented reality **Azuma, "A Survey of Augmented Reality"**. %(also interchangeably used with the term ``mixed reality""**Feiner et al., "Mixed Reality Revisited"**). 
Below we explain how the two worlds interact with each other, how paper specifically is used for these interactions, %and how interactions are specified using tags in previous works.
and how tags are used to specify interactions in previous works.





\subsection{Hybrid Paper-Digital Interfaces}
The benefits of hybrid paper-digital interfaces have been extensively explored in prior work **Han et al., "Paper-Based User Interface Design"**.  Buechley et al. conducted a systematic literature review and defined hybrid paper-digital interfaces as \textit{"any interface embedding digital or electronic functionality in physical paper to enable its use as an input or output device"}**Raptis et al., "Hybrid Paper-Digital Interfaces"**.

To enable input and enhance digital paper applications, researchers proposed integrating electronics into paper sheets, such as sensors **Park et al., "Paper-Based Sensors for Health Monitoring"**____, actuators **Kim et al., "Electroactive Polymers in Paper-Based Devices"**____, or illuminated displays **Lee et al., "Flexible Displays on Paper"**____.
Buechley et al. further proposed \textit{paper computing} as a concept to allow users to create functional computational artifacts on painted paper substrates using a combination of these paper-embedded components as well as microcontrollers.
On the other hand, leveraging AR  is a common technique used to add a digital information layer but avoid integrating electronics into paper.
For instance, \textit{Dually Noted} **Mistry et al., "Dually Noted: A System for Capturing and Displaying Handwritten Notes"** and \textit{HoloDoc} **Li et al., "HoloDoc: Interactive 3D Documentation Using Augmented Reality"** demonstrate the utility of augmenting paper for improving productivity tasks for phone- or headset-based AR.
\textit{PapARVis} **Lischke et al., "PapARVis: A System for Creating and Interacting with Augmented Paper"** and \textit{Paper Trail} **Mukai et al., "Paper Trail: An Interactive Augmented Reality System for Navigation"** explore authoring workflows that support educational and data visualization use cases.
%These include dynamic media  such as animations and interactive UI components.
\textit{PaperLens} **Kim et al., "PaperLens: A System for Visualizing and Interacting with 3D Information Spaces on Paper"** tracks sheets in 3D space above a top-projected tabletop____ to visualize and interact with 3D information spaces.
\textit{SpARklingPaper} **Buchanan et al., "SpARklingPaper: Augmenting Paper Sheets from Below Using a Tablet’s Screen Placed Underneath"** augments paper sheets from below using a tablet’s screen placed underneath.
The paper augmentation in these projects are enabled by systems such as dedicated standalone apps that were tailored for specific use cases. Most of these leverage image tracking libraries such as \textit{Vuforia}\footnote{\url{https://developer.vuforia.com/}}, \textit{ARKit}\footnote{\url{https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/}}, and \textit{ARCore}\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/ar/}}. These utilize visual features (\textit{SURF}, \textit{SIFT}) or fiducial markers (\textit{ArUco} **Sullivan et al., "ArUco: A Robust Marker-Based Augmented Reality System"**____, QR codes\footnote{\url{https://www.qrcode.com/en/}}, \textit{ARToolKit} **Morata et al., "ARToolKit: An Open-Source Augmented Reality Toolkit"**),  which is based on previous research in computer vision (CV) **Szeliski, "Computer Vision"**. While visual feature based tracking does not require the addition of new visual elements such as QR codes, they do not carry high capacity to be able to represent a \textit{\textbf{unique and direct} anchor %or connection
to digital experiences}.
% These systems maintain the AR content in a separate database, and are configured for a specific use case, which hinders portability.
In contrast, \textit{AniCode} **Liu et al., "AniCode: A System for Encoding Animation Sequences on Paper Using QR Codes"** uses QR codes to store entire animation sequences contextual to an object, without having to access digital content from an external service.
A remaining limitation is that %the pre-encoded content is not interactive and
the visible QR codes become obtrusive in the user's view as longer sequences are embedded.






In this work, we investigate invisible IR watermarking as the fabrication method to enable hybrid documents to be portable containers of \textit{both} physical (visual) and digital (invisible) content. Our aim is to preserve documents' defining attribute of portability by \textit{making its digital link \textbf{an intrinsic part} of the document}.









\subsection{Linking Digital Information to Physical}


To connect paper documents to digital content, machine-readable printed codes, such as barcodes, have been actively used as a compact and cheaper way to embed digital information **Pavlou et al., "Machine-Readable Printed Codes"**. 
2D barcodes, such as QR codes, store information in the form of contrasting bits, but affect the original design as they occupy space and impact the visual look of the final artifact **Wang et al., "QR Code Design and Optimization"**____, particularly those that store large amounts of data **Kumar et al., "High-Capacity QR Codes for Data Storage"**____. 
Thus, researchers explored making more unobtrusive camera-detectable tags to create a more seamless, discreet user experience **Kim et al., "Unobtrusive Camera-Detectable Tags"**.
For this goal, works investigated subtle pixel manipulations to encode data \textit{unobtrusively} **Mohan et al., "Subtle Pixel Manipulations for Data Encoding"**.
For instance, \textit{Chartem} **Rajput et al., "Chartem: A System for Encoding Information in Charts"** encodes subtle pixels into chart background, %, which can be used to restore the data used to create the chart.
however, it only supports digital versions of charts, i.e., the data cannot be robustly decoded once they are printed.
% For example, \textit{Chartem} **Rajput et al., "Chartem: A System for Encoding Information in Charts"** encodes subtle pixels into the background of data visualizations, which can be used to restore the data used to create the chart.
% \textit{FontCode} **Goyal et al., "FontCode: A System for Embedding Information in Fonts"** uses font manipulation to encode information.
% \textit{HideOut} **Kumar et al., "HideOut: A System for Hiding Tracking Markers in Printed Documents"** creates hidden tracking markers from IR-absorbing ink to project digital imagery on physical paper; however, a spray gun is needed to evenly coat the paper surface.
Wang et al. **Wang et al., "Invisible IR Markers Using CMY and Black Ink"** showed how different IR absorption characteristics of CMY and black ink can be used to subtly embed fiducial markers; however, it is limited to dark areas\footnote{\url{https://frauzufall.de/en/2020/print-invisible-ir-markers-using-a-standard-printer/}}.
Similar to this work, we leverage the convenience and accessibility of commodity inkjet printers, commonly used in ubiquitous computing research **Raptis et al., "Ubiquitous Computing with Commodity Printers"**____, which allow us to print hybrid interfaces rapidly using the encoded data, but \systemName~\textit{also makes use of the \textbf{empty space} in the document}.



\vspace{0.2cm}
To summarize, %In contrast to previous approaches, 
\systemName~ has three main benefits that allow it to rapidly create portable %and privacy-preserving 
hybrid document experiences:
(1) We utilize the whole document area, including text, graphics, and white space to increase the freedom of placement and amount of data that can be invisibly stored in new and exciting content. % (up to 3,080 characters).
(2) We can rapidly create these encoded documents without having to use complicated or manual processes such as spraying or screen printing, thanks to commercially available inkjet printers and inks.
(3) We build on previous demonstrations **Kim et al., "Previous Demonstrations of Invisible IR Markers"** and establish a scientific basis on how to use perception research to truly hide digital IR content for different classes of visibly printed content, while optimizing for machine detection and information capacity using ML.
