\section{Conclusion}


We introduced \systemName, a watermarking technique that embeds computer-readable information while remaining invisible to the human eye. Unlike previous methods, our approach utilizes the entire document, including white spaces, and works regardless of background color. Through a psychophysical experiment, we determined the maximum ink that can be embedded without being detected. We developed tools to support users in applying IR ink technology, including software for efficient information embedding and a universal camera module for capturing \systemName~watermarks. Our open-source ML pipeline processes these images for robust use with standard QR code readers. We demonstrated various use cases, highlighting the potential of invisible IR content for hybrid paper-digital interfaces and advancing watermarking techniques.
