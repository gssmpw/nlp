ABSTRACT = {It has been almost half a century since the first interest in autonomous robots was shown, and research is still continuing to improve their ability to make perfectly conscious decisions from a user safety point of view. These autonomous robots are now at a fairly advanced level, which means that their adoption rate in social environments is also increasing. This article reviews the current state of development of this technology and highlights the evolution of interest in it. We analyze and discuss specific areas of its use, for example, its functionality and current level of development. Finally, challenges related to the current level of research and new methods that are still being developed for the wider adoption of these autonomous robots are highlighted.},

abstract = {Job-shop scheduling problem (abbreviated to JSP) is one of the well-known hardest combinatorial optimization problems. During the last three decades, the problem has captured the interest of a significant number of researchers and a lot of literature has been published, but no efficient solution algorithm has been found yet for solving it to optimality in polynomial time. This has led to recent interest in using genetic algorithms (GAs) to address it. The purpose of this paper and its companion (Part II: Hybrid Genetic Search Strategies) is to give a tutorial survey of recent works on solving classical JSP using genetic algorithms. In Part I, we devote our attention to the representation schemes proposed for JSP. In Part II, we will discuss various hybrid approaches of genetic algorithms and conventional heuristics. The research works on GA/JSP provide very rich experiences for the constrained combinatorial optimization problems. All of the techniques developed for JSP may be useful for other scheduling problems in modern flexible manufacturing systems and other combinatorial optimization problems.}

abstract = {The generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) is an extension of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) and it is among the most researched combinatorial optimization problems due to its theoretical properties, complexity aspects and real-life applications in various areas: location-routing problems, material flow design problem, distribution of medical supplies, urban waste collection management, airport selection and routing the courier airplanes, image retrieval and ranking, digital garment manufacturing, etc. Even though the importance of this combinatorial optimization problem was highlighted in several publications and there were developed several methods for solving it, there is no survey dedicated to the GTSP. The scope of this paper is to close this gap by providing a comprehensive survey on mathematical formulations, solution approaches and latest advances regarding the GTSP. The paper is organized around the following issues: problem definition, variations and related problems, real-life applications of the GTSP, mathematical formulations, solution approaches designed for solving the investigated problem, datasets, computational results and comparative analysis of the performance of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we discuss certain open problems and potential research directions.}

abstract = {The clothoid is a planar curve with the intuitive geometrical property of a linear variation of the curvature with arc length, a feature that is important in many geometric design applications. However, the exact parameterization of the clothoid is defined in terms of the irreducible Fresnel integrals, which are computationally expensive to evaluate and incompatible with the polynomial/rational representations employed in computer aided geometric design. Consequently, applications that seek to exploit the simple curvature variation of the clothoid must rely on approximations that satisfy a prescribed tolerance. In the present study, we investigate the use of planar Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves as polynomial approximants to monotone clothoid segments, based on geometric Hermite interpolation of end points, tangents, and curvatures, and precise matching of the clothoid segment arc length. The construction, employing PH curves of degree 7, involves iterative solution of a system of five algebraic equations in five real unknowns. This is achieved by exploiting a closed-form solution to the problem of interpolating the specified data (except the curvatures) using quintic PH curves, to determine starting values that ensure rapid and accurate convergence to the desired solution.}

Truncating at the kth term the s-power series furnishes the order-k Hermite interpolant, i.e. the degree-(2k+1) polynomial curve that reproduces up to the kth derivative of the original curve at the endpoints of a given interval. By piecing these approximations we obtain a Hermitian spline that exhibits Ck continuity at the joints and enjoys almost arc-length parameterization. This is a more suitable alternative than the truncated Taylor series or the blending of Taylor expansions advocated by Wang et al. [Computer-Aided Design 33 (2001) 1049] in a recent article.}

Clothoids are transcendental functions and so have been approximated by polynomials, by power series and continued fractions, and by rational functions. Here the clothoid is approximated by an arc spline. The chief advantage in doing so is that arc splines are very easy to lay out and to offset. Examples show that the approximation is of extremely high accuracy. It is proved that if the arc spline has n arcs, then the error in the approximation is of order O(1/n2).}

abstract = {As we move to increasingly complex cyber–physical systems (CPS), new approaches are needed to plan efficient state trajectories in real-time. In this paper, we propose an approach to significantly reduce the complexity of solving optimal control problems for a class of CPS with nonlinear dynamics. We exploit the property of differential flatness to simplify the Euler–Lagrange equations that arise during optimization, and this simplification eliminates the numerical instabilities that plague optimal control in general. We also present an explicit differential equation that describes the evolution of the optimal state trajectory, and we extend our results to consider both the unconstrained and constrained cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of our approach by generating the optimal trajectory for a planar manipulator with two revolute joints. We show in simulation that our approach is able to generate the constrained optimal trajectory in 4.5ms while respecting workspace constraints and switching between a ‘left’ and ‘right’ bend in the elbow joint.}

    abstract = { This paper presents a formulation of differential flatness---a concept originally introduced by Fliess, Levine, Martin, and Rouchon---in terms of absolute equivalence between exterior differential systems. Systems that are differentially flat have several useful properties that can be exploited to generate effective control strategies for nonlinear systems. The original definition of flatness was given in the context of differential algebra and required that all mappings be meromorphic functions. The formulation of flatness presented here does not require any algebraic structure and allows one to use tools from exterior differential systems to help characterize differentially flat systems. In particular, it is shown that, under regularity assumptions and in the case of single input control systems (i.e., codimension 2 Pfaffian systems), a system is differentially flat if and only if it is feedback linearizable via static state feedback. In higher codimensions our approach does not allow one to prove that feedback linearizability about an equilibrium point and flatness are equivalent: one must be careful with the role of time as well as the use of prolongations that may not be realizable as dynamic feedback in a control setting. Applications of differential flatness to nonlinear control systems and open questions are also discussed. }

ABSTRACT = {Addressing a collision-aware multi-robot mission planning problem, which involves task allocation and path-finding, poses a significant difficulty due to the necessity for real-time computational efficiency, scalability, and the ability to manage both static and dynamic obstacles and tasks within a complex environment. This paper introduces a parallel real-time algorithm aimed at overcoming these challenges. The proposed algorithm employs an approximation-based partitioning mechanism to partition the entire unassigned task set into several subsets. This approach decomposes the original problem into a series of single-robot mission planning problems. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, both numerical and hardware experiments are conducted, involving dynamic obstacles and tasks. Additionally, comparisons in terms of optimality and scalability against an existing method are provided, showcasing its superior performance across both metrics. Furthermore, a computational burden analysis is conducted to demonstrate the consistency of our method with the observations derived from these comparisons. Finally, the optimality gap between the proposed method and the global optima in small-size problems is demonstrated.},
