\vspace{-1mm}
Haris, "The Rectified Flow method" proposed the Rectified Flow method, which straightens the flow trajectory to achieve high-quality results within a one sampling step, laying a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent research. InstaFlow, "InstaFlow applies the Reflow method" applies the Reflow method to straighten the curved ODE solving path, allowing latents to transition more quickly from the noise distribution to the image distribution. The straightened ODE path also reduces the learning difficulty for the student model, improving the distillation effectiveness. This enables one-step generation for large-scale text-to-image tasks. PeRFlow, "PeRFlow further improves Reflow correction" further improves Reflow correction by segmenting the flow trajectory, achieving exceptional performance.

\textbf{Multi-step Diffusion-based Real-ISR.} In recent years, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the field of image super-resolution Chen et al., "Diffusion-Based Image Super-Resolution" proposed the method that achieves state-of-the-art performance. DiffBIR, "A Two-Step Diffusion-Based Image Reconstruction Method" reconstructs low-resolution (LR) images using a small network and then employs ControlNet, "ControlNet: A Unified Framework for Control and Generation" to control the generation of the diffusion model. SeeSR, "SeeSR: Semantic Guidance for Diffusion Models in Real-ISR" introduces a module for extracting semantic information from images. This module effectively guides the diffusion model's generation through semantic cues, preventing errors caused by image degradation. SUPIR, "SUPIR: Restoration-Guided Sampling for One-Step Diffusion-based Real-ISR" uses Restoration-Guided Sampling to ensure both generative capability and fidelity. It also leverages a large dataset and a large pre-trained diffusion model, SDXL, "SDXL: A Large-Scale Pre-Trained Diffusion Model" to enhance the model's performance.

\textbf{One-step Diffusion-based Real-ISR.} Recently, one-step diffusion ISR models have become a popular research direction, showing great potential and application value Huang et al., "SinSR: Single Image Super-Resolution with Deterministic Sampling" introduces a deterministic sampling method. It fixes the noise-image pair using consistency-preserving distillation. OSEDiff, "One-Step Diffusion-based Inversion for Real-ISR" employs Variational Score Distillation (VSD), "Variational Score Distillation: A New Perspective on Diffusion Models in Real-ISR" and directly uses the low-resolution (LR) image as the starting point for diffusion inversion. In addition, OSEDiff uses DAPE, "DAPE: Distribution-Aware Perturbation Estimation for Diffusion-based Real-ISR" to extract semantic information from the LR image as the generation condition. ADDSR, "ADDSR: Adversarial Diffusion Distillation for One-Step and Multi-Step Real-ISR Models" combines adversarial training by introducing Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) and ControlNet to achieve both 4-step and one-step models. TSD-SR, "TSD-SR: Target Score Distillation with Distribution-Aware Sampling Module for Real-ISR" proposes Target Score Distillation (TSD) and a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module (DASM), effectively addressing the issue of artifacts caused by VSD in the early stages of training.
