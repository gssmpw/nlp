\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a novel distribution scenario-oriented watermarking schema for diffusion models and a new security mechanism to prevent watermark leakage and watermark escape in the model distribution scenarios, which offers new insights into current distribution scenarios by considering watermark randomness and watermark-model association as key constraints for enhancing watermarking security. We separate the watermark injection from the security mechanism, ensuring that fine-tuning the VAE focuses solely on the security mechanism without the added task of learning watermark patterns. Our watermarking scheme ensures both security and efficiency in model distribution scenarios. In the future, our research directions will include adversarial methods against forge attack \cite{lukas2023leveraging}, security mechanism with higher image quality and more consideration about model distribution scenarios.
