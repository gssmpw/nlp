\begin{abstract}

Latent diffusion models have exhibited considerable potential in generative tasks. Watermarking is considered to be an alternative to safeguard the copyright of generative models and prevent their misuse.
However, in the context of model distribution scenarios, the accessibility of models to large  scale of model users brings new challenges to the security, efficiency and robustness of existing watermark solutions. To address these issues, we propose a secure and efficient watermarking solution. A new security mechanism is designed to prevent watermark leakage and watermark escape, which considers  watermark randomness and watermark-model association as two constraints for  mandatory watermark injection. %To increase the security of watermark distribution, we propose watermark generation module to transform the watermark into a watermark-specific distribution and obtain a watermarked latent variable through sampling strategy. 
To reduce the time cost of training the security module, watermark injection and the security mechanism are decoupled, ensuring that fine-tuning VAE only accomplishes the security mechanism without the burden of learning watermark patterns. A watermark distribution-based verification strategy is proposed to enhance the robustness against diverse attacks in the model distribution scenarios.
% we decouple the watermark injection and the security mechanism, ensuring that fine-tuning VAE only accomplishes the security mechanism without the burden of learning watermark patterns.
% Specifically, the robustness of watermark detection is ensured by verifying whether the watermarked latent variables fall within the predefined watermark distribution. 
% We develop a watermark-network controller that is a security mechanism integrated into the latent diffusion model component, ensuring the integrity and security of watermark embeddings. 
Experimental results prove that our watermarking  consistently outperforms existing six baselines on effectiveness and robustness against ten image processing attacks and adversarial attacks, while enhancing security in the distribution scenarios.
%Latent diffusion models have demonstrated immense potential in generative tasks but have also raised concerns regarding illicit usage. Watermarking has been proved to be an effective solution for copyright protection and provenance tracking of generated content. 
% However, in model distribution scenarios, post-hoc watermarks can be easily circumvented, and existing model watermarking methods designed for latent diffusion models fail to withstand reconstruction attacks and adaptive adversarial sample attacks. 
%However, in model distribution scenarios, since model users can obtain the parameters of the model, it poses new threats to the security and robustness of watermarks.
% \yj{What's the core challenge in the distribution scenario, robustness, security, or both?} 
%Therefore, we propose a semantic watermarking method for latent diffusion model in model distribution scenarios. 
%We propose a Secure Latent Watermark Distribution method. 
%The robustness of watermark detection is ensured by detecting whether the watermarked latent variables are within the watermark distribution. 
%We introduce Watermark-Network Controller, a security mechanism integrated into latent diffusion model component to guarantee the security of watermark embedding.
% We propose a novel watermark distribution method : Watermarked Sampling from Distribution \yj{Introduce the mechanism to guarantee robustness} and first introduce Latent-VAE Skip-Binder, a security mechanism integrated into latent diffusion model component to guarantee the security of watermark embedding.
%Experimental results demonstrate that our watermarking  is consistently effective and robust compared with existing six baselines over ten image processing attacks and challenging adversarial attacks while is more secure in the distribution scenarios. 
The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DistriMark-F11F/.
%that compared to recent methods such as FSWatermark and Stable Signature, our method not only surpasses them in robustness but also exhibits significant advantages in terms of image quality.
