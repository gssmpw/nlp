abstract = {The smart metering and communication methods used in smart grid are being extensively studied owing to widespread applications of smart grid. Although the monitoring and control processes are widely used in industrial systems, the energy management requirements at both service supplier and consumer side for individuals promoted the evolution of smart grid. In this paper, it is aimed to disclose in a clear and clean way that what smart grid is and what kind of communication methods are used. All components of a smart grid are introduced in a logical way to facilitate the understanding, and communication methods are presented regarding to their improvements, advantages, and lacking feature. The developing generation, transmission, distribution and customer appliances are surveyed in terms of smart grid integration. The communication technologies are introduced as wireline and wireless classification where the key features are also tabulated. The security requirements of hardware and software in a smart grid are presented according to their cyber and physical structures.}
