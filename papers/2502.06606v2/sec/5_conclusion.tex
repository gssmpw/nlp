\section{Conclusion}

We introduce \textbf{MaterialFusion}, a novel framework for exemplar-based material transfer that balances material fidelity with detail preservation, leveraging existing pre-trained models like IP-Adapter and Guide-and-Rescale within a unified diffusion model approach. Through quantitative evaluations and user studies, our method demonstrates superior results in realistic material integration compared to existing approaches. However, our framework has limitations, particularly in handling highly complex materials or intricate textures where fine-grained control may still fall short. Despite these challenges, MaterialFusion offers a robust foundation for future advancements in controlled, high-quality material transfer for real-world applications.
