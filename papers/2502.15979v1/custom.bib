    abstract = "The key challenge in the attribute-value extraction (AVE) task from e-commerce sites is the scalability to diverse attributes for a large number of products in real-world e-commerce sites. To make AVE scalable to diverse attributes, recent researchers adopted a question-answering (QA)-based approach that additionally inputs the target attribute as a query to extract its values, and confirmed its advantage over a classical approach based on named-entity recognition (NER) on real-word e-commerce datasets. In this study, we argue the scalability of the NER-based approach compared to the QA-based approach, since researchers have compared BERT-based QA-based models to only a weak BiLSTM-based NER baseline trained from scratch in terms of only accuracy on datasets designed to evaluate the QA-based approach. Experimental results using a publicly available real-word dataset revealed that, under a fair setting, BERT-based NER models rival BERT-based QA models in terms of the accuracy, and their inference is faster than the QA model that processes the same product text several times to handle multiple target attributes.",

abstract = {Existing attribute-value extraction (AVE) models require large quantities of labeled data for training. However, new products with new attribute-value pairs enter the market every day in real-world e-Commerce. Thus, we formulate AVE in multi-label few-shot learning (FSL), aiming to extract unseen attribute value pairs based on a small number of training examples. We propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Attentive Framework (KEAF) based on prototypical networks, leveraging the generated label description and category information to learn more discriminative prototypes. Besides, KEAF integrates with hybrid attention to reduce noise and capture more informative semantics for each class by calculating the label-relevant and query-related weights. To achieve multi-label inference, KEAF further learns a dynamic threshold by integrating the semantic information from both the support set and the query set. Extensive experiments with ablation studies conducted on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other SOTA models for information extraction in few-shot learning.},

abstract = {E-commerce platforms should provide detailed product descriptions (attribute values) for effective product search and recommendation. However, attribute value information is typically not available for new products. To predict unseen attribute values, large quantities of labeled training data are needed to train a traditional supervised learning model. Typically, it is difficult, time-consuming, and costly to manually label large quantities of new product profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently and effectively extract unseen attribute values from new products in the absence of labeled data (zero-shot setting). We propose HyperPAVE, a multi-label zero-shot attribute value extraction model that leverages inductive inference in heterogeneous hypergraphs. In particular, our proposed technique constructs heterogeneous hypergraphs to capture complex higher-order relations (i.e. user behavior information) to learn more accurate feature representations for graph nodes. Furthermore, our proposed HyperPAVE model uses an inductive link prediction mechanism to infer future connections between unseen nodes. This enables HyperPAVE to identify new attribute values without the need for labeled training data. We conduct extensive experiments with ablation studies on different categories of the MAVE dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed HyperPAVE model significantly outperforms existing classification-based, generation-based large language models for attribute value extraction in the zero-shot setting.},
