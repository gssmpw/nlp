\subsection{Traditional methods}

Traditional methods often fall short in capturing the dynamic and diverse interactions. This shortcoming has led to a growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance drug-gene research. Identifying disease-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been the focus of various models, highlighting the role of non-coding genetic elements in diseases. GAERF **Wu et al., "Graph Autoencoder-based Random Forest for LncRNA-Disease Association Prediction"** , introduced by Wu \textit{et al.}, employs graph autoencoders (GAE) combined with random forest techniques for detecting disease-related lncRNAs. In contrast, LPLNS **Chen et al., "Label Propagation with Linear Neighborhood Similarity for Novel LncRNA-Disease Associations"** utilizes label propagation with linear neighborhood similarity to predict novel lncRNA-disease associations, thereby deepening our understanding of lncRNA roles in disease. lncRNA prediction methods add an extra layer of genetic interaction data, which, when integrated with drug-gene and miRNA predictions, offers a comprehensive view of genetic influences on diseases. Moreover, predicting disease-associated miRNAs sheds light on how these small RNA molecules regulate genes, serving as a vital complement to drug-gene interaction prediction. SMALF **Liu et al., "Small RNA-disease Association Prediction via Meta-path-based Aggregation"** , created by Liu \textit{et al.}, integrates latent features from the miRNA-disease association matrix with original features, utilizing XGBoost **Chen et al., "Xgboost-Based Small RNA-Disease Association Prediction"** to predict unknown miRNA-disease associations. Likewise, CNNMDA **Xuan et al., "Convolutional Neural Networks for MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction"** , introduced by Xuan \textit{et al.}, employs network representation learning in conjunction with convolutional neural networks (CNN).
 
\subsection{GNN-based methods}

Recent progress in AI, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has demonstrated significant potential in uncovering drug-gene associations. GNNs excel at capturing patterns from graph-structured data, making them highly effective in modeling drug-gene relationships. These models facilitate the identification of potential interactions, which is valuable for drug repurposing and discovering new therapeutic targets. For example, SGCLDGA **Li et al., "Singular Value Decomposition-based Graph Convolutional Network for Drug-Gene Association Prediction"** integrates GNNs with contrastive learning, using graph convolutional network (GCN)  **Wang et al., "Graph Convolutional Networks for Drug-Gene Association Prediction"** to derive vector representations of drugs and genes from a bipartite graph. It employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to refine the graph and create multiple views. Further, it optimizes these representations with a contrastive loss function to effectively differentiate positive and negative samples. In addition, multiple GNN-based methods have been developed for predicting miRNA-disease associations. HGCNMDA **Wang et al., "Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks for MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction"** combines GNNs with node2vec and GCN to jointly learn features of miRNAs and diseases, offering a comprehensive perspective by integrating diverse biological networks. LAGCN **Zhang et al., "Learning Atomic Graph Convolutions for MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction"** employs graph convolution along with attention mechanisms to learn and integrate embeddings for drugs and diseases from heterogeneous networks, effectively concentrating on crucial features to enhance prediction accuracy. Lastly, NIMCGCN **Li et al., "Node-wise Integrated Multi-scale Convolutional Graph Networks for MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction"** applies GCNs to uncover hidden features of miRNAs and diseases from similarity networks, thereby improving the discovery of novel miRNA-disease associations by leveraging similarities in known associations. These miRNA-disease prediction models contribute an additional layer of insight into the genetic underpinnings of diseases, which can aid in developing more targeted therapies when combined with drug-gene interaction predictions.

\subsection{Meta-path based methods}

Meta-path-based methods are extensively applied in drug-disease association prediction due to their effectiveness in revealing latent relationships through intermediate nodes within heterogeneous networks. A meta-path, defined as a sequence of relations linking different node types, captures essential semantic information, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. MGP-DDA, in studying drug-disease associations, constructs a tripartite network involving drugs, gene ontology (go) functions, and diseases, employing three specific meta-paths to capture their interrelations **Zhang et al., "Meta-Path-based Aggregation for Drug-Disease Association Prediction"** . These meta-paths generate features based on path instance counts, which are then used for drug-disease association prediction, showing robust performance by retaining richer semantic information from intermediate nodes. Similarly, HSGCLRDA integrates meta-path aggregation in a drug-disease-protein heterogeneous network **Wang et al., "Heterogeneous Similarity Graph-based Contrastive Learning for Drug-Disease Association Prediction"** . By constructing both global and local feature graphs through meta-paths, HSGCLRDA can capture detailed structural and contextual information about the interactions between drugs, diseases, and proteins. This meta-path-based aggregation is combined with contrastive learning to optimize feature representations, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Both methods highlight the strength of meta-path-based techniques in enhancing prediction tasks by retaining and utilizing rich semantic information from heterogeneous networks. These approaches not only enable the discovery of novel drug-disease associations but also contribute to the broader understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.
