Recent years, learned image compression has made tremendous progress to achieve impressive coding efficiency. Its coding gain mainly comes from non-linear neural network-based transform and learnable entropy modeling. However, most studies focus on a strong backbone, and few studies consider a low complexity design. In this paper, we propose LALIC, a linear attention modeling for learned image compression. Specially, we propose to use Bi-RWKV blocks, by utilizing the Spatial Mix and Channel Mix modules to achieve more compact feature extraction, and apply the Conv based Omni-Shift module to adapt to two-dimensional latent representation. Furthermore, we propose a RWKV-based Spatial-Channel ConTeXt model (RWKV-SCCTX), that leverages the Bi-RWKV to modeling the correlation between neighboring features effectively.
To our knowledge, our work is the first work to utilize efficient Bi-RWKV models with linear attention for learned image compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive RD performances by outperforming VTM-9.1 by -15.26\%, -15.41\%, -17.63\% in BD-rate on Kodak, CLIC and Tecnick datasets. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/sjtu-medialab/RwkvCompress}.
