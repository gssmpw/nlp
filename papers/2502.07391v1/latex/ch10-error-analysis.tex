\subsection{Error Analysis} \label{sec:error-analysis}
Despite the excellent performance of \model, we recognize that it can exhibit different types of errors, which can lead to inaccurate sarcasm explanations. 
Therefore, we conduct a thorough error analysis and identify the following as the primary causes of erroneous behavior in \model's performance:
% Therefore, in order to identify these errors and the potential reasons behind them, we conduct a thorough error analysis by examining individual samples for which \model\ was unable to correctly explain the underlying sarcasm and trying to identify factors which may have caused such erroneous behavior. 
% From our analysis, we were able to identify the following as the primary causes of errors in \model's performance: 
\textbf{a)} \textit{extraction of irrelevant external knowledge concepts} (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:error-analysis}); 
\textbf{b)} \textit{missing external knowledge concepts} (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:error-analysis-no-knowledge});
\textbf{c)} \textit{insufficient OCR features} (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:error-analysis-OCR});
\textbf{d)} \textit{irrelevant image description} (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:error-analysis-irrelevant-desc}). Appendix \ref{sec:appendix-error-analysis} provides a detailed account of the errors exhibited by \model.
