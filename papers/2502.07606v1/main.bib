abstract = {We provide a novel reduction from swap-regret minimization to external-regret minimization, which improves upon the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour and Stoltz-Lugosi in that it does not require finiteness of the space of actions. We show that, whenever there exists a no-external-regret algorithm for some hypothesis class, there must also exist a no-swap-regret algorithm for that same class. For the problem of learning with expert advice, our result implies that it is possible to guarantee that the swap regret is bounded by є after (logN)\~{O}(1/є) rounds and with O(N) per iteration complexity, where N is the number of experts, while the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour and Stoltz-Lugosi require at least Ω(N/є2) rounds and at least Ω(N3) total computational cost. Our result comes with an associated lower bound, which—in contrast to that of Blum-Mansour—holds for oblivious and ℓ1-constrained adversaries and learners that can employ distributions over experts, showing that the number of rounds must be Ω(N/є2) or exponential in 1/є. Our reduction implies that, if no-regret learning is possible in some game, then this game must have approximate correlated equilibria, of arbitrarily good approximation. This strengthens the folklore implication of no-regret learning that approximate coarse correlated equilibria exist. Importantly, it provides a sufficient condition for the existence of approximate correlated equilibrium which vastly extends the requirement that the action set is finite or the requirement that the action set is compact and the utility functions are continuous, allowing for games with finite Littlestone or finite sequential fat shattering dimension, thus answering a question left open in “Fast rates for nonparametric online learning: from realizability to learning in games” and “ Online learning and solving infinite games with an ERM oracle”. Moreover, it answers several outstanding questions about equilibrium computation and/or learning in games. In particular, for constant values of є: (a) ‍we show that є-approximate correlated equilibria in extensive-form games can be computed efficiently, advancing a long-standing open problem for extensive-form games; see e.g. ‍“ Extensive-form correlated equilibrium: Definition and computational complexity” and “ Polynomial-Time Linear-Swap Regret Minimization in Imperfect-Information Sequential Games”; (b) ‍we show that the query and communication complexities of computing є-approximate correlated equilibria in N-action normal-form games are N · poly log(N) and poly logN respectively, advancing an open problem of “Informational Bounds on Equilibria”; (c) we show that є-approximate correlated equilibria of sparsity poly logN can be computed efficiently, advancing an open problem of “Simple Approximate Equilibria in Large Games”; (d) finally, we show that in the adversarial bandit setting, sublinear swap regret can be achieved in only \~{O}(N) rounds, advancing an open problem of “From External to Internal Regret” and “Tight Lower Bound and Efficient Reduction for Swap Regret”.},

abstract = {We give a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that, for any constant ε>0, obtains ε T-swap regret within only T = (n) rounds; this is an exponential improvement compared to the super-linear number of rounds required by the state-of-the-art algorithm, and resolves the main open problem of ‍[]. Our algorithm has an exponential dependence on ε, but we prove a new, matching lower bound.   Our algorithm for swap regret implies faster convergence to ε-Correlated Equilibrium (ε-CE) in several regimes: For normal form two-player games with n actions, it implies the first uncoupled dynamics that converges to the set of ε-CE in polylogarithmic rounds; a (n)-bit communication protocol for ε-CE in two-player games (resolving an open problem mentioned by ‍[, , ]); and an \~{O}(n)-query algorithm for ε-CE (resolving an open problem of ‍[] and obtaining the first separation between ε-CE and ε-Nash equilibrium in the query complexity model).   For extensive-form games, our algorithm implies a PTAS for normal form correlated equilibria, a solution concept often conjectured to be computationally intractable (e.g. ‍[, ]).},

abstract = {In an online decision problem, one makes a sequence of decisions without knowledge of the future. Each period, one pays a cost based on the decision and observed state. We give a simple approach for doing nearly as well as the best single decision, where the best is chosen with the benefit of hindsight. A natural idea is to follow the leader, i.e. each period choose the decision which has done best so far. We show that by slightly perturbing the totals and then choosing the best decision, the expected performance is nearly as good as the best decision in hindsight. Our approach, which is very much like Hannan's original game-theoretic approach from the 1950s, yields guarantees competitive with the more modern exponential weighting algorithms like Weighted Majority. More importantly, these follow-the-leader style algorithms extend naturally to a large class of structured online problems for which the exponential algorithms are inefficient.}
