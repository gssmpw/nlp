\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduced CutPaste\&Find, a novel, training-free framework for detecting hallucinations in LVLM-generated descriptions. Unlike existing methods that depend on costly LVLM-based inference, our approach utilizes off-the-shelf visual and linguistic tools, making it both efficient and scalable. By incorporating a visual-aid knowledge base and a scaling factor for improved similarity alignment, our method enables robust hallucination detection with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CutPaste\&Find is both effective and resource-efficient, offering a practical solution for enhancing the reliability of LVLMs.
