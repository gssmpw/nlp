\noindent\textbf{Corpora } Many corpora explore the notion of belief on the sentence level. FactBank is one of the first corpora to do this, annotating source-and-target belief: both the belief presented by the author towards an event and the belief towards events by sources mentioned inside of the text ____.
Other corpora annotate only the author's belief towards events: these corpora include LU ____, UW ____, LDCCB ____, MEANTIME ____, MegaVeridicality ____,  UDS-IH2 ____, CommitmentBank ____, and RP ____. Two recent corpora for event factuality are Maven-Fact ____ which contains a large-scale corpus of event and supporting evidence annotations, 
and ModaFact ____, which is an Italian author belief corpus that annotates in a similar style and inspiration as FactBank. 

\noindent\textbf{Methods} Previous methods for author belief prediction mainly involve fine-tuning: ____ fine-tune multi-task LSTMs; ____ fine-tune a graph convolutional network with BERT ____ representations; ____ fine-tune RoBERTa ____ with span representations; ____ fine-tune RoBERTa and Flan-T5 ____, and also explore four LLMs predictions using few-shot learning; ____ fine-tune BERT, mT5-XXL ____, Aya23-8B ____, and Minerva-3B ____.

There has been much less focus on the complete source-and-target belief task: ____ both fine-tune a Flan-T5 model, with the latter optimizing for the structure of belief represented as a tree.
