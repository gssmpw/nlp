\section*{Impact statement}
This paper contributes to advancing second-order optimization, with potential implications for both theoretical insights and practical applications. While our work does not present immediate concerns warranting specific emphasis, we recognize that progress in this field may have broader societal impacts. We remain committed to engaging in discussions on the broader implications of our research should the need arise in the future.

% This work aims to advance the area of practical second-order optimization. 
% There are many potential societal
% consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be
% specifically highlighted here.
%We also do not identify any immediate concerns that warrant specific discussion.
% We made extensive efforts to ensure that our experimental results are reproducible, including providing comprehensive descriptions of all experimental configurations and hyperparameters (\cref{app:hypersearch}), details of the hardware used during training and evaluation (\cref{app:resources}), as well as the use of, and providing links to, publicly available datasets and source codes for various algorithms used in our experiments. After publication, we also plan to release our source code, which will include algorithm implementations, hyperparameter settings, dependencies, and hardware configurations necessary for reproduction.
