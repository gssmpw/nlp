\begin{abstract}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
  Adversarial robustness of machine learning models is critical to ensuring reliable performance under data perturbations. Recent progress has been on point estimators, and this paper considers distributional predictors. First, using the link between exponential families and Bregman divergences, we formulate an adversarial  Bregman divergence loss as an adversarial negative log-likelihood. Using the geometric properties of Bregman divergences, we  compute the adversarial perturbation for such models in closed-form. Second, under such losses, we introduce \emph{adversarially robust posteriors}, by exploiting the optimization-centric view of generalized Bayesian inference. Third, we derive the \emph{first} rigorous generalization certificates in the context of an adversarial extension of Bayesian linear regression by leveraging the PAC-Bayesian framework. Finally, experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior robustness of the derived adversarially robust posterior over Bayes posterior, and also validate our theoretical guarantees.
  %Third, we study generalization certificates in the context of an adversarial extension of Bayesian linear regression. 
  %Leveraging the PAC-Bayesian framework, we derive novel generalization risk certificates 
  %for both standard Bayes and adversarially robust posteriors, considering both standard and adversarial negative log likelihood loss functions. 
  %Our analysis provides the \emph{first} rigorous non-trivial generalization guarantees for adversarially robust probabilistic models. 
  %we evaluate the robustness Bayes and adversarially robust posteriors on real data, and validate the generalization certificates on synthetic data. %Experimental evaluation of the bounds shows the non-vacuousness of the certificates.

\section{Back Matter}
There are a some final, special sections that come at the back of the paper, in the following order:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Author Contributions (optional)
  \item Acknowledgements (optional)
  \item References
\end{itemize}
They all use an unnumbered \verb|\subsubsection|.

For the first two special environments are provided.
(These sections are automatically removed for the anonymous submission version of your paper.)
The third is the ‘References’ section.
(See below.)

(This ‘Back Matter’ section itself should not be included in your paper.)


\begin{contributions} % will be removed in pdf for initial submission 
					  % (without ‘accepted’ option in \documentclass)
                      % so you can already fill it to test with the
                      % ‘accepted’ class option
    Briefly list author contributions. 
    This is a nice way of making clear who did what and to give proper credit.
    This section is optional.

    H.~Q.~Bovik conceived the idea and wrote the paper.
    Coauthor One created the code.
    Coauthor Two created the figures.
