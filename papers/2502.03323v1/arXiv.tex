\begin{abstract}
Distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for reliable deployment of classification systems. However, OOD data is typically unavailable or difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge for accurate OOD detection. In this work, we present a method that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create high-quality synthetic OOD proxies, eliminating the dependency on any external OOD data source. We study the efficacy of our method on classical text classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification as well as classification tasks arising in LLM development and deployment, such as training a reward model for RLHF and detecting misaligned generations.
Extensive experiments on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and various model sizes show that our approach dramatically lowers false positive rates (achieving a perfect zero in some cases) while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution tasks, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin\footnote{The code is available at \url{https://github.com/mominabbass/ood_synthetic} and the dataset can be accessed at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/abbasm2/synthetic_ood}.}.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
OOD detection is a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for classification systems deployed in real-world applications. Identifying when a model encounters inputs that deviate significantly from its training distribution is crucial for ensuring reliability, safety, and alignment with intended use cases. However, effectively detecting OOD samples has proven difficult \citep{nguyen2015deep}, largely due to the challenge of obtaining representative OOD data for training robust detectors.


Previous approaches to OOD detection have focused on leveraging external OOD datasets \citep{hendrycks2018using}, augmenting in-distribution (InD) images through mixing techniques \citep{hendrycks2022pixmix, zhang2023mixture}, and using unlabeled wild data to enhance classifier training \citep{du2024how, katz2022training}.
However, these methods are limited by the availability and representativeness of OOD data. Real-world OOD inputs can be highly diverse and unpredictable, making it impractical to curate datasets that capture the full spectrum of potential distribution shifts.


In this work, we propose a simple approach that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to synthesize high-quality OOD proxies, eliminating the need for any external OOD data source. Our key insight is that by carefully prompting LLMs, we can generate synthetic samples that mimic potential distribution shifts and serve as effective proxies for real OOD data. This allows us to train robust OOD detectors using only InD data and synthetically generated OOD proxies.
Our approach capitalizes on the recent success of LLMs to create synthetic datasets applicable across diverse downstream learning tasks \citep{tang2023does, gao2023selfguided}.
By applying this paradigm to OOD detection, we aim to overcome the longstanding challenge of OOD data scarcity. Rather than attempting to collect or curate real OOD samples, we leverage the semantic understanding and generative abilities of LLMs to produce diverse synthetic proxies that capture the essence of distribution shifts.

We identify several critical use cases where existing OOD detection methods fall short, including classical NLP classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification, as well as classification tasks relevant to the development of modern LLM systems, such as training a reward model for RLHF \citep{christiano2017deep} and detection of misaligned generations. We demonstrate that established OOD detection score-based methods \citep{hendrycks2017a, liang2018enhancing, NEURIPS2020_f5496252, wang2021can, sun2022dice} under perform on these use-cases when using in-distribution data to learn an OOD detection rule. Our synthetic data generation approach effectively addresses these challenges by generating representative OOD samples leading to an efficient OOD detector.
The primary contributions of our work are:

\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related works}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

\textbf{Detecting OOD data.}
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in OOD detection \citep{fort2021exploring, yang2024generalized, NEURIPS2022_f0e91b13, galil2023a, djurisic2023extremely, zheng2023out, wang2023outofdistribution, zhu2023diversified, bai2023feed, ming2024does, ghosal2024overcome}. 
One approach to detect OOD data uses scoring functions to assess data distribution, including:

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Distance-based methods} \citep{NEURIPS2018_abdeb6f5, NEURIPS2020_8965f766, ren2021simple, NEURIPS2022_804dbf8d, ming2023how}: 
    These methods compute distances (e.g., Mahalanobis distance or cosine similarity) between a sample and class prototypes in feature space to measure how far a sample is from in-distribution data.
    \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Energy-based scores} \citep{NEURIPS2020_f5496252, wu2023energybased}: These scores leverage the energy of a sample computed from the logits of a neural network to determine its likelihood of belonging to the in-distribution or OOD set.
    \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Confidence-based approaches} \citep{bendale2016towards, hendrycks2017a, liang2018enhancing}:
   These rely on model confidence scores (e.g., softmax probabilities) to identify OOD data, often enhanced by techniques like temperature scaling and input perturbation.
    \vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Bayesian methods} \citep{pmlr-v48-gal16, NIPS2017_9ef2ed4b, NEURIPS2019_7dd2ae7d, Wen2020BatchEnsemble}: 
    They use Bayesian models to quantify uncertainty in model predictions to identify inputs that are significantly different from the training data.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
Another approach to OOD detection involves using regularization techniques during the training phase \citep{NEURIPS2018_3ea2db50, pmlr-v97-geifman19a, NEURIPS2020_28e209b6, yang2021semantically, pmlr-v162-wei22d, du2022unknown, NEURIPS2023_bf5311df, NEURIPS2023_e812af67}.
For example, regularization techniques can be applied to the model to either reduce its confidence \citep{lee2017training, hendrycks2018deep} or increase its energy \citep{NEURIPS2020_f5496252, du2022towards, pmlr-v162-ming22a} on the OOD data.
Most of these regularization methods assume the availability of an \emph{additional auxiliary OOD dataset}. 
Several studies \citep{NEURIPS2021_f4334c13, pmlr-v162-katz-samuels22a, he2023topological} relaxed this assumption by either utilizing unlabeled wild data or employing positive-unlabeled learning, which trains classifiers using positive and/or unlabeled data \citep{letouzey2000learning, pmlr-v37-hsiehb15, niu2016theoretical, gong2018margin, NEURIPS2020_1e6e25d9, NEURIPS2021_47b4f1bf, xu2021positive, NEURIPS2022_8d5f526a, du2024how}. 
These approaches rely on the assumption that such external data is both sufficiently available and representative of real-world OOD scenarios. In practice, real-world OOD inputs are highly diverse and unpredictable, making it difficult to curate datasets that capture all potential distribution shifts; as \citet{yang2024generalized} highlight, \emph{"...approaches impose a strong assumption on the availability of OOD training data, which can be infeasible in practice."} Practical constraints have led to a shift in recent research toward settings where real OOD data is either unavailable or significantly limited. Unlike these approaches, our synthetic data generation approach completely removes the dependency on external data sources and allows us to create more controlled and flexible test conditions. 


\textbf{Synthetic data.}
Recently, synthetic data has been used for OOD detection in the image domain;  \citet{kwon2023improving} leverage CLIP \citep{radford2021learning}, a vision-language model, to erase InD regions from training images and then uses a latent diffusion model to replace them with realistic OOD features that blend seamlessly with the image background whereas \citet{sun2024clip} generate synthetic image samples by using a variant of CLIP to mix InD features from different classes.
In contrast, we focus on textual data and leverage LLMs to generate high-quality proxies for OOD data that capture the complexities of real-world OOD data. In our work, we explore the efficacy of LLM-generated OOD proxies for OOD detection, an area which remains largely unexplored.

\section{Synthetic Data Generation} 
\label{sec:synthetic_data_generation}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
\subsection{Synthetic data pipeline}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
Our synthetic generation pipeline is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic_data_generation}.
Unlike previous studies that leverage external OOD data sources or augment InD samples by mixing them together (see Section \ref{sec:intro}), our method completely removes the need for original OOD samples in training the OOD detector. 
Following the protocol in \citet{liu2023good, yang2022openood, winkens2020contrastive},  we divide OOD data into two categories: near-OOD and far-OOD, far-OOD where InD and OOD data come from different domains and near-OOD where InD and OOD data come from the same domain but with different classes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:InD_vs_OOD}. Near-OOD samples are generally more challenging to identify.
\begin{figure*}[h]

\end{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=0.94\linewidth]{figures/near_vs_far_OOD.pdf}

    \caption{Comparison of far- and near-OOD instances with InD samples.}
    \label{fig:InD_vs_OOD}
    \vspace{-0.1cm}
\end{figure*}


For far-OOD, we employ a two-stage process, while for near-OOD, we use a single-stage process. This is because near-OOD data originates from the same domain as InD data, allowing us to use InD examples as in-context demonstrations within the prompt.
In contrast, far-OOD data comes from a different domain, so we first generate a few seed demonstrations by prompting the LLM in the initial stage. These seed demonstrations are then used as in-context demonstrations in the second stage, guiding the LLM to generate the final responses, which helps enhance the diversity of the outputs.
We generate all synthetic OOD data using the Llama 3 70B Instruct model, unless stated otherwise. 
The specific prompts used for generating the OOD data are detailed in Tables \ref{table_generation_gsm8k}-\ref{table_generation_BT_DSI_HSOL}.
After generating the final responses, following \citet{wang2022self}, we filter out invalid entries, excessively long or short instructions, as well as low-quality or repetitive responses; this ensures a diverse and high-quality dataset for our subsequent analyses and model training. 
To better understand the effectiveness of our synthetic generation pipeline, we visualize the sentence representations of InD, original OOD, and synthetic OOD data in Figure \ref{fig:umap_comments}; a detailed discussion of these visualizations follows in Section \ref{section_results}.
Example data from the original OOD dataset alongside our synthetic data can be found in Appendix Tables \ref{table_synthetic_examples_gsm8k}-\ref{table_synthetic_examples_HSOL}.

\vspace{-0.1cm}
\subsection{Synthetic data model}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
We consider two strategies to train an OOD detector using the synthetic OOD data:

\textbf{Repurposing a pre-trained model}.
Suppose we have access to a model trained for the InD task. Let $\phi: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^h$ denote the feature extractor of the pre-trained InD model, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the input space and $h$ is the dimensionality of the feature representation. We add a \emph{binary classification layer} on top of the feature extractor to predict an OOD score $z_{\text{ood}} = \mathbf{w}^\top \phi(x)$, where $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^h$. Then the probability that a sample is OOD is given by $p_{\text{ood}}(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(z_{\text{ood}})$, where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function. To fit the OOD detector weights $\mathbf{w}$ we can use a small amount of InD data and the synthetically generated OOD data and train with the binary classification loss. The main advantage of this approach is that it is guaranteed to preserve the in-distribution predictions of the pre-trained model while augmenting it with the ability to detect OOD samples. In addition, we don't require access to the exact InD data the model was trained on, which will be convenient in our RLHF reward modeling experiment in Section \ref{sec:rlhf}.


\textbf{End-to-end training}. The second approach involves training a \emph{single} $(K+1)$-way model (e.g. Llama-2 13B), where the first $K$ classes correspond to the InD classes and the $(K+1)$-th class represents the OOD category.
The classification layer is now parameterized by $\mathbf{W}_{\text{univ}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(K+1) \times h}$, enabling the model to output logits for $K$ InD classes and one OOD class:
$z_{\text{univ}} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{univ}} \phi(x)$
where $\mathbf{z}_{\text{univ}} \in \mathbb{R}^{K+1}$ corresponds to the logits for the classes $\{1, \dots, K, K+1\}$, with the $(K+1)$-th class designated for OOD instances.
This model is trained using the combined $K$-class InD dataset\footnote{Note that $K=2$ in our experiments.} and the synthetic OOD dataset. The main advantage of this approach is the flexibility to simultaneously learn to accurately predict in-distribution and distinguish InD vs OOD, thus improving the overall performance. We use this method in all but the reward modeling experiments and conduct an ablation study in Section \ref{sec:additional_studies}.


\vspace{-0.1cm}
\section{Experiments}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
In this section, we demonstrate how well our framework performs across various InD-OOD dataset pairs, encompassing a wide range of real-world scenarios. We identify four crucial scenarios where addressing the OOD detection problem is especially valuable: \textbf{1) toxicity detection}, \textbf{2) harm detection}, \textbf{3) RLHF reward modeling}, and \textbf{4) selective classification}.

% \vspace{-0.1cm}
\subsection{Model, Datasets, and Prompt Details} \label{sec_model_dataset_prompts}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
For toxicity detection, harm detection, and selective classification tasks, we conduct experiments using Llama-2 \citep{touvron2023llama} with 7/13B parameters unless stated otherwise. For RLHF reward model filtering, we employ Starling-RM-7B-alpha \citep{starling2023}, which is pretrained from Llama2-7B-Chat \citep{touvron2023llama}\footnote{we use Starling-RM-7B-alpha because, unlike general Llama models, it is a pre-trained reward model specifically designed for the RLHF pipeline.}. 
We employ smaller 7B and 13B Llama variants as detector models to keep the system simple and computationally efficient, as larger models would add unnecessary complexity and computation.
All experiments are performed on hardware equipped with NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs. We provide the necessary code to reproduce our results.

\textbf{Datasets.} We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs. As InD datasets, we use Civil Comments \citep{borkan2019nuanced} (toxicity detection; we use CC for brevity), BeaverTails [Non-Violent Unethical Behavior] (NVUB) \citep{ji2024beavertails} (harm detection; we use BT for brevity), and RewardBench Chat \citep{lambert2024rewardbench} (RLHF reward model filtering). For toxicity and harm detection tasks, each InD dataset is paired with four OOD datasets; two are categorized as far-OOD\footnote{Far-OOD detection is crucial in real-world systems that need to detect and handle tasks such as math or coding problems differently; for example, these tasks should bypass unnecessary processes, such as harmful content filters, which are useful for general text but costly and irrelevant for math or code.} and two as near-OOD; datasets' abbreviations are listed in Table \ref{tab:InD_OOD_pairs} with details in Appendix \ref{appendix_datasets}. During our preliminary experiments, we refined several prompt templates for improved quality and diversity, eventually adopting a fixed format for each task (shown in Table \ref{table_classification_prompts}).

\textbf{Evaluation metrics.} We evaluate our approach using three standard OOD detection metrics:
(1) False Positive Rate at 95\% True Positive Rate (FPR95↓): This metric measures the false positive rate of OOD samples when the true positive rate of InD samples is fixed at 95\%.
(2) Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC↑): This metric assesses the overall separability between InD and OOD samples across various thresholds.
(3) InD Classification Accuracy (InD Acc↑): quantifies the model's performance on the primary task of classifying InD samples.

\textbf{Baselines.}
We compare our method against the widely used baselines like MSP \citep{hendrycks2017a}, Energy score \citep{NEURIPS2020_f5496252}, ReAct \citep{sun2021react}, and DICE \citep{sun2022dice}, which employ a binary model (since $K=2$) trained only on the InD data and do not incorporate any OOD data, neither original nor synthetic, during training\footnote{Both our method and the baselines use the \emph{same real InD data}, ensuring a fair comparison.} (see Appendix \ref{appendix_score_baselines} for baseline details). 
During testing, these models receive both InD and OOD data. OOD detection is performed by assigning a score: a high score suggests the data is from InD, while a low score indicates it is from OOD. We use the MSP, Energy, ReAct, and DICE scores for this purpose. Although these baselines were originally proposed for image data, we evaluate them on text data.
We also consider an \emph{ideal setting} by training a three-class model directly on the \emph{original OOD data}. This ideal setting is not commonly used in OOD literature as it does not reflect real-world conditions because OOD data can encompass any data encountered in the wild, which we typically lack access to.
We use ``Original'' for the model trained on the original OOD data and ``Synthetic'' for the model trained on our generated proxies.

\subsubsection{Toxicity and Harm Detection}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
\textbf{Toxicity detection} is a classical text classification task with applications to moderation of online conversations to promote safe and inclusive conversations.


\textbf{Harm detection} is essential for resolving critical misalignment issues in LLMs, where the LLM's outputs can diverge from desired ethical standards. The goal is to train a smaller specialized detector model (i.e. a fine-tuned classifier) to proactively identify when alignment methods should be applied \citep{ngweta2024aligners,ji2024aligner} to correct a harmful response from an LLM. By targeting alignment efforts only when necessary, this approach significantly mitigates the ``alignment tax'' — the resource-intensive process of continuously aligning an LLM — ensuring more efficient and cost-effective alignment without compromising LLM's integrity \citep{ouyang2022training}.

For both tasks, we adopted LoRA \citep{hu2021lora}, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, to fine-tune Llama-2 13B. Our objective is twofold: first, to determine if an input, i.e. CC or BT prompt-response pair, is appropriate; second, to classify inputs as InD or OOD. To achieve this, we utilized a three-way model with labels Positive (i.e. non-toxic or aligned), Negative (i.e. toxic or not aligned), and Neutral (i.e. OOD). 
In all experiments, we maintained a consistent setup: a learning rate of 1.5e-4 and a batch size of 16. We configured the total number of epochs to 10 and applied early stopping. 
We employed LoRA with these configurations: an alpha of 16, dropout of 0.1, and a rank of 16. The LoRA target modules included "q\_proj," "k\_proj," "v\_proj," "out\_proj," "fc\_in," "fc\_out," and "wte."
For Civil Comments, we label samples with a toxicity score of 0 as Positive and those with a score above 0.6 as Negative.
For BeaverTails, we select Negative samples based on the harm category and Positive samples when the `is\_safe' category is True.
Each model was trained by randomly sampling 6000 data samples while ensuring a comparable number of samples per class, except for Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP), where only 374 training samples were available, all of which were used. The size of the synthetic and original data is kept similar in our experiments\footnote{Note that synthetic data can be generated in large volumes, if needed, allowing even larger performance improvement. We kept the synthetic and original data sizes similar for consistency.}.
In cases where validation samples are not available, we sample them from the training data, ensuring the selected samples are mutually exclusive from the training set. The testing data is always disjoint from both the training and validation datasets.


Our main results are shown in Table \ref{table_main-results} for the eight InD-OOD dataset pairs for toxicity and harm detection tasks. 
First, we observe that our three-way synthetic model matches or surpasses the baseline models on InD accuracy for nearly all InD-OOD dataset pairs. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in performing the primary task of InD classification.
The only instance where the InD performance deviates slightly more from the baselines is in the case of BT (SEAC \& DAWBS), which we believe is due to the significant semantic similarity between the InD and OOD data, making the task especially challenging. 

Next, we observe that our synthetic proxies significantly outperform the MSP, Energy, ReAct, and DICE score-based baselines in terms of FPR95 on far-OOD datasets, while either matching or exceeding the performance of the ideal model trained on original OOD data. 
For example, on BT-GSM8K, our approach exceeds the ideal model, yielding an improvement of 0.23\% on FPR95.
In contrast, the score-based methods consistently underperform, resulting in high FPR95 and low AUROC values across nearly all datasets. 
Remarkably, in certain cases such as CC-GSM8K, CC-MBPP, and BT-MBPP, our method achieves a perfect zero FPR95.
On the challenging near-OOD datasets, our synthetic model is the only approach that performs close to the ideal model. In comparison, the baseline methods perform poorly; for instance, on SST-2, our model achieves an FPR95 of 10.16\%, while MSP, Energy, ReAct, and DICE yield FPR95 values of 92.31\% and 70.35\%, 61.89, and 69.63\%, respectively, highlighting their considerable limitations on text data.
These observations are particularly noteworthy because they illustrate the capability of artificially generated samples to learn a general decision boundary that can accurately identify actual OOD instances, demonstrating that our method achieves accurate predictions across diverse and potentially unfamiliar data distributions.\footnote{
Appendix \ref{appendix:additional_exp} provides an in-depth analysis of predictions and misclassifications, showing that most near-OOD errors reflect the true data distribution.} 



\subsubsection{RLHF reward modeling}
\label{sec:rlhf}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
% \textbf{RLHF reward modeling.}
In the RLHF pipeline, a reward model serves as an automated system that learns human preferences and assigns scores to model outputs. It guides the fine-tuning process of LLMs, making the training more efficient, scalable, and consistent. By reducing the need for continuous human labeling, it significantly accelerates model development while maintaining alignment with human values.
However, as evident from the RewardBench Leaderboard \citep{lambert2024rewardbench},\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench}} certain reward models excel in specific text categories (e.g., Chat), achieving high win percentages, yet perform miserably in others (e.g., Reasoning), yielding significantly lower win percentages.
Therefore, we designed a dual-purpose reward model that not only evaluates the score of a given LLM response but also categorizes it based on whether it pertains to a high-performing category (i.e., InD) or a low-performing category (i.e., OOD) in terms of win percentage. 
Our redesigned reward model thus provides two outputs: 1) a score and 2) a classification label (i.e., InD vs OOD). Such a model can strengthen the RLHF pipeline. If the model encounters an input belonging to a low-performing category, the practitioner can choose to discard or ignore this output, thereby aiding in the training of a more robust RLHF model.


To model the aforementioned dual-purpose behavior, we applied a single layer classification head on top the last layer last token embedding of the Starling-RM-7B-alpha model while keeping the entire LLM frozen. 
We use the RewardBench (Chat) category as InD and the RewardBench (Reasoning) category as OOD. This decision was based on the performance of the Starling-RM-7B-alpha model, which achieves a high win percentage of 98.0\% for Chat on the RewardBench Leaderboard, indicating strong performance. 
Conversely, its performance in the Reasoning category was notably poorer, with a win percentage of only 58.0\%. As InD dataset (i.e. Chat), we used five subsets including alpacaeval-easy, alpacaeval-length, alpacaeval-hard, mt-bench-easy, mt-bench-medium. As OOD dataset (i.e. Reasoning), we used five code and math subsets including math-prm, hep-cpp, hep-java, hep-python, and hep-rust. The single layer classification head was trained using cross entropy loss for ten epochs with a batch size of 16, learning rate of 4e-5 with linear scheduling, and AdamW optimizer. 

Results for the RLHF reward modeling are shown in Table \ref{table_reward_model}.

\end{table}
We observe that our reward model accurately distinguishes OOD test samples from InD when trained on synthetic data, achieving detection accuracy comparable to the ideal model. 
This capability is particularly valuable as it enables practitioners to use reward models trained on their domain without worrying about degrading LLM capabilities in other domains where the reward model may perform poorly.

  \vspace{-0.5cm}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Selective classification}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
One way to improve the reliability and efficiency of a classifier model is to use selective classification \citep{geifman2017selective} under which the model abstains from making predictions when it is uncertain. This method has demonstrated promising results in classification tasks by minimizing the risk of incorrect predictions, making it well-suited for mission-critical applications where the impact of errors is significant. 
We investigate whether or not selective classification can be used to enhance classifier performance in the presence of OOD data.
For example, given a binary detector trained to classify whether an input text is `Negative' (i.e. toxic) or `Positive' (i.e. non-toxic). At test time, we input samples from both InD (i.e. Negative/Positive) and OOD (e.g. math/code problems or toxicity data coming from a different data distribution) data. The model performance is enhanced by dropping samples on which the model is most uncertain based on a \emph{score} (e.g. MSP/Energy/DICE scores; details in next section).

For selective classification experiments, we use four InD-OOD pairs: CC-SST-2, CC-ToxiGen, BT-BT (SEAC \& DAWBS), and BT-BT (DSI \& HSOL); abbreviations are detailed in Table \ref{tab:InD_OOD_pairs}.
We opt for the more challenging near-OOD datasets because their strong semantic similarity to the InD data makes the classification task particularly difficult.
We train a Llama-2 7B binary model, which is trained to classify `Negative' versus `Positive' text. The x-axis represents coverage, which indicates the percentage of total test samples remaining after selective filtering, where samples with the lowest scores (based on MSP/Energy/DICE scores) are removed. Risk is then evaluated by making predictions on various coverage sets using the same Llama-2 7B binary model that generated these coverage sets. 
We compare these score baselines against our method, which employs a three-way Llama-2 7B model (classifying `Negative', `Positive', and `Neutral', where `Neutral' represents the OOD class) trained on both the InD data and the synthetic OOD data. Unlike the baselines, our method selects coverage sets by eliminating samples that have the \emph{highest} probability of being classified as `Neutral'. Risk is then evaluated by making predictions on these coverage sets using the same Llama-2 7B binary model used for the baselines.

The results for the selective classification for CC-Toxigen pair are show in Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_toxigen} (see Appendix Figures \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_sst2}, \ref{fig_selec_class_BT_llama2-7b} for additional dataset pairs). We observe that the baselines exhibit suboptimal performance, with high risk values. The Energy method completely fails across all InD-OOD pairs, providing negligible reduction in risk.
Additionally, the proportion of OOD samples removed is relatively low for DICE, for example, only 34\% for the CC-ToxiGen pair when the coverage is 0.8. In contrast, our method effectively removes 60\% of the OOD samples, resulting in much lower risk and thereby improving classifier performance.  Additionally, we compute the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Figures \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_toxigen} and \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_sst2} in Table \ref{table_selective_classification_auc_CC}, where our method achieves the lowest the AUC, demonstrating a more effective selective classification strategy (see Appendix Table \ref{table_selective_classification_auc_BT} for additional dataset pairs).

By significantly reducing risk and improving classifier performance, our method outperforms existing baselines, making it a highly effective solution for real-world applications that require efficient OOD data management.

\label{sec:additional_studies}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
\textbf{Effect of data generation model size.} Thus far, the Llama-3 70B-instruct model was used for data generation as larger models generally yield more diverse and high-quality generations \cite{chen2024diversity}. However, we also conducted an ablation using the Llama-3 8B-instruct model for data generation step. From Table \ref{ablation_three-way_vs_binary_short} (for additional results, see Table \ref{ablation_data_gen_size}), we observe that even the smaller 8B model achieves perfect zero FPR95 on the far-OOD CC-GSM8k InD-OOD pair. Additionally, on near-OOD datasets, its performance is second only to the ideal baseline (see Table \ref{ablation_data_gen_size}), demonstrating that smaller models can still generate high-quality synthetic data for OOD detection tasks.

\textbf{Three-way vs binary model.} Another natural question is to ask: Is it necessary to add a third class to the OOD detector, or would a repurposed binary model suffice? Here we fine-tune the InD classifier for the OOD detection and use the InD classifier (trained on InD data only) for class prediction. We compare this model pair to the
% To find an affirmative answer, we evaluated both a binary model and our
three-class model on several InD-OOD pairs, including CC-GSM8k, CC-SST-2, and CC-ToxiGen, ensuring that both models were trained on an equal number of samples for consistency.
From Table \ref{ablation_three-way_vs_binary_short} (see Table \ref{ablation_three-way_vs_binary} for additional results), we observe that both models perform similarly across all metrics, indicating that the primary performance gains are attributed to our synthetic data generation pipeline, rather than the choice of the OOD detector design. We hypothesize that other OOD detector approaches from prior works would also benefit from incorporating our OOD synthetic data.

\textbf{Effect of OOD detector model size.} We deemed it important to evaluate the performance of our approach on a range of model sizes.
For this experiment, we tested models of sizes \{1.4B, 3B, 7B, 13B\}, specifically using Pythia 1.4B \citep{biderman2023pythia}, RedPajama 3B, Llama-2 7B, and Llama-2 13B \citep{touvron2023llama}. 
Using Civil Comments as InD, GSM8K as far-OOD, and ToxiGen as near-OOD, we report test accuracy for the three-class models. From Figure \ref{fig_model_size} we observe that, in general, increasing model size enhances performance for both the ideal model and our synthetic model across both far- and near-OOD datatsets. We also observe that, for GSM8K, our synthetic approach outperforms the ideal model when the model size is small (e.g. Pythia 1.4B and RedPajama 3B).
This result is particularly intriguing, given that the ideal model was trained on the original OOD dataset, which is not accessible in practice, whereas our model was trained on synthetic data. For larger model sizes, our model's far-OOD performance closely matches that of the ideal model (e.g., 94.85\% vs 95.13\% for Llama-2 7B).
We also observe an interesting exception with RedPajama 3B: 
while its performance decreases on synthetic GSM8K, it improves significantly on synthetic ToxiGen, resulting in the smallest gap from the ideal model (-1.86\%).


\textbf{Understanding the effectiveness of synthetic OOD data.}
To understand why our synthetic generation pipeline is effective, we visualize the sentence representations of InD, original OOD and synthetic OOD data using the sentence transformer model (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) \citep{reimers2019sentence} in Figure \ref{fig:umap_comments}. This visualization reveals distinct boundaries between InD and OOD sentences. Compared to original OOD data, our synthetic proxy data forms more generalized clusters and establishes a broader, non-linear decision boundary around the InD cluster, potentially identifying diverse set of OOD test samples outside this boundary as OOD.
While our synthetic data may introduce more diversity and attempt to approximate the varied distributions of real OOD data, it does not necessarily outperform the original OOD data. Instead, it may offer a complementary way to represent a broader range of OOD samples. As shown in our experiments in Table \ref{table_main-results}, synthetic data \emph{sometimes} provides better generalization than real data, and when not, increasing the diversity of training data can help narrow the gap (see Figure \ref{fig_cross_model}).

\textbf{Cross-modal OOD generalization.} 
Next, we evaluate our synthetic model's generalization performance under increasing training data diversity. For this experiment, we train three models using: (1) ToxiGen dataset, (2) ToxiGen+GSM8K datasets, and (3) ToxiGen+GSM8K+MBPP datasets. Each model is subsequently tested across four testsets: ToxiGen, MBPP, GSM8K, and a combined set ToxiGen+MBPP+GSM8K (All).
Figure \ref{fig_cross_model} demonstrates that augmenting training data diversity systematically improves cross-modal generalization performance. For instance, a model trained on ToxiGen+GSM8K achieves a perfect FPR95 on the MBPP testset, matching the ideal model's performance—despite never being explicitly trained on MBPP.
Notably, as training dataset diversity increases, our synthetic model progressively converges towards the ideal model's behavior, demonstrated by the consistent reduction in FPR95 discrepancy between synthetic and ideal models as we add more synthetic training datasets.

\section{Conclusions}
\vspace{-0.1cm}
In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection that leverages synthetic data generation powered by LLMs. 
Our method addresses the critical challenge of OOD data scarcity by leveraging LLMs to create high-quality OOD proxies, eliminating the need for external OOD data sources.  
Extensive experiments encompassing nine InD-OOD dataset pairs demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches across real-world text classification use cases, including tasks arising in LLM development and deployment lifecycle.

Incorporating OOD detection capabilities into various classification systems used for training LLMs is a promising direction for future work. For example, OOD detection may help to identify when reward overoptimization (also known as reward hacking) starts to occur \citep{skalse2022defining,gao2023scaling,moskovitz2023confronting}. Another interesting application is pre-training data filtering, where various classifiers are often used to select data for pre-training \citep{penedo2024fineweb,li2024datacomp} and are likely to benefit from OOD robustness due to the complexity and breadth of LLM pre-training text corpora.

% \section*{Impact Statement}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
% Our work to use synthetically generated OOD data using LLMs for improved OOD detection has significant broader impacts. The improved OOD detection could lead to more robust AI systems, potentially increasing their use in critical decision-making processes. However, this may also exacerbate existing inequalities if these systems are not carefully designed and monitored. Our work focuses on querying LLMs, which can generate content with potential ethical risks such as fairness and bias inherited from the pretraining data of the LLMs. The generation of potentially offensive or toxic content, even for research purposes, could inadvertently contribute to the proliferation of harmful language, aligning with concerns raised by \citet{bender2021dangers} about the risks of LLMs perpetuating biases.
% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

\section{Score-based Baseline Methods} \label{appendix_score_baselines}

\subsection{Preliminaries and Problem Setup}
Let $X = \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the input space, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the input features. The output space is represented as $Y = \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}$, where $K$ is the number of classes. Given a training dataset $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ sampled from the joint distribution $P$ on $X \times Y$, the objective is to learn a mapping $f_\theta: X \rightarrow Y$.
Assume that model $f_\theta$ is trained on a dataset drawn from the InD $P_{\text{in}}$.

\subsection{Formulation of OOD Detection}

During testing, inputs are sampled from a mixture of InD $P_{\text{in}}$ and OOD $P_{\text{out}}$. The goal is to determine whether a given input $x \in X$ belongs to $P_{\text{in}}$.
OOD detection is framed as a binary classification problem where the model $f_{\theta}$ must classify $x$ as either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{InD}: $x$ belongs to the known distribution $P_{\text{in}}$.
    \item \textbf{OOD}: $x$ is from an unknown distribution $P_{\text{out}}$, with no overlap between the label set of $P_{\text{out}}$ and $Y$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decision Rule for OOD Detection}
The decision rule for OOD detection is based on a score function $S(x)$, which assigns a value to each input $x$ indicating its likelihood of belonging to $P_{\text{in}}$. A threshold $\lambda$ is used for classification:

\begin{align}
g_\lambda(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{in} & \text{if } S(x) \geq \lambda \\ 
\text{out} & \text{if } S(x) < \lambda 
\end{cases}
\end{align}

This mechanism ensures that inputs with scores above $\lambda$ are classified as InD, while those below are deemed OOD.
The threshold $\lambda$ is chosen so that a high fraction of InD data (e.g. 95\% in our case i.e. FPR95) is correctly classified. 


\textbf{{Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) \citep{hendrycks2017a}.}} This method proposes to use the maximum softmax score as the OOD
score $S(x)$.

\textbf{{Energy \citep{wu2023energybased}.}}  This approach leverages an energy score $E(x)$  for OOD detection. The energy function maps the pre-softmax logits to a scalar $E(x) \in \mathbb{R}$, which is relatively lower for InD data. Importantly, \cite{wu2023energybased} utilizes the \emph{negative} energy score (i.e. $S(x) = -E(x)$) for OOD detection, aligning with the convention that the score $S(x)$ is higher for InD data and lower for OOD data. Furthermore, this method does not require hyperparameter tuning.

\textbf{{DICE \citep{sun2022dice}.}} 
This method computes logits by applying sparsification to the penultimate layer of the model, using only a subset of important weights that significantly contribute to the prediction.
After obtaining the logits, the final score $S(x)$ is calculated using either the Energy score or MSP. An ablation study in the original paper demonstrates that the Energy score performs better, which is why we have selected this method. The approach includes a sparsity hyperparameter $p \in [0, 1]$; a higher $p$ indicates a greater fraction of weights are dropped, with $p = 0$ resulting in no weights being dropped. We set $p = 0.5$, as it performs effectively in our case and aligns with findings in the original paper.

\textbf{{ReAct \citep{sun2021react}.}} 
This method improves OOD detection by truncating the activations in the penultimate layer of the network. Activations are clipped to a threshold $c$, reducing the effect of noisy OOD data while preserving InD data. The truncated activations are used to compute the logits.
After obtaining the logits, the final score $S(x)$ is calculated using either the Energy score or MSP.
An ablation study in the original paper demonstrates that the Energy score performs better, which is why we have selected this method. The rectification threshold $c$ is set to 1.33 and is selected from a set of \{0.85, 1.0, 1.33, 1.5, 2.0, 2.33\}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Civil Comments}
The Civil Comments\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/civil_comments}} dataset comprises user-generated comments collected from the Civil Comments platform, a commenting system employed by approximately 50 English-language news websites worldwide between 2015 and 2017. The dataset's composition is multifaceted, encompassing not only the raw text of public comments but also associated metadata such as article identifiers and timestamps. We use Civil Comments as an InD dataset.

\subsection{BeaverTails}
The BeaverTails\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/BeaverTails}} dataset is designed to assess the safety alignment of LLMs. It consists of test prompts that focus on handling harmful or sensitive content, categorized into 14 different harm areas:
`Animal Abuse', `Child Abuse', `Controversial Topics and Politics'
`Discrimination, Stereotypes, and Injustice',
`Drug Abuse, Weapons, and Banned Substances',
`Financial Crime, Property Crime, and Theft',
`Hate Speech and Offensive Language',
`Misinformation Regarding Ethics, Laws, and Safety',
`Non-Violent Unethical Behavior',
`Privacy Violation',
`Self-Harm',
`Sexually Explicit and Adult Content'
`Terrorism and Organized Crime', and `Violence, Aiding and Abetting, and Incitement'.

Each prompt in the dataset is labeled with one primary harm category but may overlap with others. This labeling helps in evaluating how well LLMs handle specific sensitive content and guides the development of safer AI systems. 

We used the \textbf{Non-Violent Unethical Behavior} category from the BeaverTails dataset as our InD dataset. Additionally, we constructed two near-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) datasets by merging other harm categories. The first near-OOD dataset was formed by combining the \textbf{Sexually Explicit and Adult Content} category with the \textbf{Drug Abuse, Weapons, and Banned Substances} category. The second near-OOD dataset was created by merging \textbf{Discrimination, Stereotype, and Injustice} with \textbf{Hate Speech and Offensive Language}.

\subsection{GSM8K}
Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k}}) dataset comprises 8.5K linguistically diverse math word problems designed to evaluate models' abilities to perform multi-step reasoning. Each problem requires between 2 and 8 steps, primarily involving basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Aimed at the middle school level, the problems are solvable without requiring concepts beyond early Algebra, and most do not necessitate explicitly defining variables. Solutions are provided in natural language, rather than solely as mathematical equations, making the dataset useful for studying how large language models reason through problems. This structure allows for a better understanding of models' internal reasoning processes, as emphasized in the associated research paper \citep{cobbe2021gsm8k}. We use GSM8K as an far-OOD dataset.

\subsection{MBPP}
The Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/mbpp}}) dataset contains approximately 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, aimed at entry-level programmers. These problems cover core programming fundamentals and standard library usage. Each problem includes a task description, a sample code solution, and three automated test cases. A portion of the dataset has been manually verified for accuracy, as detailed in the accompanying paper \citep{austin2021program}. We use MBPP as a far-OOD dataset.

\subsection{SST-2}
The Stanford Sentiment Treebank \citep{socher-etal-2013-recursive} (SST-2\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2}}) is a dataset designed for sentiment analysis, featuring fully labeled parse trees to enable detailed exploration of how sentiment is expressed in language. It contains 11,855 sentences from movie reviews, parsed with the Stanford parser, and includes 215,154 unique phrases, each annotated by three human judges. SST-2 focuses on binary sentiment classification (negative or somewhat negative vs. somewhat positive or positive) using full sentences, with neutral sentences excluded. We use SST-2 as a near-OOD dataset.

\subsection{ToxiGen}  
ToxiGen\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/toxigen/toxigen-data}} \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigen} is a large-scale dataset designed to improve toxic language detection systems.
It contains 274k statements that are either toxic or harmless, focusing on 13 minority groups. The dataset was generated using advanced machine learning techniques to create examples of subtly toxic and benign language. This approach allows ToxiGen to include more complex, implicitly toxic statements than earlier datasets, which were mostly made from human-written text. A review of some samples from ToxiGen showed that people found it hard to tell the difference between statements generated by machines and those written by humans. We use ToxiGen as a near-OOD dataset.

\section{Additional Experiments}  \label{appendix:additional_exp}
Selective classification experiments presented in the main paper (see Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_toxigen} and Table \ref{table_selective_classification_auc_CC}) demonstrate that the baselines exhibit suboptimal performance, with high risk values. In contrast, our method consistently achieves the lowest risk, particularly on the CC-Toxigen pair. As shown in Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_llama2-7b_sst2}, it remains the best-performing method on the CC-SST-2 pair, yielding the lowest error. We extend these results to additional InD-OOD pairs, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_BT_llama2-7b}. 
From Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_BT_llama2-7b}, we observe that our method outperforms most score-based baselines for the BT-BT (SEAC \& DAWBS),
and BT-BT (DSI \& HSOL) pairs, generally removing the highest number of OOD samples across coverage sets. The only exception is MSP, which performs slightly better, not because it removes more OOD samples (27\% vs. our 44\% at 0.8 coverage for BT-BT (SEAC \& DAWBS)), but because these tasks are highly challenging due to the strong semantic similarity between InD and OOD data, with MSP mistakenly removing many low-confidence InD samples.
Additionally, we compute the Area Under
the Curve (AUC) for Figure \ref{fig_selec_class_BT_llama2-7b} in Table \ref{table_selective_classification_auc_BT}, where our
method achieves the second best AUC, demonstrating a more
effective selective classification strategy.

\textbf{Deeper analysis around predictions.} We conduct an in-depth analysis of the predictions, with detailed results presented in the confusion matrices shown in Figures \ref{fig:cm_ccomments_farOOD}-\ref{fig:cm_beaverT_nearOOD}.
We observe that for far-OOD, our three-label synthetic model mostly detects OOD samples (i.e., `Neutral') more accurately than the ideal model (c.f. 1305 vs 1317 on BT-GSM8K and 469 vs 499 on BT-MBPP), achieving nearly a 100\% success rate on OOD samples (1317/1319 and 499/500). 
Moreover, in many cases, our model is able to detect Negative (i.e. toxic or harmful) samples better than the ideal model; for example, on CC-MBPP (459 vs 433), CC-ToxiGen (917 vs 862), and BT-BT (DSI \& HSOL) (546 vs 510), highlighting the importance of our model's superior alignment detection capability. Lastly, while our model performs competently on near-OOD datasets, it does fall slightly short compared to the ideal model. 
Addressing and narrowing this gap from the ideal model presents an intriguing avenue for future research. We further scrutinize the predictions for near-OOD data in Table \ref{table_deeper_analysis}, using CC-ToxiGen as our InD-OOD pair for this study. 
While ToxiGen is categorized as OOD because it presents significant distribution shifts from Civil Comments \citep{yuan2023revisiting}, it contains toxic elements similar to those in the Civil Comments dataset. 
\begin{table}[h]
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.0}
  \setlength\tabcolsep{2.7pt}
  \centering
  \caption{Deeper analysis of near-OOD predictions labeled as Neutral, using CC-ToxiGen as our InD-OOD pair.}
  \begin{tabular}{ccllllllllll}
    \toprule
     Assigned Label     & Actual Label & Predicted Label & \#samples \\

    \midrule 
    
     Neutral  &  Non-toxic   & Positive  &  34/59  \\
     Neutral  &  Toxic       & Negative  &  77/86  \\
     Neutral  &  Toxic       & Positive  &  25/59  \\
     Neutral  &  Non-toxic   & Negative  &  9/86   \\

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{0.2cm} 
  \label{table_deeper_analysis}
  \vspace{-0.4cm}
\end{table}
Thus, it is crucial to examine samples misclassified as Positive or Negative rather than Neutral.
As shown in Table \ref{table_deeper_analysis}, nearly all samples misclassified as Negative were actually toxic (77/86), while most misclassified as Positive were actually non-toxic (34/59). This indicates that near-OOD misclassifications accurately reflect the true nature of the data.
