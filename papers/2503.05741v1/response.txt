\section{Literature Review}
\label{s:lit-rev}
In this section, we review some of the relevant works \textcolor{black}{that are} similar to our work. A new course was designed and shown in the work Li et al., "Developing a Novel Approach to Teaching Computer Science Concepts Using Raspberry Pi" at the University of Calgary, using RPi to make the learning mechanism of assembly language enjoyable and interactive for the students. In the RPi part of the course, students learn to create an interactive video game using ARM assembly language. The author showed that the distribution of grades in the exams improved significantly after introducing RPi to the curriculum. A voluntary, anonymous survey collected feedback from 198 students in two consecutive semesters, indicating an overall response rate of 58\%, evaluating aspects like enjoyment, learning experience, motivation, and independent learning in the new course format. Quantile-Quantile normality test was performed before and after introducing RPi which showed that the mean grades after introducing RPi were not normally distributed compared to the previous curriculum. Consequently, the authors performed a t-test which revealed that the integration of RPi was significant. Two surveys were also conducted concerning RPi and future studies. In Li et al., "Integrating MATLAB into the Computer Science Curriculum: A Case Study," the authors designed a MATLAB course while integrating RPi to enhance the learning capability of the BME students while handling real-life data. They proposed six experiments and performed both numerical course evaluation and survey on the students before and after incorporating RPi. After including RPi, the evaluation score increased. The student enjoyed programming more after introducing such hardware experiments and the authors indicated that as the BME students in the senior year have to do more complex real-life analysis, this newly proposed course would help them to understand how real-life projects work.

The majority of previous methods have taken multidisciplinary approaches while designing the courses. However, they have usually taken close-ended approaches which indicate teaching different experiments and evaluating the students based on these experiments. On the other hand, some studies proposed open-ended (project-based) approaches. The overall scenario of our literature review is divided into several segments shown in Table~\ref{tab:literature} where we can see the main focus or outputs of the different studies are multidisciplinary and project-based approaches. However, the assessments in the course design also included close-ended evaluations.


In our work, we have taken a mixture of \textit{close-ended} and \textit{open-ended} approaches for more effective learning. In this approach, we designed the experiments while keeping the multidisciplinary perspective as well as the feedback from the industry and academic experts.
