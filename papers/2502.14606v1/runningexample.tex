This section introduces an example taken from \sut, an open source 3D game\footnote{\url{https://github.com/iv4xr-project/labrecruits}} where the player navigates a maze-like environment composed of rooms and corridors connected by doors. The doors are connected to buttons that open/close one or more doors. 
The game level may also contain other entities, such as 
%There could be other entities in a game level such as 
desks, chairs, fire hazards, extinguishers, etc. \sut allows the user to design and load a game level. Our example, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:runningexample}, is a simple level in \sut composed of three doors (door1, door2, door3), four buttons (bttn1, bttn2, bttn3, bttn4), and other non interactable entities such as desks. \sut could be played by either human players or test agents~\cite{prasetya2020aplib} by controlling the avatar (labelled as `agent' in Figure~\ref{fig:runningexample}). Our approach uses the test agents for interacting with the game.
