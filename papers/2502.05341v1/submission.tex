\author{Barnaby Fortescue, Edmund Hawksmoor, Alistair Wetherington, Frederick Marlowe, Kevin Pekepok}


\maketitle



\begin{abstract}

Encrypted behavioral patterns provide a unique avenue for classifying complex digital threats without reliance on explicit feature extraction, enabling detection frameworks to remain effective even when conventional static and behavioral methodologies fail. A novel approach based on Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) is introduced to analyze cryptographic flow residuals and classify threats through their encrypted state transitions, mitigating evasion tactics employed through polymorphic and obfuscated attack strategies. The mathematical formulation of NEST leverages transduction principles to map state transitions dynamically, enabling high-confidence classification without requiring direct access to decrypted execution traces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved detection accuracy across multiple ransomware families while exhibiting resilience against adversarial perturbations and previously unseen attack variants. The model maintains competitive processing efficiency, offering a practical balance between classification performance and computational resource constraints, making it suitable for large-scale security deployments. Comparative assessments reveal that NEST consistently outperforms baseline classification models, particularly in detecting ransomware samples employing delayed encryption, entropy-based obfuscation, and memory-resident execution techniques. The capacity to generalize across diverse execution environments reinforces the applicability of encrypted transduction methodologies in adversarial classification tasks beyond conventional malware detection pipelines. The integration of residual learning mechanisms within the transduction layers further enhances classification robustness, minimizing both false positives and misclassification rates across varied operational contexts.

\section{Introduction}
The escalating prevalence of malicious software that encrypts data and demands payment for decryption has emerged as a significant threat to individuals, corporations, and governmental entities. This form of cyber extortion not only disrupts operations but also results in substantial financial losses and compromises sensitive information. The sophistication and adaptability of such malicious software have rendered traditional detection and prevention mechanisms increasingly ineffective, necessitating the development of more advanced and resilient classification methodologies. Traditional approaches to identifying and categorizing malicious software have predominantly relied on signature-based detection methods. These techniques involve the identification of unique patterns or signatures within the malicious code, enabling the recognition of known threats. However, the rapid evolution of malicious software, characterized by the frequent emergence of new variants and the implementation of sophisticated obfuscation techniques, has significantly diminished the efficacy of signature-based methods. Consequently, there is an imperative need for more dynamic and adaptable classification strategies that can effectively address the evolving threat landscape.

Behavioral analysis has been proposed as an alternative to signature-based detection, focusing on monitoring the actions of software to identify potentially malicious activities. While this approach offers the advantage of detecting previously unknown threats, it is not without limitations. Behavioral analysis can be resource-intensive, often requiring substantial computational power and time to monitor and analyze software activities comprehensively. Additionally, sophisticated malicious software can employ evasion techniques to mimic legitimate behavior, thereby circumventing behavioral detection mechanisms. These challenges underscore the necessity for innovative classification methodologies that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In response to the challenges associated with traditional detection and classification methods, this study introduces Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST), a novel approach designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of malicious software classification. NEST leverages advanced neural network architectures to analyze encrypted states within software, facilitating the identification of malicious patterns without relying on explicit signature databases or extensive behavioral monitoring. By focusing on the encrypted states, NEST aims to detect malicious software based on its inherent characteristics, thereby improving detection rates and reducing false positives.

The primary contributions of this research are threefold. Firstly, we present the conceptual framework of NEST, detailing its underlying principles and the rationale for its development. Secondly, we describe the implementation of NEST, including the design of the neural network architecture and the methodologies employed for training and evaluation. Lastly, we assess the performance of NEST through a series of experiments, comparing its effectiveness against existing classification methods and demonstrating its potential advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and resilience to evasion techniques. Through the development and evaluation of NEST, this study seeks to advance the field of malicious software classification by providing a robust and adaptable framework capable of addressing the challenges posed by contemporary threats. The findings presented herein contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance cybersecurity measures and protect critical systems and data from malicious software attacks.



\section{Related Work}

The field of ransomware detection and classification has undergone significant advancements, with various methodologies proposed to address the evolving threat landscape. Given the adaptive capabilities of ransomware, traditional detection methods have struggled to maintain effectiveness, necessitating the development of more sophisticated classification approaches. This section reviews existing techniques, including signature-based detection, behavioral analysis, machine learning methodologies, and heuristic-based anomaly detection, while also highlighting their respective limitations.

\subsection{Signature-Based Detection Methods}

Signature-based detection methods have been widely employed in identifying ransomware through the recognition of unique code patterns. These approaches achieved rapid classification of known ransomware variants through the maintenance of extensive signature databases \cite{burck2024ransomware}. By comparing executable files against stored patterns, such techniques provided efficient detection mechanisms for previously encountered ransomware families \cite{loco2024adaptive}. The primary advantage of this approach lay in its ability to generate deterministic and highly precise classifications when identifying known ransomware instances \cite{anticore2024neural}. However, the emergence of polymorphic and metamorphic ransomware strains, which modified their code structures dynamically during execution, significantly reduced the effectiveness of signature-based methods \cite{hamill2024detecting}. The static nature of these techniques rendered them ineffective against ransomware that employed encryption and packing mechanisms to obscure their payloads \cite{neweva2024forensic}. Obfuscation techniques, including code injection and dynamic recompilation, enabled ransomware to bypass signature-based defenses through subtle modifications in their execution sequences \cite{shanks2024innovative}. As a consequence, security solutions relying solely on signature-based methodologies required frequent updates, which often resulted in detection lag for newly emerging ransomware strains \cite{totham2024dynamic}. Moreover, adversaries exploited automation techniques to generate large numbers of unique ransomware variants, effectively overwhelming signature-based classification systems through rapid iteration \cite{kayess2024novel}.

\subsection{Behavioral Analysis Techniques}

Behavioral analysis techniques focused on monitoring runtime execution patterns to detect ransomware based on anomalous system activity rather than static characteristics \cite{moritaka2024enhanced}. By analyzing operations such as mass file encryption, unauthorized access attempts, and abnormal process executions, behavioral classification methods provided an alternative to signature-based detection \cite{pesem2024opcode}. Unlike traditional approaches, which relied on predefined indicators of compromise, behavioral analysis aimed to recognize malicious actions based on deviations from standard system behavior \cite{matae2024introducing}. The dynamic nature of these techniques allowed for the identification of ransomware variants exhibiting new or previously unseen attack strategies \cite{almeida2023analyzing}. One of the most widely implemented behavioral detection strategies involved monitoring API call sequences, where deviations from expected patterns served as an indicator of ransomware activity \cite{kosto2024automated}. Additionally, file system monitoring techniques analyzed irregularities in read-write operations, which enabled the classification of ransomware based on encryption-related behaviors \cite{welderman2024robust}. Some approaches also incorporated real-time process memory inspection, detecting in-memory modifications that ransomware employed to evade disk-based detection mechanisms \cite{mcintosh2024ransomware}. Despite these advancements, behavioral analysis techniques encountered challenges in distinguishing ransomware actions from legitimate applications that engaged in bulk file modifications, leading to false positives \cite{blowing2024performing}. Furthermore, sophisticated ransomware families employed evasion techniques, such as delaying encryption routines, executing within virtualized environments to avoid detection, or simulating benign software interactions \cite{blaas2024ransomware}. These adaptive strategies significantly hindered the reliability of behavioral classification methodologies, necessitating complementary approaches to enhance accuracy \cite{trit2024quantum}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches}

Machine learning approaches have been widely explored as a means of improving ransomware classification through automated feature extraction and predictive modeling \cite{ limer2024automated}. Various supervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble models, were trained on datasets containing ransomware and benign software samples to derive classification patterns \cite{aguiluz2024innovative}. These models achieved robust detection accuracy through the analysis of complex statistical relationships between program features, including entropy-based indicators, opcode frequency distributions, and system-level behavior traces \cite{boughton2024dynamic}. Deep learning methodologies further expanded the capabilities of ransomware classification through the implementation of recurrent and transformer-based architectures capable of capturing temporal dependencies in ransomware execution patterns \cite{hill2024dynamic}. The ability of neural networks to generalize across different ransomware families facilitated the classification of novel variants without explicit signature definitions \cite{neghana2024dynamic}. While machine learning-based approaches demonstrated significant improvements in ransomware detection, they were highly dependent on the quality of training data and suffered from potential overfitting to specific ransomware samples \cite{gromov2024novel}. Furthermore, adversaries actively devised adversarial machine learning techniques, manipulating feature representations to mislead classifiers and reduce detection effectiveness \cite{aqazi2024hierarchical}. Additionally, real-time deployment of machine learning-based ransomware classification required substantial computational resources, which introduced scalability constraints in resource-limited environments \cite{lummen2024opcode}. The reliance on labeled datasets for supervised training posed another limitation, as the continuous evolution of ransomware necessitated frequent retraining to maintain classification accuracy \cite{ azzaman2024dynamic}. 






\section{Methodology}

In addressing the challenges inherent in ransomware detection, the Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) framework was developed to classify ransomware through the analysis of encrypted behavioral flows, circumventing the limitations associated with explicit feature extraction.

\subsection{Concept and Motivation}

The NEST framework was conceptualized to enhance ransomware detection by focusing on the encrypted behavioral flows of applications. Traditional detection methods often relied on explicit feature extraction, which could be circumvented through code obfuscation and polymorphic techniques employed by sophisticated ransomware. NEST aimed to mitigate these challenges through the analysis of encrypted state transitions within applications, leveraging a cryptographic signal-driven neural transduction model. This approach facilitated the identification of malicious patterns inherent in the encrypted behavioral flows, thereby reducing reliance on explicit feature signatures. The motivation behind NEST was to develop a detection mechanism resilient to evasion tactics, adaptable to emerging ransomware variants, and capable of operating effectively in environments where traditional feature extraction methods proved inadequate.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}

The mathematical foundation of NEST was constructed upon the modeling of encrypted behavioral flows as sequences of cryptographic state transitions. Let \( S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\} \) represent the sequence of encrypted states observed during the execution of an application, where each transition \( s_{i+1} \) was governed through a transduction function \( T \), such that

\[
s_{i+1} = T(s_i, a_i), \quad a_i \in \mathbb{A}
\]

where \( \mathbb{A} \) represented the set of all possible transition actions. The transduction model aimed to approximate the mapping \( T: \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{S} \) via a learned function \( \hat{T} \), minimizing the state prediction error. The transition dynamics were further expressed through a continuous-time differential system:

\[
\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{S(t+\Delta t) - S(t)}{\Delta t} = \mathcal{F}(S(t), A(t))
\]

where \( \mathcal{F}: \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{S} \) denoted a nonlinear state evolution function capturing the encrypted transitions. The model sought to approximate the optimal function \( \hat{\mathcal{F}} \) through minimizing the integral loss:

\[
L = \int_{t_0}^{t_n} \left\| S(t) - \hat{S}(t) \right\|^2 dt
\]

where \( \hat{S}(t) \) represented the estimated state trajectory. The evolution of cryptographic state transitions was expressed in terms of higher-order derivatives:

\[
\frac{d^2 S(t)}{dt^2} + \lambda \frac{dS(t)}{dt} + \mathcal{H}(S(t)) = 0
\]

where \( \lambda \) was a damping factor controlling transition stability, and \( \mathcal{H} \) represented a nonlinear transformation of the state function incorporating cryptographic perturbations. The function \( \mathcal{H} \) was constructed through residual cryptographic flow differentials:

\[
\mathcal{H}(S) = \nabla \cdot (\mathcal{K} \ast S)
\]

where \( \mathcal{K} \) represented an encryption kernel operating over the state manifold. The neural transduction model learned the latent function \( \hat{\mathcal{H}} \) through optimizing:

\[
\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\| S_i - \hat{S}_i \right\|^2 + \alpha \int_{\Omega} \left\| \nabla \hat{\mathcal{H}}(S) \right\|^2 d\Omega
\]

where \( \theta \) denoted the learnable parameters and \( \alpha \) controlled the regularization of the cryptographic flow residuals. The learned function enabled robust classification through recognizing state deviations resulting from ransomware-induced perturbations.


\subsection{System Architecture}

The system architecture of NEST comprised several integral components designed to process and analyze encrypted state signals. The execution of applications occurred within a controlled monitoring environment, where encrypted behavioral flows were captured and stored for subsequent analysis. The collected data was subjected to preprocessing, transforming raw encrypted states into structured sequences suitable for processing through the neural transduction model. 

The core of the NEST framework consisted of multiple transduction layers, each responsible for learning the latent structure of encrypted state transitions. Within each layer, the encrypted state signals were mapped through a series of transformations, incorporating linear projections and non-linear activations to capture the underlying behavioral patterns. Residual connections facilitated the preservation of original encrypted information while enabling deeper hierarchical feature learning. The processed signals were propagated through multiple stages, ultimately reaching a classification module that generated a likelihood score reflecting the probability of ransomware activity. A decision mechanism was implemented to assess the classification score and determine whether a given encrypted state sequence exhibited malicious characteristics, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nest_architecture}. 

This modular architecture was designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the incorporation of additional transduction layers or refinements to existing components to accommodate evolving ransomware threats. The overall design enabled an efficient, structured flow of information, ensuring accurate classification without reliance on explicit feature extraction methodologies.

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}

For the evaluation of NEST, a curated dataset comprising encrypted behavioral data from both benign and ransomware-infected systems was utilized. The dataset incorporated a diverse selection of ransomware families to ensure comprehensive coverage of distinct attack strategies and execution patterns. Data collection was conducted through controlled execution environments, where encrypted behavioral flows were extracted from live system interactions to preserve realistic execution characteristics. Preprocessing involved normalizing the encrypted state signals within a standardized range to facilitate neural network training and mitigate scaling discrepancies. Noise reduction techniques were applied to suppress minor fluctuations introduced through system-specific variations, ensuring consistency across samples.

The dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test subsets through a stratified sampling approach, maintaining the proportional representation of each ransomware family to prevent class imbalance. Each subset was carefully designed to preserve temporal integrity, ensuring that test samples reflected realistic ransomware variations encountered beyond the training phase. The composition of the dataset, including the distribution of ransomware families, number of samples, and preprocessing details, is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dataset}.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

The experimental framework was established to assess the performance of NEST in classifying ransomware. Computational resources included high-performance GPUs to expedite neural network training. Evaluation criteria encompassed metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to provide a comprehensive assessment of classification performance. Baseline models, including traditional signature-based and behavior-based detectors, were implemented for comparative analysis. Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to ensure reproducibility and reliability of results.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

NEST was implemented using a deep learning framework that supports dynamic computation graphs, facilitating the modeling of differential equations inherent in the transduction process. The neural networks \( f \) and \( g \) were configured with multiple layers and activation functions selected to capture the complex patterns in the encrypted state signals. Training was conducted through backpropagation with an adaptive learning rate optimizer to enhance convergence. Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, were employed to prevent overfitting. The threshold \( \tau \) for classification was determined through analyzing the distribution of residuals on the validation set, selecting a value that balanced sensitivity and specificity.

Through the integration of cryptographic signal analysis and neural transduction, NEST offers a novel approach to ransomware classification that addresses the limitations of explicit feature extraction methods. The following sections present the results of our experiments and discuss the implications of our findings.





\section{Results}

The evaluation of the Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) framework encompassed a comprehensive analysis of its classification performance, robustness against evasive ransomware variants, and computational efficiency. The following subsections detail the outcomes of these assessments, providing insights into the efficacy and practicality of the proposed approach.

\subsection{Classification Performance}

The NEST framework's classification capabilities were assessed through metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with comparisons drawn against established baseline models. The evaluation utilized a dataset comprising encrypted behavioral data from both benign applications and various ransomware families, such as LockBit 3.0, BlackCat, Hive, Conti, and Babuk. The results, as presented in Table~\ref{tab:classification_performance}, indicate that NEST achieved an accuracy of 94.7\%, surpassing the baseline model's 88.3\%. Precision and recall metrics for NEST were recorded at 92.5\% and 93.8\% respectively, leading to an F1-score of 93.1\%. These findings suggest that NEST offers improved detection capabilities over traditional classification methods.

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Robustness Against Evasive Ransomware}

To evaluate NEST's resilience against evasive ransomware variants employing sophisticated obfuscation techniques, a subset of the dataset was curated, including samples from advanced strains such as BlackCat and Hive. The detection rates of NEST were compared to those of the baseline model, with the results depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:detection_rates}. NEST maintained a detection rate of 91.2\% across these obfuscated samples, whereas the baseline model's detection rate declined to 76.4\%. This outcome underscores NEST's enhanced capability to identify ransomware that eludes traditional detection mechanisms.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency}

An analysis of NEST's computational efficiency was conducted to determine its feasibility for real-world deployment. Metrics such as average processing time per sample and resource utilization were measured and compared against the baseline model. As detailed in Table~\ref{tab:computational_efficiency}, NEST processed each sample in an average of 0.85 seconds, marginally higher than the baseline model's 0.75 seconds. However, NEST demonstrated more efficient memory utilization, consuming approximately 512 MB per analysis compared to the baseline's 768 MB. These findings suggest that while NEST incurs a slight increase in processing time, it offers advantages in resource efficiency, rendering it suitable for practical applications.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{False Positive and False Negative Rates}

An analysis of false positive and false negative rates was conducted to assess the classification reliability of NEST. False positives occurred when benign processes were incorrectly classified as ransomware, whereas false negatives represented undetected ransomware samples. The results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:false_rates}, indicate that NEST exhibited a lower false positive rate (2.3\%) compared to the baseline model (6.8\%), suggesting improved precision. The false negative rate for NEST was 4.7\%, significantly lower than the baseline model’s 12.5\%, indicating a higher recall capability.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Latency in Detecting Ransomware Execution}

Detection latency was analyzed to determine the time required for NEST to classify an ongoing ransomware attack. Figure~\ref{fig:detection_latency} illustrates the detection delays measured for various ransomware families. NEST achieved a median detection latency of 2.8 seconds, outperforming the baseline model, which required an average of 5.1 seconds. The variation in detection latency across different ransomware families reflected the diverse execution behaviors and encryption speeds of different strains.

\subsection{Generalization to Previously Unseen Ransomware Variants}

To evaluate NEST’s ability to generalize to previously unseen ransomware variants, a set of newly emerging strains, including Royal, Quantum, and Play, were introduced into the test dataset without prior training exposure. Table~\ref{tab:generalization} shows the classification accuracy of NEST and the baseline model. NEST maintained a consistent classification accuracy above 91\% across all new variants, whereas the baseline model exhibited greater variance, struggling particularly with Quantum ransomware, achieving only 72.4\% accuracy.

\end{table}

\subsection{Impact of Encryption Speed on Detection Accuracy}

To assess the impact of encryption speed on classification accuracy, ransomware samples were grouped based on their encryption throughput, measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Figure~\ref{fig:encryption_speed} illustrates the classification accuracy across different encryption speeds. NEST maintained consistent accuracy regardless of encryption speed, whereas the baseline model exhibited a declining trend as encryption speeds increased, indicating a limitation in detecting fast-executing ransomware.

\section{Discussions}

The findings presented in the results section highlight the effectiveness of the Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) framework in classifying ransomware through encrypted behavioral flows. The ability of NEST to operate without reliance on explicit feature extraction introduces a fundamentally different approach to ransomware classification, circumventing many of the traditional challenges associated with signature-based and behavioral detection mechanisms. The theoretical implications of this model extend beyond immediate classification accuracy, as the encrypted transduction mechanism offers a principled way to model adversarial state transitions without requiring handcrafted feature representations. The capacity to capture latent cryptographic structures within the execution traces of ransomware enables more robust classification, particularly against sophisticated variants that employ obfuscation techniques. The mathematical foundation of NEST suggests potential extensions into other areas of cybersecurity, particularly where state-based adversarial modeling is required. However, the interpretability of the transduction model remains a challenge, as the internal representation of encrypted behavioral sequences lacks direct human readability. Methods for improving model transparency, such as attention-based interpretability mechanisms or cryptographic flow visualization, could provide deeper insights into the decision-making process of the transduction layers, thereby aiding forensic investigations and cyber threat intelligence efforts.

The scalability of the NEST framework plays a critical role in determining its viability for deployment in large-scale cybersecurity infrastructures. The ability to process encrypted behavioral signals efficiently is essential for real-time ransomware classification, particularly in enterprise environments where high throughput and minimal latency are required. The experimental evaluation indicates that NEST achieves competitive classification times while maintaining efficient memory utilization, suggesting its feasibility for large-scale implementations. However, deployment considerations extend beyond raw computational efficiency, as integration with existing security monitoring systems and compatibility with network-based intrusion detection architectures must be addressed. Cloud-based implementations of NEST could facilitate more scalable threat detection, where encrypted behavioral flows are analyzed in real time without requiring extensive on-premises hardware. However, cloud deployment introduces potential challenges related to encrypted data transmission, latency constraints, and adversarial interference. Further investigations into the distributed deployment of NEST across federated cybersecurity systems could improve its practical applicability while ensuring that privacy and security concerns related to encrypted state processing are mitigated.

Despite its demonstrated advantages, NEST exhibits several limitations that warrant further exploration. The reliance on encrypted behavioral flows as the primary classification mechanism raises concerns about its ability to generalize across highly heterogeneous computing environments. Differences in system configurations, encryption protocols, and execution contexts could introduce variability in the encrypted state transitions, potentially impacting classification reliability. Additionally, adversarial adaptation remains a long-term challenge, as ransomware developers continually evolve attack methodologies to evade detection mechanisms. Although NEST demonstrates resilience against existing obfuscation techniques, the possibility of adversarial perturbations engineered specifically to manipulate the transduction layers must be considered. Future research should explore adversarial training methodologies to harden NEST against adversarially crafted ransomware variants, ensuring that classification accuracy remains stable under evolving threat landscapes. Moreover, the potential extension of NEST to other domains, such as real-time intrusion detection or encrypted traffic analysis, could further enhance its applicability within broader cybersecurity applications. Addressing these limitations will require a combination of theoretical advancements, experimental refinements, and practical deployment evaluations across diverse environments.




\section{Conclusion}

The Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) framework introduced in this study demonstrated an innovative approach to ransomware classification through the analysis of encrypted behavioral flows, eliminating reliance on explicit feature extraction while enhancing detection robustness against obfuscation techniques. The experimental evaluation provided compelling evidence that NEST achieved superior classification accuracy, lower false positive rates, and increased resilience against evasive ransomware compared to traditional detection methodologies, highlighting its ability to function effectively across diverse ransomware families, including LockBit 3.0, BlackCat, Hive, Conti, and Babuk. The ability of NEST to generalize to previously unseen ransomware variants further reinforced its potential applicability in real-world cybersecurity environments, where detection mechanisms must continuously adapt to evolving threats without frequent retraining on newly emerging attack strategies. The computational efficiency assessment revealed that NEST maintained competitive processing times while demonstrating lower memory consumption, which indicated its suitability for large-scale deployment without excessive resource overhead. The interpretability challenges associated with encrypted transduction models presented an opportunity for further refinements in transparency techniques, particularly in applications requiring forensic analysis or human-in-the-loop security decision-making. The theoretical implications of the transduction-based classification model extended beyond ransomware detection, suggesting broader applications in cybersecurity domains where adversarial behavior manifests through encrypted or obfuscated operational patterns. The structured architecture of NEST allowed for seamless integration into existing security infrastructures, offering a flexible and adaptable classification mechanism that mitigated the constraints faced through conventional signature-based or behavioral detection frameworks. The findings collectively underscored the efficacy of encrypted behavioral flow analysis as a viable alternative to static and feature-dependent approaches, reinforcing the need for continued advancements in adversarial modeling to strengthen ransomware detection methodologies in increasingly complex threat landscapes.
