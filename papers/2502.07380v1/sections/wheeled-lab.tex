Wheeled Lab bridges low-cost wheeled platforms with Isaac Lab (see \Cref{fig:fig1}). To integrate with Isaac Lab, we simply define a hierarchy of abstractions. Some of the highest-level abstractions are illustrated in \Cref{fig:overview} (e.g. Scene, Observation, Reward). Through iterative testing of the Sim2Real pipelines in this work, we have developed reliable baseline configurations of these abstractions which are amenable specifically to low-cost wheeled platforms. These definitions make up the platforms' training environments in Isaac Lab.

In addition to training, Wheeled Lab itself further provides scripts for the evaluation of the pipeline, such as visualization, benchmarks, and reporting. These components are important aspects of the Sim2Real process which helps practitioners diagnose and iterate on algorithmic problems. For example, visualization of the value network on real data can help inform reward shaping and observation design~\cite{stachowicz_fastrlap_2023}.

To integrate with a platform, trained policies interface through ROS. We provide an example implementation of a node that builds the required observations from relevant topics and passes them forward to the trained network.
