In modern robotics, state-of-the-art methods are focusing more on complex, costly, and proprietary platforms and ecosystems, leaving behind more resource-constrained audiences. Wheeled platforms, on the other hand, already have deep roots in the broader community of educators, students, and enthusiasts, often acting as the entry-level platform of choice for beginning roboticists.

We present this work, Wheeled Lab, to act as a bridge between the broader community and state-of-the-art research in robot learning through low-cost, open-source wheeled platforms. Atop Isaac Lab, Wheeled Lab provides a modular and self-contained design framework to lower the barrier-to-entry while being fully integrated with Isaac Lab's extensive research community and ecosystem.

To kickstart this integration, we demonstrate the entire Sim2Real pipeline on three state-of-the-art policy types. Each policy and task is motivated by their fundamental relevance to general robot learning and Sim2Real. \textit{Drifting} is a complex control problem highlighting accurate, randomized, and massive physical simulation. \textit{Elevation traversal} defines safe behavior at the interface between perception and control, highlighting physical scene generation and massive interaction. \textit{Visual navigation} integrates a sensor modality with substantial research attention and pre-training potential while highlighting challenges in data diversity and transferability.

Wheeled Lab is entirely low-cost and open-source. Experiment videos, code, and more information can be found on our \website.
