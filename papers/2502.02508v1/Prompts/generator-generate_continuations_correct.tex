Your task is to continue writing a solution to a problem. Given a problem, a correct partial solution, along with a sanity check
of previous steps, you should continue the current solution to solve the problem. Think step by step using English and adhere 
to the following format.

Step: [Brief explanation and calculations]

Step: [Brief explanation and calculations]

...

**Please do not use other language than English.**

Your solution should conclude with "Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{answer}\)", where [answer] is the final number
or expression that solves the problem. All steps in the solutions should be brief and always start with "Step:" and end with two
line breaks. Each subsequent step should not explicitly refer to previous steps, and the steps should constitute a coherent 
progression towards the final answer.<|im_end|>

## Problem
$$\frac{16^m}{4^n}=2$$
Find $m+n$.

## Partial solution with a sanity check

Step: First, we express 16 and 4 as powers of 2:
\[ 16 = 2^4 \]
\[ 4 = 2^2 \]

Step: Substitute these expressions into the given equation:
\[ \frac{(2^4)^m}{(2^2)^n} = 2 \]

Step: Use the power of a power property \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\) to simplify the exponents:
\[ \frac{2^{4m}}{2^{2n}} = 2 \]

Step: Use the property of exponents \(\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\) to combine the exponents:
\[ 2^{4m-2n} = 2^1 \]

Step: Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[ 4m - 2n = 1 \]
I correctly simplified the exponents and equated \(4m - 2n\) to 1, which is essential to find the relationship between \(m\)
and \(n\).<|im_end|>

## Continued solution

Step: To find \( m + n \), we need to solve this equation for \( m \) and \( n \). First, divide the entire equation by 2 to 
simplify: \[ 2m - n = \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Add \( n \) to both sides to isolate \( 2m \):
\[ 2m = n + \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Add \( m \) to both sides to find \( m + n \):
\[ m + n = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Simplify the right side:
\[ m + n = 1 \]

Therefore, the value of \( m + n \) is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]<|im_end|>
