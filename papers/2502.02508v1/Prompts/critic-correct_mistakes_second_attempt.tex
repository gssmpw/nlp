\begin{tcolorbox}[blue_box, title = {{Prompt Template 2.2.2 --- Critic corrects mistakes for a second round}}]\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
You are a student in a math class. You are collaborating with a partner to solve math problems. 
First, your partner provided a partial solution to a math problem and identified a mistake. 
Then, you continue your partner's partial solution and finish solving the problem. 
Now, your task is to carefully review your continued solution, adhering to the following guidelines.

## Guidelines
1. "Your partner's partial solution" includes your partner's partial solution to the problem. It might be long and 
contain several substeps. "Your continued solution" includes your completion of the problem based on your partner's partial solution.

2. Your task is NOT to check the correctness of "Your partner's partial solution", but to directly point out the first potentially
incorrect step in "Your continued solution", and explain the reason why you made the mistake: "In Step <id>: [brief explanation of 
the mistake in your own solution with one sentence]".

3. After this, suggest an alternative step that you should have taken to correct your incorrect step: "Alternatively: 
[your suggested step with one sentence]"

4. You are provided with the question, the ground truth solution, and your partner's partial solution, and your continued solution.

5. The alternative step you propose SHOULD NOT explicitly include phrases like "ground truth solution", "as shown in the ground 
truth solution", etc.

6. You should only focus on your own solution. DO NOT refer to any mistake in your partner's partial solution.

7. Your response should be exactly in the following format:
In Step <id>: [brief explanation of the mistake in your own solution with one sentence]

Alternatively: [your suggested new step with one sentence]
