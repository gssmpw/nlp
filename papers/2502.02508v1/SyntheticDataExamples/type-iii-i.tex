Given $A=\left\{x\in \mathbb{N}^* \mid -x^{2}+3x\geqslant 0\right\}$ and $B=\left\{x \mid \log_{\frac{1}{2}}x\leqslant 
0\right\}$, then $A\cap B=$

A: $\left[3,+\infty \right)$

B: $\left[0,1\right]$

\begin{verbatim}
First, we solve the inequality for set \( A \):
\[ -x^2 + 3x \geq 0 \]<|continue|>
Factor out the common term:
\[ x(-x + 3) \geq 0 \]<|continue|>
Determine the critical points by setting each factor to zero:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x + 3 = 0 \implies x = 3 \]<|continue|>
The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, 0) \), \( (0, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) 
\). We test a point from each interval in the inequality \( x(-x + 3) \geq 0 \).

- For \( x \in (-\infty, 0) \), choose \( x = -1 \):
  \[ (-1)(-1 + 3) = (-1)(2) = -2 \quad (\text{not} \geq 0) \]

- For \( x \in (0, 3) \), choose \( x = 1 \):
  \[ (1)(1 + 3) = (1)(2) = 2 \quad (\geq 0) \]

- For \( x \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( x = 4 \):
  \[ (4)(4 - 3) = (4)(1) = 4 \quad (\geq 0) \]<|continue|>
 Since the inequality is non-strict (\(\geq\)), we include the critical points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 3 \). Therefore, the 
 solution to the inequality is:
\[ A = [0, 3] \]<|continue|>
Next, we solve the inequality for set \( B \):
\[ \log_{\frac{1}{2}} x \leq 0 \]<|continue|>
Recall that the base of the logarithm is \(\frac{1}{2}\), which is less than 1. For a logarithm with a base less than 1, the 
inequality \(\log_{\frac{1}{2}} x \leq 0\) implies:
\[ x \geq 1 \]

<|reflect|>
I may have overlooked something. The solution to the inequality incorrectly includes the critical point \( x = 0 \) because \( x 
\in \mathbb{N}^* \) (the set of positive natural numbers), and \( 0 \) is not a positive natural number.<|explore|>
To find a better solution, The solution to the inequality should be \( A = \left\{1, 2, 3\right\} \) since \( x \) must be 
a natural number and \( 0 < x \leqslant 3 \).<|continue|>
Correct the solution for set \( A \) considering \( x \in \mathbb{N}^* \):

\[ A = \{1, 2, 3\} \]<|continue|>
Set \( B \) remains the same:

\[ B = [1, \infty) \]<|continue|>
Find the intersection \( A \cap B \):

\[ A \cap B = \{1, 2, 3\} \cap [1, \infty) = \{1, 2, 3\} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]
