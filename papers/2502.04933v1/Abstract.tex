Conventional 5G network management mechanisms, that operate in isolated silos across different network segments, will experience significant limitations in handling the unprecedented hyper-complexity and massive scale of the sixth generation (6G). Holistic intelligence and end-to-end automation are, thus, positioned as key enablers of forthcoming 6G networks. The Large Language Model (LLM) technology, a major breakthrough in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, enjoys robust human-like language processing, advanced contextual reasoning and multi-modal capabilities. These features foster a holistic understanding of network behavior and an autonomous decision-making. This paper investigates four possible architectural designs for integrated LLM and 6G networks, detailing the inherent technical intricacies, the merits and the limitations of each design. As an internal functional building block of future 6G networks, the LLM will natively benefit from their improved design-driven security policies from the early design and specification stages. An illustrative scenario of slicing conflicts is used to prove the effectiveness of our architectural framework in autonomously dealing with complicated network anomalies. We finally conclude the paper with an overview of the key challenges and the relevant research trends for enabling Mobile Network-specialized LLMs. This study is intended to provide Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) with a comprehensive guidance in their paths towards embracing the LLM technology.
