\textbf{Architecture}  & \textbf{Strengths} & \textbf{Weaknesses} \\
\hline
\multirow{5}{3.5cm}{Standalone \gls{LLM} (Subsec.~\ref{subsec:standalone_llm})} & Independent and extended operational range of the \gls{LLM} with a wider spectrum of usecases & Increased latency as data need to be routed through multiple internal entities/interfaces to reach the \gls{LLM} \\
%\cline{2-3}
& Interoperability with multiple entities and systems both internally and externally & The need for additional middleware to interface with the other network entities \\ %\cline{2-3}
& Dedicated resources &	Duplication of functionalities due to silos of intelligence deployed across the \glspl{NF}\\ %\cline{2-3}

\multirow{6}{3.5cm}{Fully integrated \gls{LLM} (Subsec.~\ref{subsec:integrated_llm})} & Streamlined holistic design avoiding the need for intermediary communication middleware & Complex integration due to the required architectural developments at both cohabiting frameworks \\

& Shared access to the already established \gls{NF} pipeline and interfaces with outside &  Competition for the finite resources pool leading to resource contention\\ %\cline{2-3}
