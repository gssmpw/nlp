\subsection{Mobile Multiplayer Game}

The next ultimate gaming experience may follow the fusion of the physical and virtual worlds, where the dimensions and assets of our physical reality are augmented with elements from the virtual reality. This combination would allow users to go beyond the limitations of their homes and enjoy the outside and the physical company of other people while still been able to employ the power of their digital equipments to extend their perception of the world with rich elements and narratives provided by the game industry. To achieve this, interactions must have a low latency and last as long as possible, meaning an efficient use of devices battery.

The potential improvements to wireless communications proposed by 5G include a device-2-device communication that would allow devices within a given zone to communicate with high throughputs. In a real-time mobile multiplayer game (MMG), such feature would allow the formation of interaction spaces in which devices would be able to synchronize and update the game state with low latency. However, in a pure P2P game architecture, some players may use modified applications to have advantage over other players (cheating). This is one the main reasons for the use of authoritative servers~\cite{}, which are generally deployed in the cloud -- adding network latency that may not fit with real-time constraints. To address this issue, we propose a P2P architecture with peer review of the game state update. In this model, each update to the game state performed by a node is checked by a peer node dynamically chosen. Thus, if a node updates the game to an invalid state, there is a great chance such violation would be detected. Figures~\ref{fig:} and~\ref{fig:} illustrate a classic client-server architecture and the aforementioned P2P architecture.

The P2P with peer review architecture implies the dynamic selection of a \textit{reviewer} for each of the available node. For obvious reasons, a single node should not accumulate this role, i.e., reviewers should be evenly distributed among nodes. A simple scheme would be to randomly allocate this role to one of the nodes which have not yet been chosen. While the details of this approach are out of the scope of this paper, it illustrates how a data-intensive and delay-sensitive application could explore the potential of a self-organizing edge space. In the next section, we describe the abstractions and the self-organization mechanisms for the engineering and execution of interactive mobile applications.

%While this solution would still rely on backend servers for processing and persisting game data, a pure cloud-based solution would imply a significant amount of data to be transfered back and forward, increasing latency and the use of mobile data plans. In addition to the election and replication of roles, the physical-virtual space mapping tends to be more coarse and fuzzy than previous example. For instance, a game may choose city parks as arena for users interaction. Accordingly, a \textit{game session group} could have the geolocation coordinates of a park region as its membership criteria. Once devices are within the same session group and a server role is elected, the game session may start.


%To achieve a fair use of resources, the server role should be rotated among existing group members even before the active role have quit the system. 

%To prevent battery drain, a GPS role can be assigned to fewer members and broadcasted using low energy bluetooth.
