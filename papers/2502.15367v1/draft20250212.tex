% As voice assistants (VAs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for emotion-aware systems capable of recognizing and appropriately responding to user emotions has grown. While significant progress has been made in speech emotion recognition (SER) and sentiment analysis, effectively responding to user emotions—particularly negative ones—remains a challenge. This study explores human emotional response strategies in VAs interactions using a role-swapping approach, where participants regulate AI emotions rather than receiving pre-programmed responses. Through speech feature analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we examined acoustic and linguistic patterns across different emotional scenarios. Our results indicate that participants favor neutral or positive emotional responses when engaging with negative emotional cues, demonstrating a natural inclination toward emotional regulation and de-escalation. Additionally, we found that root mean square (RMS), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and jitter serve as key acoustic indicators of emotional state, while sentiment polarity and lexical diversity (TTR) distinguish between positive and negative responses. These findings provide valuable insights for developing adaptive, context-aware VAs that deliver empathetic, culturally sensitive, and user-aligned responses.

While significant progress has been made in speech emotion recognition (SER) and sentiment analysis, effectively addressing user emotions—particularly negative ones—remains a challenge. This study explores human emotional response strategies in VA interactions using a role-swapping approach, where participants regulate AI emotions rather than receiving pre-programmed responses. Through speech feature analysis and natural language processing (NLP), we examined acoustic and linguistic patterns across various emotional scenarios. Results show that participants favor neutral or positive emotional responses when engaging with negative emotional cues, highlighting a natural tendency toward emotional regulation and de-escalation. Key acoustic indicators such as root mean square (RMS), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and jitter were identified as sensitive to emotional states, while sentiment polarity and lexical diversity (TTR) distinguished between positive and negative responses. These findings provide valuable insights for developing adaptive, context-aware VAs capable of delivering empathetic, culturally sensitive, and user-aligned responses. By understanding how humans naturally regulate emotions in AI interactions, this research contributes to the design of more intuitive and emotionally intelligent voice assistants, enhancing user trust and engagement in human-AI interactions.
