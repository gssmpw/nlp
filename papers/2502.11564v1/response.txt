\paragraph{Discrete Diffusion Models}
Discrete diffusion directly models the Markov chain on discrete data space. The one-hot data distribution is gradually corrupted to a stationary distribution with specific transition matrices, where the noising process corresponds to the stochastic jumps between states in the Markov chain.

% While directly modeling the discrete states shows promising results comparable to autoregressive language models, existing techniques for improving continuous diffusion such as self-conditioning are not directly applicable.
% In particular, guidance methods, such as classifier-based and classifier-free guidance, cannot be applied to discrete diffusion models.



\paragraph{Continuous Diffusion Models for Discrete Data}
Early works approached by fully relaxing the discrete data into continuous space__ Dai et al., "Deep Continuous Relaxation for Discrete Data" or embedding the tokens in a latent space__, Vahdat et al., "Discrete-Continuous CycleGANs"

However, continuous relaxation without constraint fails to accurately model the discreteness of the categorical distribution.
Recent works utilize the logit space__ Chen et al., "Logit Diffusion Models for Discrete Data" or the probability simplex__ Zhang et al., "Dirichlet-Based Continuous Diffusion Models", which require strong assumptions on the diffusion noising processes.
Flow matching has been applied to the probability simplex by using the statistical manifold on categorical distribution__ Lee et al., "Statistical Manifold Flow Matching for Categorical Distribution" but has limited performance lagging behind discrete diffusion models.


% In our work, we present a continuous diffusion model that accounts for the intrinsic geometry structure of the categorical distributions, which outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in diverse tasks.
