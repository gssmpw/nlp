{investigates the extent to which speaker embeddings—vector representations designed to capture speaker identity—contain residual information unrelated to speaker identity, such as linguistic content, recording conditions, and speaking style. The study analyzes six sets of speaker embeddings derived from recent high-performing deep neural network (DNN) architectures. To evaluate these embeddings, a large multi-speaker parallel speech dataset is utilized, comprising 46 speakers delivering the same set of prompts, recorded in both professional studios and home environments. The analysis includes intra- and inter-speaker similarity measures and examines whether simple classification and regression methods can extract residual information from the embeddings. The findings reveal that, despite the high discriminative power of the analyzed embeddings, residual information remains present, showing a high correlation with recording conditions, linguistic content, and utterance duration. }
