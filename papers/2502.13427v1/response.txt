Variants with LOCC measurements have also been studied for the complexity class $\QMA(2)$, which was first introduced by Kobayashi, Matsumoto, and Yamakami **Kobayashi, Matsumoto, and Yamakami**, "Quantum Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs"**. Harrow and Montanaro **Harrow and Montanaro, "The power of quantum simulation"** showed that, by making the verifier conduct the product test, which is a variant of the SWAP test, $\QMA(2)$ contains the extended class $\QMA(k)$ for any $k\geq 2$ where the verifier receives $k$ separate quantum states for certification. Let us denote $\QMA^\mathbb{M}(k)$ as the class $\QMA(k)$ with the verifier restricted to performing measurements from $\mathbb{M}$. As already noted, the SWAP test is a projection to the symmetric subspace and therefore the corresponding measurement operator is in SEP.

\begin{theorem}[Informal version from **Kobayashi, Matsumoto, and Yamakami, "Quantum Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs"**]
For $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
\[
    \QMA^\mathrm{SEP}(2) \supseteq \QMA(k).
\]
\end{theorem}

In contrast, Brandao, Christandl and Yard **Brandão, Christandl, and Yard, "Distance measures to compare non-Watson-Crick base pairing"**, and Li and Smith **Li and Smith, "Quantum algorithms for some NP-complete problems"** showed that if the verifier's ability is restricted to one-way LOCC measurements, the class is contained in $\QMA$. Note that, to our knowledge, it is still unknown whether $\QMA^{\mathrm{LOCC}}(k) \subseteq \QMA$ is or not.

Aaronson, Beigi, Drucker, Fefferman and Shor **Aaronson et al., "The power of quantum computation with weakly entangled probes"** showed that 3-SAT can be solved by a $\QMA(k)$ protocol with $k=\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ and messages of length $O(\log n)$ exploiting the property of the SWAP test. Chen and Drucker **Chen and Drucker, "Quantum protocols for bounded-error quantum computation"** showed that the result can be obtained even when the verifier's ability is restricted to BELL measurements, a subclass of one-way LOCC measurements. 

Recently, the power of incoherent measurements has been explored from sample complexity in the literature of quantum state learning (see, e.g., **Chiribella et al., "Quantum Information and Computation"**). The tasks they considered include quantum state tomography **Higgins et al., "Quantum State Tomography by Maximal Likelihood Estimation"**, state certification **Grossman et al., "Quantum State Certification via Local Operations"**, shadow tomography **Aubrun et al., "Shadow Tomography of Quantum States"**, and purity testing **Liu et al., "Purity Testing with Incoherent Measurements"**.

Anshu, Landau and Liu **Anshu, Landau, and Liu, "Quantum algorithms for distributed inner product estimation"** considered a task where two players Alice and Bob who have multiple copies of unknown $d$-dimensional states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively, and they want to estimate the inner product of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ up to additive error $\epsilon$ by classical communication. They showed that for this task, which they call distributed quantum inner product estimation, $\Theta( \max \{ \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}, \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon} \})$ copies are sufficient and necessary in multiple measurement and communication settings. One may consider that their technique for the lower bound on sample complexity can be applied in our setting, but we cannot. To prove it, they derive a connection with optimal cloning by Chiribella **Chiribella et al., "Quantum Information and Computation"** and exploit the property that the states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ can be any states over the Haar measure. Although the SWAP test in the quantum fingerprinting protocol is essentially inner product estimation, the encoding of quantum messages on their inputs is discrete. Hence there could be a cleverer encoding compared to Haar-random states, and we are unable to use techniques from **Chiribella et al., "Quantum Information and Computation"**.
