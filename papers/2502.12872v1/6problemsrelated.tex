We introduced several classes of automata that act as intermediary classes between deterministic and nondeterministic automata. These new classes of automata are distinct from similar notions in the literature. We extensively compared the novel classes of MA, MR, and SR automata with HD and SD automata. Here, we briefly discuss a few other related notions such as almost-DBP or good-for-MDP automata.  
In an effort to also reason about history deterministic and semantically deterministic automata, Abu Radi, Kupferman, and Leshkowitz~\cite{AKL21} introduced and studied a class of automata they called almost-determinisable by pruning (almost-DBP). 
While their definition is related to the probability that a run on a randomly generated word in the language is accepting, we study the notion where a randomly generated run by a resolver on every word in the language is accepting.  
To further highlight the difference, almost-DBP B\"uchi auomtata are the same as semantically deterministic B\"uchi automata, whereas SR B\"uchi automata are a different class than SD B\"uchi auomtata.  

Good-for-MDP automata are automata that admit compositionality with MDPs that make them relevant for reinforcement learning and MDP model checking~\cite{HPSS0W20}. We remark that SR automata are good-for-MDP, since an almost-sure resolver for an automaton can be used as a strategy for syntactic satisfaction objective for the product of automaton with any MDP. The converse is not true, however, since good-for-MDP B\"uchi automata recognise all $\omega$-regular languages~\cite[Section 3.2]{HPSS0W20} but SR B\"uchi automata are only as expressive as deterministic B\"uchi automata (\cref{theorem:pih}).

 %Another related work to ours is that of probabilistic finite state monitors~\cite{CSV08}, which consider randomising transitions in safety automata, similar to probabilistic automata,
Although we have studied the classes of MA, SR, and MR automata comprehensively, some fundamental questions about these classes are still unknown. For the class of MA automata, the exact probability distributions in the resolver do not matter (\cref{lemma:indifferent2probabilities}). However, the same remains unknown for SR and MR automata. 
\begin{question}
Are almost-sure resolvers that resolve nondeterminism in stochastically resolvable settings indifferent to the exact probabilities distribution?  
\end{question}
Despite the problem of resolver checking for the cases of B\"uchi or coB\"uchi being undecidable, more study is needed to conclude the complexity status of the class membership problem for SR and MR automata. 
\begin{question}
    Is it decidable to check if a given (co)B\"uchi automaton is SR?
\end{question}
Our result of \textsf{Resolver-coBuchi} being undecidable is somewhat surprising when considered together with \cref{theorem:coBuchiHDisSR}, where we showed that every SR coB\"uchi automaton can be efficiently converted to an MA coB\"uchi automaton in polynomial time without any additional states. Thus, it might be reasonable to expect that the above question can be answered affirmatively.% for coB\"uchi automaton is decidable.

\cref{theorem:coBuchiHDisSR} also implies that HD coB\"uchi automata have language-equivalent MA coB\"uchi automata with at most as many states. We ask whether the same holds for parity automata, and thus, if it is  possible to trade the exponential memory for resolvers in HD parity automata with randomness.  
\begin{question}
    Does every HD parity automaton have a language-equivalent MA parity automaton of the same size?
\end{question}

% Similarly, checking if a B\"uchi or coB\"uchi automaton is MA is in $\NP$, but the lower bound results hold for parity automata with arbitrarily many priorities. 
% \theju{low hanging fruit. do we leave it here as a conjecture? i believe checking MA is in $\P$ for coBuchi. If we had a week where we could think, I think we could prove it. We could also stop at the previous conjecture?}

% \apbutlong{I think we should not mention it. I would rather mention the conjecture that every HD parity automaton has  a language-equivalent MA parity automaton with at most as many states.}
