This study presents BOLIMES, a novel feature selection algorithm that combines the robustness of Boruta with the interpretability of LIME to address the challenges in gene expression classification. The proposed method has demonstrated superior performance, achieving higher accuracy compared to alternative solutions, while significantly reducing training time. Furthermore, we have identified the optimal number of features necessary to achieve the best possible accuracy. Looking ahead, future work could focus on integrating additional interpretability methods with LIME for a more comprehensive feature relevance assessment. Extending BOLIMES to multi-omics data, including proteomics and metabolomics, could enhance its applicability. Investigating deep learning-based classifiers and validating the approach on larger, diverse datasets and clinical samples would be essential for improving performance and ensuring robustness in real-world applications.
