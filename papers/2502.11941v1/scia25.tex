\begin{abstract}
Air quality prediction is key to mitigating health impacts and guiding decisions, yet existing models tend to focus on temporal trends while overlooking spatial generalization. We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013--2017 collected in northern China for PM\(_{2.5}\) analysis.  Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics---especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.
