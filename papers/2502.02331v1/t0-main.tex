\begin{abstract}
    Performativity, the phenomenon where outcomes are influenced by
    predictions, is particularly prevalent in social contexts where individuals
    strategically respond to a deployed model. In order to preserve the high
    accuracy of machine learning models under distribution shifts caused by
    performativity, \citet{p20p} introduced the concept of performative risk
    minimization (PRM). While this framework ensures model accuracy, it
    overlooks the impact of the PRM on the underlying distributions and the predictions of the model.
     In this paper, we
    initiate the analysis of the impact of PRM, by studying
    performativity for a sequential performative risk minimization problem with binary random variables and linear performative shifts. We formulate two natural measures of impact. In the case of full information, where the distribution
    dynamics are known, we derive explicit formulas for the PRM solution and
    our impact measures. In the case of partial information, we provide
    performative-aware statistical estimators, as well as simulations. Our
    analysis contrasts PRM to alternatives that do not model data shift and
    indicates that PRM can have amplified side effects compared to such methods.

%\section*{Impact Statement}
%
%This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. Our theoretical analysis contributes to better understanding of the impact of machine learning on society. Therefore, we expect that our results can serve a positive purpose in increasing the awareness about ML impact and encouraging further research on related topics. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
