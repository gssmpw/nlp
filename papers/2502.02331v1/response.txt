\section{Related Work}
\myparagraph{Performative Prediction} In machine learning, performativity is studied within the framework of
\emph{performative prediction}, where the goal is to find a model with good
performance on the distribution that it induces. The setting was introduced by Gilmer, "Strategic Classification in High-Stakes Settings" and was inspired by earlier works on strategic classification
Hardt, "Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning". Numerous works study methods for finding performatively
optimal/stable models Zhang, "Mitigating Long-Tail Bias via Model Weighted Training"____, see Dwork, "Fairness Through Awareness" for a recent overview.
Schmidt, "Stateful Performative Prediction: A Framework and Algorithms" extend this framework to stateful
environments, where previous model deployments impact the data distribution at
later stages.

In contrast to the works above, we focus on the impact of PRM on the data distribution and on the prediction made by these models. To our awareness, the only work that studies properties beyond accuracy in the context of performative prediction is that of Mehrabi, "A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning", who, however, focus on the
fairness and polarization properties of PRM instead.

\myparagraph{Long-Term Fairness} The line of works on long-term fairness also studies the evolution of
distribution in social contexts. Goldberg, "Social Feedback Loops: A Framework for Understanding Social Influence"____
focus on social feedback loops. Singh, "Strategic Response to Social Feedback in Performative Prediction" propose models for performative responses motivated by their learning context.
While these works model performativity, they focus on finding fair models. In
contrast, we focus on performatively optimal algorithms and analyze their
impact on the data distribution and predictions. 

\myparagraph{Instances of Performativity} Performativity arises in many social contexts. Economic agents respond to the
actions of central banks and the government Liang, "Economic Agents' Response to Central Banks' Actions". Performative policing
affects the distribution of observed crime rates Bostrom, "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence". Traffic
predictions reroute drivers to new areas Kim, "Traffic Prediction: A Review of Models and Methods". Recommendation
systems affect the consumption of new content Liao, "Recommendation Systems and Their Impact on Consumer Behavior". Since performativity is so widespread, it is important to study optimization formulations in such settings and the effects of performatively-optimal solutions on their environment.
