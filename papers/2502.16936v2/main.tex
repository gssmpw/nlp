%\subsection{Theorems and such}
%The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
%\begin{definition}
%\label{def:inj}
%A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
%\end{definition}
%Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
%\begin{proposition}
%If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof} 
%Left as an exercise to the reader. 
%\end{proof}
%\cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
%\begin{lemma}
%\label{lem:usefullemma}
%For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{theorem}
%\label{thm:bigtheorem}
%If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
%\end{theorem}
%An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
%\begin{corollary}
%If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
%the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{assumption}
%The set $X$ is finite.
%\label{ass:xfinite}
%\end{assumption}
%\begin{remark}
%According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.

\section*{Impact Statement}

%This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the fields of machine learning and music information retrieval. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the fields of machine learning and music information retrieval. Musical version matching can be used to enhance music discovery, preserve cultural heritage, and support fair copyright management. By connecting versions across styles and performances, musical version matching also fosters creativity, promotes artistic appreciation, and paves the way for more equitable solutions in the music industry, benefiting society at large. As with any machine learning tool, however, there always exists the possibility of some potential misuses of itself or of some of its components, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
