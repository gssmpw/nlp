In this paper, we investigate the episodic memory capabilities of LLMs. We propose an innovative Multi-agent data generation framework to collect high-quality, context-rich fine-tuning data, named EM-Train, which we used to further train the Echo model. We innovatively introduce time information into the training paradigm of LLMs. We also develop a multi-round dialogue test set, EM-Test, to evaluate the episodic memory capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that EM-Train significantly improves the Episodic Memory of LLMs. The experiments also verify that LLMs can gain time perception and reasoning abilities by incorporating time information into their training paradigms. Furthermore, qualitative experimental analysis indicates that Echo exhibits some human-like episodic memory capabilities. Our research provides a preliminary exploration of complex episodic memory capabilities with temporal information for LLMs.
