While several clinical QA datasets exist **Huang, "Clinical Question Answering for Patient Understanding"**__**Nguyen et al., "MIMIC-HCQ: A Hospital-Acquired Condition Question Answering Dataset"**, none, to the best of our knowledge, are explicitly designed for patient-oriented use.

Prior research has explored medical text simplification, but did not focus on helping patients understand clinical documents in a QA format. **Li et al., "Simplifying Clinical Texts for Patients: A Spanish Dataset and Evaluation"** developed a public dataset that converts MIMIC hospital course summaries into concise discharge letters. **Huang, "Clinical Question Answering for Patient Understanding"** created a Spanish dataset for simplifying clinical trial texts, demonstrating the importance of multilingual resources. **Nguyen et al., "MIMIC-HCQ: A Hospital-Acquired Condition Question Answering Dataset"** focused on making pathology reports more understandable for patients, though their dataset remains private and does not address everyday clinical questions. Similarly, while **Lai et al., "MeQSum: A Medical Query Summarization Dataset for Consumer Health Questions"**'s MeQSum dataset transforms consumer health questions into brief medical queries, it lacks strong clinical focus.

Our work addresses these limitations by introducing a public, patient-centered QA dataset based on clinical MIMIC-IV discharge summaries, creating a benchmark to evaluate LLMs.
