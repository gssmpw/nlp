While several clinical QA datasets exist ____, none, to the best of our knowledge, are explicitly designed for patient-oriented use. 

Prior research has explored medical text simplification, but did not focus on helping patients understand clinical documents in a QA format. ____ developed a public dataset that converts MIMIC hospital course summaries into concise discharge letters. ____ created a Spanish dataset for simplifying clinical trial texts, demonstrating the importance of multilingual resources. ____ focused on making pathology reports more understandable for patients, though their dataset remains private and does not address everyday clinical questions. Similarly, while ____'s MeQSum dataset transforms consumer health questions into brief medical queries, it lacks strong clinical focus.

Our work addresses these limitations by introducing a public, patient-centered QA dataset based on clinical MIMIC-IV discharge summaries, creating a benchmark to evaluate LLMs.
