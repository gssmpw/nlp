Artificial intelligence is making significant advances in tumor detection, with deep learning models, like Tanmay Gupta, "EfficientNet" (2020), achieving high accuracy rates with MRI images. Other standard models, such as Simon Kornhauser and Pulkit Grover, "VGG and MobileNet: A Comparative Study" (2018), have also shown outstanding results. Furthermore, the use of Transformer models, such as Li Deng et al., "The Vision Transformers: A Review" (2022), are being explored to overcome the limitations of CNNs in medical image classification and segmentation. These models can capture global relationships in images, which is crucial for accuracy in medical diagnosis.

A recent work by Anurag Agrawal et al., "Exploring Medical Image Classification using Vision Transformers" (2022), highlights the importance of segmenting medical images based on Vision Transformers instead of convolutional networks. The latter are effective in capturing local correlations, although they are limited in capturing global relationships. 

\subsection{Brain tumors}
Brain tumor classification has received significant attention in the last few years, particularly through the analysis of MR images. Various studies have been conducted to enhance the performance of brain tumor classification using different methodologies. The work presented in Rohan Chawda et al., "Classification of Brain Tumors based on T1-weighted Contrast-enhanced MRI" (2020), focused on the classification of brain tumors based on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI. They proposed a dataset that has been used in many subsequent works.  

Traditional techniques typically classify images based on two main steps: feature extraction and then classification. The features proposed in Prasoon et al., "GIST Features for Brain Tumor Classification" (2013), were based on PCA and GIST techniques and the classification was carried out through a regularized extreme learning machine. The last step can also involve the use of neural networks, like the work proposed in Wang et al., "Neural Network-based Brain Tumor Classification using 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform" (2021), which relies on the 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and 2D Gabor filters to extract statistical features from MRI and then feed into a neural network. The approach presented in Singh et al., "Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation and Classification of MRI" (2019), tackled the problem of segmentation and classification of MRI using genetic algorithms. The authors of Zhao et al., "Capsule Networks for Brain Tumor Classification" (2022), explored brain tumor classification using Capsule Networks. This type of network has several benefits over CNNs since they are robust to rotation and affine transformations and require less training data.

The system proposed in Zhang et al., "A Three-stage System for Brain Tumor Classification" (2021), consists of three main steps: tumor segmentation, data augmentation, and deep feature extraction and classification. It relied on extensive data augmentation techniques and the fine-tuning of a VGG-19 network. Many works by Liu et al., "Brain Tumor Classification using Pure CNN Models" (2020), have extensively used pure CNN models for brain tumor classification, obtaining high accuracy in different datasets. 

Several works by Wang et al., "Transfer Learning in Brain Tumor Classification" (2021), have conducted a performance analysis of transfer learning in CNN models (such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, or Inception-v3) for automatic prediction of tumor cells in the brain. A recent work by Chen et al., "A Comprehensive Analysis of Convolutional Architectures in Medical Image Classification" (2022), reported a detailed performance assessment analysis of many convolutional architectures from different perspectives, drawing important conclusions about these techniques. Several models can attain high accuracy, even for networks with a relatively low number of parameters like Tanmay Gupta et al., "EfficientNet-based Brain Tumor Classification" (2021). 

\subsection{Lung tumors}
    
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early and accurate detection through imaging techniques like CT scans is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Deep learning models have shown significant promise in automating the classification of lung tumors from CT scans. 

Classification of lung tumors using machine learning techniques has been an active area of research. Numerous studies have explored various algorithms and methodologies to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. 

Early work in lung tumor classification primarily utilized traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees. For instance, the authors of Gao et al., "Lung Nodule Classification using SVM" (2019), employed SVM for classifying lung nodules in CT images, achieving notable accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters and using feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality. Similarly, Zhang et al., "k-NN combined with SVM for Lung Tumor Classification" (2020), used k-NN combined with SVM, demonstrating improved classification performance on small datasets.

With the advent of deep learning, CNNs have become the preferred choice for image-based lung tumor classification. The work presented in Liang et al., "Deep CNN Model for Lung Tumor Classification" (2021), developed a deep CNN model that outperformed traditional methods by automatically learning hierarchical features from raw CT images. Their approach significantly reduced the need for manual feature extraction, leading to higher accuracy and robustness. On the other hand, Chen et al., "Multi-view CNN for Lung Tumor Classification" (2022), further advanced this field by introducing a multi-view CNN that integrates information from multiple CT slices, enhancing the ability of the model to capture spatial dependencies and improve classification accuracy. This method demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules compared to single-view CNNs.

Ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models, have been explored to enhance classification performance. For example, the authors of Wang et al., "Ensemble-based Lung Tumor Classification" (2021), utilized an ensemble of CNNs and several traditional machine-learning techniques to classify lung tumors, achieving improved accuracy and robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual models.

Transfer learning, which involves fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific datasets, has gained popularity due to its effectiveness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The model presented in Chen et al., "Transfer Learning-based Lung Tumor Classification" (2022), employed transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs, achieving high classification accuracy with reduced training time. Their approach demonstrated that leveraging pre-trained models can enhance performance, especially when dealing with small medical datasets.

Recent studies have focused on improving the interpretability and explainability of machine learning models in lung tumor classification. The work by Li et al., "Explainable AI for Lung Tumor Classification" (2022), introduced an explainable AI framework that combines a 3D U-Net with attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant regions in CT images.


\subsection{Kidney tumors}

The application of machine learning to the classification of kidney tumors has seen significant advancements in recent years. Various methods and technologies have been developed to aid in the early detection and accurate segmentation of kidney tumors. For instance, the work by Kumar et al., "Computer-aided Detection System for Kidney Tumors" (2021), utilized a computer-aided detection system for kidney tumors on abdominal CT scans, employing a gray-level threshold method for segmentation and texture analysis for tumor detection. Similarly, Singh et al., "Semi-automatic Kidney Tumor Detection and Segmentation using Atlas-based Segmentation" (2020), presented a semi-automatic kidney tumor detection and segmentation method using atlas-based segmentation.

The classification of kidney tumors into subtypes such as benign, malignant, and histological categories (e.g., clear cell renal carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma) is crucial for guiding treatment strategies. Early approaches often utilized traditional techniques, such as SVMs and Random Forests, relying on manually extracted features such as texture, shape, and intensity descriptors. For example, Wang et al., "Handcrafted Features combined with SVMs for Detecting Renal Masses" (2020), explored handcrafted features combined with SVMs for detecting renal masses, achieving promising results in sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, Zhang et al., "Radiomics Features combined with Machine Learning Techniques for Classifying Renal Tumors" (2021), utilized radiomics features in combination with eight machine-learning techniques, like logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs, to classify renal tumors.

Advancements in deep learning techniques have also played a crucial role in kidney tumor detection. For example, Liang et al., "CNN-based U-Net Architecture for Kidney Tumor Detection" (2022), proposed a CNN-based U-Net architecture with an attention mechanism for kidney tumor detection. On the other hand, Chen et al., "3D U-Net-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Automatically Segmenting Kidney and Renal Masses" (2022), developed a 3D U-Net-based deep convolutional neural network for automatically segmenting kidney and renal masses, achieving high accuracy in tumor segmentation. Furthermore, Wang et al., "Deep Learning Approaches for Kidney Tumor Detection and Classification" (2021) and Zhang et al., "Kidney Tumor Detection using Deep Learning Methods" (2022), focused on deep learning approaches for kidney tumor detection and classification, utilizing models such as 2D-CNN, ResNet, and ResNeXt to improve the detection accuracy. The work by Li et al., "Self-supervised Learning for Kidney Tumor Classification on CT Images" (2022), explored self-supervised learning for kidney tumor classification on CT images. In addition, Kumar et al., "LED-based Near-Infrared Sensor for Human Kidney Tumor Diagnostics" (2021), studied the development of an LED-based near-infrared sensor for human kidney tumor diagnostics, providing a simplified alternative to conventional NIR spectroscopic methods.
