\section{Related Work}
Similarity-based DTI prediction methods utilize drug and target similarity measures in conjunction with the distance between each pair of drugs and their respective targets **Moro, "On Similarity-Based Graph Embeddings for Network Analysis"**. The similarity is obtained using a distance function like the Euclidean.
The DTI prediction using feature-based approaches uses mainly the support vector machine **Durrantey, "A Novel Support Vector Machine Approach to Drug-Target Interaction Prediction"**. A pair of targets and drugs can be distinguished by features, leading to binary classification or two-class clustering based on positive or negative interactions.
Currently, graph-based approaches used in parallel with network-based methods to predict missing DTI are considered reliable interaction prediction methods **Zitnik, "Graph-Based Methods for Predicting Missing Interactions"**. Here, drug-drug similarity, target-target similarity, and known interactions between DTI are integrated into a heterogeneous network, operating on the simple logical principle that similar drugs interact with similar targets.


Embedding-based approaches (KGE) such as TransE **Bordes, "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-Relational Data"** and RotatE **Sun, "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Attention Network with Iterative Enhancements"** incorporate the fundamental semantics of a graph by expressing entities and relationships between them as continuous vectors. In contrast, semantic or textual matching techniques such as DistMult **Yang, "DistMult: Simple Embeddings for Relation Learning"**, utilize scoring functions to evaluate the similarity of entities and relationships. By looking at the scores for all the relationships and entities linked to a certain head/tail and relationship, these methods find the most likely relationship or tail entity during testing.

In summary, existing KGC methodologies exhibit notable limitations. Embedding models such as TransE, RotatE and various others fail to generalize to unseen entities and relations due to their dependence on predefined embeddings, limiting adaptability to new knowledge graph structures. Text-based and LLM-based approaches depend on descriptive entity information, which is often sparse or inconsistent across datasets. In addition, embedding methods, as well as some text-based methods, rely on extensive negative sampling during training, leading to high computational costs, especially on large datasets.
