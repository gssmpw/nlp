\section{Introduction}

In~\cite{DP07:tcs}, in a setting of a process language featuring both
non-deterministic and probabilistic choice, Yuxin Deng and Catuscia
Palamidessi propose an equational theory for a notion of weak
{\bisimilarity} and prove its soundness and completeness. Not
surprisingly, the axioms dealing with a silent step are reminiscent to
the well-known $\tau$-laws of Milner~\cite{Mil89:phi,Mil89:ic}. The process
language treated in~\cite{DP07:tcs} includes recursion, thereby
extending the calculus and axiomatization of~\cite{BS01:icalp}. While
the weak transitions of~\cite{DP07:tcs} can be characterized as
finitary, infinitary semantics is treated in~\cite{FG19:jlamp},
providing a sound and complete axiomatization also building
on the seminal work of Milner~\cite{Mil89:ic}.

In this paper we focus on branching {\bisimilarity} in the sense
of~\cite{GW96:jacm}, rather than on weak {\bisimilarity} as
in~\cite{BS01:icalp,DP07:tcs,FG19:jlamp}.

In the non-probabilistic setting branching {\bisimilarity} has the
advantage over weak {\bisimilarity} that it has far more efficient
algorithms~\cite{GJKW17:tcl,GV90:icalp}. Furthermore, it has a strong
logical underpinning~\cite{DV95:jacm}. It would be very attractive to
have these advantages available also in the probabilistic case, where
model checking is more demanding. See also the initial work reported
in~\cite{GV17:festschrift}.

For a similarly basic process language as in~\cite{DP07:tcs}, without
recursion though, we propose a notion of branching probabilistic {\bisimilarity}
as well as a sound and complete equational axiomatization. Hence,
instead of lifting 
all $\tau$-laws to the probabilistic setting, we only need to do this
for the B-axiom of~\cite{GW96:jacm}, the single axiom capturing inert
silent steps. For what is referred to as the alternating
model~\cite{HJ90:rtss}, branching probabilistic {\bisimilarity} has been
studied in~\cite{AGT12:tcs,AW06:tcs}. Also~\cite{Seg95:thesis}
discusses branching probabilistic {\bisimilarity}. However, the proposed
notions of branching {\bisimilarity} are either no congruence for the
parallel operator, or they invalidate the identities below which we
desire. The paper~\cite{AG09:sofsem} proposes a complete theory for a
variant of branching {\bisimilarity} that is not consistent with the
first $\tau$-law unfortunately.

Our investigation is led by the wish to identify the three processes
below, involving as a subprocess a probabilistic choice between $P$
and~$Q$. Essentially, ignoring the occurrence of the action~$a$
involved, the three processes represent (i)~a probabilistic choice of
weight~$\frac34$ between to instances of the subprocess mentioned,
(ii)~the subprocess on its own, and (iii)~a probabilistic choice of
weight~$\frac13$ for the subprocess and a rescaling of the subprocess,
in part overlapping.

\noindent
In our view, all three processes starting from $s_0$, $t_0$, and $u_0$
are equivalent. The behavior that can be observed from them when
ignoring $\tau$-steps and coin tosses to resolve probabilistic choices
is the same. This leads to a definition of probabilistic branching
{\bisimilarity} that hitherto was not proposed in the literature and
appears to be the pendant of weak distribution {\bisimilarity} defined
by~\cite{EHKTZ13:qest}.

As for~\cite{DP07:tcs} we seek to stay close to the treatment of the
non-deterministic fragment of the process calculus at hand. However,
as an alternate route in proving completeness, we rely on the
definition of a concrete process.  We first apply the approach for
strictly non-deterministic processes and \emph{mutatis mutandis} for
the whole language allowing processes that involve both
non-deterministic and probabilistic choice. For now, let's call a
process concrete if it doesn't exhibit inert transitions,
i.e.\ $\tau$-transitions that don't change the potential behavior of
the process essentially. The approach we follow first establishes
soundness for branching (probabilistic) {\bisimilarity} and soundness and
completeness for strong (probabilistic) {\bisimilarity}. Because of the
non-inertness of the silent steps involved, strong and branching
{\bisimilarity} coincide for concrete processes. The trick then is to
relate a pair of branching (probabilistically) bisimilar processes to
a corresponding pair of concrete processes. Since these are also
branching (probabilistically) bisimilar as argued, they are
consequently strongly (probabilistically) bisimilar, and, voil\`a,
provably equal by the completeness result for strong (probabilistic)
{\bisimilarity}.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section~\ref{sec-prelim} we gather some notation regarding probability
distributions. For illustration purposes Section~\ref{sec-nondet}
treats the simpler setting of non-deterministic processes reiterating
the completeness proof for the equational theory of~\cite{GW96:jacm}
for rooted branching {\bisimilarity}. Next, after introducing
branching probabilistic {\bisimilarity} and some of its fundamental
properties in Sections~\ref{sec-bpb} and~\ref{fundamental},
respectively, in Section~\ref{sec-prob} we prove the main result,
viz.\ the completeness of an equational theory for rooted branching
probabilistic {\bisimilarity}, following the same lines set out in
Section~\ref{sec-nondet}. In Section~\ref{sec-concl} we wrap up and
make concluding remarks.
