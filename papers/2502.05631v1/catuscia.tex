\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
  This paper proposes a notion of branching {\bisimilarity} for
  non-deterministic probabilistic processes. In order to characterize
  the corresponding notion of rooted branching probabilistic
  {\bisimilarity}, an equational theory is proposed for a basic,
  recursion-free process language with non-deterministic as well as
  probabilistic choice. The proof of completeness of the
  axiomatization builds on the completeness of strong probabilistic
  {\bisimilarity} on the one hand and on the notion of a concrete
  process, i.e.\ a process that does not display  (partially)
  inert $\tau$-moves, on the other hand. The approach is first presented for the
  non-deterministic fragment of the calculus and next generalized to
  incorporate probabilistic choice, too.
