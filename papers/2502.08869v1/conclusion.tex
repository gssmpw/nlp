\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present the first survey on leveraging vision models for time series analysis, whose general process structures the survey. We propose a new taxonomy consisting of imaging and modeling methods for time series. We discuss the pre- and post-processing steps as well. Each category encompasses representative methods and relevant remarks. The survey also highlights the challenges and future directions for further advancing time series analysis with vision models.
