In this work, we introduce \ours, a skill chaining model designed for long horizon dexterous manipulation. 
Given a task decomposed into $N$ skills, \ours trains $N+1$ heads: $N$ heads to learn individual skills and an additional head for skill progress estimation. 
Based on the estimated progress values, a skill progress guided skill selector \progss chooses the proper skill to execute at each time step. 
Qualitative results demonstrate that \progss effectively adapts to unexpected disturbance.
Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real world settings reveal the performance advantages of \ours over the single-head Octo baseline, as well as its capability to handle various skill sequences and diverse object sets.
