\section{Threats to Validity \& Limitations}\label{sec:threats}
\noindent\textbf{Construct validity:} Our COOD/COOD+ framework uses data-driven techniques to synthesize OOD samples, which may not fully reflect real-world SE scenarios. While we include diverse OOD scenarios, a pilot study with developers is necessary. Additionally, the reliability of our OOD benchmark depends heavily on the quality of the OOD datasets used. \textbf{Internal validity:} Hyperparameter tuning impacts ML performance. For model fine-tuning, we kept the GraphCodeBERT architecture unchanged due to feasibility reasons, but conducted ablation studies with various model components, encoder backbones, and key hyperparameters. \textbf{External validity:} We conduct OOD detection experiments on two large-scale code search datasets. Although our focus on Python and Java limits generalizability, experiments on these two languages partially demonstrate that our approach is PL-agnostic.

% \noindent\textbf{Construct validity:} For the training and evaluation of our COOD/COOD+, we use several data-driven techniques to synthesize OOD samples, which may not perfectly resemble real-world SE scenarios. Even though we try to include various OOD scenarios with respect to different aspects of multi-modal data, a pilot study with developers is necessary. Additionally, the reliability of our proposed OOD benchmark heavily depends on the quality of the datasets we used to extract the OOD samples. \textbf{Internal validity:} An important factor that impacts ML performance is hyperparameter tuning. For the finetuning of our models, due to feasibility reasons, we didn't change the model architecture of GraphCodeBERT, but we conduct ablation studies with different model components, encoder backbones, and important hyperparameters.
% \textbf{External validity: } We conduct OOD detection experiments on two large-scale code search datasets. The generalizability issue is related to the focus on Python \& Java. Yet, by conducting experiments on two different PLs, we partly demonstrate that our approach is PL agnostic.
