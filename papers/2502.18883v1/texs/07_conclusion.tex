\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion} 
We proposed two multi-modal OOD detection aproaches for code-related pre-trained ML models; namely unsupervised COOD and weakly-supervised COOD+. The COOD merely leveraged unsupervised contrastive learning to identify OOD samples. As an extension of COOD, COOD+ combined contrastive learning and a binary classifier for OOD detection using a small number of labelled OOD samples. To reap the benefits of these two modules, we also devised a novel scoring metric to fuse their prediction results. The evaluation results demonstrated that the integration of the rejection network and contrastive learning can achieve superior performance in detecting all four OOD scenarios for multi-modal NL-PL data. Additionally, our models can be applied to the downstream SE task, achieving comparable performance to existing code-related models. %For future work, we will design and execute a pilot study with developers to validate our OOD detection methods in real-world SE settings. 

% To achieve this, we employed a margin-based loss in contrastive learning to maximize the difference in similarity scores between ID and OOD code pairs. In addition, we introduced a binary OOD rejection network that can be adapted to be used in conjunction with contrastive learning for further enhancing detection performance. %We will also  as well as to do more experiments to validate the excellent performance of the proposed methods.
