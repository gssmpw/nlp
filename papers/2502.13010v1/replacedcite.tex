\subsection*{Difference and Importance of AMG-RAG}

Our \gls{myrag} dynamically constructs relational medical \glspl{kg} integrated with advanced search capabilities. Unlike traditional static systems, our approach extracts medical terms from queries, enriches them with real-time data, and utilizes \glspl{llm} to infer relationships. This dynamic mechanism ensures continuous alignment with emerging medical knowledge, addressing the limitations of static knowledge bases and pre-trained models. By combining dynamic \glspl{kg} with \gls{cot} reasoning and \gls{rag}, our framework improves the adaptability and reliability of medical \gls{qa} systems.
