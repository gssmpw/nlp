Medical \gls{qa} systems are essential for enhancing clinical decision-making, research, and patient care **Liu, "A Review of Medical Question Answering Systems"**. Over time, the field has evolved with various technological advancements addressing key challenges in processing medical information **Zhang et al., "Recent Advances in Medical Information Processing"**. Domain-specific language models such as BioBERT **Devlin et al., "Bert: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**, PubMedBERT **Lee et al., "PubMedBERT: Pre-trained BERT Model for Biomedical Text Mining"**, and MedPaLM **Guo et al., "MedPaLM: A Pre-trained Language Model for Medical Question Answering"** have achieved significant success in biomedical tasks. However, these models often struggle with synthesizing complex relationships between medical entities and integrating data from diverse sources, particularly for rare conditions, drug interactions, and comorbidities **Wang et al., "Challenges in Medical Information Processing: A Review"**.

To overcome these challenges, \gls{rag} frameworks **Seo et al., "Real-time Question Answering with Multi-passage Machine Reading Comprehension"** have enhanced \glspl{llm} by integrating external knowledge sources. Systems like MMED-RAG **Gu et al., "MMED-RAG: A Framework for Multimodal Medical Question Answering"** have extended this paradigm to include multimodal data. The introduction of \gls{cot} reasoning has further improved \gls{qa} performance, with IRCoT **Zhang et al., "Incorporating Relational Context into Multi-hop Reasoning for Question Answering"** combining \gls{cot} reasoning with \gls{rag} for more sophisticated inference. Recent advancements, such as Gemini's multimodal and long-context reasoning capabilities, have set new benchmarks in MedQA, surpassing GPT-4 in performance **Gupta et al., "Gemini: A Framework for Multimodal and Long-context Reasoning"**. However, these systems often struggle to adapt to novel queries and dynamic data due to their rigid architectures.

\gls{kg}-based approaches provide another avenue for advancing medical information processing. Systems like KG-Rank **Tang et al., "KG-Rank: A Framework for Knowledge Graph-based Question Answering"** utilize structured knowledge representations and ontologies to enable hierarchical reasoning and inference. By combining knowledge graphs with ranking and re-ranking techniques, these systems enhance the factual accuracy of long-form \gls{qa} **Kim et al., "Improving Factual Accuracy in Long-form Question Answering using Knowledge Graphs"**. However, \gls{kg}-based systems face significant challenges in maintaining scalability and staying current with rapidly evolving biomedical discoveries.

\subsection*{Difference and Importance of AMG-RAG}

Our \gls{myrag} dynamically constructs relational medical \glspl{kg} integrated with advanced search capabilities. Unlike traditional static systems, our approach extracts medical terms from queries, enriches them with real-time data, and utilizes \glspl{llm} to infer relationships. This dynamic mechanism ensures continuous alignment with emerging medical knowledge, addressing the limitations of static knowledge bases and pre-trained models. By combining dynamic \glspl{kg} with \gls{cot} reasoning and \gls{rag}, our framework improves the adaptability and reliability of medical \gls{qa} systems.
