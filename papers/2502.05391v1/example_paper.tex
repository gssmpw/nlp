% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

Unlike CFG, iGCT \textbf{eliminates the need for two-stage training} and removes contrast artifacts, achieving \textbf{better precision} and \textbf{FID} under high guidance (Fig. \ref{fig:results_fid_prec_rec}).

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

The societal implications of this work are largely positive, as it contributes to creative industries, education, and research. However, as with any image generation technology, there is a risk of misuse, such as the creation of misleading or harmful content. We encourage the responsible use of this technology and emphasize the importance of ethical considerations in its deployment.

In summary, while our work primarily aims to advance the field of machine learning, we acknowledge the broader societal implications and encourage ongoing dialogue about the ethical use of image generation technologies.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
