\subsection{fMRI-Based Brain Decoding}
% 任务定义
% Brain Visual decoding 目的是从脑活动中还原出受试者得到的对应视觉刺激. Naselaris2011
Brain decoding seeks to reconstruct the visual stimuli perceived by subjects based on their brain activity, offering a deeper understanding of the brain's mechanisms for processing external information____.
% Early
Earlier work____ reveals a correlation between Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) image representations and neural activity in the visual cortex using sparse linear regression.
% 生成模型入场: GAN 入场 -> Diffusion + CLIP
With the advent of generative models____ and extensive fMRI datasets____, visual decoding has shifted towards mapping brain signals to the latent spaces of large models, facilitating the reconstruction of diverse visual stimuli____.
% Diffusion + CLIP: % 现有数据集缺乏配对数据集,大多依赖于拉到潜空间的策略
This approach has proven effective in utilizing latent diffusion models for image reconstruction____, addressing inter-subject differences by either training separate models for individual subjects or employing partially unified models with subject-specific parameters.
% 我们的优势
% However, such models focus solely on individual latent patterns and, limit their potential to uncover inter-subject neural variability.
However, influenced by neural variability, cross-subject brain signals in the latent space are prone to semantic conflicts, which can lead to convergence at suboptimal points.
% MindAligner introduces a region-level explicit alignment method designed to enhance the interpretation of inter-subject neural variability. 
MindAligner addresses this by leveraging an explicit functional alignment framework across brains, this approach more effectively utilizes shared functionalities among subjects, thereby mitigating semantic conflicts.

Overview of MindAligner. 
To achieve explicit brain functional alignment, given a pre-trained brain decoding model, we design a \textbf{Brain Functional Alignment Module (BFA)} that learns a Brain Transfer Matrix (BTM) $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{M}}$ for fMRI mapping between the known and novel subjects. BTM is decomposed into two low-rank matrices $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}$ to create latent space for further alignment. 
The Cross-Stimulus Neural Mapper is proposed to create fMRI pairs under shared stimuli. In addition to the alignment losses $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_{rec}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_{KL}$ between generated and real fMRI, a latent alignment loss $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_{latent}$ guides functional alignment based on stimulus similarities.
In the inference stage, only the BTM is utilized for functional mapping, enabling cross-subject brain decoding.

\subsection{Cross-Subject Functional Alignment}
% 文件夹清空, 
% 问题: 为什么要研究跨受试功能对齐
As brains differ both in size and processing mechanisms ____, the resulting variability in fMRI signals has spurred research into brain alignment methods.
% 促使了功能对齐的产生, 传统功能对齐往往依赖于共享刺激，即需要提供不同受试者在相同视觉刺激下的数据对，通过优化重建损失完成对齐.
The ideal condition for functional alignment methods often depends on \textbf{shared stimuli}, 
requiring paired data from multiple subjects exposed to identical visual inputs, with alignment achieved through reconstruction loss optimization ____.
A new paradigm____ has emerged, enabling explicit alignment by transforming one subject's signal to that of another, thereby preserving functionality and facilitating knowledge transfer across subjects.
To enable cross-subject visual decoding on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)____, the largest open-source dataset available, which lacks shared stimuli, 
current methods focus on either anatomical alignment____ or functional alignment in latent space____.
Benefiting from a focus on region-level functional differences, functional alignment outperforms anatomical alignment in effectiveness.
MindEye2____ employs ridge regression to align different subjects into a shared latent space, followed by a shared decoding module.
%, subsequently using the resulting latent vectors in a common module for visual decoding.
MindBridge____ generates pseudo stimuli to create shared stimuli for brain alignment.
% 现有方法存在的问题, %  我们方法的优越性
However, these alignment methods either rely on shared stimuli, restricting their applicability to datasets without such conditions, or utilize latent space alignment, which impedes their ability to uncover inter-subject neural variability.
We introduce an explicit brain functional alignment model to conquer the restriction of the shared stimuli and enhance the interpretation of inter-subject neural variability.
%and design a region-level explicit alignment method to enhance the interpretation of inter-subject neural variability.
