\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
This paper proposes \textit{VectorQ}, an online framework that learns embedding-specific similarity threshold regions to address the limitations of static thresholds in semantic prompt caches. \textit{VectorQ} introduces embedding-specific threshold regions, employs correctness sampling to re-evaluate the correctness of uncertain similarity values, and guarantees threshold convergence. Our results show that \textit{VectorQ} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semantic prompt caches, achieving up to 26Ã— increases in cache hit rate and error rate reductions by up to 74\%.
