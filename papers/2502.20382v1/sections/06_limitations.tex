\section{Limitations and Future Work}
While our method efficiently generates abundant contact-rich trajectories, several limitations remain. First, although our human-hand demonstration framework is fast and intuitive, it may not fully exploit the kinematic capabilities of the target robot, such as continuous joint rotation or specialized dexterous maneuvers. Future work could explore the application of our automated data generation framework to embodiment-aware legacy datasets, better capturing the unique motion capabilities of different robotic systems.

Second, although our method demonstrates strong performance in the vicinity of the demonstration due to trajectory optimization, the learned policies struggle to recover from states far outside the demonstrated regions, such as those resulting from catastrophic failure. Future work could explore more advanced planning techniques to iteratively improve the learned policies' robustness in unvisited regions of the state space. \looseness=-1

Third, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our pipeline primarily for training robust state-based policies. Extending the framework to train visuomotor policies by incorporating high-quality synthetic rendering from simulation could further improve policy transferability to real-world scenarios.\looseness=-1
