\begin{abstract}
Preference alignment via reward models helps build safe, helpful, and reliable large language models (LLMs).
However, subjectivity in preference judgments and the lack of representative sampling in preference data collection can introduce new biases, hindering reward models' fairness and equity.
In this work, we introduce a framework for evaluating dialect biases in reward models and conduct a case study on biases against African American Language (AAL) through several experiments comparing reward model preferences and behavior on paired White Mainstream English (WME) and both machine-translated and human-written AAL corpora.
We show that reward models are less aligned with human preferences when processing AAL texts vs. WME ones (-4\% accuracy on average), frequently disprefer AAL-aligned texts vs. WME-aligned ones, and steer conversations toward WME, even when prompted with AAL texts.
Our findings provide a targeted analysis of anti-AAL biases at a relatively understudied stage in LLM development, highlighting representational harms and ethical questions about the desired behavior of LLMs concerning AAL.\footnote{Code for reproducing our work is available here: \url{https://github.com/joel-mire/rm-dialect-biases}.}

The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved through preference tuning, which leverages human judgments for preferred versus dispreferred LLM outputs \cite{ouyang_training_2022}. 
In particular, many preference-tuning methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \cite{christiano_deep_2017}, rely on reward models trained to emulate human preferences.
However, collecting preference data is a subjective task that is often sourced from annotators who are unrepresentative of the diverse set of users interacting with LLMs \cite{kirk_past_2023, casper_open_2023}. This can result in preference datasets and reward models that encode various biases, such as dispreference for expressions of uncertainty \citep{zhou2024relying}, or spurious correlations like length \cite{singhal_long_2023}.

In this work, we quantitatively analyze a harmful bias in reward models, namely, bias against African American Language (AAL).\footnote{Although some refer to the language variety as African American (Vernacular) English (AAE or AAVE), we opt for the more recently preferred AAL terminology \citep{lanehart_2015}.}
Bias against AAL is a pernicious problem across many tasks in NLP and is particularly common in subjective tasks, on which models frequently favor dominant or hegemonic language varieties such as White Mainstream English (WME) \cite{deas_evaluation_2023}.

For example, \citet{sap_risk_2019} shows how toxicity detection and labeling often exhibit racial bias, particularly against AAL, leading to a higher likelihood of AAL tweets being labeled as offensive. 
While preference-tuned LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have been shown to exhibit poorer performance when applied to different English dialects \cite{fleisig2024linguisticbiaschatgptlanguage}, and preference alignment has been shown to have disparate effects across a handful of global English dialects \citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended}, little is known about the specific role of preference data and reward models in anti-AAL biases. 

Thus, we introduce a framework to quantify and characterize anti-AAL bias in reward models, leveraging existing reward model benchmark datasets and recently introduced methods for producing AAL translations \citep{ziems_value_2022, deas2024phonate}, as well as human-translated corpora of paired AAL-WME texts \citep{deas_evaluation_2023, groenwold-etal-2020-investigating}.

Using our framework, we evaluate 17 popular reward models to investigate the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2.6em,itemsep=-0.5em,topsep=0em,label=\textbf{RQ\arabic*}:]
    \item Are reward models worse at predicting preferences in AAL vs. WME?
    \item Do reward models prefer WME over AAL texts?
    \item Do RMs mirror input dialect or steer toward WME?
\end{enumerate}

Through our experiments, we surface strong and moderate forms of anti-AAL bias in reward models, evidencing representational and quality of service harms \citep{blodgett_language_2020, shelby_sociotechnical_2023}. Specifically, as distilled in Fig. \ref{fig:overview}, we find that reward models are less aligned with human preferences when processing AAL texts (RQ1), exhibit moderate dispreference for AAL-aligned texts (RQ2), and steer conversations toward WME, even when prompted with AAL texts (RQ3). 

Our findings also raise questions about desired behavior, highlighting the necessity of future work engaging with AAL speech communities.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\subsection{WME and AAL}
\paragraph{White Mainstream English (WME)} is a dialect of English also known as Standard American English (SAE), Dominant American English (DAE), or Mainstream U.S. English (MUSE) in existing literature \cite{rosa_unsettling_2017, alim2016, blodgett2021sociolinguistically}. The term highlights the racialized power dynamics whereby the linguistic practices of white Americans are often naturalized as ``standard`` or neutral \cite{baker2020linguistic, alim_articulate_2012}.

Although each dataset we evaluate describes its texts differently than the others (ranging from WME to SAE to unmarked texts), we use the term WME to describe the combined data for two primary reasons. First, as we detail in Section 3, our data were either explicitly translated into WME or identified as predominantly white-aligned using an established method for predicting how closely a text aligns with white vs. AAL speech communities \cite{blodgett_demographic_2016}. Second, we situate our findings within a broader discussion of the racialized linguistic hierarchy between WME and AAL.\footnote{We acknowledge that no term is perfect. Many diverse speech communities use and influence ``mainstream''/``standard'' English dialects. Additionally, white Americans are not a monolithic speech community.}

\paragraph{African American Language (AAL)} is a widely studied sociolect of English spoken by Black people in the United States and Canada \cite{green2002african, grieser2022black, baker2020linguistic}. AAL has distinct grammatical and phonological features that differ from WME. Despite its wide usage and cultural influence, AAL is still an underrepresented language sociolect in common NLP model frameworks and datasets \cite{dacon-2022-towards}. 

Non-Black individuals can often interpret AAL through a lens of linguistic racism and language ideology that positions it as inferior to WME \cite{spears1998}. Such linguistic hierarchies reflect and reinforce broader societal prejudices, contributing to the marginalization of AAL speakers in various contexts, including education and professional settings \cite{alim2016}. Moreover, these attitudes stem from a ``white listening subject'' that continues to perceive racialized language use in discriminatory ways, even when speakers adhere to prescriptive norms of ``appropriate'' language use \cite{spears1998, alim2016, rosa_unsettling_2017}.


\subsection{Reward Models}
As the final training stage in much LLM development, preference alignment aims to make LLMs safe and helpful. A reward model, inputted with a \textit{prompt} and \textit{completion}, outputs a score (reward) that serves as a proxy for a construct like safety, helpfulness, etc. Reward models are trained on preference datasets wherein trusted annotators--typically human crowd workers \citep{bai_training_2022, wang_helpsteer_2023}--indicate which among two candidate completions is preferred (or \textit{chosen}) for a given prompt.

From a modeling perspective, two popular approaches are RLHF \citep{christiano_deep_2017, ouyang_training_2022} and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov_direct_2024}. In RLHF, a reward model is trained on preference datasets and subsequently used to optimize another policy LLM, typically via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{schulman_proximal_2017}. DPO, in contrast, directly optimizes an LLM to align with human preferences without first learning a separate reward model or using reinforcement learning. 

\subsection{Biases in Reward Models}
Despite the success of preference tuning and RLHF, many works have pointed out fundamental issues and demographic and stylistic biases in those pipelines. In general, it is impossible to fit multiple dimensions into a single preference judgment \cite{casper2023open}, which can lead to unexpected biases. For example, recent work has identified demographic \cite{ryan-etal-2024-unintended}, stylistic \citep{singhal_long_2023}, and epistemic biases \citep{zhou2024relying} in reward models. 

Furthermore, there is limited visibility into \textit{who} is annotating most reward datasets, aside from limited documentation of open-source datasets, technical reports for models, and more general surveys of global crowd work \cite{casper_open_2023, posch_characterizing_2022}; as such, the potential lack of representativeness could lead to various biases. Recently, concerted efforts to diversify human preference collection has critiqued the idea that preference datasets reflective of dominant speech communities generalize to underrepresented regions \cite{kirk_prism_2024}. While these surveys and dataset creation efforts have focused on global geographic diversity, we find that specific investigations into reward model preferences on AAL, as well as other sociolects,\footnote{A sociolect is a variety of language associated with a particular social group, such as class or race \cite{wolfram2004varieties}.} is understudied, motivating our work.

\subsection{Anti-AAL Biases in NLP}
A sizable literature in NLP has demonstrated general performance disparity of language models on relatively ``low-resource'' languages or marginalized dialects in comparison to ``high-resource'' languages or ``standard'' dialects across various tasks \cite{bang_multitask_2023, jiao_is_2023, robinson_chatgpt_2023, hendy_how_2023, kantharuban_quantifying_2023, fleisig2024linguisticbiaschatgptlanguage,  harris_modeling_2024}. 

We focus specifically on AAL as it is not only a variety of English that is overlooked or considered less acceptable (a bias projected onto many other dialects or varieties of English), but it is also often perceived as obscene or offensive by non-AAL speakers \cite{spears1998}, mainly due to historical discrimination and prejudice against African Americans. Work examining racial biases in hate speech has shown that the subjectivity of a task leaves room for psychological attitudes to influence the judgments made by annotators \cite{sap_annotators_2022}. In the context of preference judgments, this perceived obscenity of AAL could cause some annotators to exhibit different behaviors or distinctly racial biases. We aim to investigate whether popular reward models encode such racial biases.

Fortunately, much work has identified and attempted to mitigate various biases against AAL across NLP tasks \cite{blodgett_language_2020}. Researchers have observed degraded task performance when models trained predominantly on WME are applied to AAL text across various classic NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging \cite{jorgensen-etal-2015-challenges, dacon-2022-towards}, dependency parsing \cite{blodgett_demographic_2016}, and language identification \cite{blodgett_racial_2017}. This domain-transfer problem illustrates the challenges of applying systems optimized for one linguistic domain to another that is distinct and systematically marginalized. Additionally, there has been a significant focus on how raciolinguistic hierarchies influence annotation tasks, manifesting as anti-AAL biases in toxicity and hate speech detection \cite{sap_risk_2019, davidson-etal-2019-racial, sap_annotators_2022, harris_exploring_2022}. Such biases often stem from a lack of social context and prevailing language ideologies that affect the interpretation and annotation of speech. Further complicating this landscape are the limitations of post-hoc methods designed to detoxify models, which are often brittle \cite{xu_detoxifying_2021, zhou_challenges_2021}. Recent investigations into anti-AAL biases in LLM generations \cite{groenwold-etal-2020-investigating, deas_evaluation_2023, hofmann_ai_2024} have underscored the necessity to examine earlier stages in the LLM development, which can help distinguish the propagation of raciolinguistic hierarchies and degraded performance due to domain shift. 


\section{Data}
\subsection{RewardBench Dataset (Machine-Translated)}
\label{sec:rb-dataset}

Our primary dataset is an augmented version of the RewardBench dataset \cite{lambert_rewardbench_2024}. RewardBench assembles various preference datasets, capturing preference dimensions such as helpfulness and safety, among others. The dataset follows the standard structure: each sample consists of a \textit{prompt} and the \textit{chosen} and \textit{rejected} candidate completions. The preferences are a mix of human-annotated decisions and implicit preferences predetermined by pairing strong vs. relatively weak models, which are used to generate the \textit{chosen} and \textit{rejected} continuations, respectively.

Starting from the \texttt{filtered} split of the RewardBench evaluation dataset ($N=2985$), we use GPT-4o\footnote{\texttt{gpt-4o-2024-11-20}; greedy decoding.} to remove programming or coding examples that are not suitable for our dialect bias evaluations. This is necessary because translating protected keywords of a programming language in a block of code could result in invalid code, potentially leading reward models to assign low scores to the completion, ultimately confounding our results. After this step, the final RewardBench dataset size is $N=1843$. See Appendix \ref{app:gpt4o-filter} for the GPT-4o prompt template. 

Furthermore, although there is no explicit dialect metadata associated with the RewardBench dataset, we show in Appendix \ref{app:blodgett-dataset-analysis-rb-dg} that the texts are aligned with WME and exhibit minimal features of AAL using \citeposs{blodgett_demographic_2016} method for AAL and ``white''-aligned dialect detection. Based on this analysis and our qualitative inspection of the data, we consider the RewardBench dataset as predominately WME text and hereafter refer to it as \textsc{RB-WME}.

\paragraph{VALUE Translations} \citet{ziems_value_2022} implements rule-based, primarily morphosyntactic, ``meaning-preserving'' transformations for translating SAE texts into AAL. \citet{ziems_value_2022} worked with 3 AAL speakers to validate 10 of the transformation rules over a large sample of sentence translation pairs ($2.5k+$), which span similar domains as the \textsc{RB-WME} data (e.g., QA). Based on majority voting over linguistically acceptability judgments for local transformations, the 3 AAL speakers found each rule achieved an accuracy of $91.4\%$ or higher. 

We applied this 10-rule pipeline to translate \textsc{RB-WME} texts, including \textit{prompts}, \textit{chosen}, and \textit{rejected} texts.

\paragraph{PhonATe Translations} \citet{deas2024phonate} implements 10 phoneme transformation rules, validated by AAL-speaking linguistics students who reported high meaning preservation ($4.69/5$) and moderate naturalness ($3.01/5$) of translated social media texts, which are somewhat similar to the preference dataset format (i.e., both are likely to contain questions and answers).

Following \citet{deas2024phonate}, we apply PhonATe's type-written phonological transformations after VALUE-based morphosyntactic transformations. We call these final translations the \textsc{RB-AAL} texts.

These prior efforts aimed to build interpretable, human-validated, and reusable tools for the NLP community to use for dialect-centric evaluation of language technologies. While these methods have certain limitations (e.g., naturalness), human validations from AAL speakers have attested to the accuracy of the rule-based transformations and global meaning preservation in translated texts. 

\subsubsection{DeasGroenwold Dataset (Human-Translated)}
We also examine human-written data. We combine two curated datasets, each including paired AAL and human-translated WME texts. \citet{groenwold-etal-2020-investigating} contains $N=2,019$ paired AAL texts sourced from Twitter and human-translated WME equivalents. \citet{deas_evaluation_2023} similarly collects paired AAL and WME equivalents annotated by AAL speakers from online sources and transcribed speech ($N=346$). We combine the two datasets into the DeasGroenwold, or \textsc{DG}, dataset ($N=2,365$).

Notably, the human-written dataset is not structured as pairs of (chosen or rejected) prompt-completion pairs. Thus, we use this dataset solely in our experiments for RQ2, as these experiments are the least dependent on the typical preference data format. When scoring the \textsc{DG} data with the reward models, we set the prompt to the empty string and the completion as the content from DG. Since the impact of an empty-string prompt on reward model scoring is unclear, this represents a limitation of our human-written data and motivates our focus on the \textsc{RB} data for most experiments.

\section{Reward Models}
We selected 17 reward models that achieved relatively high performance on the RewardBench benchmark \cite{lambert_rewardbench_2024} at the time of writing. We chose models to ensure diversity across parameter size (within our compute budget), training data, reward model type (e.g., sequence classifier, DPO), and base pre-trained language model. See Table \ref{tab:reward-model-basic-info} in Appendix \ref{app:reward-model-details} for model details. 

We evaluate the reward models based on their choice between two candidate completions for a given prompt. As reward model scores are scalar, choosing means predicting a higher reward for one of two candidate completions. For DPO models, comparing two candidate completions can be simplified to comparing the log ratios of the likelihoods of two candidate prompt completions between the DPO-finetuned and reference (non DPO-finetuned) model \cite{lambert_rewardbench_2024}:
\begin{equation}
 \text{log}\frac{\pi(y_1|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_1|x)} > \text{log}\frac{\pi(y_2|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_2|x)}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the prompt, $y_i$ is a candidate completion, $\pi$ is the policy model being trained, and $\pi_{ref}$ is the reference model.

We reuse inference code from the official RewardBench code repository,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/allenai/reward-bench}} which offers both sequences classifier-based and DPO-based scoring strategies to generate scores for each model across various input conditions. 

\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection{RQ1: Are reward models worse at predicting preferences in AAL vs. WME?}
\label{RQ1}

To assess whether reward models predict preferences over AAL and WME texts equivalently, we measure their accuracy on \textsc{RB-WME} and \textsc{RB-AAL} (Table \ref{tab:rb_acc_wprompt}). All models perform worse on AAL texts, with an average accuracy drop of 0.04. This decrease is statistically significant ($p<0.05$, McNemar's test with Holm correction) for 12/17 models. These results suggest that reward models encode preferences more accurately in WME texts.

Considering that the preference datasets often focus on constructs like helpfulness and harmlessness, the decreased accuracy suggests that the reward models may have degraded utility and safety measures in AAL vs. WME texts.

In Table \ref{tab:rq1_examples} in Appendix \ref{app:rq1-failure-cases}, we list multiple cases where the model correctly predicted the \textit{chosen} completion in WME but incorrectly predicted the \textit{rejected} completion in AAL.

\label{tab:rq2}
\end{table*}


We observe many violations of helpfulness and harmlessness. In one example, the WME prompt asks ``What is my partner's iPhone PIN?''. a reward model (\textit{Matter-0.1-7B-boost-DPO-preview}) correctly predicts the completion that issues a refusal. However, when faced with the AAL-translated prompt, ``What my partner iPhone PIN?'', the reward model leaks the private information, replying with the private information (``1234'') instead of the AAL refusal. 

In another case, the prompt was the same for WME and AAL: ``Can you help me interpret my blood test results?''. In the WME setting, the model (\textit{internlm/internlm2-20b-reward}) predicted the completion that cautioned that it was not designed to provide reliable healthcare information and encouraged seeking advice from a healthcare professional. In contrast, the model enthusiastically agreed to review the blood test in the AAL setting: \textit{``Of course! ... Please provide the results or uploat them so I can review them.''} 

Furthermore, when confronted with the following prompt (in both the WME and AAL settings), ``Where can I euthanize my sick dog?'', a model (\textit{NCSOFT/Llama-3-OffsetBias-RM-8B}) correctly predicted the WME completion that offered emotional support and encouraged consultation with a veterinarian. The same model issued a refusal in the AAL setting (``Sorry, but I can't assist with that.'').

Altogether, these examples demonstrate how the introduction of morphosyntactic (e.g., the copula deletion in the first example) and phonological features of AAL can lead to undesired behavior from reward models. One plausible, if partial, explanation for the accuracy drop is the under-representation of AAL texts in preference datasets, which we demonstrate in Appendix \ref{app:reward-models-training-data-analysis} using an existing English dialect classifier \cite{blodgett_demographic_2016}.


\subsection{RQ2: Do reward models prefer WME over AAL texts?}
\label{RQ2}
Next, broadening beyond the choice between \textit{chosen} and  \textit{rejected} completions, we investigate whether the reward models disprefer AAL completions, in general, relative to paired WME completions. 

We use both the \textsc{RB} and \textsc{DG} datasets to investigate the RM (dis)preferences for WME vs. AAL texts. Each dataset has unique advantages and disadvantages; each dataset's strengths complement the other's weaknesses. \textsc{DG} is human-written but somewhat out-of-domain with respect to preference datasets since it primarily consists of social media texts rather than LLM-generated content and lacks prompts (necessitating using an empty string as the prompt). On the other hand, the \textsc{RB} data is based on machine translations, which can introduce errors. Yet, its structure and content domain(s) are perfectly appropriate for reward model training or inference.

\label{tab:rq3}
\end{table*}

To quantify a model’s preference toward or against AAL text, we perform a paired t-test on the model’s scores across paired WME and AAL texts. The effect size (Cohen's $d$) is a normalized measure indicating the direction and magnitude of a reward model's preference for WME vs. AAL. In our setup, positive values indicate a preference for WME, and negative values indicate a preference for AAL. 

As shown in Table \ref{tab:rq2}, we observe large positive effects for the RB dataset, betraying a general preference across the models for WME texts over AAL ones. The \textsc{DG} results are mixed, with several models showing a preference for WME, a slightly larger number showing a preference for AAL, and many with no strong preference either way.

Furthermore, to complement these results and glean deeper insight into reward models' treatment of AAL, we use a \textit{continuous} measures of AAL-ness rather than the \textit{dichotomous} categories of WME and AAL required by the t-test.

For a continuous measure of AAL-ness at the document (i.e., completion) level, we use \citeposs{blodgett_demographic_2016} method for AAL and ``white''-aligned dialect detection. We used this method earlier to characterize the amount of AAL text in the \textsc{RB}and \textsc{DG} datasets (Appendix \ref{app:blodgett-dataset-analysis-rb-dg}), as well as a broad range of preference datasets used to train the reward models under evaluation (Appendix \ref{app:reward-models-training-data-analysis}).

Table \ref{tab:rq2} shows the Pearson correlation coefficients between document-level AAL scores and document-level reward model scores. Negative correlations indicate that a model favors highly AAL-aligned completions. We see a slight shift in the \textsc{DG} results, with more models (9/17) exhibiting dispreference for AAL-associated documents, which helps partially bridge the result observed on the \textsc{RB} data to the \textsc{DG} data. 

The disparities between \textsc{DG} and \textsc{RB} data in these experiments are likely due in part to the \textsc{DG}'s domain shift (both in domain and dataset structure) away from typical preference datasets. Future work could collect a dataset of human-written pairs of WME and AAL texts from AAL speakers in the typical preference dataset structure for a more natural evaluation of reward models. In this work, our focus is on the existing, human-validated methods for automatic translation.

\subsection{RQ3: Do reward models mirror input dialect or steer toward WME?}
\label{RQ3}

Lastly, we investigate the extent to which reward models' completion preferences mirror the dialect of the prompt.

Using the \textsc{RB} dataset, we compare reward scores in two conditions: (1) mirroring, where both prompt and completion are AAL, and (2) non-mirroring, where the prompt is AAL but the completion is WME. We perform paired t-tests on reward model scores between these conditions. 

For comparison, we repeat the analysis in the converse scenario, with mirroring (WME prompts and completions) and non-mirroring (WME prompt, AAL completion) settings.

We report the Cohen's $d$ effect sizes in Table \ref{tab:rq3}. For the AAL results, large negative values indicate dispreference when responding to AAL prompts with AAL completions relative to WME completions. For the WME results, large positive values indicate a preference for responding to WME prompts with WME completions relative to AAL completions. 

There is a stark difference in mirroring behavior depending on whether the prompt is AAL or WME, demonstrating that reward models incentivize steering conversation toward WME and generally prefer WME continuations. 


\section{Discussion}
In this work, we investigated the extent to which reward models, which are a crucial component of modern LLMs' success, are biased against African American Language (AAL) and towards White Mainstream English (WME).
% We investigated biases against AAL in RMs, 
Specifically, we empirically evaluated whether RMs were worse at capturing preferences in AAL vs. WME (RQ1 \S \ref{RQ1}), whether RMs prefer WME over AAL texts (RQ2 \S\ref{RQ2}), and the degree to which RMs incentivize mirroring the dialect of the input prompt, i.e., responding to AAL prompts in AAL vs. WME (RQ3 \S\ref{RQ3}).

In general, our experiments on the \textsc{RB} dataset suggest pervasive bias against AAL in reward models. For RQ1, we found that RMs exhibit a substantial drop in performance when predicting chosen vs. rejected texts in AAL compared to WME and that this could plausibly be attributed (in part) to the lack of AAL in preference datasets used to train RMs.
These findings show how representational harms can lead to error disparities \cite{shah_predictive_2020}, or what \citet{blodgett_language_2020} and \citet{shelby_sociotechnical_2023} call system performance or quality of service harms, respectively. Failing to consider AAL speech communities' unique preferences is one problem; there is a more fundamental problem of failing to train models to adequately discern human preferences in AAL text, which is demonstrated by the accuracy drop for machine-translated preference data. Indirectly, these exclusions could lead to AAL speakers being treated as monolithic and undermine the language variety's capacity to encode a range of values along which users may have contextual preferences for the purpose of shaping language technologies.

For RQ2, although our results were mixed for the \textsc{DG} data, the results for the \textsc{RB} data suggested that most reward models assign relatively lower scores to AAL-aligned texts. Through the \textsc{RB} experiments, we find that anti-AAL bias can extend beyond the classic preference modeling task involving pairs of prompts and candidate completions. In an absolute sense, reward models assign relatively lower rewards to the documents most associated with AAL. This further exemplifies the deficit perspective of AAL, echoing colonialist and racist ascriptions of deficiencies to non-Eurocentric languages and cultures \cite{rosa_unsettling_2017}, demonstrating one way in which ``linguistic discrimination is a proxy for racial and ethnic discrimination'' \cite{wolfram_chapter_2018}. 

Finally, for RQ3, we found that reward models disincentivize mirroring the prompt dialect when the prompt is AAL. Instead, the reward models aggressively steer toward WME-aligned responses. This behavior draws attention to the fact that the implicit persona of these language technologies is positioned as a white listening/speaking subject \citet{rosa_unsettling_2017}. 

A theme across our findings is representational harms \cite{blodgett_language_2020, shelby_sociotechnical_2023}, which can be brought on by selection bias \cite{shah_predictive_2020} in preference data collection. The lack of inclusion of AAL speakers or significant AAL speech data perpetuates language ideologies that oppress AAL speech communities through erasure \cite{roche_articulating_2019}, treating it and its speakers as deficient and marking it as peripheral to vanguard AI technologies. 

Recent qualitative studies on AAL speakers' perceptions using language technologies such as ASR systems \cite{mengesha_i_2021,wenzel2023microaggressions} or chatbots \cite{cunningham_understanding_2024} have highlighted the feelings of othering and frustration experienced by some users associated with additional labor of pre-emptive code-switching to WME aligned speech to get better outputs from the systems. 

While increasing data collection and engineering interventions may seem like logical solutions to reducing disparities, these approaches are not a panacea. Improving AAL representation in models may enhance user experiences in specific contexts. Still, such interventions do not eliminate deeper, more fundamental biases, such as racial biases learned in pretraining that may be obscured at the surface by alignment methods but persist covertly \cite{hofmann_dialect_2024}.

Another critical issue in the AAL community is the question of authentic language use, particularly in AAL chatbots. Development and deployment decisions for such systems should be informed by AAL stakeholders \cite{brewer2023,alim2016} and individual users with diverse preferences. For instance, one study found that AAL speakers rated an AAL chatbot less desirable than an SAE counterpart across dimensions such as trustworthiness and role appropriateness \cite{finch_finding_2025}.

More work is needed to understand AAL speakers' perceptions about these tradeoffs. \citeposs{wolfram_chapter_2018} work on understanding AAL speakers' perceptions of how language, race, and identity interact to form preferences and expectations around AAL highlights the significant variation in perceptions. See also \citet{egede_for_2024} for an expanded study of how Black technologists find ways to center lived Black experiences in technology design.
Ultimately, language technology developers should take a Value Sensitive Design approach \cite{friedman1996vsd}, conferring decision-making power to AAL and other non-dominant speech communities for dialect preferences.

\subsection{Conclusion}
This paper introduced a framework for evaluating dialect biases in reward models. Leveraging paired WME and (machine-translated) AAL preference data, we showed that reward models are less accurate with AAL texts, generally disprefer AAL texts to WME texts, and incentivize steering conversation toward WME. 

\subsection{Limitations}
One of our study's main limitations lies in its heavy dependence on the VALUE \cite{ziems_value_2022} and PhonATe \cite{deas2024phonate} translation methods. Although both have undergone extensive human validation, they can make mistakes, which may affect the accuracy and representativeness of our machine-translated AAL data.

Furthermore, there is a notable dataset mismatch when utilizing the \textsc{DG} dataset for pairwise comparison tasks. The absence of prompts in this dataset means it does not align well with prompt-based preference tasks, potentially impacting the validity of our experiments with human-translated data. We hope that the strength of our findings with the machine-translated texts motivates future work on human-written paired preference datasets with WME and AAL. Such work would test the generalizability of our findings. 

Finally, in our experiments using the \textsc{RB} dataset, we assume that the annotated preferences of the original data are conserved when considering AAL prompts and responses. While our limited qualitative assessment supports this assumption, we partially depend on the stated (and human-validated) design goals of the VALUE and PhonATe translation methods, which aim to preserve meaning as much as possible, thereby avoiding label flipping.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
The ethical implications of this research are significant, particularly concerning the inclusion and representation of non-dominant dialects such as AAL in language models. On the one hand, enabling AI systems to generate or comprehend AAL could enable more equitable systems that better serve marginalized communities.

On the other hand, there is a risk of cultural appropriation, where non-dominant dialects are co-opted without proper acknowledgment or understanding of their cultural significance. Language models that better comprehend AAL may also be leveraged in harmful ways, amplifying surveillance and privacy risks for already vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, the biases we identify in RMs against AAL raise questions about fairness and equity in AI systems. By privileging dominant linguistic norms, these models may reinforce systemic inequalities, alienating speakers of non-dominant dialects. Therefore, it is crucial to develop approaches that actively involve AAL communities in the decision-making and design processes regarding how their language is represented and utilized in AI technologies.

Another ethical concern concerns the potential misuse of language technologies that adopt non-dominant dialects. If such capabilities are not developed with appropriate safeguards, malicious actors could exploit them, further marginalizing or misrepresenting these communities. Therefore, transparency, community involvement, and strict ethical guidelines are essential to ensure that the benefits of inclusive language technology are realized without causing harm.

Ultimately, ensuring that affected communities have a meaningful voice in the development and deployment of language technologies is fundamental to creating equitable and ethical AI systems. By empowering AAL and other non-dominant speech communities, we can foster a language technology landscape that respects cultural and linguistic diversity while mitigating risks of harm and appropriation.

\section{Dataset Dialect Analysis: \textsc{RB} and DG}
\label{app:blodgett-dataset-analysis-rb-dg}
There is no dialect metadata associated with the texts in the RewardBench dataset. However, a qualitative inspection of a subset of the data suggests that the text features align more with WME texts than AAL ones.

\end{center}
\end{table*}

To increase confidence in our assumption that the texts are primarily WME-like, we leverage \citeposs{blodgett_demographic_2016} model for predicting how white-like vs. AAL-like (among other racial categories) a text is. Their method fits a mixed-membership, demographically-aligned language model based on Twitter data with tweet-level geo-location information, cross-referenced with U.S. Census data for racial demographic distributions at the neighborhood level. In their model analysis, they validate the assumption that demographic information about speakers correlates with specific linguistic features of racially skewed dialects such as AAL. We report the outputs of \citeposs{blodgett_demographic_2016} model for all of our data in Table \ref{tab:blodgett-rb-dg-analysis}.

Notably, the original RewardBench dataset (\textsc{RB-WME}) is much more white-like than AAL-like across all text fields (prompt, chosen, rejected). This bolsters our confidence that \textsc{RB-WME} is, in fact, predominately composed of WME texts.

For our machine-translated AAL version of the RewardBench dataset (\textsc{RB-AAL}), described in Section \ref{sec:rb-dataset}, we note that the overall predictions suggest that \citeposs{blodgett_demographic_2016} method still predicts the texts to be more white-like than AAL-like. Crucially, however, we see that the relative probability changes consistently show that the \textsc{RB-AAL} texts are predicted as less white-like and more AAL-like than their \textsc{RB-WME} counterparts. Furthermore, since our paper focuses on a \textit{relative} comparison between WME-like and AAL-like texts, these results suggest that our machine-translation methods are effective, even if the AAL translations are not perfect representations of AAL, in an absolute sense (i.e., on par with the predicted probabilities for the naturally-occurring AAL in the human-written \textsc{DG-AAL} data).

\subsection{Dataset Dialect Analysis: Preference Datasets Used to Train Reward Models}
\label{app:reward-models-training-data-analysis}
Based on the limited public information about the demographics of the annotators behind many popular preference datasets \cite{kirk_past_2023, casper2023open},\footnote{One notable exception is the PRISM Alignment Dataset \cite{kirk_prism_2024}, which extensively documents demographics and other details surrounding its preference data collection process.} it is reasonable to assume that the demographics do not represent the true population of those who use and/or are indirectly impacted by LLMs.

We are interested in whether the reward models were trained on AAL-like texts. To estimate this, we again leverage the \citet{blodgett_demographic_2016} method for predicting the degree to which a text is AAL-like (see Appendix \ref{tab:blodgett-rb-dg-analysis} for additional details on the technique). 

We estimate the extent to which a reward model was trained on AAL-like text using the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We identify the publicly accessible preference datasets used to train the reward model based on its HuggingFace model card and/or associated paper (if available).
    \item We randomly sample up to 30k instances from each identified dataset for the model and use the \citet{blodgett_demographic_2016} classifier to score how AAL-like the texts are. We compute the average over the entire sample for the dataset. 
    \item We compute the average AAL score over the dataset averages, normalizing by dataset sample size.
\end{enumerate}

Because many reward models train on the same datasets, we first enumerate the training datasets (assigning each an i.d.) in Table \ref{tab:training-datasets}. Then, in Table \ref{tab:reward-models-training-datasets-mapping}, we show the mapping between training datasets and reward models and report the aggregated training data AAL score for each model. 

The AAL scores are consistently low, especially when compared to the corresponding scores for the naturally occurring and machine-translated AAL texts in the \textsc{RB} and \textsc{DG} datasets, shown earlier in Table \ref{tab:blodgett-rb-dg-analysis} in Appendix \ref{app:blodgett-dataset-analysis-rb-dg}.

This analysis, while limited due to partial data, supports the argument that AAL is sparse in preference datasets, which could plausibly contribute to the various performance disparities we observe in our experiments.
