On average, we found out that for solving lp/milp, computer hardware got about 20 times faster, and the algorithms improved by a factor of about nine for lp and around 50 for milp, which gives a total speed-up of about 180 and 1,000 times, respectively. However, these numbers have a very high variance and they considerably underestimate the progress made on the algorithmic side: many problem instances can nowadays be solved within seconds, which the old codes are not able to solve within any reasonable time.},

In contrast to opaque models (e.g. neural networks), sparse two-level Boolean rules gain the crucial benefit of interpretability, which is necessary in a wide range of applications such as law and medicine and is attracting considerable attention in machine learning. This paper introduces two principled objective functions to trade off classification accuracy and sparsity, where 0-1 error and Hamming loss are used to characterize accuracy. We propose efficient procedures to optimize these objectives based on linear programming (LP) relaxation, block coordinate descent, and alternating minimization. We also describe a new approach to rounding any fractional values in the optimal solutions of LP relaxations. Experiments show that our new algorithms based on the Hamming loss objective provide excellent tradeoffs between accuracy and sparsity with improvements over state-of-the-art methods.},

We represent the problem of learning individual conjunctive clauses or individual disjunctive clauses as a Boolean group testing problem, and apply a novel linear programming relaxation to find solutions. We derive results for exact rule recovery which parallel the conditions for exact recovery of sparse signals in the compressed sensing literature: although the general rule recovery problem is NP-hard, under some conditions on the Boolean `sensing' matrix, the rule can be recovered exactly. This is an exciting development in rule learning where most prior work focused on heuristic solutions. Furthermore we construct rule sets from these learned clauses using set covering and boosting.  We show competitive classification accuracy using the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Or's of And's (OA) models are comprised of a small number of disjunctions of conjunctions, also called disjunctive normal form. An example of an OA model is as follows: If (\$x\_1 = \$ `blue' AND \$x\_2=\$ `middle') OR (\$x\_1 = \$ `yellow'), then predict \$Y=1\$, else predict \$Y=0\$. Or's of And's models have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they are a set of conditions that concisely capture the characteristics of a specific subset of data. We present two optimization-based machine learning frameworks for constructing OA models, Optimized OA (OOA) and its faster version, Optimized OA with Approximations (OOAx). We prove theoretical bounds on the properties of patterns in an OA model. We build OA models as a diagnostic screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea, that achieves high accuracy with a substantial gain in interpretability over other methods.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the learning of Boolean rules in disjunctive normal form (DNF, OR-of-ANDs, equivalent to decision rule sets) as an interpretable model for classification. An integer program is formulated to optimally trade classification accuracy for rule simplicity. We also consider the fairness setting and extend the formulation to include explicit constraints on two different measures of classification parity: equality of opportunity and equalized odds. Column generation (CG) is used to efficiently search over an exponential number of candidate rules without the need for heuristic rule mining. To handle large data sets, we propose an approximate CG algorithm using randomization. Compared to three recently proposed alternatives, the CG algorithm dominates the accuracy-simplicity trade-off in 8 out of 16 data sets. When maximized for accuracy, CG is competitive with rule learners designed for this purpose, sometimes finding significantly simpler solutions that are no less accurate. Compared to other fair and interpretable classifiers, our method is able to find rule sets that meet stricter notions of fairness with a modest trade-off in accuracy.},
