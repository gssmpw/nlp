\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes an orthogonal direction to break through the current plateau of adversarial robustness. We begin by revisiting dictionary learning in deep learning and reveal its limitations in dealing with outliers 
% under the single noise distribution assumption 
and its vulnerability to adaptive attacks. 
As a countermeasure, we propose a novel elastic dictionary learning approach along with an efficient RISTA algorithm unrolled as an 
% implicit
convolutional neural layers. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable robustness, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines available on the robustness leaderboard.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discover and validate that structural prior can reliably enhance adversarial robustness and generalization, unveiling a promising direction for future research.
