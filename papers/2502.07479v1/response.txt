Bootlint **Taylor, Bootstrap Linter** is a Bootstrap-specific linter for checking common HTML mistakes in web pages built in a vanilla way; that is, pages where default Bootstrap classes are used. Bootlint uses JavaScript to check for Bootstrap rule conformance, which is not configurable. The source code of Bootlint, which is in the \textit{bootlint.js}\footnote{https://github.com/twbs/bootlint/blob/master/src/bootlint.js} file of the Bootlint project, is much lengthier than the code in Listing 2. This validates our points on the current limitations of the current solution, as explained above. 

Policheck is Microsoft's internal tool that checks codes, comments, and content, including web pages. For example, it can check if a web page contains inappropriate content or if its style matches best practices and guidelines **Guo, Policheck**.

ESLint **Figueroa, ESLint** is a static JavaScript analysis linting utility written in JavaScript to enforce coding styles through pluggable rules. With ESLint, developers can analyze JavaScript code by using default rules or creating new rules without running the JavaScript code. ESLint requires a configuration file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), or JavaScript. Most importantly, the configuration file includes the source of the rule file, which is a JavaScript file that has the implementation of the rule. While ESLint is powerful and popular, the JavaScript code for each rule is not reusable.
