\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose the \textit{first} algorithm enabling collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) among institutions while preserving the privacy of their transaction graphs. We employ LSH~\cite{lsh} and bloom filters~\cite{bloomfilter} to reduce communication costs and enhance efficiency. Experimental evaluations on two synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In future work, we will attempt to deploy the algorithm in real-world industrial settings to evaluate its effectiveness with realistic data. Moreover, we will enhance the algorithm to address intricate money laundering scenarios involving more institutions and more complex transaction graphs.
