There is a growing body of work on sampling from discrete distributions with score-based models that build on denoising diffusion models~\citep{sohl2015deep, hoogeboom2021argmax, austin2021structured, campbell2022continuous, loudiscrete}.     There are variations between these models, but they are all fundamentally formulated based on a forward/backward continuous-time diffusion process for corrupting the data and learning score functions, via denoising, to reverse the process. Algorithmically, these continuous-time processes are then discretized using various schemes.  Our approach here is fundamentally different with a single noise scale sampling strategy: at each stage of measurement accumulation the data is sampled at a fixed noise scale. The process to bring the noise down is therefore discrete by nature, characterized by a single hyperparameter, the number of measurements $m$, in contrast to devising a noise schedule in diffusion-based prior works.
