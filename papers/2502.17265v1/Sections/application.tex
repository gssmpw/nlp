We deploy the proposed wrist control pipeline on the Hannes prosthesis. This arm is equipped with two EMG electrodes placed on the forearm flexor and extensor muscles of the user. These are used to trigger the \textit{rotation} phase and to control the fingers opening-closing during the \textit{grasping} phase. Moreover, the pipeline automatically starts/ends when the user brings the prosthetic arm up/down. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used to detect such motion.

The pipeline runs at 15 Hz on a laptop equipped with a NVIDIA RTX 3080. The supplementary video shows a qualitative comparison between the SSC baseline and the proposed vision-based control. Note that during the \textit{transport} phase, we do not run the visual servoing on an object part mask since it would bias the approach. Instead, we use the full object mask. This is obtained by merging the neighboring masks into a single mask, then the closest one to the image center is selected. Subsequently, in the \textit{rotation} phase, the closest object part mask to the image center is selected and its label is used to rotate the wrist accordingly.
