The first row represents the ground truth bounding box (yellow). The second row shows the inference results of IA-SSD, with green boxes indicating predicted bounding boxes with prediction probabilities, blue points representing selected foreground points, and purple points representing vote points learned from these foreground points. The third row represents the prediction results of our PDM-SSD, with the addition of pseudo foreground points obtained from the predicted heatmap. The fourth row shows the Gaussian coefficients of the foreground points used for final prediction, and the fifth row shows the angle coefficients.}

One of the advantages of PDM-SSD is that it uses a point-based 3D backbone, which allows the model to maintain fast inference speed. We analyze the parameter count and GFLOPs of each part of PDM-SSD. PDM-SSD has a very small parameter count, only 3.3M. The main difference between PDM-SSD and many other point-based detectors is the addition of the Neck module, which only contains 0.53M parameters and accounts for only 13\% of the overall GFLOPs, so it has a minimal impact on the model's inference speed. Table. \ref{tabel8} analyzes the inference speed of IA-SSD, PDM-SSD(A), and PDM-SSD. Our experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 with Intel i7-12700KF CPU@3.6GHz. The results show that the inference speed of PDM-SSD is 68FPS, slightly lower than the 84FPS of IA-SSD, but it fully meets the hardware limitations of current LiDAR devices and practical application requirements (0.46m/frame at a speed of 120km/h), and it also brings a 0.63\% performance gain. What's even more surprising is that PDM-SSD(A) can maintain the detection speed of 84FPS and bring a significant performance gain. Combining the advantages of PDM in sparse and incomplete object detection undoubtedly improves the safety in practical applications.
