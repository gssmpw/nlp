%This paper presents a new point-based single-stage 3D object detection networks, named \nickname{}. With novel instance-aware downsampling strategy and centroid rally module, we can effectively and efficiently achieve muti-class 3D object detection in a bottom-up manner.  Our \nickname{} achieves the best results among pure point-based methods, and provides a state-of-the-art efficiency than existing LiDAR detectors. In the future, we will focus on designing an efficient network to achieve real-time and robust 3D detection in 360-degree LiDAR scenes.

\qy{In this paper, we propose an efficient solution termed \nickname{} for point-based 3D object detection in LiDAR point clouds. Considering the task of object detection inherently focuses on the foreground information, we propose an instance-aware learning-based downsampling way to automatically select the sparse yet important instance points. Additionally, a dedicated contextual centroid perception module is proposed to fully exploit the geometrical structure around the bounding boxes.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Limitations.} Although the proposed \nickname{} can achieve remarkable efficiency in object detection of large-scale LiDAR points clouds, it also has limitations. \textit{e.g.,} the instance-aware sampling relies on the semantic prediction of each point, which is susceptible to class imbalances distribution. For future work, we will further explore advanced techniques to alleviate the imbalanced issue.
