The MiWaves app is a mobile health (mHealth) intervention designed to support emerging adults (EAs) in reducing cannabis use through self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and tailored resources. The MiWaves app is available on both the iOS and Android platforms. MiWaves utilizes \textbf{self-monitoring surveys} (see Figure \ref{fig:app_ema}), which prompt users twice daily to self-report their use of cannabis, stress levels, exercise, and sleep patterns, allowing users to reflect on their habits. During onboarding, participants can customize their preferred self-monitoring survey notification times, selecting 2-hour windows for morning and evening prompts, ensuring that the app integrates seamlessly into their daily routines. Full set of questions asked during these self-monitoring surveys can be found in Appendix \ref{app:self_monitoring_questions}.

Based on the self-reported data, MiWaves utilizes \textbf{reBandit} \cite{ghoshmiwaves2024}, an RL algorithm, to personalize the likelihood of delivering an \textbf{intervention message} (see Figure \ref{fig:app_message}). The algorithm is designed to balance intervention delivery with moments of no intervention, maximizing user engagement while avoiding habituation to the intervention content. Since user engagement is a primary determinant of success in digital interventions \cite{nahum2018jitai}, reBandit optimizes treatment to maximize user engagement. The intervention messages are randomly chosen (without replacement) from a pool of messages with varying length and interaction types. Table \ref{tab:intervention_prompts} provides a summary of the different types of intervention messages utilized in MiWaves.

The MiWaves app also includes a \textbf{My Trends} screen (see Figure \ref{fig:app_life_insights}), which provides participants with visual summaries of their self-reported cannabis use, sleep patterns, and exercise levels over the past week. This feature fosters self-awareness by allowing users to track their progress and identify patterns in their behavior. Additionally, MiWaves offers a comprehensive \textbf{Resources} screen to address a wide range of participant needs. This screen provides curated information on mental health and substance use services, overdose prevention, housing and hunger support, LGBTQ+ and gender identity resources, pregnancy and parenting services, education and employment opportunities, community activities, health services, and violence prevention resources.

\subsection{Context features and privacy}
\begin{figure}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/comfort.png}
    \caption{Responses to participant's privacy outlook - i.e. questions asking how comfortable they were with an app collecting data about their location, social media messages, text messages, moving speed, physical activity and sleep.}

    \Description{Responses to participant's privacy outlook - i.e. questions asking how comfortable they were with an app collecting data about their location, social media messages, text messages, moving speed, physical activity and sleep.

\end{figure}

Digital interventions often leverage contextual data, such as location, physical activity, and sleep patterns, to enhance personalization through adaptive algorithms. These algorithms rely on real-time data to deliver interventions tailored to users' behaviors, routines, and environments, making the experience more relevant and effective. However, integrating such data collection in apps like MiWaves must also address participants' privacy concerns and comfort levels to maintain trust and engagement. To inform future iterations of MiWaves, participants were asked about their comfort with an app collecting data across various contextual variables.

Figure \ref{fig:privacy} presents participants' responses to questions about their comfort levels with the collection of six specific types of data - namely location tracking, text messages, social media messages, movement speed (which could include traveling in vehicles), physical activity (e.g. step count, heart rate etc.) and sleep. Participants were asked to rate their comfort level (1 to 10) with 1 being not comfortable at all, and 10 being very comfortable. The findings reveal a nuanced outlook -- the majority of participants expressed discomfort with the collection of location data (mean = 3.46, SD = 1.05), text messages (mean = 2.81, SD = 1.16), and social media messages (mean = 2.49, SD = 1.24). This highlights a significant privacy concern around these sensitive forms of contextual data, indicating their use may not align with participantsâ€™ preferences in future iterations of MiWaves. Conversely, participants reported higher comfort levels with the collection of physical activity data (mean = 6.70, SD = 0.93) and sleep data (mean = 6.33, SD = 0.89). These findings suggest that participants were more open to sharing physiological or behavioral data compared to communication or location data.

% Interestingly, comfort levels for collecting data about speed of movement were more evenly distributed, with participants showing mixed reactions.

% \sg{Talk about future trials using a more complex context for personalization. Hence we asked participants about their outlook on which features they'd be more comfortable with }

\subsection{Expiring notifications and user experience}
The MiWaves intervention was designed with the intention that self-monitoring check-ins and MiWaves message notifications would expire after a set period. This decision was primarily made to clearly delineate time boundaries for post-study effect analysis, allowing researchers to more accurately understand the impact of each intervention. However, this design choice led to dissatisfaction among some participants who felt constrained by the expiration feature, especially when they missed opportunities to self-monitor or engage with messages.

$N=8$ participants explicitly remarked on the frustrations caused by expired check-ins or limited response windows. For instance, P102 stated, \emph{``that check ins expired too fast so i didnâ€™t get to fill them out even though i couldâ€™ve and i wanted to''}, emphasizing the rigidity of the design. Similarly, P40 noted, \emph{``Missing the time slot to do the checkin resulted in no data for that half of a day\ldots wish there was a way to still go in and enter the data''}. Another participant, P62, expressed, \emph{``if u missed a checkin you couldn't correct your data''} reflecting broader dissatisfaction with the inability to make amendments. Suggestions for addressing this issue were also provided by participants. P102 proposed, \emph{``Longer check-in periods that donâ€™t expire,''} while P71 suggested, \emph{``A longer gap in time to answer, 3 or 4 hours.''} Additional participants, such as P78 and P79, echoed similar sentiments, requesting \emph{``longer check-in windows''} and \emph{``longer periods that you could check in for.''} These responses indicate a clear preference for increased flexibility in response times, which could help reduce participant frustration and improve overall satisfaction.

While the expiration feature served an essential purpose for study analysis, participant feedback underscores the importance of balancing research goals with user experience. For future iterations of MiWaves, one could consider allowing participants to complete expired check-ins. To maintain the rigor of effect analysis, such retroactive entries could be excluded from decision-making algorithms and flagged separately during data analysis.
