\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose Spectral Truncation And Rescale (STAR) for model merging by removing noisy components via spectral decomposition and restoring the original nuclear norm through rescaling. STAR requires no additional inference and is robust to different hyperparameter choices and language models. STAR provides a principaled way of automatic rank determination and is intuitively complimentary to other merging methods.
