\textbf{Explainable Recommendation.}
Recommendation explanations are pivotal for improving user satisfaction and system transparency~\cite{zhang2020explainable}. 
Recently, natural language explainable recommendation has gained more attention, which generates explanations based on sequential models, such as GRU~\cite{li2020generate}, Transformer~\cite{li2021personalized}, and pre-trained language models~\cite{li2023personalized}.
To enhance explanation quality on specific aspects, some studies focus on modifying model architectures and training processes.
For example, integrating additional components to capture auxiliary information~\cite{cheng2023explainable,zhou2024enhancing},  
and employing techniques like contrastive learning~\cite{zhuang2024improving} and reinforcement learning~\cite{yang2024fine} for targeted training.
Recent studies also explore directly generating explanations by prompting LLMs~\cite{luo2023unlocking,raczynski2023problem,lei2024recexplainer}.
Unlike these methods, our work focuses on refining explanations produced by existing models in a post-hoc manner. 
While a recent study~\cite{qin2024beyond} investigates response refinement, our framework differs in task, scenario, and methodology.

\textbf{LLM-based Autonomous Agents.}
With advancements in large language models, LLM-based autonomous agents have gained significant attention~\cite{wang2024survey}, showcasing remarkable abilities in reasoning~\cite{yao2022react}, planning~\cite{shinn2024reflexion}, and tool use~\cite{schick2024toolformer}. 
Applications in this field can be divided into two categories:
The first focuses on assisting humans with complex tasks, such as software development~\cite{qian2023communicative} and role-playing in games~\cite{wang2023voyager}, while the second aims to simulate human behaviors in diverse scenarios~\cite{park2023generative,gao2023s,liu2023training}.
Several studies apply LLM-based agents to recommender systems.
Some improve recommendation performance by equipping agents with recommendation tools~\cite{huang2023recommender, zhang2024agentcf, wang2023recmind}.
Some simulate user behaviors in recommendation scenarios~\cite{zhang2024generative,wang2023user}.
In contrast to these studies, our work is the first to design an LLM-based agent framework specifically for generating recommendation explanations.
