\textbf{Explainable Recommendation.}
Recommendation explanations are pivotal for improving user satisfaction and system transparency____. 
Recently, natural language explainable recommendation has gained more attention, which generates explanations based on sequential models, such as GRU____, Transformer____, and pre-trained language models____.
To enhance explanation quality on specific aspects, some studies focus on modifying model architectures and training processes.
For example, integrating additional components to capture auxiliary information____,  
and employing techniques like contrastive learning____ and reinforcement learning____ for targeted training.
Recent studies also explore directly generating explanations by prompting LLMs____.
Unlike these methods, our work focuses on refining explanations produced by existing models in a post-hoc manner. 
While a recent study____ investigates response refinement, our framework differs in task, scenario, and methodology.

\textbf{LLM-based Autonomous Agents.}
With advancements in large language models, LLM-based autonomous agents have gained significant attention____, showcasing remarkable abilities in reasoning____, planning____, and tool use____. 
Applications in this field can be divided into two categories:
The first focuses on assisting humans with complex tasks, such as software development____ and role-playing in games____, while the second aims to simulate human behaviors in diverse scenarios____.
Several studies apply LLM-based agents to recommender systems.
Some improve recommendation performance by equipping agents with recommendation tools____.
Some simulate user behaviors in recommendation scenarios____.
In contrast to these studies, our work is the first to design an LLM-based agent framework specifically for generating recommendation explanations.
