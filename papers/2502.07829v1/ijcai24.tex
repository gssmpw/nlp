\begin{abstract}
% The integration of preference alignment with diffusion models has emerged as a transformative approach to enhance image generation and editing capabilities. However, cooperating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies present challenges for novices navigating this intersection. Meanwhile, comprehensive and systematic reviews on this topic remain scarce. This survey systematically reviews methodologies that utilize various methods for preference alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing key challenges such as text-image alignment, aesthetic coherence, and ethical considerations. By exploring state-of-the-art techniques like RLHF and DPO, we provide a comprehensive understanding of how these methods improve generative models to better align with human values and preferences. The survey also highlights applications across diverse domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, offering insights into current advancements and potential future directions. Our analysis lays the foundation for leveraging preference alignment in diffusion models, aiming to inspire further innovation in addressing real-world challenges.

The integration of preference alignment with diffusion models (DMs) has emerged as a transformative approach to enhance image generation and editing capabilities. Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.
