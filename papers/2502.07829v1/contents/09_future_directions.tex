\section{Challenges and Future Directions}
\label{sec:challenges_and_future_directions}
The field currently faces several fundamental challenges. 
The predominant pressing is the computational burden of preference fine-tuning, particularly in RLHF approaches that require loads of resources for both training and inference. 
This is along with the challenge of collecting high-quality human preference data, which is both time-consuming and expensive. 
Besides, maintaining semantic consistency while optimizing for multiple diverse objectives---such as image quality, text alignment, and aesthetic appeal---remains difficult. 
Furthermore, the subjective nature of human preferences also makes it challenging to design effective reward functions that can reliably capture and reproduce these preferences in scale.

Looking ahead, several promising directions emerge for advancing the field. 
One key area is developing more efficient fine-tuning methods that can reduce computational requirements while maintaining performance. 
This includes exploring parameter-efficient approaches like LoRA and techniques that can minimize the need for extensive human feedback. 
Another crucial direction is improving the integration of multiple modalities, particularly in combining text and image understanding to achieve better alignment with human preferences. 
This could involve taking the use of LLMs to better interpret and implement human preferences in image generation. The field is also moving toward more practical applications. 
There is growing interest in adapting these techniques for specific domains like medical imaging, autonomous driving, and robotics. 
This application-oriented direction requires more robust evaluation metrics and reliable models for real-world scenarios. 
Also, there is an increasing emphasis on making fine-tuning more interpretable and controllable, for a better understanding of how preferences affect generation and enabling more fine-grained control over different aspects of the output, respectively.

As these models grow more powerful and widely deployed, safety and ethical considerations become increasingly important. This includes developing evaluation metrics and approaches, to ensure alignment with human values, preventing misuse, and maintaining privacy and security during the fine-tuning process. Success in these areas will be essential milestones toward the responsible advancement of preference fine-tuning in DMs.
