\section{Conclusion}
We propose \methodname{}, a scalable and automatic annotation pipeline aimed to produce massive UI element functionality annotations used to enhance UI understanding capabilities of open-source VLMs. The pipeline prompts an open-source LLM to generate element functionalities based on the UI content changes induced by interacting with the elements. To guarantee high quality, LLM-aided rejection and verification are introduced to remove invalid samples. Fine-tuned with the data collected by \methodname{}, the base models obtain strong UI grounding ability and exhibit data scaling effects. We hope that \methodname{} will open up possibilities for advancing the field of general UI agents.
