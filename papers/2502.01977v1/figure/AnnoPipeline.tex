    \caption{\textbf{The proposed pipeline for automatic UI functionality annotation.} An LLM is utilized to predict element functionality based on the UI content changes observed during the interaction. LLM-aided rejection and verification are introduced to improve data quality. Finally, the high-quality functionality annotations will be converted to instruction-following data by applying task templates.}
