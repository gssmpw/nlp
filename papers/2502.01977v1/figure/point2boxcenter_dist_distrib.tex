    \caption{\textbf{Histograms of distances from predicted points to ground truth box centers.} The distance from the normalized coordinate of a predicted point to its corresponding GT box center is calculated for all samples. Then, the histograms of these distances are illustrated to demonstrate the growing grounding performances brought by scaling the AutoGUI data size. The averaged distance for each experiment is displayed on the subplot title.}
