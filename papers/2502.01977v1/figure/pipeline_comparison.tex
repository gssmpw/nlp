    \caption{\textbf{Comparing the proposed AutoGUI annotation pipeline with existing methods.} AutoGUI is able to manipulate real UIs and interact with elements hidden beneath deeper levels (e.g., the buttons hidden in collapsed dropdown menus), thereby collecting considerably rich element-functionality annotations from the immense UI resources on the Internet. In contrast, SeeClick~\cite{cheng2024seeclick} only uses static webpages and collects static element-text pairs. Likewise, CogAgent collects static element-HTML pairs while OmniAct generates Python scripts only for visible elements. These three existing methods can only annotate visible static UI elements and ignore the rich UI functional semantics entailed in interaction trajectories which are provided by our AutoGUI pipeline in abundance.}
