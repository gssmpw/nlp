\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
Task Type & Examples \\ \midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Grounding} & For the element I describe in this page capture, can you predict their positions (with point)? \{functionality\} \\
 & In this web page image, please locate the element as I describe it (with point). \{functionality\} \\
 & Given a screenshot, I will describe a specific element; your task is to predict their locations (with point). \{functionality\} \\ \midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Referring} & Describe the function of the element at \{point\} on the screen. \\
 & Detail the functionality of the UI element positioned at \{point\}. \\
 & What kind of input or interaction is expected at the point marked \{point\}? \\ \bottomrule
