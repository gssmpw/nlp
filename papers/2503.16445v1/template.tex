\abstract{%

In an era where black-box AI models are integral to decision-making across industries, robust methods for explaining these models are more critical than ever. While these models leverage complex feature interplay for accurate predictions, most explanation methods only assign relevance to individual features. There is a research gap in methods that effectively \emph{illustrate} interactions between features, especially in visualizing higher-order interactions involving multiple features, which challenge conventional representation methods.

To address this challenge in local explanations focused on individual instances, we employ a visual, subset-based approach to reveal relevant feature interactions. Our visual analytics tool \textsc{Finch} uses coloring and highlighting techniques to create intuitive, human-centered visualizations, and provides additional views that enable users to calibrate their trust in the model and explanations. 
We demonstrate \textsc{Finch} in multiple case studies, demonstrating its generalizability, and conducted an extensive human study with machine learning experts to highlight its helpfulness and usability.
With this approach, \textsc{Finch} allows users to visualize feature interactions involving any number of features locally.
