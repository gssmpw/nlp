In this paper, we presented GFNCP, a novel approach to amortized clustering that generates data assignments and their associated probabilities while accounting for point interactions and maintaining invariance to the order of the input data.

We showed that GFNCP outperforms existing methods in various tasks, in both clustering and consistency metrics.
