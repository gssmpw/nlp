\section*{Checklist}


% % %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references. For each question, choose your answer from the three possible options: Yes, No, Not Applicable.  You are encouraged to include a justification to your answer, either by referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline description (1-2 sentences). 
% Please do not modify the questions.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page limit. Not including the checklist in the first submission won't result in desk rejection, although in such case we will ask you to upload it during the author response period and include it in camera ready (if accepted).

% \textbf{In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.}
