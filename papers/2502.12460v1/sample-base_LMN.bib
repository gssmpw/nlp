abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for generating Attribute-based Access Control policies from a given Access Control Matrix (ACM). In contrast to the existing techniques for policy mining, which group the desired accesses in the ACM using certain heuristics, we pose it as a search problem in the policy space. A randomized algorithm is then used to identify the policy that best represents the given ACM. Our initial experiments show promising results.},

abstract = {In Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) systems, utilizing environment attributes along with the subject and object attributes introduces a dynamic nature to the access decisions. The inclusion of environment attributes helps in achieving a more fine-grained access control. In this paper, we present an ABAC policy mining algorithm that considers the environment attributes and their associated values while forming the rules. Furthermore, we use gini impurity to form the rules. This helps to minimize the number of rules in the generated policy. The experimental evaluation shows that our approach is quite effective in practice.},

abstract = {Access control policies (ACPs) are natural language statements that describe criteria under which users can access resources. We focus on constructing NIST Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) ABAC model from ACP statements. NGAC is more complex than RBAC or XACML ABAC as it supports dynamic, event-based policies, as well as prohibitions. We provide algorithms that use spaCy, a NLP library, to extract entities and relations from ACP sentences and convert them into the NGAC model. We then convert this NGAC model into Neo4j representation for the purpose of analysis. We apply the approach to various real-world ACP datasets to demonstrate the feasibility and assess scalability. We demonstrate that the approach is scalable and effectively extracts the NGAC ABAC model from large ACP datasets. We also show that redundancies and inconsistencies of ACP sentences are often found in unclean datasets.},

title = {Relation extraction for inferring access control rules from natural language artifacts},
year = {2014},
isbn = {9781450330053},
abstract = {With over forty years of use and refinement, access control, often in the form of access control rules (ACRs), continues to be a significant control mechanism for information security. However, ACRs are typically either buried within existing natural language (NL) artifacts or elicited from subject matter experts. To address the first situation, our research goal is to aid developers who implement ACRs by inferring ACRs from NL artifacts. To aid in rule inference, we propose an approach that extracts relations (i.e., the relationship among two or more items) from NL artifacts such as requirements documents. Unlike existing approaches, our approach combines techniques from information extraction and machine learning. We develop an iterative algorithm to discover patterns that represent ACRs in sentences. We seed this algorithm with frequently occurring nouns matching a subject--action--resource pattern throughout a document. The algorithm then searches for additional combinations of those nouns to discover additional patterns. We evaluate our approach on documents from three systems in three domains: conference management, education, and healthcare. Our evaluation results show that ACRs exist in 47\% of the sentences, and our approach effectively identifies those ACR sentences with a precision of 81\% and recall of 65\%; our approach extracts ACRs from those identified ACR sentences with an average precision of 76\% and an average recall of 49\%.},
