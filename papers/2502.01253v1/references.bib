    abstract = { Mobile devices have become the primary method of communication and information access for people around the world. Currently, most mobile applications create or consume data stored in standalone databases. This means most of these applications exist in silos without exploiting the potential of being linked with data collected from other applications or external data on the Web. The Web community has advocated the use of Linked Data technologies to address this issue for data interoperability on Web-based applications. Although we have seen some success from Web content publishers in using or publishing Linked Data, there are few examples to be found on mobile platforms. Our platform, developed as an extension of MIT App Inventor, bridges this gap by enabling developers to build mobile applications that can take advantage of Linked Data. The platform includes components for querying remote SPARQL endpoints, generating and storing triples from input and context, as well as enable crowd-sourcing of Linked Data through cloud based messaging. We believe that our platform will reduce the burden on mobile developers working with Linked Data and open up many opportunities for building mobile applications that interact with and contribute to the Linked Data world. },

abstract="Modern smartphones offer advanced sensing, connectivity, and processing capabilities for data acquisition, processing, and generation: but it can be difficult and costly to develop mobile research apps that leverage these features. Nevertheless, in life sciences and other scientific domains, there often exists a need to develop advanced mobile apps that go beyond simple questionnaires: ranging from sensor data collection and processing to self-management tools for chronic patients in healthcare. We present Punya, an open source, web-based platform based on MIT App Inventor that simplifies building Linked Data-enabled, advanced mobile apps that exploit smartphone capabilities. We posit that its integration with Linked Data facilitates the development of complex application and business rules, communication with heterogeneous online services, and interaction with the Internet of Things (IoT) data sources using the smartphone hardware. To that end, Punya includes an embedded semantic rule engine, integration with GraphQL and SPARQL to access remote graph data, and support for IoT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and Linked Data Platform Constrained Application Protocol (LDP-CoAP). Moreover, Punya supports generating Linked Data descriptions of collected data. The platform includes built-in tutorials to quickly build apps using these different technologies. In this paper, we present a short discussion of the Punya platform, its current adoption that includes over 500 active users as well as the larger app-building MIT App Inventor community of which it is a part, and future development directions that would greatly benefit Semantic Web and Linked Data application developers as well as researchers who leverage Linked Open Data resources for their research.",

End-user development environments, such as MIT Punya, can help lay users to better collaborate on mobile health apps; and even open the door for these users, given some training, to prototype their own mobile health apps.

These applications will also have the capability of empowering citizens involved in crisis situations to contribute via crowdsourcing, and to communicate up-to-date information to others. We will leverage several technologies to develop this application framework, namely (i) Linked Data principles for structured data, (ii) existing data sources and ontologies for disaster management, and (iii) App Inventor, which is a mobile application development framework for non-programmers.

abstract="Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can issue smart, context-sensitive recommendations to help patients self-manage their illnesses, including medication regimens, dietary habits, physical activity, and avoiding flare-ups. Instead of merely positing an ``edict,'' the AI model can also explain why the recommendation was issued: why one should stay indoors (e.g., increased risk of flare-ups), why further calorie intake should be avoided (e.g., met the daily limit), or why the care provider should be contacted (e.g., prescription change). The goal of these explanations is to achieve understanding and persuasion effects, which, in turn, targets education and long-term behavior change. Symbolic AI models facilitate explanations as they are able to offer logical proofs of inferences (or recommendations) from which explanations can be generated. We implemented a modular framework called XAIN (eXplanations for AI in Notation3) to explain symbolic reasoning inferences in a trace-based, contrastive, and counterfactual way. We applied this framework to explain recommendations for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to avoid flare-ups. For evaluation, we propose a questionnaire that captures understanding, persuasion, education, and behavior change, together with traditional XAI metrics including fidelity (soundness, completeness) and interpretability (parsimony, clarity).",

    abstract = { In the past decade, trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a focus for the AI community to ensure better adoption of AI models, and explainable AI is a cornerstone in this area. Over the years, the focus has shifted from building transparent AI methods to making recommendations on how to make black-box or opaque machine learning models and their results more understandable by experts and non-expert users. In our previous work, to address the goal of supporting user-centered explanations that make model recommendations more explainable, we developed an Explanation Ontology (EO). The EO is a general-purpose representation that was designed to help system designers connect explanations to their underlying data and knowledge. This paper addresses the apparent need for improved interoperability to support a wider range of use cases. We expand the EO, mainly in the system attributes contributing to explanations, by introducing new classes and properties to support a broader range of state-of-the-art explainer models. We present the expanded ontology model, highlighting the classes and properties that are important to model a larger set of fifteen literature-backed explanation types that are supported within the expanded EO. We build on these explanation type descriptions to show how to utilize the EO model to represent explanations in five use cases spanning the domains of finance, food, and healthcare. We include competency questions that evaluate the EO’s capabilities to provide guidance for system designers on how to apply our ontology to their own use cases. This guidance includes allowing system designers to query the EO directly and providing them exemplar queries to explore content in the EO represented use cases. We have released this significantly expanded version of the Explanation Ontology at https://purl.org/heals/eo and updated our resource website, https://tetherless-world.github.io/explanation-ontology, with supporting documentation. Overall, through the EO model, we aim to help system designers be better informed about explanations and support these explanations that can be composed, given their systems’ outputs from various AI models, including a mix of machine learning, logical and explainer models, and different types of data and knowledge available to their systems. }

abstract = {Medical experts may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems with greater trust if these are supported by ‘contextual explanations’ that let the practitioner connect system inferences to their context of use. However, their importance in improving model usage and understanding has not been extensively studied. Hence, we consider a comorbidity risk prediction scenario and focus on contexts regarding the patients’ clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We explore how relevant information for such dimensions can be extracted from Medical guidelines to answer typical questions from clinical practitioners. We identify this as a question answering (QA) task and employ several state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) to present contexts around risk prediction model inferences and evaluate their acceptability. Finally, we study the benefits of contextual explanations by building an end-to-end AI pipeline including data cohorting, AI risk modeling, post-hoc model explanations, and prototyped a visual dashboard to present the combined insights from different context dimensions and data sources, while predicting and identifying the drivers of risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - a common type-2 diabetes (T2DM) comorbidity. All of these steps were performed in deep engagement with medical experts, including a final evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show that LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract some relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the value-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these regarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting. Overall, our paper is one of the first end-to-end analyses identifying the feasibility and benefits of contextual explanations in a real-world clinical use case. Our findings can help improve clinicians’ usage of AI models.}

abstract="Explainability has been a goal for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems since their conception, with the need for explainability growing as more complex AI models are increasingly used in critical, high-stakes settings such as healthcare. Explanations have often added to an AI system in a non-principled, post-hoc manner. With greater adoption of these systems and emphasis on user-centric explainability, there is a need for a structured representation that treats explainability as a primary consideration, mapping end user needs to specific explanation types and the system's AI capabilities. We design an explanation ontology to model both the role of explanations, accounting for the system and user attributes in the process, and the range of different literature-derived explanation types. We indicate how the ontology can support user requirements for explanations in the domain of healthcare. We evaluate our ontology with a set of competency questions geared towards a system designer who might use our ontology to decide which explanation types to include, given a combination of users' needs and a system's capabilities, both in system design settings and in real-time operations. Through the use of this ontology, system designers will be able to make informed choices on which explanations AI systems can and should provide.",
