\section{Conclusion}
We proposed \mname, an LLM-based framework for validating free-form hypotheses. 
By integrating a sequential testing paradigm with automated experiment design and execution, \mname delivers scalable, statistically rigorous hypothesis validation. This work represents an early exploration, and several aspects can be further improved.
Refining test relevance and ensuring robust LLM implementations remain challenges. 
Future work can also extend \mname to control other error metrics (e.g., false discovery rate), further broadening its utility in scientific discovery and beyond.
