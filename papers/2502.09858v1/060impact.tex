This work introduces \mname, a statistically rigorous agentic framework for hypothesis validation using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. By combining advanced natural language processing capabilities with robust statistical methodologies, \mname addresses the critical challenge of evaluating and validating hypotheses generated by LLMs, ensuring that only evidence-backed hypotheses guide future research. The broader implications of this work span multiple domains, including biology, economics, and social sciences, where hypothesis generation and validation play a pivotal role in advancing knowledge.

From an ethical perspective, \mname's emphasis on rigorous statistical validation and Type-I error control mitigates the risks associated with hallucinated or unsupported hypotheses. This ensures that research resources are directed toward meaningful and plausible hypotheses, reducing the potential for wasted efforts and false conclusions that could mislead scientific progress or policy decisions. Additionally, by automating and accelerating the hypothesis validation process, \mname democratizes access to high-quality scientific methodologies, enabling smaller research teams and resource-limited institutions to conduct advanced analyses.
