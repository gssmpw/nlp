\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:valid}}
\label{app:proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:valid}]
    Throughout, we condition on the training process of the LLM agents. Under Assumptions~\ref{assump:hypo} and~\ref{assump:evalue}, each e-value also obeys $\mathbb{E}[e_i\given \mathcal{D}_{i-1}]\leq 1$ under $H_0$ since $H_0$ implies $h_i^0$ for each $i\geq 1$.  
    Define $E_i=\prod_{s=1}^{i}e_s$ as the aggregated evidence at each iteration $i\geq 1$, and $E_0=1$. Also, recall that  $\mathcal{F}_i = \sigma(\mathcal{D}_i)$ is the filtration in Assumption~\ref{assump:stopping}. Then, we have  
    $$
    \mathbb{E}[E_i \given \mathcal{F}_{i-1}] = E_{i-1}  \cdot  \mathbb{E}[e_i \given \mathcal{F}_{i-1}] \leq E_{i-1},
    $$
    where we use the takeout property and the fact that $E_{i-1}$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_{i-1}$. 
    In addition, it is clear that $E_i$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_i$. Therefore, $\{E_i\}_{i\geq 1}$ is a non-negative super-martingale adapted to the filteration $\{\mathcal{F}_i\}_{i\geq 1}$. Applying Doob's optional stopping theorem, we know that for any stopping time $\tau$ adapted to the filteration $\{\mathcal{F}_i\}_{i\geq 1}$, $E:= E_{\tau}$ obeys $\mathbb{E}[E]\leq E_0 =1$ under $H_0$. Finally, by Markov's inequality, we know that $\mathbb{P}(\hat{y}=1) = \mathbb{P}(E\geq 1/\alpha) \leq \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[E]\leq \alpha$ under $H_0$, thus completing the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:valid}. 
\end{proof}


\section{Full related works}\label{appedix:related}

\paragraph{Philosophy of science}
The philosophical foundations of hypothesis validation are rooted in debates about the nature of scientific inquiry. Central to our framework is Karl Popper's falsificationism~\cite{popper1959logic}, which argues that scientific hypotheses cannot be definitively proven but can only be refuted through empirical tests. While Popper emphasized iterative falsification, critiques such as those synthesized in Agassi~\cite{agassi2014popper} highlight tensions between his ideas and those of contemporaries like Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn's paradigm shifts~\cite{kuhn1962structure} challenged falsificationism by emphasizing the sociotechnical embeddedness of scientific progress, a perspective further refined by Lakatos' methodology of scientific research programmes\cite{lakatos1978methodology}. Lakatos' framework, which evaluates hypotheses within evolving theoretical systems, aligns with our treatment of auxiliary assumptions (e.g., dataset relevance) as prerequisites for testing, as discussed in~\cite{lakatos2023bridge}.
Modern critiques, such as Rubin~\cite{rubin2025replication}, argue that Lakatos' approach mitigates challenges like the replication crisis by emphasizing progressive problem shifts over strict falsification. Similarly, van Fraassen's constructive empiricism~\cite{vanfraassen1980scientific}, which prioritizes empirical adequacy over ontological truth, mirrors our focus on observable implications rather than abstract claims. Goodman's ``grue" paradox~\cite{goodman1983fact}, which interrogates inductive reasoning, underscores the epistemic risks inherent in generalizing from data-risks our framework pragmatically addresses through statistical safeguards like e-values.
Maxwell~\cite{maxwell2012popper} positions aim-oriented empiricism as a synthesis of Popperian, Kuhnian, and Lakatosian ideas, advocating for explicit epistemic aims in scientific practice. This resonates with our adaptive sequential testing paradigm, which balances empirical rigor with iterative refinement. While our framework abstracts sociotechnical dimensions noted in Kuhn and Lakatos, the need for transparency in automated systems echoes their emphasis on communal validation~\cite{webpage10}.
By integrating these perspectives, \mname bridges classical philosophy of science and modern data-driven inquiry, offering a scalable yet philosophically grounded approach to hypothesis validation.



\paragraph{LLM for hypothesis generation.} 
Many methods have used LLM to generate novel research ideas. For example, \citet{wang2024scimonscientificinspirationmachines},\citet{baek2024researchagentiterativeresearchidea}, and \citet{yang2024largelanguagemodelsautomated} propose methods for generating creative, domain-specific research ideas. \citet{si2024llmsgeneratenovelresearch} conducted large-scale human studies comparing AI-generated research ideas with those from experts. 
Moving beyond ideas, many also explore hypothesis generation with LLMs with a focus in the commonsense domains \cite{gendron2024largelanguagemodelsstrong, yang2024languagemodelsinductivereasoners, moskvichev2023conceptarcbenchmarkevaluatingunderstanding, mirchandani2023largelanguagemodelsgeneral, tang2023largelanguagemodelsincontext, xu2024largelanguagemodelsreally, han2023inductivereasoninghumanslarge, xu2024llmsabstractionreasoningcorpus, pmlr-v139-alet21a, webb2023emergentanalogicalreasoninglarge}. Notably, \citet{honovich-etal-2023-instruction} explores LLMs' capabilities in inducing rules from example demonstrations. \citet{qiu2024phenomenalpuzzlingtestinginductive} and \citet{wang2024hypothesissearchinductivereasoning} further extends this idea to generating and iteratively refining candidate hypotheses from a set of examples or observations. \cite{majumder2024discoverybench} grounds hypothesis generation with a given dataset and a question. However, these works focus on hypothesis generation rather than rigorous validation. \mname is complementary to this line of research as it takes in a hypothesis (generated from either LLM or human) and develops a systematic, data-driven process for evaluating whether a hypothesis withstands statistical scrutiny.


\paragraph{LLM for hypothesis testing and experiments.} 
To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that investigates rigorous validation of a free-form hypothesis grounded with data using AI agent. Some studies have tested LLMs' abilities to implement experiments as a form of validation. For example, \citet{tian2024scicoderesearchcodingbenchmark} and \citet{gu2024bladebenchmarkinglanguagemodel} evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities in executing experimental protocols. While these works focus narrowly on code generation, \mname presents a framework for validating natural language-based free-form hypothesis. Additionally, prior research into automated scientific discovery has explored combining hypothesis and code generation for end-to-end workflows \citep{li2024mlrcopilotautonomousmachinelearning, lu2024aiscientistfullyautomated, ifargan2024autonomousllmdrivenresearchdata,majumder2024discoverybench}. While these studies focus on automation, they often lack rigorous statistical grounding. In contrast, \mname focuses on the hypothesis testing component and incorporates robust Type-I error control, ensuring the reliability and scientific rigor of its results. \cite{li2024critical} (CriticAL) used LLMs to identify and evaluate discrepancies between model predictions and data through hypothesis testing. While CriticAL focuses on validating statistical predefined models, \mname tackles the challenge of validating free-form natural language hypotheses with a sequential falsification framework.


\paragraph{LLM for automating research.} LLMs have also been used for several other research-related tasks, including automated review generation \cite{darcy2024margmultiagentreviewgeneration, liang2023largelanguagemodelsprovide}, related work curation \cite{ajith2024litsearchretrievalbenchmarkscientific, press2024citemelanguagemodelsaccurately}, experiment outcome predictions \cite{manning2024automatedsocialsciencelanguage, zhang2024masswnewdatasetbenchmark, lehr2024chatgptresearchscientistprobing}, and future work recommendations \cite{zhang2024masswnewdatasetbenchmark}. While these are interesting applications, our work focuses on hypothesis testing.


\section{Limitations}

\paragraph{Type-I error v.s.~false discoveries.} We view hypothesis validation with \mname as an initial step towards rigorous automatic scientific discovery. One limitation of our current framework arises from the limitation of Type-I error as an error criterion for scientific discovery. Let us denote rejecting the null as a ``discovery'', and it is a \emph{true discovery} if the alternative holds. 
The shortcoming of Type-I error control is that it does not necessarily imply the discoveries are true (which is more pronounced when \mname is used to validate many hypotheses). 
Awareness of this issue emerged much later than the appearance of concept of Type-I error, but has been quite important nowadays in the fields of hypothesis testing, selective inference, and replicability~\citep{ioannidis2005most,open2015estimating,benjamini2020selective}. To see this point, consider an extreme case where all hypotheses being passed on to \mname are null ones. Then, the Type-I error control only implies that we reject each hypothesis with no greater than a chance of $\alpha$, but every discovery, once made, must be false. Therefore, we stress   that one should be cautious in interprating the validated hypotheses by \mname as true discoveries to act upon.

In the following, we discuss possible extended uses of \mname for more advanced error critria on false discoveries. Consider using \mname to validate $M\geq 1$ (abstract) hypotheses. The family-wise-error-rate (FWER) is the probability of making any false discovery; FWER control at level $\alpha\in (0,1)$ can be achieved by Bonferroni's correction, i.e., running \mname for each hypothesis at level $\alpha/M$ and gather all rejected null hypothesis. A more liberal criterion is the false discovery rate (FDR)~\cite{benjamini1995controlling}, which is the average fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries. The FDR is suitable for measuring the wastage of follow-up resources on validated (rejected) hypotheses. Since our framework produces a valid e-value $E_\tau$ for each hypothesis, these e-values can be readily used to derive a set of validated hypotheses with FDR control by employing the eBH procedure~\citep{wang2022false}. However, these use cases are beyond the scope of this work, and we leave the evaluation and further developments of such capabilities of \mname for future investigation. 


\section{Error analysis}\label{appendix:error_analysis}
In this section, we provide insights into the common failure modes of \mname. We first manually inspected 20 randomly sampled failed experiment logs produced by \mname, and created a list of 10 possible failure categories based on the model's behaviors. Table~\ref{tab:failure_types} provides detailed definitions of the 10 failure categories. Then, we collected a total of 128 failed experiment logs from benchmark runs across \emph{TargetVal-IFNG}, \emph{TargetVal-IL2}, and \emph{DiscoveryBench}. We then query a reasoning LLM (OpenAI O1) with the failed trajectory logs, the agent's incorrect conclusion, and the ground truth conclusion to automatically categorize each failed experiment into one or more failure modes described in Table~\ref{tab:failure_types}. We manually checked 30 labeled experiment logs for quality assurance. 93.3\% of O1's labels aligned with human judgment. According to Figure~\ref{fig:failure_distributions}, 35.9\% of the failures accompany the agent misinterpreting the context for p-values. 28.1\% and 17.2\% of the errors occur when the agent fails to find effective falsification tests or uses tests that breaks implication. 8.6\% and 7.0\% of the errors are caused by incorrect test implementation and failure to locate relevant data. It is worth noting that we only observed 1 instance of hallucination across 128 failure cases, and no signs of p-hacking were observed.

\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}l|X@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Failure Type} & \textbf{Definition} \\ 
\midrule
Falsification Test Breaks Implication & The agent selects falsification tests that are not logically implied by the main hypothesis. This occurs when the falsification sub-hypothesis could be true even if the main hypothesis is false, leading to irrelevant p-values and misleading results. \\
\midrule
Ineffective Test Selection & The agent fails to identify or design falsification tests that are capable of effectively addressing the main hypothesis, resulting in weak or inconclusive evidence. \\
\midrule
Malformed Falsification Test & The design of the falsification test is flawed. For example, the test assesses an alternative sub-hypothesis that contradict the main hypothesis, or lack a clear framework for accepting or rejecting the null sub-hypothesis. \\
\midrule
Incorrect Test Implementation & The agent incorrectly implements the falsification test. While the test appears to execute successfully, it contains undetected bugs or methodological errors that result in invalid or misleading p-values and conclusions. \\
\midrule
P-Hacking & The agent manipulate data analysis, experimental procedures, or selectively report results to artificially achieve statistically significant p-values, leading to misleading conclusion. \\
\midrule
Misinterpreted P-Value & The agent misinterprets or overlooks important context when analyzing p-values. This includes failing to recognize invalid p-values, ignoring assumptions of the statistical test, or drawing incorrect conclusions from the results. \\
\midrule
Hallucination & The agent generates data entries, data interpretations, assumptions, observations, p-values, or conclusions that are fabricated or not grounded in the provided data or context. \\
\midrule
Failed to Recover from Test Errors & The agent encounters errors during test execution and fails to recover or adapt. This may result in the agent repeating the same errors or becoming stuck in an unproductive loop of failed tests. \\
\midrule
Failed to Locate Relevant Data & The agent is unable to identify, retrieve, or preprocess the necessary data required for conducting critical falsification tests, preventing effective hypothesis evaluation. \\
\midrule
Other & There was some other problem that prevented the agent from arriving at the correct conclusion. \\

\end{table}

\section{Tests and trajectory analysis} \label{appendix:test_analysis}
In this section, we detail how we categorized the statistical and domain-specific tests performed by \mname during falsification experiments, as well as how we summarized the agent's trajectories for executing each falsification test, as visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:test_distribution}.

We parsed and sampled 1500 falsification test designs and their execution logs, and then asked GPT-4o to identify and group the statistical tests performed in the falsification experiments.

We limit our analysis of domain-specific tests to biological hypotheses only, as we have an abundance of biological hypotheses from \emph{TargetVal} benchmark. The other five domains provided by \emph{DiscoveryBench} contains limited number of unique hypotheses per domain, and the analysis does not converge. We sampled 462 falsification tests proposed by the experiment design agent and used GPT-4o to extract and group them into standardized biological tests.

For agent trajectories, we first manually inspected the behaviors of the experiment execution agent over 20 experiments and summarized a list of 11 possible high-level actions taken by the agent. Detailed definitions of these actions are listed in Table~\ref{tab:action_names}. We then randomly sampled 80 trajectories of the experiment execution agent, and prompted GPT-4o to convert each trajectory into a list of high-level actions as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:action_names}. We observe that the agent's workflow closely mirrors that of a human data analyst. It begins by inspecting the dataset and assembling relevant information, then proceeds with a cycle of test implementation, execution, and iterative error resolution. Upon observing the test results, the agent may optionally check validity criteria (e.g., model assumptions and sample sizes) and refine its approach if necessary. Finally, the agent compiles all findings into a summary to draw a final conclusion.

\section{Human study details} \label{appendix:human_study}
We recruited 11 computational biologists and bioinformaticians (PhD holders or candidates) for our human study, and 9 adhered. Each participant was asked to complete a short questionnaire on their educational background and relevant experience (Listing~\ref{lst:questionnaire}). We present the background distributions of recruited participants in Figure~\ref{fig:demo}. Of the 9 participants, 6 hold (or are pursuing) a PhD, 1 holds a Master's degree, and 2 are postdoctoral researchers. In terms of experience with data analysis and coding for genetic and genomic data, 2 participants identified as beginners, 1 as intermediate, and 6 as experts. Regarding familiarity with statistical hypothesis testing, 2 participants identified as beginners, 2 as intermediate, and 5 as experts. Finally, 6 participants reported that they have never performed wet-lab experiments, while 3 indicated having done so.

We sampled a total of 18 tasks from the TargetVal-IL2 benchmark to evaluate the Type-I error (9 tasks) and statistical power (9 tasks) of our method. Each participant was randomly assigned two tasks to complete. To prevent inference of one hypothesis from the other, a participant might receive two positive, two null, or one positive and one null hypothesis. Participants were free to use the internet or large language models for general coding questions (e.g., library usage, syntax) and statistical tests, but not to query the specific biological hypothesis directly. All conclusions were to be derived solely from the data provided in the TargetVal-IL2 benchmark, with each hypothesis tested at significance level $\alpha = 0.1$. All work was documented in Jupyter Notebooks.

\section{Human Annotation Details}
\label{appendix:human_annotations}
We randomly sampled 90 falsification test proposals from the three benchmarks. Each of the three annotators first individually annotated a common set of 20 proposals using the same 0.1-1.0 rubric as the Relevance Checker \ref{lst:relevance_checker_prompt}. The annotators then discuss and calibrate their decisions and independently annotate 10 more proposals after the calibration. The annotators achieved a Kendall's $W$ of 0.62 before the calibration, and 0.91 post calibration. Finally, each annotator individually annotate a separate set of 20 falsification proposals. The human annotators and the relevance checker agent achieved a Kendall's Tau of 0.43 ($p=1e-06$) and Spearman's correlation of 0.55 ($p=5e-6$). The relevance checker agent ranked 84\% of the proposed falsification tests as "Strongly Relevant" (score $>=$ 0.8), whereas human annotators ranked 77\% of the test proposals as "Strongly Relevant".

\section{Qualitative Analysis}
This section provides qualitative analysis on one successful falsification trajectory and one failure case trajectory on the \emph{TargetVal-IL2} benchmark.

Figure~\ref{fig:example_trajectory} presents an example trajectory of \mname running on a \emph{TargetVal-IL2} hypothesis. We can see the agent attempted multiple rounds of diverse falsification experiments, including expression correlation analysis, LCP2 regulatory network analysis, LCP2 variant-immune phenotype association test, and LCP2 eQTL-IL2 regulatory region test. \mname performs sequential error control to rigorously aggregate the evidence from all four experiments, and then rejects the main null hypothesis as the summarized sequential statistics (i.e., cumulated e-values) passes our alpha-threshold of 0.1. 

We observe that the experiment design agent autonomously refines its proposal to enhance the implication strength and feasibility of the proposed falsification experiment. The experiment execution agent iteratively inspects and interacts with multiple data sources to evaluate the feasibility of the experiment, before implementing and conducting the statistical tests. The experiment execution agent also shows attempts to account for model assumptions and inspect the validity of test statistics before arriving at a final conclusion (e.g., Round 3). We note that with rigorous Type I error control, \mname also provides more tolerance and leniency for test execution failures. Notice that in Round 1, the experiment execution agent incorrectly concluded that LCP2 and IL2 are not present in the datasets. However, benefiting from the sequential falsification frameowkr, \mname is eventually able to reach the correct conclusion after multiple experiment trials.

Figure~\ref{fig:failed_trajectory} shows an example false positive trajectory on \emph{TargetVal-IL2}. The critical error lies in Round 3, where the experiment design agent proposes to test whether "genetic variants near RAB39A are significant QTLs for IL-2 related immune phenotypes," but the experiment execution agent only looked at eQTLs for RAB39A expression in neutrophils, a cell type that may or may not produce IL-2. The agent then converts the eQTL score to a highly significant p-value for "RAB39A expression in neutrophils", but it does not imply that RAB39A regulates IL-2. Hence, while the proposed falsification experiment is valid, the implementation of the test violates the implication assumption. We categorize this failure case as "Incorrect Test Implementation", and "Misinterpreted P-Value". Overall, we found that understanding and reasoning about the context and validity of effect sizes and p-values remains to be a main challenge for \mname.


\section{Prompting Details}

Listings~\ref{lst:coding_agent_prompt}, \ref{lst:statistical_agent_prompt}, \ref{lst:relevance_checker_prompt}, \ref{lst:summarizer_prompt}, and \ref{lst:estimation_prompt} detail the prompts used for different modules of \mname.

You are an expert statistician specialized in the field of {domain}. You are tasked to validate rigorously if a {domain} hypothesis H is true by implementing an falsification test proposed by the user. 

You should write code to implement the falsification test. 
The test should be relevant to the main hypothesis and aims to falsify it. 
The test should use the available data described below, and use data processing, extraction, and perform statistical analysis to produce a p-value measuring the falsification of the main hypothesis. 
The test should be extremely rigorous. The p-value should be theoretically grounded.
The code should be clear, concise, and efficient. Do progress bar when necessary. It will have a time limit, so please be efficient. For example, if possible, you can set the number of permutations to be small (e.g. <1000).
The code should be self-contained, and do not need additional modifications from user.

You have access to the following pandas dataframe tables, where each table, it shows the precise column names and a preview of column values:

\begin{figure*}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={System Prompt For Statistical Agent}, label={lst:statistical_agent_prompt}, captionpos=b]
Given a {domain} hypothesis "{main_hypothesis}", your goal is to propose a novel falsification test given the available {domain} data sources. 
A falsification test is a test that can potentially falsify the main hypothesis. 
The outcome of the falsification test is to return a p-value that measures the evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.

Notably, the falsification test should satisfy the following property: if the main hypotheiss is null, then the falsification sub-hypothesis should also be null. 

Here are the list of available data sources, and you can directly call the dataframe as it has already been loaded; no need to load from file path. Each is a pandas dataframe with columns and example rows:

{data}

For the final test, return
(1) Name: name of the test
(2) Test description: be clear and concise. Describe the falsification outcomes.
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: what is the statistical null sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: what is the statistical alternative sub-hypothesis does this falsification test aim to test?

Here are the falsification tests that you've created in the previous rounds and their corresponding test results:

"""
{existing_falsification_test}
"""

You may use these information to formulate your next subhypothesis and falsification test, but make sure the proposed falsification test is non-redundant with any of the existing tests.

The proposed test should also avoid these failed falsification tests in the previous rounds:

"""
{failed_falsification_test}
"""

A good falsification test should serve as a strong evidence for the main hypothesis. However, make sure it is answerable with the given available data sources.
You should aim to maximize the implication strength of the proposed falsification test using the relevant parts of the provided data.

First produce an initial falsification test proposal.

Then, in each round i, you will do the following:
(1) critic: ask if the main hypothesis is null, is this test also null? be rigorous. this is super important, otherwise, the test is invalid. Is it redundant on capabilities with existing tests? Is it overlapping with failed tests? Can this be answered and implemented based on the given data? 
(2) reflect: how to improve this test definition. 

If you think the test definition is good enough, return the final test definition to the user. 
If not, either refine the test definition that is better than the previous one or propose a new test definition, then go to the next round.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Relevance Checker System Prompt}, label={lst:relevance_checker_prompt}, captionpos=b]
Given a main hypothesis and a proposed sub-hypothesis test, assess the relevance of this sub-hypothesis test to the main hypothesis. Use the following rubric to guide your response, providing a score from 0.1 to 1.0 and a brief justification for the score. Each score level represents a different degree of relevance based on evidence strength, mechanistic connection, and predictive value of the test results.

Rubric:

1.0 - Highly Relevant: The sub-hypothesis provides direct evidence or a clear mechanistic insight that strongly supports or refutes the main hypothesis. The test is specific to variables or mechanisms involved in the main hypothesis, with significant predictive value.
0.8 - Strongly Relevant: The test addresses a major component of the main hypothesis, providing substantial supporting or refuting evidence, and shows strong mechanistic alignment. The results would significantly impact the confidence in the main hypothesis.
0.6 - Moderately Relevant: The test examines elements supporting the main hypothesis without direct mechanistic insight. Some aspects align with the main hypothesis, offering moderate predictive value.
0.4 - Slightly Relevant: The test is related to the main hypothesis but provides limited direct evidence. It explores loosely associated variables and has minimal predictive value.
0.2 - Barely Relevant: The test is tangentially related, providing minimal information that could impact the main hypothesis, with no clear mechanistic link and negligible predictive value.
0.1 - Irrelevant: The sub-hypothesis does not provide relevant evidence or mechanistic connection to the main hypothesis, with no predictive value.

Instructions:

	1.	Read the main hypothesis and the sub-hypothesis test carefully.
	2.	Choose the relevance score from the rubric that best matches the relationship.
	3.	Explain your reasoning for selecting this score, referring to evidence strength, mechanistic connection, and predictive value of the sub-hypothesis test results.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={E-Value Estimation Agent System Prompt}, label={lst:estimation_prompt}, captionpos=b]
Given a scientific hypothesis H, you have designed a sub-hypothesis test h to falsify the main hypothesis. You have also collected evidence from data for the null hypothesis (h_0) and the alternative hypothesis (h_1).

Your goal is to:
1. Estimate the probability of this evidence under the alternative hypothesis, P(data|h_1).
2. Estimate the probability of this evidence under the null hypothesis, P(data|h_0).

Follow this rigorous rubric to evaluate estimation precision, focusing on both theoretical grounding and accuracy in likelihood estimation:

- **0.1**: Extremely poor estimate, lacks theoretical grounding; estimation is inconsistent with evidence and does not consider hypothesis structure.
- **0.2**: Poor estimate; limited theoretical basis, fails to account for evidence specifics, and overlooks key elements of hypothesis testing.
- **0.3**: Weak estimate, marginally considers evidence but lacks appropriate statistical measures or fails to apply probability theory accurately.
- **0.4**: Below average; applies some basic probability theory but lacks rigor, poorly models the relationship between evidence and hypothesis.
- **0.5**: Average estimate; applies probability theory minimally, captures some evidence but with limited specificity to the hypothesis context.
- **0.6**: Above average; uses sound statistical principles, somewhat models the evidence-hypothesis relationship, but with notable gaps or simplifications.
- **0.7**: Good estimate; well-grounded in theory, evidence is modeled with reasonable accuracy but lacks precision or depth in interpretation.
- **0.8**: Very good estimate; rigorous application of probability theory, models evidence in the context of hypothesis well, with minor limitations in capturing uncertainty or alternative explanations.
- **0.9**: Excellent estimate; highly accurate, theoretically sound, robustly interprets evidence under hypothesis, addressing key uncertainties and incorporating evidence nuances.
- **1.0**: Perfect estimate; fully grounded in advanced probability theory, comprehensive and precise, accurately modeling all aspects of evidence given the hypothesis, leaving no uncertainties unaddressed.

---
**Process**:
- First, produce an initial estimate proposal.
- In each round i, perform the following steps:
    1. **Critique**: Evaluate the estimation's reasonableness, theoretical rigor, and alignment with this rubric.
    2. **Reflect**: Identify specific improvements to enhance accuracy and theoretical grounding based on critique.
- If the estimation achieves a rigorous standard (e.g., reaching 0.9 or 1.0), return the final estimates:
    - P(data|h_1) = [final value]
    - P(data|h_0) = [final value]
- If refinement is needed, improve or propose a new estimation, then proceed to the next round.

INITIAL PROPOSAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Name of the Test:
"Tissue-Wide Expression Correlation Test between GRAP2 and IL-2"

(2) Test Description:
Using the GTEx expression data (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm), compute the correlation between GRAP2 and IL-2 transcript levels across all tissues for which both genes have measured TPM. If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2, we would expect a consistent positive or negative correlation across multiple tissues, reflecting regulatory coupling. A standard correlation test (e.g., Pearson's or Spearman's) can be performed for each tissue, and these can then be combined or meta-analyzed to return an overall p-value testing whether the correlation significantly differs from zero.

(3) Null Sub-Hypothesis h_0:
"There is no systematic correlation between GRAP2 and IL-2 expression across tissues."  
If the main hypothesis (that GRAP2 regulates IL-2) is null (i.e., GRAP2 does not regulate IL-2), then we would not expect a meaningful correlation of their transcript levels across tissues.

(4) Alternative Sub-Hypothesis h_1:
"There is a significant correlation between GRAP2 and IL-2 expression across tissues."  
If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2, we would expect a consistent correlation (positive or negative) in expression across multiple tissues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROUND 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) CRITIC:
• If the main hypothesis "Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of IL-2" is null (i.e., false), then indeed we would expect no biology-driven correlation of expression between GRAP2 and IL-2. Hence, under the main null, the sub-hypothesis that "GRAP2 and IL-2 are correlated across tissues" should also be null. This satisfies the requirement that the falsification sub-hypothesis becomes null under the main null.  
• This is not redundant with any existing tests, since there are "No Implemented Falsification Test Yet."  
• The GTEx expression dataframe (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm) is available, and even though the user's example line did not explicitly show GRAP2 or IL-2, the complete dataset should include expression measures for both. Thus, this test is answerable with the provided data stream.

(2) REFLECTION:
The test meets all criteria:  
• It is a direct investigation of the regulatory link between GRAP2 and IL-2.  
• It uses available or presumed-available GTEx expression data (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm).  
• It can yield a formal p-value to quantify whether correlation is observed.  
• It is non-redundant and not overlapping with invalid or failed tests.

No further refinement appears necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL TEST DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Name:
"Tissue-Wide Expression Correlation Test between GRAP2 and IL-2"

(2) Test Description:
Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, extract the TPM measurements of GRAP2 and IL-2 across all available tissues. Compute the correlation in each tissue and/or perform an overall meta-correlation analysis across tissues. A significant nonzero correlation would suggest regulatory coupling consistent with GRAP2 modulating IL-2. A lack of correlation would serve as evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.

(3) Null Sub-Hypothesis h_0:
"No correlation exists between GRAP2 and IL-2 across tissues."

Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2).

 Falsification Test description: Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, extract the TPM measurements of GRAP2 and IL-2 across all available tissues.

 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: A significant correlation exists between GRAP2 and IL-2 across tissues. 
 
Relevance score 0.8 

Reasoning: The tissue-wide correlation test directly examines whether GRAP2 and IL-2 expressions align across multiple tissues. While correlation is not definitive proof of causation, a strong and consistent correlation would be substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that GRAP2 influences IL-2 production. Thus, the test strongly addresses a key element of the main hypothesis, though it does not alone provide a complete mechanistic explanation.

INITIAL PROPOSAL FOR A NEW FALSIFICATION TEST

Name (tentative): "Tissue-Specific Expression Contrast Test for GRAP2 in High- vs. Low IL-2 Expressing Tissues"

Test Description (tentative):  
1. From df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, identify tissues with relatively high IL-2 expression and those with relatively low (or no) IL-2 expression.  
2. Compare GRAP2 expression levels between these two groups of tissues (e.g., via a two-sample t-test).  
3. If GRAP2 truly helps regulate IL-2, one would expect significantly higher GRAP2 expression in tissues where IL-2 is robustly expressed.  
4. Failure to observe this difference would be potential evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.

Null Sub-Hypothesis h_0 (tentative):  
"GRAP2 expression does not differ between tissues that are high IL-2 expressers versus those that are low IL-2 expressers."

Alternate Sub-Hypothesis h_1 (tentative):  
"GRAP2 expression is significantly higher (or lower) in tissues with higher IL-2 expression than in low-IL-2 tissues."

────────────────────────────────────────────
ROUND 1
────────────────────────────────────────────

1) CRITICISM:

• Does the test become null if the main hypothesis ("Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2") is null?  
    If GRAP2 truly has no regulatory role on IL-2, we would not expect GRAP2 expression to track IL-2 expression across tissues. Hence in that scenario, there would be no difference in GRAP2 levels between high  versus low IL-2 tissues. That agrees with the null sub-hypothesis (no difference).  

• Is it redundant with the existing test ("Tissue-Wide Expression Correlation Test between GRAP2 and IL-2")?  
    The original correlation test looks at sample-by-sample or tissue-by-tissue correlation of GRAP2 and IL-2. The new test groups tissues by IL-2 expression (high vs. low) and then compares GRAP2 expression between these groups. Although related in spirit, it is not strictly the same statistical approach. The new test provides a simpler, two-group contrast that may reveal tissue-specific dichotomies. It is therefore not completely redundant.  

• Is it implementable with the given data?  
    Yes. df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm has per-tissue expression levels for each gene. We can subset IL-2 expression, pick the high vs. low expressers (e.g., top quartile vs. bottom quartile) among tissues, and then compare GRAP2 expression in those same tissues.

• Any overlap with failed tests?  
    No. No tests have been outright failed in the prior context, so there is no overlap to avoid.

2) REFLECTION AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:

• The proposed test is fairly straightforward, but still biologically meaningful. It differs from a simple correlation test by explicitly focusing on whether GRAP2 is enriched in tissues that produce IL-2.  
• The grouping (high vs. low IL-2 tissues) might be done in multiple ways (e.g., top X%
• The resulting p-value would reflect whether GRAP2's levels are systematically different in "IL-2 rich" vs. "IL-2 poor" tissues, giving clear evidence toward or against the main hypothesis.

Given this reasoning, the test appears valid. Below is the final definition.

FINAL TEST DEFINITION
────────────────────────────────────────────

(1) Name:  
"Tissue-Specific Expression Contrast Test for GRAP2 in High- vs. Low IL-2 Expressing Tissues"

(2) Test Description:  
Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, identify tissues exhibiting relatively high IL-2 expression and those with low or negligible IL-2 expression. Split the tissues into two groups accordingly. Then perform a two-sample test (e.g., t-test) comparing GRAP2's mean TPM in the high IL-2 group versus the low IL-2 group. If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2, we would expect a statistically significant expression difference in tissues that produce more IL-2. A non-significant result (or inverted effect) would serve as evidence to falsify the main hypothesis.

(3) Null Sub-Hypothesis h_0:  
"GRAP2 expression does not differ between tissues with high IL-2 expression and tissues with low IL-2 expression."

(4) Alternate Sub-Hypothesis h_1:  
"GRAP2 expression is significantly higher (or lower) in tissues that exhibit high IL-2 expression than in tissues that exhibit low IL-2 expression."
Proposed falsification test is not relevant enough to the main hypothesis! 
 Proposal: 
Main hypothesis: Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: Tissue-Specific Expression Contrast Test for GRAP2 in High- vs. Low IL-2 Expressing Tissues 
 Falsification Test description: Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, identify tissues exhibiting relatively high IL-2 expression and those with low or negligible IL-2 expression. Split the tissues into two groups accordingly. Then perform a two-sample test (e.g., t-test) comparing GRAP2's mean TPM in the high IL-2 group versus the low IL-2 group. If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2, a statistically significant expression difference in tissues that produce more IL-2 would be expected; a non-significant result (or inverted effect) would serve as evidence to falsify the main hypothesis. 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: GRAP2 expression does not differ between tissues with high IL-2 expression and tissues with low IL-2 expression. 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: GRAP2 expression is significantly higher (or lower) in tissues that exhibit high IL-2 expression than in tissues that exhibit low IL-2 expression. 
Relevance score: 0.6 
Reasoning: This expression-contrast analysis is a relevant check—if up/down regulation of GRAP2 is linked to high or low IL-2 production across tissues, that would be consistent with GRAP2's proposed regulatory role. However, it largely provides an association rather than direct mechanistic evidence, so while it does inform the hypothesis, it is a moderate rather than a strong or definitive test.

    \begin{lstlisting}
Initial Falsification Test Proposal:

(1) Name of the test: "Essential Expression Overlap Test"

(2) Test description (concise):  
Use df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm to tabulate, for each tissue, whether GRAP2 is expressed above a small threshold (present vs. absent) and whether IL-2 is expressed above that threshold (present vs. absent). If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2 production (implying GRAP2 expression is necessary for IL-2 expression), then no tissue should exhibit IL-2 expression in the absence of GRAP2 expression. Statistically, one can form a 2x2 contingency table (presence/absence of GRAP2 versus presence/absence of IL-2) across tissues and apply Fisher's exact test. A "failure" case—tissues without GRAP2 expression but with IL-2 expression—would tend to falsify the main hypothesis.

(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:  
"There is no strict dependency of IL-2 expression on GRAP2 expression, i.e., tissues lacking GRAP2 can still show IL-2 expression."

(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:  
"Tissues that lack GRAP2 expression also consistently lack IL-2 expression, consistent with GRAP2 being necessary for IL-2 production."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Round 1

(1) Critic:  
• If the main hypothesis (GRAP2 regulates IL-2) is truly null, then we should see at least some tissues without GRAP2 but with IL-2 expression, violating the ‘necessary' relationship. Hence under a null main hypothesis, the sub-hypothesis that ‘no tissue expresses IL-2 if GRAP2 is absent' would also be null. This aligns with the requirement.  
• Is it redundant or overlapping with the prior correlation tests? This test specifically looks for a necessary-expression pattern (i.e., IL-2 cannot be present when GRAP2 is absent), rather than measuring linear correlation or differences in mean expression. It is not merely a repeat of the correlation-based or high-vs.-low expression tests. Hence it is non-redundant.  
• Can it be answered with the given data? Yes. df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm provides GRAP2 and IL-2 tissue expression data. One can define a threshold (e.g., median TPM or a small nonzero TPM) to classify each gene as "expressed" or "absent" in each tissue.

(2) Reflect:  
The proposal is fairly straightforward, can be implemented with df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, and meets the falsification requirement (if in any tissue IL-2 is inexplicably high while GRAP2 is negligible, that falsifies "GRAP2 is necessary for IL-2 production"). This test complements correlation analyses by focusing on a threshold-based "necessary condition" approach rather than a predictive or trend-based one.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Test Definition:

(1) Name: "Essential Expression Overlap Test"  

(2) Test description:  
Classify each tissue in df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm as having GRAP2 expressed/not expressed and IL-2 expressed/not expressed (based on a small nonzero TPM threshold). Construct a 2 x2 table with these presence/absence calls across tissues. Apply Fisher's exact test to see if IL-2 is indeed "absent" whenever GRAP2 is absent. Failure to observe this co-absence pattern (i.e., finding tissues with no GRAP2 expression but clear IL-2 expression) would be evidence falsifying the main hypothesis.

(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:  
"There is no essential overlap pattern; IL-2 may be present even when GRAP2 is not expressed."

(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:  
"Tissues lacking GRAP2 expression consistently lack IL-2 expression, indicating that GRAP2 expression is necessary for IL-2 production."

Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This presence/absence study directly addresses a major component of the main hypothesis—namely, whether GRAP2 is required for IL-2 expression—but it relies on tissue-level correlation rather than a more detailed mechanistic test. Positive or negative findings would strongly influence confidence in the main hypothesis by demonstrating or refuting necessity of GRAP2, yet the approach is still correlational rather than providing definitive mechanistic proof.

INITIAL PROPOSAL FOR A NEW FALSIFICATION TEST:

(1) Name: "IL-2 Pathway Co-expression Test for GRAP2"

(2) Test Description (initial idea):
Rather than directly correlating GRAP2 expression with IL-2 itself (as in Round 1) or checking co-absence/presence patterns (as in Round 2), we will examine whether GRAP2 is co-expressed with key IL-2 signaling genes (e.g., IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, JAK3, STAT5, etc.) across tissues in df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm.  
• Collect TPM expression for GRAP2 and for each IL-2 signaling gene across tissues.  
• Compute the correlation (or multiple regression) across all tissues between GRAP2 and these IL-2 signaling genes.  
• Summarize evidence with a suitable test statistic (e.g., aggregate the correlations with Fisher's transformation for a meta p-value).  

If GRAP2 truly regulates IL-2 production, we would expect that GRAP2 at least co-varies with (i.e., is coordinately expressed alongside) the main receptor subunits or intracellular signaling components of IL-2. A lack of consistent co-expression with IL-2 signaling genes across tissues would provide evidence against GRAP2 being involved in IL-2 regulation.

(3) Null Sub-hypothesis h_0:  
"GRAP2 expression does not systematically correlate with the expression of IL-2 signaling genes across tissues."  

(4) Alternate Sub-hypothesis h_1:  
"GRAP2 is significantly co-expressed with IL-2 signaling genes across tissues, consistent with a regulatory relationship linking GRAP2 to IL-2 pathway activity."  

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
ROUND 1: CRITIC
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Does this test become null if the main hypothesis ("Gene GRAP2 regulates IL-2") is null?  
  - Yes. If GRAP2 has no regulatory link to IL-2, there is no particular reason for it to be co-expressed with the IL-2 signaling pathway genes. Hence we would find no strong correlation, and the test outcome (co-expression) would be null.  

• Is it redundant with existing or failed tests?  
  - Previous successful tests:  
    1) Tissue-Wide Expression Correlation Test (GRAP2 vs IL-2 directly)  
    2) Essential Expression Overlap Test (presence/absence)  
  - Previously failed test: Tissue-Specific Expression Contrast Test (high vs low IL-2 groups).  
  - The new proposal is different: It tests correlation of GRAP2 with IL-2 signaling components (e.g. IL2RA, IL2RB, JAK3, STAT5), not IL-2 expression itself. So it is not a simple duplication.  

• Can it be answered with the given data?  
  - Yes. df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm presumably contains expression levels for many genes, including GRAP2 and IL-2 signaling genes.  

Conclusion of critic: The test is not obviously redundant, can be performed with available data, and if the main hypothesis is null, the test is also null. It appears valid.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
ROUND 2: REFLECTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The test is suitably distinct and answerable.  
• It relies on the notion that if GRAP2 is essential for IL-2 production, it is presumably involved in (or at least co-expressed with) IL-2 signaling components.  
• This adds a new angle (IL-2's receptor + downstream signals), thus strengthening or falsifying the claim in a different dimension than prior tissue-level correlation tests.  

No further refinement seems necessary. The proposal stands as a solid new falsification test.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL TEST DEFINITION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

(1) Name: "IL-2 Pathway Co-expression Test for GRAP2"

(2) Test Description:  
Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, gather expression values for GRAP2 and for canonical IL-2 signaling genes (e.g., IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, JAK3, STAT5, etc.) across all available tissues. Compute a correlation (or multiple linear regression) across tissues to assess whether GRAP2 is co-expressed with these IL-2 signaling genes. Summarize correlation results (e.g., via Fisher's z-transformation) into an overall p-value. A lack of consistent correlation would be evidence falsifying the main hypothesis that GRAP2 regulates IL-2 production.

(3) Null Sub-hypothesis (h_0):  
"GRAP2 expression is not correlated (no systematic co-variation) with IL-2 signaling components across tissues."

(4) Alternate Sub-hypothesis (h_1):  
"There is significant co-expression between GRAP2 and IL-2 signaling genes across tissues, consistent with a shared regulatory or functional link to IL-2 biology."

Proposed falsification test is not relevant enough to the main hypothesis! 
 Proposal: 
Main hypothesis: Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: IL-2 Pathway Co-expression Test for GRAP2 
 Falsification Test description: Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, gather expression values for GRAP2 and for canonical IL-2 signaling genes (e.g., IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, JAK3, STAT5, etc.) across all available tissues. Compute a correlation (or multiple linear regression) across tissues to assess whether GRAP2 is co-expressed with these IL-2 signaling genes. Summarize correlation results (e.g., via Fisher's z-transformation) into an overall p-value. A lack of consistent correlation would be evidence falsifying the main hypothesis that GRAP2 regulates IL-2 production. 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: GRAP2 expression is not correlated (no systematic co-variation) with IL-2 signaling components across tissues. 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is significant co-expression between GRAP2 and IL-2 signaling genes across tissues, consistent with a shared regulatory or functional link to IL-2 biology. 
Relevance score: 0.6 
Reasoning: While evaluating tissue-level co-expression of GRAP2 with IL-2 signaling genes does address one of the main hypothesis's predictions (that GRAP2 is linked to IL-2 production), it is ultimately only an indirect measure of regulation. Demonstrating correlation across tissues does not in itself provide a direct mechanistic link or functional test of regulation (e.g., knockdown or overexpression). Hence, it offers some supportive or refuting insight, but only moderate predictive value regarding the main hypothesis.

\textbf{Round 3}
    \begin{lstlisting}

Initial Proposal

(1) Name of the test: "Housekeeping Normalized Partial Correlation Test"

(2) Test description (in plain language):  
   • From df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, retrieve the per-tissue TPM values of GRAP2, IL2, and at least one well-established housekeeping gene (e.g., GAPDH, ACTB) across all available tissues.  
   • Fit a linear model or compute partial correlations to assess whether GRAP2's expression levels predict IL2 expression after accounting for general (housekeeping) transcriptional activity. In other words, we ask: "Does GRAP2 covary with IL2 over and above the baseline expression captured by a housekeeping gene?"  
   • If the partial-regression coefficient (or partial-correlation) for GRAP2 in predicting IL2 is non-significant, that result would tend to falsify the main hypothesis that GRAP2 is specifically required for IL2 production (i.e., GRAP2 is not uniquely associated with IL2 once overall transcriptional levels are factored out).  
   • Report a p-value for this association; a large p-value (above conventional significance thresholds) favors falsifying the hypothesis.

(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:  
   "After controlling for housekeeping-gene expression, there is no relationship between GRAP2 expression and IL2 expression across human tissues."  
   Mathematically, the partial correlation (or partial-regression coefficient) of GRAP2 for predicting IL2 is zero.

(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1:  
   "Even after controlling for housekeeping-gene expression, GRAP2 expression remains significantly associated with IL2 expression,"  
   implying that GRAP2 specifically helps drive or track IL2 levels.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Round 1
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

(1) CRITIC:

• "If the main hypothesis is null, is this sub-hypothesis also null?"  
    The main hypothesis is that "GRAP2 regulates IL2." If that is in fact false (i.e., GRAP2 does not meaningfully affect IL2 levels), then we would not expect GRAP2 to have a unique partial correlation with IL2 once we control for baseline expression. In other words, under the null scenario (no real GRAP2→IL2 regulatory link), we should indeed find that GRAP2 and IL2 show no unique association, so the partial correlation would be zero. Hence, if the main hypothesis is null, the falsification sub-hypothesis of "GRAP2 has a nonzero partial correlation" would also be null. So that condition is satisfied.

• "Is it redundant with existing tests or with those that failed?"  
    So far, we have had:
    1) A simple correlation of GRAP2 and IL2 expression across tissues.  
    2) A presence/absence (Fisher exact) approach.  
    3) A contrast of GRAP2 across high- vs. low-IL2 tissues.  
    4) A broad co-expression test of GRAP2 with IL2-signaling genes.  

  In contrast, the newly proposed test focuses on controlling for a housekeeping gene to rule out the trivial possibility that GRAP2 and IL2 are simply co-varied because of global transcription differences between tissues. This partial-correlation approach is indeed different from a raw correlation or from presence/absence/overlap tests. It is also not the same as the multi-gene "IL-2 pathway co-expression test," because that test specifically regressed GRAP2 against IL2-signaling mediators (e.g. JAK3, STAT5). Here, we are trying to see if GRAP2 specifically goes along with IL2 beyond general expression baselines. Thus it is not redundant.

• "Can it be answered with the given data?"  
    Yes. df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm has per-tissue TPM values for many genes, including (very likely) at least one standard housekeeping gene. That allows us to implement the partial-correlation or linear-model approach.

(2) REFLECT:

• This test appears sound, distinctly focuses on controlling for baseline expression, and can be implemented with the given GTEx-style data. It is neither a pure correlation test (as in Round 1) nor simply presence/absence or a multi-gene correlation (Round 2 or the later failed attempts). It also maintains the crucial property that if GRAP2 truly has no effect on IL2, the partial correlation should vanish.  

No further refinements seem strictly necessary. The test is implementable, non-redundant, and meets the requirement that under the main null hypothesis, the sub-hypothesis would also be null.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Answer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

(1) Name: "Housekeeping Normalized Partial Correlation Test"

(2) Test Description:  
Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, retrieve expression (TPM) for GRAP2, IL2, and one or more canonical housekeeping genes across all tissues. Run a partial-correlation or linear-regression model of IL2 on GRAP2 while controlling for housekeeping-gene levels (to account for baseline transcriptional activity). If GRAP2 retains a statistically significant association with IL2 after that control, it supports the main hypothesis; an insignificant partial-correlation p-value would tend to falsify it.

(3) Null Sub-hypothesis h_0:  
"There is zero partial correlation between GRAP2 and IL2 when controlling for housekeeping-gene expression levels."

(4) Alternate Sub-hypothesis h_1:  
"There is a significant partial correlation between GRAP2 and IL2, over and above housekeeping-gene expression, indicative of a specific regulatory link."

Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: Housekeeping-Normalized Partial-Correlation Test 
 Falsification Test description: From df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, retrieve expression (TPM) for GRAP2, IL2, and at least one established housekeeping gene across all tissues. Then, run a partial-correlation or linear-regression model of IL2 on GRAP2 while controlling for the housekeeping-gene expression. If the partial correlation is significantly non-zero, it supports the hypothesis that GRAP2 specifically influences IL2 levels above and beyond general transcriptional activity. If the partial correlation is zero, that would falsify the hypothesis. 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: After controlling for housekeeping-gene expression, there is no relationship between GRAP2 and IL2 (partial correlation = 0). 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: Even after controlling for housekeeping-gene expression, GRAP2 remains significantly associated with IL2 (partial correlation ≠ 0). 
Relevance score 1.0 
Reasoning: This test is highly relevant because it directly measures whether GRAP2 remains associated with IL-2 after controlling for general transcription (housekeeping gene), providing specific, mechanistic evidence for or against a GRAP2 IL-2 regulatory link. A significant partial correlation would strongly support the main hypothesis that GRAP2 regulates IL-2 production, conferring high predictive value for the relationship.

INITIAL PROPOSAL FOR A NEW FALSIFICATION TEST

(1) Name (tentative): "Random-Gene Negative Control Test for GRAP2 IL2 Co-expression"

(2) Test Description (tentative):  
• From df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, compute the across-tissue Pearson (or Spearman) correlation between GRAP2 and IL2.  
• Then, randomly select a large number of other genes (e.g., 100 1000) from the same dataset and compute the correlation of each of those genes with IL2 across the same tissues.  
• Compare the GRAP2 IL2 correlation coefficient to this "null" distribution of correlation coefficients from random genes.  
• If the GRAP2 IL2 correlation is indistinguishable from that of randomly chosen genes (i.e., not significantly higher than the random distribution), that refutes a special regulatory relationship and thus falsifies the main hypothesis.  
• Conversely, if GRAP2 IL2 stands out as significantly greater than most random-gene correlations with IL2, it supports (but does not prove) GRAP2's special role in IL-2 regulation.

(3) Null Sub-hypothesis h_0 (tentative):  
"GRAP2 is no more correlated with IL2 across tissues than a random gene is."  
In other words, if the main hypothesis ("GRAP2 regulates IL2") is truly null, we expect no special correlation over and above what one would see if GRAP2 were just any arbitrary gene.

(4) Alternate Sub-hypothesis h_1 (tentative):  
"GRAP2 is significantly more correlated with IL2 across tissues than a random gene," indicating a potential functional/causal link consistent with regulation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Round 1: CRITIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Does the test become null if the main hypothesis is null?  
   • Yes. If GRAP2 does not in fact regulate IL2, then any correlation computed across tissues would be comparable to random. Hence, the test's sub-hypothesis (that GRAP2 is more correlated with IL2 than random genes) would also fail.  

2) Is this test redundant with (or overly similar to) existing or failed tests?  
   • Existing tests involved direct correlation between GRAP2 and IL2 or presence/absence overlap, as well as partial-correlation controlling for housekeeping genes. None used a random-gene control distribution. So this is not redundant with the existing correlation or partial-correlation approaches.  

3) Is the test answerable from the given data, and does it avoid the previously failed proposals?  
   • Yes. We can implement this test with df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm by extracting GRAP2 expression, IL2 expression, and expression for all other genes. It is not one of the cited failed tests.  

Conclusion of Critic:  
• The proposed test appears valid. It is not redundantly overlapping with previous correlation tests (because it uses a random distribution as a control), it achieves the "if main hypothesis is null, then sub-hypothesis is also null" requirement, and it can be carried out with df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Round 1: REFLECT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The test definition seems sound and distinct enough from the previous correlation-based tests.  
• It cleanly states a null vs. an alternative sub-hypothesis using a random-gene background distribution, which strengthens the "falsification" criterion.  
• It can be readily implemented using the provided GTEx expression data (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm).  

Therefore, the test is suitably defined and meets the requirements. No further refinement is necessary.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL FALSIFICATION TEST DEFINITION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

(1) Name of the test:  
"Random-Gene Negative Control Test for GRAP2 IL2 Co-expression"

(2) Test description:  
Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, first calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson) between GRAP2 and IL2 expression across all tissues. Then repeatedly sample other genes (e.g., 100 1000 random genes) from the same dataset and calculate each of their correlations with IL2. This yields a null distribution of correlation coefficients representing "random" relationships to IL2. Finally, compare the observed GRAP2 IL2 correlation to this distribution (e.g., compute a p-value as the fraction of random-gene correlations that exceed GRAP2 IL2's correlation). If GRAP2's correlation with IL2 is not significantly different from random, that falsifies the main hypothesis. If it is significantly stronger, it supports (but does not prove) a regulatory link.

(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0:

Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene GRAP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: Random-Gene Negative Control Test for GRAP2 IL2 Co-expression 
 Falsification Test description: Using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm, first calculate the correlation (e.g., Pearson) between GRAP2 and IL2 expression across all tissues. Then repeatedly sample other genes (e.g., 100 1000 random genes) from the same dataset and calculate each of their correlations with IL2. This yields a null distribution of correlation coefficients representing 'random' relationships to IL2. Finally, compare the observed GRAP2 IL2 correlation with this distribution (e.g., compute a p-value as the fraction of random-gene correlations that exceed GRAP2 IL2's correlation). If GRAP2's correlation with IL2 is not significantly different from random, that falsifies the main hypothesis. If it is significantly stronger, it supports (but does not prove) a regulatory link. 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: GRAP2 is no more correlated with IL2 across tissues than a random gene is (no special co-expression pattern). 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: GRAP2 is significantly more correlated with IL2 across tissues than a random gene, indicating a potential co-expression relationship consistent with regulation. 
Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This correlation-based test directly compares GRAP2 IL2 co-expression against random gene relationships, providing substantial evidence that GRAP2 is linked to IL2 expression patterns. While the data do not constitute definitive mechanistic proof of regulation, demonstrating a uniquely high correlation would significantly bolster confidence in the main hypothesis that GRAP2 regulates IL-2.

(3) Reasoning, summary, and analysis:  
• Round 1 (Tissue-Wide Expression Correlation): The reported test statistic (0.031) was below commonly used significance thresholds, suggesting a potential correlation between GRAP2 and IL-2 expression.  
• Round 2 (Essential Expression Overlap): The test statistic (0.1832) did not appear to reject the null sub-hypothesis; hence, no strong overlap pattern was confirmed.  
• Round 3 (Housekeeping-Normalized Partial-Correlation): The result (0.028) indicated a statistically significant partial correlation between GRAP2 and IL-2 while controlling for housekeeping gene expression.  
• Round 4 (Random-Gene Negative Control Test): The test statistic (0.056) was borderline but did not strongly refute a specific correlation signal for GRAP2 compared to random genes.  

Combining all four tests, the sequential e-value analysis overall led to a "PASS," indicating that these tests, taken together, failed to falsify the primary hypothesis.

\textbf{Round 1}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me propose an initial falsification test:

Initial Test Proposal:
(1) Name: Physical Interaction Test
(2) Test description: Test if LCP2 physically interacts with IL-2 or IL-2 pathway proteins using protein-protein interaction data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: LCP2 does not show significant physical interactions with IL-2 or IL-2 pathway proteins
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: LCP2 shows significant physical interactions with IL-2 or IL-2 pathway proteins

Let me critique this proposal:

Critic:
1. Validity: If the main hypothesis "LCP2 regulates IL-2 production" is null, would this test also be null?
- Not necessarily. Physical interaction is not required for regulation. A gene can regulate another gene's production through indirect pathways without physical protein interaction.
- Therefore, this test fails the crucial validity requirement.

2. Data availability: 
- We have protein interaction data (df_affinity_capture_ms, df_two_hybrid, etc.)
- However, we need gene IDs for both LCP2 and IL-2 to use these datasets

3. Redundancy:
- No redundancy issues as there are no existing tests yet

Reflection:
We need a better test that:
1. Has proper logical implication (if main hypothesis is null, test should be null)
2. Uses available data more effectively
3. Is more directly related to regulation of production

Let me propose a revised test:

Revised Test Proposal:
(1) Name: Expression Correlation Test
(2) Test description: Test if LCP2 expression levels correlate with IL-2 expression levels across tissues in GTEx data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: There is no significant correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression levels across tissues
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: There is significant positive correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression levels across tissues

Critic:
1. Validity: If LCP2 doesn't regulate IL-2 production (null main hypothesis), then there should indeed be no correlation in expression (null sub-hypothesis). This satisfies the validity requirement.

2. Data availability:
- We have df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm which contains gene expression data across tissues
- We can calculate correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression

3. Implementation feasibility:
- This test can be implemented using standard correlation analysis
- P-value can be computed from the correlation test

This revised test appears to be valid, implementable, and logically sound. I recommend proceeding with this final test definition.

 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression levels across tissues 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: There is significant positive correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression levels across tissues 
Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This Expression Correlation Test is strongly relevant to the main hypothesis for several reasons:

1. Direct Variable Connection: The test directly examines the relationship between the two key variables in the main hypothesis - LCP2 and IL-2.

2. Mechanistic Insight: While correlation doesn't prove causation, a strong correlation would provide substantial supporting evidence for a regulatory relationship, especially across different tissues.

3. Predictive Value: If LCP2 regulates IL-2 production, we would expect to see a significant positive correlation between their expression levels. The test results would significantly impact our confidence in the main hypothesis.

The reason this doesn't receive a 1.0 score is that correlation analysis alone cannot definitively prove regulation - it's possible to have correlated expression without direct regulation. However, this test provides strong supporting evidence and is a logical first step in investigating the regulatory relationship.

I apologize for not being able to proceed with the falsification test as intended. After examining the dataset, I notice that the required genes (LCP2 and IL-2) are not present in the GTEx dataset provided. Without the expression data for these specific genes, I cannot perform a meaningful correlation analysis between LCP2 and IL-2 expression levels.

For the sake of statistical rigor, I should return:

Final Answer: The falsification test cannot be performed due to missing data for LCP2 and IL-2 genes in the provided GTEx dataset. P-value = 1.00e+00 (default when test cannot be performed).

Note: To properly test this hypothesis, we would need GTEx data containing expression levels for both LCP2 and IL-2 across multiple tissues. The current dataset does not contain this information.

\textbf{Round 2}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me propose an initial falsification test:

Initial Proposal:
(1) Name: Protein-Protein Interaction Test
(2) Test description: Test if LCP2 protein physically interacts with IL-2 or key IL-2 regulatory proteins using protein interaction data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: LCP2 does not show significant physical interactions with IL-2 or its known regulatory proteins
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: LCP2 shows significant physical interactions with IL-2 or its known regulatory proteins

Let me critique this proposal:

Critic:
1. Causality Check: If the main hypothesis (LCP2 regulates IL-2) is null, would this sub-hypothesis also be null?
- Not necessarily. Physical protein interactions don't always imply regulatory relationships. Two proteins can interact without one regulating the other's production.
- The test needs to be more specific about regulatory mechanisms.

2. Data Availability:
- We have protein interaction data (df_affinity_capture_ms, df_two_hybrid, etc.)
- However, we need to ensure we can specifically identify IL-2 related proteins.

3. Redundancy:
- This test is not redundant with the previous expression correlation test.
- It examines a different molecular mechanism.

Reflection:
Let me refine this test to better align with regulatory relationships:

Refined Proposal:
(1) Name: LCP2 Regulatory Network Analysis Test
(2) Test description: Test if LCP2 shows physical interactions specifically with known transcription factors or signaling proteins that are established regulators of IL-2 production using high-confidence protein interaction data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: LCP2 does not show significant physical interactions with established IL-2 transcriptional regulators or upstream signaling proteins
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: LCP2 shows significant physical interactions with established IL-2 transcriptional regulators or upstream signaling proteins

This refined version:
- Better reflects regulatory relationships
- Has a clearer causal implication (if LCP2 doesn't regulate IL-2, it shouldn't interact with IL-2's regulatory machinery)
- Can be implemented using the available protein interaction datasets
- Is more specific about the type of interactions we're looking for

I believe this refined test is ready for implementation.

2. Evidence Strength: Using high-confidence protein interaction data offers strong, direct evidence of potential regulatory relationships. If LCP2 physically interacts with known IL-2 regulators, this would provide substantial support for its role in IL-2 regulation.

3. Predictive Value: The results would significantly impact our confidence in the main hypothesis. If LCP2 shows interactions with established IL-2 regulators, it strongly suggests a regulatory role. Conversely, absence of such interactions would significantly weaken the main hypothesis.

While this test is highly informative, it receives 0.8 rather than 1.0 because it focuses on physical interactions alone and doesn't directly measure IL-2 production changes, which would be needed for complete validation of the regulatory relationship.

\begin{experimentexecutionagent}
\begin{lstlisting}
Now I know the final answer. Based on our rigorous analysis:

1. We found 3 high-confidence physical interactions for LCP2 in the human interactome
2. Out of these 3 interactions, 0 were with known IL-2 pathway genes
3. We performed a binomial test to determine if this observation was statistically significant, comparing against the null expectation based on the proportion of IL-2 related genes in the network
4. The test yielded a p-value of 1.00e+00, indicating no significant enrichment or depletion of IL-2 pathway interactions

Final Answer: We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of 1.00e+00. The data does not support the alternate hypothesis that LCP2 shows significant physical interactions with established IL-2 transcriptional regulators or upstream signaling proteins.

\textbf{Round 3}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me propose a falsification test and then analyze it carefully.

Initial Proposal:
(1) Name: Genetic Variant Impact Test
(2) Test description: Test if genetic variants affecting LCP2 function (pLoF, missense) are associated with immune-related phenotypes that are known to be IL-2 dependent using GeneBASS data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: Genetic variants that affect LCP2 function show no significant association with IL-2-dependent immune phenotypes
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: Genetic variants that affect LCP2 function show significant association with IL-2-dependent immune phenotypes

Let's analyze:

Critic:
1. Logical Validity: If the main hypothesis (LCP2 regulates IL-2 production) is null, then genetic variants affecting LCP2 should indeed show no association with IL-2-dependent phenotypes. This satisfies the key requirement.

2. Non-redundancy: This test is distinct from previous tests:
- Round 1 looked at expression correlation
- Round 2 examined protein interactions
This test looks at genetic evidence through variant analysis.

3. Data Availability: Yes, we can implement this using:
- df_genebass_pLoF_filtered for loss of function variants
- df_genebass_missense_LC_filtered for missense variants
These contain gene-phenotype associations.

4. Strength: This test provides causal evidence through genetic variation, which is stronger than correlation or interaction evidence.

Reflection:
The test could be improved by:
1. Being more specific about which immune phenotypes to look at
2. Clarifying the statistical threshold for significance
3. Specifying how to combine evidence across different variant types

Refined Proposal:
(1) Name: LCP2 Variant-Immune Phenotype Association Test
(2) Test description: Test if LCP2 loss-of-function and missense variants are significantly associated with autoimmune conditions and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS, which are known to be IL-2 dependent
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: LCP2 genetic variants (pLoF and missense) show no significant association (p > 0.05) with autoimmune and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: LCP2 genetic variants show significant association (p < 0.05) with autoimmune and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS

This refined version is more specific and implementable. I believe this test definition is now good enough to return to the user as it:
- Maintains logical validity with the main hypothesis
- Is non-redundant with existing tests
- Is clearly implementable with available data
- Provides strong causal evidence
- Has clear statistical criteria

Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene LCP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: LCP2 Variant-Immune Phenotype Association Test 
 Falsification Test description: Test if LCP2 loss-of-function and missense variants are significantly associated with autoimmune conditions and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS, which are known to be IL-2 dependent 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: LCP2 genetic variants (pLoF and missense) show no significant association (p > 0.05) with autoimmune and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: LCP2 genetic variants show significant association (p < 0.05) with autoimmune and T-cell related phenotypes in GeneBASS 
Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This sub-hypothesis test is strongly relevant to the main hypothesis for several reasons:

1. Mechanistic Connection: The test examines LCP2 genetic variants and their association with immune phenotypes that are known to be IL-2 dependent, providing a direct mechanistic link to the main hypothesis about LCP2's role in IL-2 regulation.

2. Evidence Strength: By using genetic variants (loss-of-function and missense) in LCP2 and examining their association with IL-2-dependent phenotypes, the test provides strong genetic evidence for the functional relationship between LCP2 and IL-2 production.

3. Predictive Value: If LCP2 truly regulates IL-2 production, we would expect LCP2 variants to be associated with autoimmune and T-cell related phenotypes, making this test highly predictive. The use of GeneBASS database adds statistical rigor to the analysis.

The score is 0.8 rather than 1.0 because while it provides strong genetic evidence, it is still an associative study rather than a direct mechanistic demonstration of LCP2's regulation of IL-2 production.

Looking at the provided datasets, I notice that `df_genebass_pLoF_filtered` and `df_genebass_missense_LC_filtered` would be the most relevant for testing associations between LCP2 genetic variants and autoimmune/T-cell phenotypes.

\end{observation}

\begin{experimentexecutionagent}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me summarize the findings before making the final conclusion:

1. We found associations between LCP2 variants and immune-related phenotypes, particularly with lymphocyte percentage
2. The strongest association showed:
   - Minimum p-value = 6.66e-05 (uncorrected)
   - Bonferroni corrected p-value = 9.42e-02
   - Positive effect (BETA = 0.014855)
   - Strong effect size (t-statistic ≈ 4.0)

However, after multiple testing correction, we technically cannot reject the null hypothesis at the conventional α=0.05 level. Despite the strong effect size and biologically plausible direction of effect, we must maintain statistical rigor.

Final Answer: Cannot reject the null hypothesis. The association between LCP2 variants and immune phenotypes, while suggestive, does not reach genome-wide significance after multiple testing correction (p-value = 9.42e-02).

\textbf{Round 4}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me propose an initial falsification test:

Name: LCP2 eQTL-IL2 Regulatory Region Test

Test description: Test if genetic variants that affect LCP2 expression (eQTLs) are enriched in regulatory regions near the IL2 gene, which would suggest direct regulatory relationship.

Null sub-hypothesis h_0: Genetic variants that are eQTLs for LCP2 are not significantly enriched in regulatory regions near IL2 gene compared to background.

Alternative sub-hypothesis h_1: Genetic variants that are eQTLs for LCP2 are significantly enriched in regulatory regions near IL2 gene compared to background.

Let me critique this proposal:

Critic:
1. Causality Direction: If the main hypothesis (LCP2 regulates IL2) is null, this test might still show significance if there's a third factor affecting both genes, or if IL2 regulates LCP2. Therefore, the test doesn't fully satisfy the crucial property that null main hypothesis implies null sub-hypothesis.

2. Data Availability: Looking at the provided data sources, while we have eQTL data from UKBB (df_eqtl_ukbb), we don't have comprehensive regulatory region annotations or IL2 genomic location data to properly implement this test.

3. Non-redundancy: While this test examines a different aspect than previous tests (genetic regulation vs. expression correlation or protein interactions), it may partially overlap with the variant-phenotype associations tested in Round 3.

Reflection:
We need a test that:
1. Has stronger directional causality aligned with the main hypothesis
2. Can be clearly implemented with available data
3. Provides unique evidence

Let me propose a refined test:

Name: LCP2 Immune Cell-Specific Expression Test

Test description: Test if LCP2 expression is specifically elevated in immune cell types where IL2 production is known to occur (e.g., T cells) compared to other tissues using GTEx tissue expression data.

Null sub-hypothesis h_0: LCP2 expression in immune tissues is not significantly higher than in non-immune tissues.

Alternative sub-hypothesis h_1: LCP2 expression in immune tissues is significantly higher than in non-immune tissues.

Critic of refined version:
1. Causality: If the main hypothesis is null, this test would also be null because if LCP2 doesn't regulate IL2, there's no requirement for it to be specifically expressed in IL2-producing cells.
2. Data Feasibility: We can implement this using df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm data.
3. Non-redundancy: This test provides unique tissue-specific evidence different from previous tests.
4. Biological Relevance: This test aligns with the biological context of IL2 regulation.

This refined test appears to meet all our criteria.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{experimentdesignagent}

\begin{relevancechecker}
\begin{lstlisting}
Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene LCP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: LCP2 Immune Cell-Specific Expression Test 
 Falsification Test description: Test if LCP2 expression is specifically elevated in immune cell types where IL2 production is known to occur (e.g., T cells) compared to other tissues using GTEx tissue expression data. 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: LCP2 expression in immune tissues is not significantly higher than in non-immune tissues. 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: LCP2 expression in immune tissues is significantly higher than in non-immune tissues. 
Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This sub-hypothesis test is strongly relevant to the main hypothesis for several reasons:

1. Mechanistic Connection: Since IL-2 is primarily produced by immune cells (especially T cells), testing LCP2's expression pattern in immune vs non-immune tissues directly addresses a key mechanistic aspect of the hypothesized regulatory relationship.

2. Evidence Strength: The test provides strong circumstantial evidence - if LCP2 is specifically expressed in IL-2-producing immune cells, it supports its potential role as a regulator. However, it doesn't directly prove regulation, which is why it's not scored as 1.0.

3. Predictive Value: The test results would significantly impact confidence in the main hypothesis. If LCP2 is not expressed in IL-2-producing cells, it would be difficult to support its role as a direct regulator. Conversely, specific expression in these cells would strengthen the hypothesis.

The test doesn't get a 1.0 score because while it provides strong supporting evidence, it doesn't directly test the regulatory relationship - LCP2 could be expressed in these cells but not actually regulate IL-2 production.

I apologize, but I notice a potential issue. Looking at the datasets provided, while we have GTEx tissue expression data (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm), we need to ensure that:

Gene LCP2 regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2)

(2) Result of Sequential Falsification Test:
The sequential testing passed with a combined e-value of 22.68, after completing 4 tests.

(3) Reasoning and Analysis:
- Expression Correlation Test (Round 1) showed strong correlation between LCP2 and IL-2 expression
- Regulatory Network Analysis (Round 2) demonstrated significant physical interactions with IL-2 regulators
- Variant-Immune Phenotype Association Test (Round 3) failed to show significant association (p=0.0942 > 0.05)
- Immune Cell-Specific Expression Test (Round 4) showed highly significant immune tissue-specific expression (p=8.06e-05)

(4) Conclusion: True

(5) Rationale:
The hypothesis is supported based on multiple lines of evidence:
- Strong expression correlation between LCP2 and IL-2
- Confirmed physical interactions with IL-2 regulatory proteins
- Highly significant immune cell-specific expression pattern
- The combined e-value (22.68) indicates strong cumulative evidence
Although the variant association test didn't reach significance, the other three tests provided strong supporting evidence, and the overall sequential testing procedure passed the predetermined threshold. The multiple complementary approaches testing different aspects of the relationship between LCP2 and IL-2 production collectively support the regulatory relationship.

\begin{experimentdesignagent}
\textbf{Round 3}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me propose an initial falsification test:

Initial Proposal:
(1) Name: RAB39A Tissue-Specific Co-Expression Pattern Test
(2) Test description: Test if RAB39A shows significantly higher expression in immune system tissues where IL-2 is known to be predominantly produced (like T cells and lymphoid tissues) compared to other tissues using GTEx data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: RAB39A expression levels in immune system tissues are not significantly different from other tissues
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: RAB39A shows significantly higher expression in immune system tissues compared to other tissues

Let me critique this proposal:

Critic:
1. Main hypothesis nullity implication: If RAB39A does not regulate IL-2 production, it could still be highly expressed in immune tissues for other functions. Therefore, this test doesn't necessarily become null when the main hypothesis is null. This violates the key requirement.
2. Data availability: While we have GTEx tissue expression data (df_gtex_tissue_gene_tpm), the tissue categories might not be granular enough to specifically identify immune tissues.
3. Redundancy: This test partially overlaps with the failed "RAB39A-IL2 Expression Correlation Test" as both use expression patterns.

Reflection:
We need a test that:
1. Has stronger logical connection to the regulatory relationship
2. Becomes null when the main hypothesis is null
3. Uses different data types than previous tests
4. Is answerable with available data

New Proposal:
(1) Name: RAB39A Genetic Variant Impact on IL-2 QTL Test
(2) Test description: Test if genetic variants near RAB39A are significant QTLs for IL-2 related immune traits in the UK Biobank eQTL data
(3) Null sub-hypothesis h_0: Genetic variants near RAB39A show no significant QTL associations with IL-2 related immune phenotypes
(4) Alternate sub-hypothesis h_1: Genetic variants near RAB39A show significant QTL associations with IL-2 related immune phenotypes

Critic Round 2:
1. Main hypothesis nullity: If RAB39A doesn't regulate IL-2, genetic variants affecting RAB39A should indeed show no QTL effects on IL-2 related traits. This satisfies the nullity requirement.
2. Data availability: We have eQTL data from UK Biobank (df_eqtl_ukbb) and variant information (df_variant_table).
3. Non-redundancy: This test uses different data types (QTL) compared to previous tests that used GeneBASS and protein interactions.
4. Implementation feasibility: The test can be implemented using the provided data sources.

This refined test appears to meet all requirements.

Proposed falsification test passes relevance check: 
 Proposal: Main hypothesis: Gene RAB39A regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). 
 Falsification Test name: RAB39A Genetic Variant Impact on IL-2 QTL Test 
 Falsification Test description: Test if genetic variants near RAB39A are significant QTLs for IL-2 related immune traits in the UK Biobank eQTL data 
 Falsification Test Null sub-hypothesis: Genetic variants near RAB39A show no significant QTL associations with IL-2 related immune phenotypes 
 Falsification Test Alternate sub-hypothesis: Genetic variants near RAB39A show significant QTL associations with IL-2 related immune phenotypes 
Relevance score 0.8 
Reasoning: This QTL test is strongly relevant to the main hypothesis for several reasons:

1. Direct genetic link: The test examines genetic variants specifically near RAB39A and their relationship to IL-2 related traits, which directly addresses the proposed regulatory relationship in the main hypothesis.

2. Population-level evidence: Using UK Biobank eQTL data provides robust, population-scale evidence that could substantiate a regulatory relationship between RAB39A and IL-2.

3. Mechanistic insight: QTL associations would suggest a genetic basis for the regulatory relationship, though it doesn't fully elucidate the exact molecular mechanism.

4. High predictive value: If significant QTL associations are found, it would strongly support (though not definitively prove) the main hypothesis. Conversely, absence of associations would significantly challenge it.

The score is 0.8 rather than 1.0 because while the test provides strong evidence, it's correlative rather than demonstrating direct causation or the specific molecular mechanism of regulation.

\begin{experimentexecutionagent}
\begin{lstlisting}
I notice the analysis shows significant eQTL associations for RAB39A. The most significant variant (rs11603234) has a p-value of 2.81e-13, which is highly significant. This eQTL effect is observed in neutrophils, which are relevant to immune function.

Since we have:
1. Multiple independent eQTL signals (4 different variants)
2. These are found in immune cells (neutrophils)
3. The associations are highly significant with the strongest p-value at 2.81e-13
4. The observation is in a relevant tissue type for IL-2 related immune traits

We can reject the null hypothesis that genetic variants near RAB39A show no significant QTL associations with IL-2 related immune phenotypes.

Final Answer: Falsification test passes. The null hypothesis is rejected with a p-value of 2.81e-13. Multiple independent variants near RAB39A show significant eQTL effects in immune cells (neutrophils), with the strongest association having a p-value of 2.81e-13.

\begin{summarizer}
\begin{lstlisting}
Let me summarize the sequential falsification testing results:

(1) Main Scientific Hypothesis:
Gene RAB39A regulates the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2)

(2) Result of Sequential Falsification Test:
The sequential testing passed with a combined e-value of approximately 1.01  x 10^6, after completing 3 tests.

(3) Reasoning and Analysis:
- Test 1 (Genetic Impact): Test statistic 0.0543 - showed weak association between RAB39A genetic variations and IL-2 phenotypes
- Test 2 (Regulatory Complex): Test statistic 1.0 - demonstrated no significant physical interactions with IL-2 regulatory proteins
- Test 3 (QTL Analysis): Test statistic 2.81e-13 - revealed highly significant QTL associations between RAB39A variants and IL-2 traits

(4) Conclusion: True

(5) Rationale:
The conclusion is True because:
- The sequential testing procedure officially passed with a very large combined e-value (>10^6)
- While the first two tests showed modest or no associations, the extremely strong QTL evidence (p=2.81e-13) in Test 3 provided compelling statistical support
- The combined evidence, particularly driven by the strong QTL associations, meets the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis
- The sequential testing framework explicitly concluded "sufficient evidence - PASS", indicating formal rejection of the null hypothesis

This conclusion is based strictly on the statistical evidence presented in the sequential testing procedure, which formally rejected the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis that RAB39A regulates IL-2 production."
