\section{Related Work}
We discuss here related works that are closest to   \mname and provide extended discussion on other related works in Appendix~\ref{appedix:related}. LLMs have been widely explored for hypothesis generation, with works focusing on domain-specific ideas ____ and comparisons between AI-generated and expert proposals ____. Beyond idea generation, some studies refine hypotheses ____ or ground them in datasets ____, yet few systematically test free-form hypotheses under rigorous statistical controls. While certain works evaluate LLM-driven experimental protocols ____ or integrate hypothesis and code generation ____, they often lack strong error control. Unlike these, \mname conducts robust statistical validation of both LLM- and human-generated hypotheses through a sequential falsification framework, ensuring reliability. Although ____ also uses hypothesis testing as a way to challenge language models, \mname uniquely targets free-form natural language hypotheses and offers rigorous error control.
