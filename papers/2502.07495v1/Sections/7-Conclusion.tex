\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \alg{}, which combines a novel two-part data structure with an LLM-powered flow classifier to effectively separate large flows from small ones and reduce collisions. By employing a soft-label mechanism for real-time flow predictions, it accurately identifies potential heavy flows while minimizing misclassifications. Experimental results on real-world datasets confirm that \alg{} achieves a significant \(7.5\times\) improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility for diverse network stream mining tasks.
