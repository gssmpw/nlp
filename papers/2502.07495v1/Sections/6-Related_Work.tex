\bbb{Traditional sketches:}
%
Sketches can broadly be categorized into two types:
%
\textit{1) Classic sketches} consist of a counter matrix and multiple hash functions. During updates and queries, flow IDs are hashed into multiple counters, and the mapped counters are then updated and queried accordingly. Typical classic sketches include the Count-Min Sketch (CMS) \cite{cmsketch}, the Conservative Update Sketch (CUS) \cite{cusketch}, and the Count Sketch (CS) \cite{csketch}. However, classic sketches fail to account for the highly skewed nature of network traffic, resulting in memory waste.
%
\textit{2) Sophisticated sketches} address this problem by separating large flows from small flows \cite{elasticsketch, sketchlearn, nitrosketch, nze-sketch, bitsense}. These sketches typically consist of multiple parts, with different parts using different data structures to record flows of varying sizes. A typical sophisticated sketch is ElasticSketch \cite{elasticsketch}, which is composed of a heavy part and a light part. The heavy part is a key-value table, while the light part is a CM sketch. Packets are first inserted into the heavy part. When the heavy part becomes full, ElasticSketch uses an eviction method to remove the flow that is most likely to be small and inserts it into the light part. Researchers have attempted to improve sketch accuracy by adjusting the flow selection method for eviction, but most of these attempts have been based on experience.
%
Additional sketches have been proposed for specialized tasks, such as heavy hitter query \cite{css, mvsketch, precision}, hierarchical heavy hitter query \cite{rhhh, cocosketch}, and DDoS victim/super-spreader query \cite{opensketch, spreadsketch}.




\bbb{ML-based sketches:}
%
In recent years, researchers have attempted to use machine learning methods to improve sketch performance. Learned Count-Min Sketch (LCMS) \cite{lcmsketch} employs an RNN to learn and infer whether a flow is large and uses an additional hash table to record large flows. Other solutions \cite{bertsimas2021frequency, mlsketch, metasketch} use ML to enhance hashing, updating, and querying processes within the sketch, leading to improved performance. The main difference between these works and ours is that they only learn features from the flow ID and distribution, without utilizing other information carried by the packets.




\bbb{LLM for other network tasks:}
%
Some works explore how to adapt LLMs to other network operations, such as traffic classification, viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster job scheduling. Typical works include PERT \cite{pert}, ET-BERT \cite{et-bert}, YaTC \cite{yatc}, and NetLLM \cite{netllm}.
