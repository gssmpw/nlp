\begin{abstract}
The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18–34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. \textit{Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.}

% 1. The Title should state the position and start with “Position:”.
%   * These hypothetical paper titles do state a position:
%       * "Position: Quantum Atelic Learning Methods Should Employ Psychic Insights"
%       * "Position: Stop Research on Psychic Properties of Machine Learning"
%   * while these versions do not:
%       * "Position: Psychic Quantum Atelic Learning"
%       * "Position: A Perspective on Psychic Quantum Atelic Learning"
% 2. The Abstract must identify the paper as a position paper and briefly state the position (e.g., “This position paper argues that <statement of the position>.”)
% 3. The Introduction must state the position, using bold text.
% 4. The paper must include an “Alternative Views” section that describes and addresses one or more viable (not strawmen) positions that are opposed to the paper’s position.
% 5. Papers that describe new research without advocating a position are not responsive to this call and should instead be submitted to the main paper track.

% Position: AI/ML Influencers Have a Place in the Academic Process
