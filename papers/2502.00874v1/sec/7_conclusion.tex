\section{Conclusion}

% In this work, we analyzed the dynamics of open, partially open, and closed review processes in AI / ML community, leveraging insights from Paper Copilot to highlight the growing community interest in transparency. Our findings reveal that while fully open reviews foster transparency and engagement, they may discourage reviewer's confidence, whereas closed systems lack accountability and broader community involvement. However, our analysis is limited by the reliance on voluntary data submissions and the inherent biases in engagement metrics, which may not fully represent the diversity of the AI / ML community. Future work will focus on expanding data sources, refining demographic analyses, and exploring mechanisms to address ethical concerns and protect intellectual property in open review models, ensuring a balanced and inclusive peer-review process.

In this work, we analyzed the dynamics of open, partially open, and closed review processes in the AI/ML community, leveraging insights from Paper Copilot to highlight the growing interest in transparency. Our findings reveal that while fully open reviews promote transparency and engagement, they may also discourage reviewer confidence, whereas closed systems lack accountability and broader community involvement. However, our analysis is limited by the rapid evolution of the AI/ML community, where shifting norms may outpace existing review models, and by potential biases in voluntary data submissions, which may not fully capture the community's diversity. Future work will focus on tracking the evolving dynamics and further expanding data, refining demographic analyses, and exploring peer review mechanisms further.
