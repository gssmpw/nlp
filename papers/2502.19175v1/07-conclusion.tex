Existing approaches to automatic differential diagnosis rely on single-dataset evaluations, assume fully observed patient profiles, focus on optimizing isolated diagnostic components, or diagnose in a single attempt. We introduce MEDDxAgent, a modular and explainable framework that enhances automatic differential diagnosis through iterative learning. MEDDxAgent integrates a history taking simulator, two agents (knowledge retrieval, diagnosis strategy), and an orchestrator (DDxDriver) to tackle the more challenging and realistic scenario of interactive differential diagnosis, where patient profiles are initially incomplete. Its modular design enables systematic evaluation of optimal agent configurations, while intermediate logging and a novel average progress rate metric provide critical transparency into its reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that interactive differential diagnosis is significantly more challenging but allows MEDDxAgent to iteratively refine predictions, outperforming simpler single-turn approaches. We hope this framework fosters continued progress in developing more adaptive and effective models for automatic differential diagnosis.
