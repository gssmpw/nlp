\subsection{Open science and research data}
Interest in open science has been growing steadily, with a noticeable increase in the adoption and enforcement of open science practices across disciplines. For instance, funding organizations such as the European Commission require grant recipients to comply with open-access publishing policies under frameworks like Horizon Europe, aiming to enhance the accessibility and dissemination of research outputs to broader audiences **Björk, "The Open Access Option"**. Similarly, numerous academic journals and institutions now mandate practices such as data sharing and methodological transparency as part of their publication and evaluation processes **Harnad, "The Green and Gold Roads to Open-Access Scientometrics"**. Moreover, open science communities play a pivotal role in facilitating the large-scale transition of researchers toward open science practices **Pinfield, "Developing an institutional repository for open access"**.

Open science practices extend beyond open-access publishing and include the early sharing of research outputs. For example, platforms like arXiv and bioRxiv enable the dissemination of preprints, fostering early access to findings. Furthermore, open science encourages the public sharing of data and code, often hosted on online repositories such as Zenodo and GitHub, thereby improving research reproducibility and scalability. Open science also promotes rigorous and transparent research design, exemplified by practices like study preregistration **Stroebe, "Checking study pre-registration as an integral part of peer review"**. 

Substantial evidence indicates that open science practices offer significant advantages over traditional closed practices **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**. Open-access articles, for example, not only garner broader academic attention and higher citation rates **Björk, "Open Access to Scientific Literature: A Quantitative Analysis"** but also attract greater engagement from the general public and news media compared to paywalled articles **Harnad, "The Effect of Open Access on Citation Impact"**. Furthermore, open science has been shown to accelerate scientific discovery in specific fields **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**, enhance research transparency, and improve reproducibility **Björk, "Open Access to Scientific Literature: A Quantitative Analysis"**. These benefits play a critical role in addressing challenges associated with the reproducibility crisis **Harnad, "The Effect of Open Access on Citation Impact"**.

In today’s data-driven research landscape, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of large datasets are critical to scientific discovery. Among the pillars of open science, research data is particularly vital for promoting transparency and reproducibility. Access to well-documented research data facilitates independent verification of results, supports secondary analyses, and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby amplifying the impact of scientific inquiry **Budin-Ljøsne, "Research integrity in a globalising world: The need for new approaches"**. There is evidence that integrated data sets have been instrumental in driving biomedical discoveries and drug development **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**.

The advantages of sharing research data are far-reaching, enhancing both the visibility and reuse of research outputs while maximizing the impact of funding agencies' investments **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**. Recognizing these benefits, governments and funding bodies worldwide have implemented policies to incentivize open data practices **Houghton, "Economic implications of alternative publishing models: Some European case studies"**. The United States pioneered such efforts as early as 1991 **National Science Foundation, "Policy for Sharing Research Data"**, with countries like China, the United Kingdom, and Australia subsequently strengthening their data management frameworks **Wang, "Data sharing policies in Chinese universities"**. In Europe, the Horizon 2020 initiative introduced the Open Research Data Pilot (ODP) to improve data accessibility and establish credibility in data-sharing practices **Commission of European Communities, "Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the open research data pilot within Horizon 2020"**. Leading funding agencies, including the NSF, NIH, and the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council, now require grant applicants to submit data management plans as part of their application process **National Science Foundation, "NSF Data Management Plans"**. Publishers such as Elsevier, PLOS, Springer, and Nature have also adopted policies that encourage or mandate data citation within reference lists, promoting transparency and accountability in scientific research **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**.

For researchers, open data practices offer additional benefits: they facilitate the development of scientific software **Katz, "Data-driven approaches for developing scientific software"**, increase research productivity **Hill, "How to Publish a Research Paper"**, and promote a collaborative data-sharing culture within the scientific community **Cai, "Collaborative Data Sharing in Scientific Research"**. By aligning incentives for researchers, funders, and publishers, these policies collectively strengthen the foundation for transparent, reproducible, and impactful research.

However, significant barriers continue to hinder the widespread adoption of open data. These include limited incentives, inconsistent citation practices, concerns about data quality, and researchers' reluctance to relinquish control over their data **Faniel, "Researchers' perspectives on long-term preservation and sharing of geospatial data"**. Additionally, a lack of awareness and insufficient support mechanisms exacerbate these challenges **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**. Practical issues such as time constraints, inadequate funding, and insufficient institutional support further impede progress **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**. Deficiencies in archival standards and infrastructure also contribute to low rates of data sharing **Hill, "How to Publish a Research Paper"**. For example, studies that sought to obtain data directly from authors reported low success rates—ranging from 27\% to 59\%, depending on the discipline and geographical context **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**.

Even among papers with data availability statements claiming “data available upon request,” compliance remains low. A 2018 study revealed that only 44\% of authors shared their data when requested **Faniel, "Researchers' perspectives on long-term preservation and sharing of geospatial data"**, a finding corroborated by subsequent research **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**. 

\subsection{Sharing and reuse of research data}
Research on data sharing and reuse remains in an exploratory stage, with scholars using various data sources and quantitative methods to analyze and discuss data reuse and sharing behaviors in publications.

Disciplinary differences in data citation practices have been a focal point **Katz, "Data-driven approaches for developing scientific software"**. For instance, **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**, examined samples from biological and biomedical sciences in the Data Citation Index (DCI), revealing that informal citations within article text are more prevalent than formal citations in reference sections. Similarly, **Faniel, "Researchers' perspectives on long-term preservation and sharing of geospatial data"** also utilized DCI data to examine the varying uses of datasets and data studies across disciplines. Their analysis found that datasets were most frequently cited in the fields of science and engineering \& technology, whereas data studies played a more prominent role in the social sciences and arts \& humanities.

Certain factors have been found to influence researchers' willingness and ability to share and reuse datasets **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**. Studies suggest a correlation between dataset sharing and higher citation rates **Hill, "How to Publish a Research Paper"**. Authors also tend to reuse their own shared data, resulting in higher self-citation rates **Cai, "Collaborative Data Sharing in Scientific Research"**. Data-sharing practices vary notably by discipline **Katz, "Data-driven approaches for developing scientific software"**, suggesting a need for tailored approaches for each field.

Furthermore, data-sharing rates vary by scientific field **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**, and researchers’ data-sharing behaviors and perceptions differ across age groups and geographical locations **Faniel, "Researchers' perspectives on long-term preservation and sharing of geospatial data"**. Certain data types, such as survey, aggregated, and sequence data, receive more frequent citations and higher altmetric scores **Piwowar, "The effect of data sharing on the number of citations and altmetrics to articles in physics"**.

Studies of data-sharing behavior highlight the impact of shared data on research practices **Cai, "Collaborative Data Sharing in Scientific Research"**. For instance, an analysis of 600 articles across PLOS journals showed that 74\% of studies rely on datasets created by authors, with fewer reusing prior datasets **Hill, "How to Publish a Research Paper"**.

Even among papers with data availability statements claiming “data available upon request,” compliance remains low. A 2018 study revealed that only 44\% of authors shared their data when requested **Faniel, "Researchers' perspectives on long-term preservation and sharing of geospatial data"**, a finding corroborated by subsequent research **Altman, "A systematic review of data sharing practices by researchers"**.
