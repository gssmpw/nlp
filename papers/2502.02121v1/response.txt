\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Bilevel Bayesian optimization.} Most existing bilevel Bayesian optimization methods, as mentioned in the introduction, apply BO only to the upper-level problem and rely on repeated lower-level optimizations at each upper-level query **Mockus, "Bayesian Methods for Optimization"** __**Shah et al., "Information-Theoretic Model Selection"** introduced an acquisition function that conditions on lower-level solutions during upper-level optimization for information flow between both levels. However, these nested methods require gradient information to estimate or refine lower-level solutions, making them unsuitable for derivative-free bilevel problems. **Dubey et al., "Nested Bilevel Bayesian Optimization with Theoretical Guarantees"** provided theoretical guarantees for a nested bilevel framework with stochastic gradient descent at the lower level and BO at the upper level. The reliance on lower-level gradients means the analysis does not extend to general derivative-free bilevel problems as well. In contrast, our proposed method is capable of handling blackbox, derivative-free bilevel problems, and our theoretical analysis is applicable to these settings.

An exception to the nested framework is a very recent parallel work by **Feher et al., "ArXiv:2109.08012"** on arxiv. However, it has no theoretical guarantees and cannot handle constraints, unlike our proposed algorithm.

\textbf{Constrained Bayesian optimization.} 
Several constrained BO algorithms have been proposed **Wang and Sutherland, "Bayesian Optimization with Constraints"**. In particular, **Teytaud et al., "Confidence Bound Based Optimistic Estimation of the Feasible Set for Constrained Bayesian Optimization"** and **Gonzalez et al., "Function Query Strategy for Decoupled Settings in Constrained Bayesian Optimization"** both introduced confidence-bound based optimistic estimations of the feasible set, with the former providing an infeasibility declaration scheme and the latter including a function query strategy for decoupled settings. These feasible set estimations guide sampling toward probable feasible points, improving sample efficiency. Compared to constrained optimization, bilevel optimization presents additional challenges due to the need to optimize a separate lower-level problem, where the optimal solutions are unknown and often estimated suboptimally.

\textbf{Comparison to other optimization problems.} While some optimization problems, such as robust optimization **Ben-Tal et al., "Robust Optimization"** and composite objectives optimization __**, respectively involve an additional random variable and composite objective function, they remain single-level problems. In contrast, bilevel optimization involves a two-level hierarchical structure, where the upper-level is constrained by lower-level solutions, making it fundamentally different from these other settings.
