Illustrated throughout in full colour, this pioneering textbook, spanning a wide range of topics from physics to computer science, engineering, economics and the social sciences, introduces network science to an interdisciplinary audience. From the origins of the six degrees of separation to explaining why networks are robust to random failures, the author explores how viruses like Ebola and H1N1 spread, and why it is that our friends have more friends than we do. Using numerous real-world examples, this innovatively designed text includes clear delineation between undergraduate and graduate level material"},

abstract = {The prevalence of graph structures in real-world scenarios enables important tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Graphs in many domains follow a long-tailed distribution in their node degrees, i.e., a significant fraction of nodes are tail nodes with a small degree. Although recent graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn powerful node representations, they treat all nodes uniformly and are not tailored to the large group of tail nodes. In particular, there is limited structural information (i.e., links) on tail nodes, resulting in inferior performance. Toward robust tail node embedding, in this paper we propose a novel graph neural network called Tail-GNN. It hinges on the novel concept of transferable neighborhood translation, to model the variable ties between a target node and its neighbors. On one hand, Tail-GNN learns a neighborhood translation from the structurally rich head nodes (i.e., high-degree nodes), which can be further transferred to the structurally limited tail nodes to enhance their representations. On the other hand, the ties with the neighbors are variable across different parts of the graph, and a global neighborhood translation is inflexible. Thus, we devise a node-wise adaptation to localize the global translation w.r.t. each node. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed Tail-GNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},
