\begin{definition}{(Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs))}
A multimodal attributed graph is defined as $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{D})$, where $\mathcal{V}$, $\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{P}$, and $\mathcal{D}$ denote the sets of nodes, edges, images, and documents, respectively. Each node $v_i\in \mathcal{V}$ contains corresponding image information $p_{v_i}\in\mathcal{P}$ and textual information $d_{v_i}\in \mathcal{D}$.
\end{definition}
Some examples of MMAGs include (1) e-commerce produce graphs ($\mathcal{G}$), where product nodes ($v\in\mathcal{V}$) are associated with product image ($p \in \mathcal{P}$) and title ($d \in \mathcal{D}$); and (2) artwork graphs ($\mathcal{G}$), where artwork nodes ($v\in\mathcal{V}$) contain picture ($p \in \mathcal{P}$) and title ($d \in \mathcal{D}$).

\subsection{Problem Definition}\label{sec:prob-def}

\begin{definition}{(Node Multimodal Content Generation on MMAGs)}
In a multimodal attributed graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{D})$, given a node $v_i\in\mathcal{V}$ within the graph $\mathcal{G}$, the goal is to generate $p_{v_i}$ and $d_{v_i}$, the corresponding image and text at $v_i$, with a learned model $(\hat{p}_{v_i}, \hat{d}_{v_i}) = f(v_i, \mathcal{G})$.
\end{definition}
This problem has numerous real-world applications.
In the context of e-commerce, this translates to generating an image ($p_{v_i}$) and a title ($d_{v_i}$) for a product ($v_i$) based on a userâ€™s purchase history ($\mathcal{G}$), framing it as a generative recommendation task.
In the art domain, this involves generating an image ($p_{v_i}$) and a title ($d_{v_i}$) for an artwork ($v_i$) based on the associated artist's style or genre ($\mathcal{G}$), positioning it as a virtual artwork creation task.
