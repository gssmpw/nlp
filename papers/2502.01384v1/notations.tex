This appendix uses the following notations: $[\cardinality]$ denotes the set of integers $\{1, \hdots, \cardinality\}$,  $[t]_+\coloneqq\max\{0,t\}$, and $I_\cardinality$ stands for the $\cardinality\times \cardinality$ identity matrix. We also denote the diagonal matrix with diagonal components $(\bz_1,\hdots,\bz_\cardinality)$ by $\diag(\bz_1,\hdots,\bz_\cardinality)$. Finally, if $\bz = (\bz_1,\hdots,\bz_\cardinality)$, the same matrix will be denoted by $\diag(\bz)$.
