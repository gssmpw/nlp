\caption{Sample length statistics of selected shortest paths used for fine-tuning, before and after augmentation with zero-shot BoN samples, averaged across GSM8K and MATH and five main models. \textquoteleft Before' and \textquoteleft After' columns detail the average relative length of training data pre- and post-augmentation. \textquoteleft Ratio (\%)' indicates the proportion of each sample type after augmentation. \textbf{Replaced} refers to solutions for the same questions that were substituted based on shortest length selection. \textbf{New} denotes newly added samples from BoN that previously lacked correct solutions for each method.}
