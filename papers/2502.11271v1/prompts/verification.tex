\begin{textcolorbox}[Prompt for Verifier]
\textbf{Task:} Thoroughly evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the memory for fulfilling the given query, considering the potential need for additional tool usage.
\\\\
\textbf{Query:} \texttt{\{question\}}
\\
\textbf{Image:} \texttt{\{image\_info\}}
\\
\textbf{Available Tools:} \texttt{\{self.available\_tools\}}
\\
\textbf{Toolbox Metadata:} \texttt{\{self.toolbox\_metadata\}}
\\
\textbf{Initial Analysis:} \texttt{\{query\_analysis\}}
\\
\textbf{Memory (tools used and results):} \texttt{\{memory.get\_actions()\}}
\\\\
\textbf{Detailed Instructions:}

1. Carefully analyze the query, initial analysis, and image (if provided):

\quad - Identify the main objectives of the query.

\quad - Note any specific requirements or constraints mentioned.

\quad - If an image is provided, consider its relevance and what information it contributes.
\\\\
2. Review the available tools and their metadata:

\quad - Understand the capabilities and limitations and best practices of each tool.

\quad - Consider how each tool might be applicable to the query.
\\\\
3. Examine the memory content in detail:

\quad - Review each tool used and its execution results.

\quad - Assess how well each tool's output contributes to answering the query.
\\\\
4. Critical Evaluation (address each point explicitly):

\quad a) Completeness: Does the memory fully address all aspects of the query?

\quad\quad - Identify any parts of the query that remain unanswered.

\quad\quad - Consider if all relevant information has been extracted from the image (if applicable).

\quad b) Unused Tools: Are there any unused tools that could provide additional relevant information?

\quad\quad - Specify which unused tools might be helpful and why.

\quad c) Inconsistencies: Are there any contradictions or conflicts in the information provided?

\quad\quad - If yes, explain the inconsistencies and suggest how they might be resolved.

\quad d) Verification Needs: Is there any information that requires further verification due to tool limitations?

\quad\quad - Identify specific pieces of information that need verification and explain why.

\quad e) Ambiguities: Are there any unclear or ambiguous results that could be clarified by using another tool?

\quad\quad - Point out specific ambiguities and suggest which tools could help clarify them.
\\\\
5. Final Determination:
   Based on your thorough analysis, decide if the memory is complete and accurate enough to generate the final output, or if additional tool usage is necessary.
\\\\
\textbf{Response Format:}

\textless{}\texttt{analysis}\textgreater{}: Provide a detailed analysis of why the memory is sufficient. Reference specific information from the memory and explain its relevance to each aspect of the task. Address how each main point of the query has been satisfied.

\textless{}\texttt{stop\_signal}\textgreater{}: Whether to stop the problem solving process and proceed to generating the final output.

\quad * \texttt{"True"}: if the memory is sufficient for addressing the query to proceed and no additional available tools need to be used. If ONLY manual verification without tools is needed, choose \texttt{"True"}.

\quad * \texttt{"False"}: if the memory is insufficient and needs more information from additional tool usage.
