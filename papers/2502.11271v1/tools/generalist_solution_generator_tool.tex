The image shows four blue buckets, each containing five baseballs. The baseballs are white with red stitching, and the buckets have handles on the sides. The arrangement of the baseballs within each bucket is slightly different, but each bucket consistently holds five baseballs. The background is plain, emphasizing the buckets and their contents.
