\section{Positive Complexity Results} \label{sec:tractable}

This section highlights configurations that allow polynomial-time computation of various Shapley value variants. We first show that both local and global interventional and baseline SHAP values for WAs under HMM-modeled distributions can be computed in polynomial time (Theorem~\ref{thm:shapwa}). By reductions, this result extends to various other ML models (Theorem~\ref{cor:reductions}).

%This section focuses on configurations that enable the computation of various Shapley value variants in polynomial time. We begin by demonstrating that both local and global interventional and baseline SHAP values for the class of WAs under distributions modeled by HMMs can be computed in polynomial time (Theorem~\ref{thm:shapwa}). By reduction, this positive complexity result extends to other model families, including decision trees, tree ensembles used for regression, and linear regression models (Corollary~\ref{cor:reductions}).
