\section{Negative Complexity Results} \label{sec:intractable}
% Introduction of what this section is about

%In the previous section, we provided positive complexity results for Local and Global I-SHAP and B-SHAP variants. In this section, we present negative complexity findings. The first subsection addresses the intractability of computing Local I-SHAP for the family of RNN-ReLus  under the feature independence assumption. The second subsection focuses on scenarios where B-SHAP is difficult to compute exactly.
