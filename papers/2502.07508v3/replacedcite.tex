\textbf{Video Generation.} Recent advancements in video generation have been driven by powerful diffusion transformer-based models ____. Sora ____ has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating realistic and long-duration videos, establishing itself as a significant milestone in text-to-video generation. CogVideoX ____ introduced a 3D full attention mechanism and expert transformers to improve motion consistency and semantic alignment. HunyuanVideo ____ introduces a hybrid stream block with enhanced semantic understanding. 
% Collectively, these models have significantly advanced the video generation field by addressing challenges in motion coherence, text alignment, and resolution fidelity. 
However, several important challenges such as temporal inconsistency and the loss of fine-grained spatial details in video generation still persist.

\textbf{Temperature Parameter.} The temperature parameter is a well-known concept in deep learning, primarily used to control the distribution of attention or output probabilities in generative models ____. In natural language generation tasks, the temperature is often adjusted during inference to modulate the diversity of the generated text ____. 
A higher temperature increases randomness, promoting creativity, while a lower temperature encourages deterministic and coherent outputs. 
Recently, the concept has been explored in vision-related tasks, such as visual question answering and multimodal learning ____, where temperature adjustments are applied to balance multimodal attention distributions. However, its application in DiT-based video generation, particularly in enhancing temporal attention, remains underexplored.
