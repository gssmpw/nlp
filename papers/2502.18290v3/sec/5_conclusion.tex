\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose \project, the first to reveal a new backdoor threat towards the vision modality of LVLMs. Building on backdoored SSL vision encoders significantly induces visual hallucinations into the model, misleading and even destroying the model's functionality totally. In light of this, we aim to raise awareness of developers in ML community and further promote advanced backdoor defense studies in the future. More discussions are in Appendix~\ref{appendix:discussion}.
