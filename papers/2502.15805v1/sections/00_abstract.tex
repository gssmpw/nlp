We introduce \methodname{}, a novel fragment-based discrete flow matching framework for molecular graph generation. 
% FragFM constructs molecular graphs at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoding mechanism to reconstruct atom-level details. 
FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoding mechanism to reconstruct atom-level details. 
This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high chemical validity, enabling more efficient and scalable molecular generation.
We benchmark \methodname{} against state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based models on standard molecular generation benchmarks and natural product datasets, demonstrating superior performance in validity, property control, and sampling efficiency. 
Notably, \methodname{} achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity.
These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.
