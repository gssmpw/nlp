    \caption{\textbf{Randomly selected samples generated by DiGress trained on the COCONUT dataset.} The top row presents molecules with a heavy atom count below 30, while the bottom row includes those with a count between 30 and 60. Atom-based models often struggle to generate chemically stable structures, frequently producing molecules with sterically strained and chemically implausible fused ring systems (second in the top row; first, second, and third in the bottom row).}
