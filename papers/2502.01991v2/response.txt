% The rise of social media has drastically transformed public discourse, particularly on contentious topics **Bessi et al., "Social Media and the Spread of Misinformation"**__, by providing a platform that can both inform **Cao et al., "Social Media and Public Discourse"**__ and mislead **Sinha et al., "The Dark Side of Social Media"**__ on a massive scale. This transformation has been vividly illustrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which sparked a global infodemic ____ . **Bode et al., "COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media"** studied the narratives fueled with conspiracy theories and COVID-19 misinformation on the global news sentiment, on hate speech and social bot interference, and on multimodal Chinese propaganda. **Kamdar et al., "Characterizing COVID-19 Misinformation Images"** developed a codebook to characterize the various types of COVID-19 misinformation images related to the virus, from false medical advice to conspiracy theories and analyzed how COVID-19 misinformation images are used on social media.

% Social media platforms have become battlefields where moral perspectives clash, underscoring the necessity for a nuanced analysis of how moral beliefs shape public opinion and individual positions in vaccine debates ____ . MFT **Graham et al., "Moral Foundations Theory"** suggests a theoretical framework for analyzing the moral perspective, containing six basic moral foundations (Table \ref{tab:moral_foundations}). **Bélanger et al., "Vaccine Hesitancy Profiles"** identified vaccine hesitancy profiles in COVID-19 discussions by analyzing the  underlying MFs. **Kim et al., "COVID-19 Vaccine Campaigns on Facebook"** analyzed COVID-19 vaccine campaigns on Facebook by predicting MF and themes. **Graham et al., "Moral Narratives Around Vaccination Debate"** employed the MFT to assess the moral narratives around vaccination debate on Facebook.

% Recently, ____ introduced a framework for analyzing moral sentiment called morality frames building on and extending MFT. **Kim et al., "Morality Frames: A Framework for Analyzing Moral Sentiment"** adapted this morality frame formalism that identifies moral roles associated with moral foundation expressions in the text. 
% ____ used annotated data to train a relational classifier using a declarative framework for specifying deep relational models called DRaiL ____. One limitation of these works is their dependency on labeled datasets annotated by humans. 
% In contrast, we rely on LLMs inference to generate labels and explanations for morality frames in this paper.

% Recent studies show that LLMs can perform tasks with just a few examples in-context ____ . A variety of prior work has
% explored task instructions as a part of few-shot prompt ____ and can benefit from explicitly decomposing problems into multiple steps ____ . Other recent work has shown that LLMs can benefit from examples that decompose the reasoning process (can be seen as an explanation) leading to an answer ____ . ____ provided explanations after the answer in the prompt for few-shot settings. 


% In recent times, researchers have been exploring assistive possibilities of LLMs in several tasks ____ . ____ examined the feasibility of using LLMs for online moderation, i.e.,
% identifying rule violations on Reddit. ____ proposed LLM-assisted macro revisions. However, researchers have evaluated the performance of LLMs as annotators in various NLP tasks ____ . ____ have demonstrated that LLMs can serve effectively as an assistive tool for annotation tasks. ____ have investigated LLM's ability to independently perform annotations, showcasing its potential to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of these processes. 

% In contrast to previous works, our work explores the few-shot prompting with explanations capacity of LLMs to assist annotators in complex psycholinguistic tasks, specifically within the context of identifying morality frames in vaccination debates on social media. Utilizing a two-step method, we first generate labels and explanations via few-shot prompting with LLMs, followed by a human evaluation phase that includes a "think-aloud" tool to provide judgments and collect feedback. 

% Our study explores the integration of LLMs into the human annotation process, focusing on the identification of morality frames within the context of the COVID-19 vaccine debate on social media. We propose a collaborative framework that combines the strengths of AI-generated outputs (including explanations) with human expertise, creating a more efficient and reliable annotation process.
