\begin{abstract}
Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to have limited expressive power, due to their message passing structure. 
One mechanism for circumventing this limitation is to add unique node identifiers (IDs), which break the symmetries that underlie the expressivity limitation. 
In this work, we highlight a key limitation of the ID framework, and propose an approach for addressing it. We begin by observing that the final output of the GNN should clearly not depend on the specific IDs used. We then show that in practice this does not hold, and thus the learned network does not possess this desired structural property. 
Such invariance to node IDs may be enforced in several ways, and we discuss their theoretical properties. 
 We then propose a novel regularization method that effectively enforces ID invariance to the network. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves ID invariance and, in turn, often boosts generalization performance.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we harness the theoretical power of unique node identifiers (IDs) to enhance the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We show that, in practice, the final output of GNNs incorporating node IDs is not invariant to the specific choice of IDs.\newline
We provide a theoretical analysis that motivates an approach which explicitly enforces invariance to IDs in GNNs while taking advantage of their expressive power. Building on our theoretical results, we propose {\ourmethod}, an explicit regularization technique, which is GNN agnostic.\newline
 Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate across real-world and synthetic datasets
 that \ourmethod~ considerably improves invariance to node IDs, as well as generalization, extrapolation and training convergence time. These results highlight \ourmethod~as an efficient solution for improving the performance of GNNs through IDs utilization, making it a valuable tool for use with any GNN.
