In the following, we report all the celebrity descriptions.

\paragraph{J K Rowling} J K Rowling is a British author, and writer of the fantasy novel “Harry Potter”. In recent years she often expressed derogatory remarks about the transgender community.

\paragraph{Kanye West} Kanye West, also known as Ye, is an American rapper. He has frequently spoken out on political and social issues with controversial opinions on topics such as abortion, capital punishment, welfare and gun rights. On frequent occasions he expressed antisemitic thoughts, stating his admiration for Adolf Hitler, denying the Holocaust, and supporting other conspiracy views against Jewish people, which led him to being banned from Twitter for 8 months.

In 2023 she performed as the protagonist in the Disney movie “The Little Mermaid”, a choice that was subject to widespread criticism because in the cartoon the little mermaid was depicted as white, while Bailey is black.
