\section{Checkout Questionnaire}\label{app-checkout_qst}
We report the questions asked to the annotators in the checkout questionnaire:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item What opinion do you have about the topic of \textit{social media shaming} after the annotation? 
    \item How did you find the annotation task? (difficult? emotionally impactful? etc.)
    \item Is there anything you would like to add?
    \item Is there anything you would like to change?
    \item Did the moral questionnaire influence the way you performed the annotation? 
    \item Did you perceive the completion of the questionnaire and annotation as thematically related?
    \item How would you use a tool that can recognize social media shaming? 
\end{itemize}

This questionnaire was not mandatory and received $33$ answers.
