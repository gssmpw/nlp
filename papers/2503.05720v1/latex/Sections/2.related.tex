\textit{Canceling} is  ``an expression of agency, a choice to withdraw oneâ€™s attention from someone or something whose values, (in)action, or speech are so offensive, one no longer wishes to grace them with their presence, time and money'' \cite{Clark2020}. The phenomenon, which originated in Black Twitter \cite{Clark2015BlackTB, Ng2022}, has evolved into a mainstream practice within internet activism that shifted towards online censorship, silencing, and aggression with growing concerns about safety in social media platforms. Currently, there is a lack of NLP works on cancel culture with the exception of a dataset generated automatically by combining sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition \cite{erker-etal-2022-cancel}. Our work is the first attempt to develop a manually annotated corpus on this complex phenomenon.

The growing interest of the NLP community in moral pluralism \cite{graham2008moral,schwartz2012overview} resulted in the creation of resources \cite{araque2020moralstrength,hoover2020moral} aimed at analyzing the impact of morality in perceiving harmful contents \cite{stranisci2021expression,davani2024disentangling}. Moreover, there is an active line of research that studies the morality of LLMs \cite{abdulhai-etal-2024-moral,rottger-etal-2024-political}. Our work apply moral pluralism to understand canceling attitudes in social media platforms, where the morality of LLMs can have an impact in content moderation.
