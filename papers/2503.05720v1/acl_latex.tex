\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Canceling is a morally-driven phenomenon that hinders the development of safe social media platforms and contributes to ideological polarization. To address this issue we present the \textbf{C}anceling \textbf{A}ttitudes \textbf{De}ection (CADE) dataset, an annotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of disagreements in evaluating people canceling attitudes on social media. Specifically, we study the impact of annotators' morality in their perception of canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation of disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator's judgments heavily depend on the type of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to develop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are perpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their detection. 

\textbf{WARNING:} the CADE corpus could contain racist, sexist, violent, and generally offensive content.

\section*{Limitations}
While this work moves towards the development of participatory approaches to Natural Language Processing, the annotator pool is not balanced, especially leaning towards the White and Educated population. Moreover, although the chosen events had worldwide coverage, the majority of the annotators do not come from the same social background as the target celebrities. This made it possible to carry out the experiment with people from different nationalities, who, however, experienced cancel culture more as spectators than actors. In the future, we plan to expand the annotation lab to a more diverse group of annotators along all the sociodemographic axes. 
Finally, the current design involved watching only one video per celebrity, with exposure to the framing implicit in the political orientation of the chosen news source. While we aimed to ensure political diversity across the six selected videos, in the future, we intend to achieve this within the same canceling event.

\section*{Ethical Statement}
This research relies on the voluntary work of those who participated in the Annotation Labs. All the involved annotators freely accepted to take part to the laboratory, for which no compensation was provided. 
We adopted all the measures to protect data privacy and safeguard personal information. The work has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution of one of the authors. %is affiliated with. 

In the future, we plan to expand this work to a less Eurocentric context, concerning both the chosen celebrities and the involved annotators, looking at it as a necessary improvement to foster diversity.
