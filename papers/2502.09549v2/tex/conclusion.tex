\section{Conclusion}
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of phishing domains, focusing on maliciously registered domains, DNS behaviors, and detection timelines. We find that 66.1\% of domains are maliciously registered, with attackers favoring low-cost TLDs like \cc{.top} and \cc{.tk}, and frequently using hosting services like AWS. 
Maliciously registered domains are detected faster than compromised ones (median 16.3 vs. 86 days), yet significant delays persist across blocklists. 
Some domains could take over a year to be listed. 
Our findings highlight the need for improved blocklist synchronization and monitoring of widely abused TLDs to mitigate phishing threats effectively.
