\section{Example of Bulk Registration.}~\label{apx:bulk_registration}

As shown in~\autoref{fig:alibaba_bulk_registration}, AlibabaCloud provides extensive features that facilitate bulk domain registration while offering promotional pricing for new users. The platform advertises and combines several capabilities that make bulk registration highly accessible: deeply discounted pricing for new users (domains for as low as \$0.5), explicit bulk management tools allowing simultaneous registration of multiple domains, and automation tools for managing multiple domains. While these features serve legitimate business purposes, they can be exploited by attackers to register multiple phishing domains efficiently at minimal cost. The combination of bulk registration capabilities, automation tools, and aggressive pricing promotions makes the platform particularly attractive for malicious actors orchestrating large-scale phishing campaigns.
