abstract = {Ontology (and more generally: Knowledge Graph) Matching is a challenging task where information in natural language is one of the most important signals to process. With the rise of Large Language Models, it is possible to incorporate this knowledge in a better way into the matching pipeline. A number of decisions still need to be taken, e.g., how to generate a prompt that is useful to the model, how information in the KG can be formulated in prompts, which Large Language Model to choose, how to provide existing correspondences to the model, how to generate candidates, etc. In this paper, we present a prototype that explores these questions by applying zero-shot and few-shot prompting with multiple open Large Language Models to different tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). We show that with only a handful of examples and a well-designed prompt, it is possible to achieve results that are en par with supervised matching systems which use a much larger portion of the ground truth.},

	abstract = {Accessing and utilizing enterprise or Web data that is scattered across multiple data sources is an important task for both applications and users. Ontology-based data integration, where an ontology mediates between the raw data and its consumers, is a promising approach to facilitate such scenarios. This approach crucially relies on useful mappings to relate the ontology and the data, the latter being typically stored in relational databases. A number of systems to support the construction of such mappings have recently been developed. A generic and effective benchmark for reliable and comparable evaluation of the practical utility of such systems would make an important contribution to the development of ontology-based data integration systems and their application in practice. We have proposed such a benchmark, called RODI. In this paper, we present a new version of RODI, which signiﬁcantly extends our previous benchmark, and we evaluate various systems with it. RODI includes test scenarios from the domains of scientiﬁc conferences, geographical data, and oil and gas exploration. Scenarios are constituted of databases, ontologies, and queries to test expected results. Systems that compute relational-to-ontology mappings can be evaluated using RODI by checking how well they can handle various features of relational schemas and ontologies, and how well the computed mappings work for query answering. Using RODI, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven systems.},

	abstract = {Mapping Relational Databases (RDB) to RDF is an active field of research. The majority of data on the current Web is stored in RDBs. Therefore, bridging the conceptual gap between the relational model and RDF is needed to make the data available on the Semantic Web. In addition, recent research has shown that Semantic Web technologies are useful beyond the Web, especially if data from different sources has to be exchanged or integrated. Many mapping languages and approaches were explored leading to the ongoing standardization effort of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) carried out in the RDB2RDF Working Group (WG). The goal and contribution of this paper is to provide a featurebased comparison of the state-of-the-art RDB-to-RDF mapping languages. It should act as a guide in selecting a RDB-to-RDF mapping language for a given application scenario and its requirements w.r.t. mapping features. Our comparison framework is based on use cases and requirements for mapping RDBs to RDF as identified by the RDB2RDF WG. We apply this comparison framework to the state-of-the-art RDB-to-RDF mapping languages and report the findings in this paper. As a result, our classification proposes four categories of mapping languages: direct mapping, read-only general-purpose mapping, readwrite general-purpose mapping, and special-purpose mapping. We further provide recommendations for selecting a mapping language.},

However, to connect results of these solutions – i.e., the semantically annotated data – with real-world applications, this semantic data needs to be connected to actionable events. A lot of work has been done (both semantically as non-semantically) to describe and deﬁne Web services, but there is still a gap on a more abstract level, i.e., describing interfaces independent of the technology used. In this paper, we present a data model, speciﬁcation, and ontology to semantically declare and describe functions independently of the used technology. This way, we can declare and use actionable events in semantic applications, without restricting ourselves to programming language-dependent implementations. The ontology allows for extensions, and is proposed as a possible solution for semantic applications in various domains.},

	abstract = {Though data analysis tools continue to improve, analysts still expend an inordinate amount of time and effort manipulating data and assessing data quality issues. Such "data wrangling" regularly involves reformatting data values or layout, correcting erroneous or missing values, and integrating multiple data sources. These transforms are often difficult to specify and difficult to reuse across analysis tasks, teams, and tools. In response, we introduce Wrangler, an interactive system for creating data transformations. Wrangler combines direct manipulation of visualized data with automatic inference of relevant transforms, enabling analysts to iteratively explore the space of applicable operations and preview their effects. Wrangler leverages semantic data types (e.g., geographic locations, dates, classification codes) to aid validation and type conversion. Interactive histories support review, refinement, and annotation of transformation scripts. User study results show that Wrangler significantly reduces specification time and promotes the use of robust, auditable transforms instead of manual editing.},

abstract = {An increasing number of structured knowledge bases have become available on the Web, enabling many new forms of analyses and applications. However, the fact that the data is being published by different parties with different vocabularies and ontologies means that there is a high degree of heterogeneity and no common schema. At the same time, the abundance of different human languages across unstructured data presents a similar problem, because most text mining tools only cater to the English language. This paper presents solutions for these two kinds of heterogeneity. It introduces Klint, a Web-based system that automatically creates mappings to transform knowledge from heterogeneous sources into FrameBase, which is a broad linked data schema that enables the representation of a wide range of knowledge. With Klint, a user can review and edit the mappings with a streamlined interface, which in turn allows for human-level accuracy with minimum human effort. The paper further describes how FrameBase can be extended to support multilingual labels, which can aid in extending current tools for integrating English text into FrameBase knowledge.},

	abstract = {The schema matching problem can be defined as the task of finding semantic relationships between schema elements existing in different data repositories. Despite the existence of elaborated graphic tools for helping to find such matches, this task is usually manually done. In this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary approach to addressing the problem of automatically finding complex matches between schemas of semantically related data repositories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that is capable of discovering complex schema matches using only the data instances. Since we only exploit the data stored in the repositories for this task, we rely on matching strategies that are based on record deduplication (aka, entity-oriented strategy) and information retrieval (aka, value-oriented strategy) techniques to find complex schema matches during the evolutionary process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an experimental evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets. The results show that our approach is able to find complex matches with high accuracy, similar to that obtained by more elaborated (hybrid) approaches, despite using only evidence based on the data instances.},

	abstract = {Automating schema mapping is challenging. Previous approaches to automating schema mapping focus mainly on computing direct matches between two schemas. Schemas, however, rarely match directly. Thus, to complete the task of schema mapping, we must also compute indirect matches. In this paper, we present a composite approach for generating a source-to-target mapping that contains both direct and many indirect matches between a source schema and a target schema. Recognizing expected-data values associated with schema elements and applying schema-structure heuristics are the key ideas needed to compute indirect matches. Experiments we have conducted over several real-world application domains show encouraging results, yielding about 90\% precision and recall measures for both direct and indirect matches.},

	abstract = {Several standards are expressed using XML Schema syntax, since the XML is the default standard for data exchange in the Internet. However, several applications need semantic support offered by domain ontologies and semantic Web tools like logic-based reasoners. Thus, there is a strong need for interoperability between XML Schema and OWL. This can be achieved if the XML schema constructs are expressed in OWL, where the enrichment with OWL domain ontologies and further semantic processing are possible. After semantic processing, the derived OWL constructs should be converted back to instances of the original schema. We present in this paper XS2OWL, a model and a system that allow the transformation of XML Schemas to OWL-DL constructs. These constructs can be used to drive the automatic creation of OWL domain ontologies and individuals. The XS2OWL transformation model allows the correct conversion of the derived knowledge from OWL-DL back to XML constructs valid according to the original XML Schemas, in order to be used transparently by the applications that follow XML Schema syntax of the standards.},

In this paper we present a new classification of schema-based matching techniques that builds on the top of state of the art in both schema and ontology matching. Some innovations are in introducing new criteria which are based on (i) general properties of matching techniques, (ii) interpretation of input information, and (iii) the kind of input information. In particular, we distinguish between approximate and exact techniques at schema-level; and syntactic, semantic, and external techniques at element- and structure-level. Based on the classification proposed we overview some of the recent schema/ontology matching systems pointing which part of the solution space they cover. The proposed classification provides a common conceptual basis, and, hence, can be used for comparing different existing schema/ontology matching techniques and systems as well as for designing new ones, taking advantages of state of the art solutions.},
