\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The primary contribution of this paper is \solx, a system for
generating tests from issue descriptions before issue resolution.
\solx outperforms the prior state of the art in fail-to-pass
tests generated while also costing less.  
%This paper also contributes
%\tdd, a new benchmark for the same problem statement, mined from
%real-world GitHub issues with strict filters and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that generated tests can improve
patches generated by SWE agents, helping them reach a precision of
between 65\% and 92\%. %We share \tdd and scripts for \solx in
%supplementary material.
