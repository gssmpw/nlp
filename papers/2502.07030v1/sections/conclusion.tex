In this paper, we have presented a hybrid mesh-volumetric model for 3D head avatars which is specially constructed with a rigged prism lattice. We have shown that our model reconstructs the geometry and texture of hair on both the scalp and the face. It can also be exported into a triangle-based model which can be animated at real-time frame rates on edge devices with image quality comparable to the state of the art. We have validated our exported models on mobile devices with a cross-platform implementation. Being a web application, we believe our models have the potential to run on other edge devices such as smart TVs and car infotainment systems, as long as a suitable web browser with WebGL support is available.

\textbf{Limitations and Future Work.}
While our current method can reconstruct hair, our approach cannot model physics-based animation such as the effect of gravity on hair. This is a limitation shared by previous work that does not explicitly model individual strands or strips of hair. Our model of the mouth interior is also quite simple, and does not deal with complex motions such as protruding the tongue. In future work, we intend to handle these cases. We also intend to incorporate a physically-based lighting model to allow for the separation of lighting and material properties during avatar reconstruction.
