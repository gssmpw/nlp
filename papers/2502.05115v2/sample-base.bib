%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Effective communication between clinicians and parents of young children with developmental delays can decrease parents' anxiety, help them handle bad news, and improve their adherence to proposed interventions. However, parents have reported dissatisfaction regarding their current communication with clinicians, and they face cognitive and emotional challenges when discussing their child's developmental delays. In this paper, we present visualization as a facilitator of parent-clinician communication and how it could address existing communication challenges. Parents and clinicians anticipated visualization webtools would aid their communication by helping parents gain a better understanding of their child, acting as objective evidence, and highlighting the strength of the child as well as important medical concepts. In addition, visualization can act as a longitudinal record, helping parents track, explore, and share their child's developmental progress. Finally, we propose visualization as a tool to guide parents in their transition from feeling emotional and disempowered to advocating with confidence.},

abstract = {This interactivity demonstration paper highlights how a patient-operated mHealth solution can be designed to improve clinician understanding of a patient's health status during a first face-to-face encounter. Patients can use smartphones to retrieve difficult-to-recall-from memory personal health information. This provides an opportunity to improve patient-clinician collaboration. To explore this idea, a mixed method study with 12 clinicians in a simulated encounter was conducted. A smartphone personal health record was prototyped and used for an experimental study. Communication, efficiency, and effectiveness was improved for clinicians who experienced the prototype. Study outcomes included a validated set of design guidelines for mHealth tools to support better patient-clinician communication.},

abstract = {Diagnostic radiology reports are increasingly being made available to patients and their family members. However, these reports are not typically comprehensible to lay recipients, impeding effective communication about report findings. In this paper, we present three studies informing the design of a prototype to foster patient-clinician communication about radiology report content. First, analysis of questions posted in online health forums helped us identify patients' information needs. Findings from an elicitation study with seven radiologists provided necessary domain knowledge to guide prototype design. Finally, a clinical field study with 14 pediatric patients, their parents and clinicians, revealed positive responses of each stakeholder when using the prototype to interact with and discuss the patient's current CT or MRI report and allowed us to distill three use cases: co-located communication, preparing for the consultation, and reviewing radiology data. We draw on our findings to discuss design considerations for supporting each of these use cases.},

abstract = {Challenging behaviors significantly impact learning and socialization of autistic children and can stress and burden their caregivers. Documentation of challenging behaviors is fundamental for identifying what environmental factors influence them, such as how others respond to a child's such behaviors. Caregiver-tracked data on their child's challenging behaviors can help clinical experts make informed recommendations about how to manage such behaviors. To support caregivers in recording their children's challenging behaviors, we developed GeniAuti, a mobile-based data-collection tool built upon a clinical data collection form to document challenging behaviors and other clinically relevant contextual information such as place, duration, intensity, and what triggers such behaviors. Through an open-ended deployment with 19 parent-child pairs and three expert collaborators, caregivers found GeniAuti valuable for (1) becoming more attentive and reflective to behavioral contexts, including their own response strategies, (2) discovering positive aspects of their children's behaviors, and (3) promoting collaboration with clinical experts around the caregiver-tracked data to develop tailored intervention strategies for their children. However, participant experiences surface challenges of logging behaviors in social circumstances, conflicting views between caregivers and clinical experts around the structured recording process, and emotional struggles resulting from recording and reflecting on intensely negative experiences. Considering the complex nature of caregiver-based health tracking and caregiver--clinician collaboration, we suggest design opportunities for facilitating negotiations between caregivers and clinicians and accounting for caregivers' emotional needs.},

As a result, clinicians, typically trained for in-person visits, must learn to communicate both health information and non-verbal affective signals to patients through a digital medium. We introduce a system called ReflectLive that senses and provides real-time feedback about non-verbal communication behaviors to clinicians so they can improve their communication behaviors. A user evaluation with 10 clinicians showed that the real-time feedback helped clinicians maintain better eye contact with patients and was not overly distracting. Clinicians reported being more aware of their non-verbal communication behaviors and reacted positively to summaries of their conversational metrics, motivating them to want to improve. Using ReflectLive as a probe, we also discuss the benefits and concerns around automatically quantifying the "soft skills" and complexities of clinician-patient communication, the controllability of behaviors, and the design considerations for how to present real-time and summative feedback to clinicians.},

abstract = {With the wide adoption of information infrastructures in healthcare (IIH), citizens and healthcare professionals now carry out intensive "data work' as part of their healthcare and self-management practices. For example, citizens use mobile apps to track personal health data for both formal and informal usages, clinicians rely on electronic health records (EHR) to document patient information, and hospital administrators use EHRs to generate data to monitor quality and efficiency of healthcare services. The creation, accumulation, management, and communication of data is increasingly central to patient work, clinical work, and management and governance of healthcare providers. To better understand data work in healthcare, this workshop aims to convene researchers from different disciplines to discuss data work performed among the entire ecosystem of clinical care delivery from patients to clinicians to administrators. Critical topics include but are not limited to: patient data work (both voluntary and compelled by clinicians as part of treatment); algorithmic authority of information infrastructure and effects on the exercise of expertise and discretion of healthcare professions; clinician demands for documentation (and balancing these demands with patient-centered care); new forms of healthcare data work, including new occupations and tasks; and data-driven accountability and management in healthcare.},

Our research extends this body of work to identify caregivers as key decision-makers and boundary actors in mobilizing and managing care. We draw on qualitative data collected via 20 semi-structured interviews to examine caregiving responsibilities in physical and remote care interactions within households in urban India. Our findings demonstrate the crucial intermediating roles family caregivers take on while situated along the boundaries separating healthcare professionals, patients and other household members, and online/offline communities. We propose design recommendations for supporting caregivers in intermediating patient-centered care, such as through training content and expert feedback mechanisms for remote care, collaborative tracking mechanisms integrating patient- and caregiver-generated health data, and caregiving-centered online health communities. We conclude by arguing for recognizing caregivers as critical stakeholders in patient-centered care who might constitute technologically assisted pathways to care.},

Although CSCW researchers have shown the potential for social computing technologies to help patients and their caregivers manage chronic conditions and support health behavior change, few studies focus on caregivers' role during a multi-day hospital stay. To explore this space, we conducted an interview and observation study of patients and caregivers in the inpatient setting. In this paper, we describe how caregivers and patients coordinate and collaborate to manage patients' care and wellbeing during a hospital stay. We define and describe five roles caregivers adopt: companion, assistant, representative, navigator, and planner, and show how patients and caregivers negotiate these roles and responsibilities throughout a hospital stay. Finally, we identify key design considerations for technology to support patients and caregivers during a hospital stay.},

We worked with occupational therapists to develop an application for remote assessment of the safety of patients' homes by occupational therapists with the assistance of family caregivers. We evaluated the application with family caregivers and found two features unique to communication between family caregivers and healthcare professionals: Caregivers want to be able to direct healthcare professionals' attention to support problem-solving at home, and they include their perspective on how to best meet the patient's health needs. We discuss the importance of these findings for home systems in the domain of long-term chronic care.},

abstract = {Children Living with Health Complexity (CLHC), whose multiple, severe and chronic conditions differentiate them from those with “complicated” conditions, rely life-long on a vast and ever-shifting array of care providers. Their parent caregivers face a fragmented health care system, disconnected medical records, inter-stakeholder communication barriers and an impenetrable accumulation of documentation – from mundane to life-critical, and largely on paper. They must coordinate care while organizing, tracking and transmitting trends in many health parameters to myriad care providers. We engaged with parent caregivers of CLHC from 12 families through an iterative, 3-phase co-design process to understand their needs for a future digital management system. We share our deepened understanding of their information-centered challenges, a set of principles for how design best-practices need to shift when targeting this acutely high-needs group, and a medium-fidelity prototype user interface which from the ground-up prioritizes caregiver-centered data integration and humanization of the child and family, as well as integrated health record access.},

abstract = {Caregiver mental health disorders increase the risk of insecure infant attachment and can negatively impact multiple aspects of child development, including cognitive, emotional, and social growth. Infant-caregiver interactions contain subtle psychological and behavioral cues that reveal these adverse effects, underscoring the need for analytical methods to assess them effectively. The Face-to-Face-Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm is a key approach in psychological research for investigating these dynamics, and the Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases revised German edition (ICEP-R) annotation scheme provides a structured framework for evaluating FFSF interactions. However, manual annotation is labor-intensive and limits scalability, thus hindering a deeper understanding of early developmental impairments. To address this, we developed a computational method that automates the annotation of caregiver-infant interactions using features extracted from audio-visual foundational models. Our approach was tested on 92 FFSF video sessions. Findings demonstrate that models based on bidirectional LSTM and linear classifiers show varying effectiveness depending on the role and feature modality. Specifically, bidirectional LSTM models generally perform better in predicting complex infant engagement phases across multimodal features, while linear models show competitive performance, particularly with unimodal feature encodings like Wav2Vec2-BERT. To support further research, we share our raw feature dataset annotated with ICEP-R labels, enabling broader refinement of computational methods in this area.},

Music therapy is valuable for supporting dementia care, but not always accessible. Technologies could potentially facilitate accessible, home-based music therapy support, but need to be carefully evaluated. We conducted an 8-week field trial of a prototype mobile application, MATCH, with caregivers and people living with dementia. MATCH contains training videos and suggested playlists showing how to use music for specific care needs. MATCH, and music streaming broadly, enabled caregivers to add new strategies to their care repertoire, addressing a range of care needs and enhancing the care relationship. To make MATCH work, however, caregivers needed to fit it into complex care environments and existing technologies. We argue that digital therapeutic tools need to be adopted by caregivers to fit their individual contexts, and this can challenge assumptions about how therapeutic tools will work in practice.},

abstract = {In low-and middle-income countries like India, people with severe mental illness (PSMI) rely on their families as a primary source of care, given the lack of support from healthcare systems. The demanding nature of caregiving places significant physical and mental demands on caregivers, who are the primary source of support to PSMI. We explore how caregivers in under-resourced settings can be better supported through everyday digital technologies. We conducted interviews with caregivers (from urban and rural India), as well as workshops with professionals from Indian NGOs that work directly with PSMIs. We found that technology has the potential to (1) provide carer-centred support that empowers carers who experience stigma and issues with existing support networks; (2) provide support for carers to overcome barriers and progress in the recovery of the PSMI. We conclude with design considerations, proposing how an online peer community can leverage carers’ expertise to actualise support provision.},

This paper reports findings from an interview study with parents of children hospitalized for cancer treatment. We used the Role Theory framework from the social sciences to show how parents adopt and enact caregiving roles during hospitalization and the challenges they experience as they adapt to this stressful situation. We show how parents experience 'role strain' as they attempt to divide caregiving work and introduce the concept of 'inter-caregiver information disparity.' We propose design opportunities for caregiving coordination technologies to better support caregiving roles in multi-caregiver teams.},

abstract = {In families composed of parents and children, the health of parents and children is often interrelated: the health of children can have an impact on the health of parents, and vice versa. However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self-management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.},

Calendar systems and medication containers, the main types of time-based objects studied, were used as part of two family-based collaborative work practices: 1) prompting health management activities, and 2) safeguarding these activities. Additionally, these artifacts were part of two social interaction patterns that managed emotional intimacy: 1) expressing support, and 2) hiding and disguising illness. Accordingly, home-based illness management may be more collaborative than previously recognized. Moreover, through their interactive incorporation into family life, time-based objects are laden with psychosocial significance. Breakdowns in temporal support were also evident, and were accompanied by: missed medication events; rationing of medications; medication errors; and difficulties with preparation for medical appointments. We propose novel artifact designs to better support patients and their families in managing the temporal aspects of chronic illness together.},

abstract = {This work investigates the role of sound and technology in the everyday lives of people with chronic primary pain. Our primary goal was to inform the first participatory design workshop of Sound of Care, a new eHealth system for pain self-management. We used an ethical stakeholder analysis to inform a round of exploratory interviews, run with 8 participants including people with chronic primary pain, carers, and healthcare workers. We found that sound and technology serve as important but often unstructured tool, helping with distraction, mood regulation and sleep. The experience of pain and musical preferences are highly personal, and communicating or understanding pain can be challenging, even within family members. To address the gaps in current chronic pain self-management care, we propose the use a sound-based AI-driven system, a Digital Pain Companion, using sonification to create a shared decision-making space, enhancing agency over treatment in a co-operative care environment.},

abstract = {Every patient deserves the opportunity to participate in a shared decision-making (SDM) process when deciding on their medical treatment. However, many cancer patients are not afforded this opportunity, due to barriers such as limited health literacy and lack of access to clinical resources, especially among low-income, rural, and minoritized populations. This prompts a difficult question: Can technologies such as AI serve as useful tools to assist clinicians and patients in their discussions about treatment options? In this paper, we report a needs-assessment and co-development study involving six medical professionals who were engaged in providing cancer care. Our goal was to establish the conceptual groundwork for developing i-SDM-an AI-based application aimed at fostering more equitable, scalable, and accessible SDM processes. The findings help to clarify the contours of emerging opportunities and challenges for AI integrations in clinical SDM with the goal of improving patient engagement, knowledge, and buy-in for treatment decisions.},

While patients often value the ability to bring in different forms of self-report data to convey their lived experiences, they often struggle to make their data practically usable in clinical settings. To better center patient needs in communicating illness experiences in clinical contexts, we explore the idea of patient annotations to digital clinical self-report measures, specifically in the context of discontinuing antidepressants. Through interviews with 20 patients with AT Annotator, a digital aid to introduce the concept of annotations, we found that participants perceived annotations to digital clinical measures as a means to enrich self-report measures and reduce the cognitive and emotional burden of logging. However, concerns were raised regarding potential disruptions in patient-provider relationships and the sensitive and complex nature of mental health contexts. We discuss opportunities for annotations to promote patient-centered communication by balancing with clinical practicality and incorporating customization support for patients' communication needs.},

abstract = {Today’s AI systems for medical decision support often succeed on benchmark datasets in research papers but fail in real-world deployment. This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.},

abstract = {Despite the plethora of telehealth applications to assist home-based older adults and healthcare providers, basic messaging and phone calls are still the most common communication methods, which suffer from limited availability, information loss, and process inefficiencies. One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.},

Data science teams think of innovations users do not want, while domain experts think of innovations that cannot be built. A lack of effective ideation seems to be a breakdown point. How might multidisciplinary teams identify buildable and desirable use cases? This paper presents a first hand account of ideating AI concepts to improve critical care medicine. As a team of data scientists, clinicians, and HCI researchers, we conducted a series of design workshops to explore more effective approaches to AI concept ideation and problem formulation. We detail our process, the challenges we encountered, and practices and artifacts that proved effective. We discuss the research implications for improved collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and discuss the role HCI might play in reducing the high failure rate experienced in AI innovation.},

Human Digital Twins, i.e., digital representations of the patient, could help address this challenge by monitoring the patient’s condition via sensors and communicating it to the caregivers through corresponding user interfaces. However, existing user interfaces in stroke rehabilitation primarily focus on the interaction between patients or therapists. This paper proposes a novel dashboard designed explicitly for informal caregivers in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation. The dashboard supports easy-to-understand communication of complex patient data and provides tools to involve informal caregivers in the patient’s therapy process. Feedback from semi-structured interviews with informal caregivers validates the critical need for corresponding user interfaces but also raises questions concerning the design of visualization and data privacy.},

However, current approaches do not adequately involve all relevant stakeholders, and primarily focus on addressing symptoms, following a medical model of disability that is extrinsic to neurodivergent interests. To address this, we employed a multi-step, multi-stakeholder approach (N=31). First, we conducted 1) interviews with children with ADHD and their care ecosystem followed by 2) a co-design pilot with one child with ADHD and his therapists and an interview with a UX designer and an occupational therapist. We then employed 3) co-design sessions with neurotypical children and children with ADHD, and 4) a focus group with their therapists. We identified communication and reflection as key concepts for empowering and promoting the well-being of children with ADHD and their care ecosystem. We contribute design implications for future systems aiming to promote the overall well-being of this population.},

Less has been done in understanding and minimizing the burden of caregiving in caregivers' own lives. We conducted a qualitative interview study to understand their experiences in caregiving. The findings reveal a great magnitude of challenges in the caregivers' day-to-day lives, ranging from the physical and social, to the personal and emotional. Caregivers have to constantly balance their personal lives with work, family, and their caregiver roles, which can be overwhelmingly stressful. We discuss how caregivers attempt maintaining this balance through two concepts: first, giving-impact, and second, visibility-invisibility. Our study's findings call for system design that focuses not only on patients but also caregivers, addressing the burdens that often impair their health and wellness.},

abstract = {Dementia is a condition that affects more and more elderly people around the world. The number of people affected by dementia is expected to increase in the future due to increasing longevity and the growing elderly population. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with dementia worldwide is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. This will pose a significant challenge to the health and social systems of many nations and will require increased attention and resources for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of dementia. As the disease spreads, the workload of formal caregivers will inevitably increase. The HAAL project (HeAlthy Aging eco-system for peopLe with dementia) responds to this challenge by developing a dashboard that integrates all the relevant information coming from a set or a subset of nine already experimented devices. The dashboard is designed to show the most relevant information regarding the patient (fall events, sleep data, wellbeing data) to the formal caregiver. The purpose of this paper is therefore to present the experimental results obtained from the usability test performed on the HAAL dashboard by 26 formal caregivers in three pilot sites: Italy, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. Quantitative and qualitative results of this preliminary study confirm the suitability of the dashboard, highlighting inter-country differences.},

abstract = {Asthma is a common childhood chronic disease. There are various metrics of asthma which are tracked and reported to healthcare providers. We investigated visualizations \& concepts for tracking quantitative and qualitative asthma data for pediatric patients. We conducted a 3-part study with 14 participants where we (1) interviewed 2 parents and 6 children about their health tracking behavior (2) tested visualization alternatives with 6 children (3) designed concepts to track qualitative data for future testing. Our study shows that simple visualizations can be comprehended by children, so the use of these to report data to the healthcare provider is a powerful tool not just for the parents but also pediatric patients. We iterated the design of the visualizations based on qualitative feedback.},

abstract = {We developed SaludConectaMX as a comprehensive system to track and understand the determinants of complications throughout chemotherapy treatment for children with cancer in Mexico. SaludConectaMX is unique in that it integrates patient clinical indicators with social determinants and caregiver mental health, forming a social-clinical perspective of the patient's evolving health trajectory. The system is composed of a web application (for hospital staff) and a mobile application (for family caregivers), providing the opportunity for cooperative patient monitoring in both hospital and home settings. This paper presents the system's preliminary design and usability evaluation results from a 1.5-year pilot study. Our findings indicate that while the hospital web app demonstrates high completion rates and user satisfaction, the family mobile app requires additional improvements for optimal accessibility; statistical and qualitative data analysis illuminate pathways for system improvement. Based on this evidence, we formalize suggestions for health system development in LMICs, which HCI researchers may leverage in future work.},

abstract = {Upon leaving the hospital, parents of high-risk infants experience a variety of challenges in providing care at home. In this work, we present results from a qualitative study to understand the role of social interaction and information-sharing surrounding high-risk infants among both home caregivers and health professionals. These results demonstrate challenges in communication and social support for caregivers of these infants. Based on these results, we present design guidelines for collaborative communication technologies for this population and a prototype system design that demonstrates how these design guidelines might be met in a mobile application. Finally, we discuss how collaborative technologies can serve to improve communication with professionals as well as provide much-needed social support.},

We have designed Carebit to protect the privacy of the caregivee while allowing the caregiver to conveniently check up on them through their phone. Carebit also provides an app for the caregivee to be able to communicate with their caregiver.},

abstract = {Language delay is a developmental problem of children who do not acquire language as expected for their chronological ages. Without timely intervention, language delay can act as a lifelong risk factor. Speech-language pathologists highlight that effective parent participation in everyday parent-child conversation is important to treat children's language delay. For effective roles, however, parents need to alter their own lifelong-established conversation habits, requiring extensive period of conscious effort and staying alert. In this paper, we present new opportunities for mobile and social computing to reinforce everyday parent-child conversation with therapeutic implications for children with language delays. Specifically, we propose TalkBetter, a mobile in-situ intervention service to help parents in daily parent-child conversation through real-time meta-linguistic analysis of ongoing conversations. Through extensive field studies with speech-language pathologists and parents, we report the multilateral motivations and implications of TalkBetter. We present our development of TalkBetter prototype and report its performance evaluation.},

In response, we’ve developed NotiSummary, an application leveraging ChatGPT to present a concise summary of notifications, thereby reducing the time and effort required to review them. The application also integrates customization capabilities to further enhance the user-centric experience. Our study investigates the potential applicability of AI-based summarization techniques in notifications and explores user interaction patterns with these summaries. Preliminary results show that users find these summaries helpful in quickly accessing specific information, with preferences emerging for receiving summaries early in the morning and late at night. These findings underscore the potential value of notification summarization while highlighting the need to further investigate user preferences for summary appearance and the impact of summary generation on notification management behavior.},

abstract = {The impact of health information on caregivers is of increasing interest to HCI/CSCW in designing systems to support the social and emotional dimensions of managing health. Drawing on an interview study, as well as corroborating data including a multi-year ethnography, we detail the practices of caregivers (particularly parents) in a bone marrow transplant (BMT) center. We examine the interconnections between information and emotion work performed by caregivers through a liminal lens, highlighting the BMT experience as a time of transition and reflection in which caregivers must quickly adapt to the new social world of the hospital and learn to manage a wide range of patient needs. The transition from parent to 'caregiver' is challenging, placing additional emotional burdens on the intensive information work for managing BMT. As a time of reflection, the BMT experience also provides an occasion for generative thinking and alternative approaches to health management. Our study findings call for health systems that reflect a design paradigm focused on 'transforming lives' rather than 'transferring information.'},
