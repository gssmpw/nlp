Studies have shown that family caregivers face significant challenges in accessing and understanding clinical information, particularly in critical care settings (1). In order to improve their access to complex clinical information, researchers have developed AI models to extract complex clinical information from electronic health records (EHRs) through summarization (2), identify high-risk factors in medical records (3), and predict risks from clinical data, such as sepsis risk (4). 

AI can also enhance the understanding of clinical information. For instance, some models can translate complicated medical jargon into accessible language for the general audience to understand (5), and simplify lengthy medical texts into shorter versions (6). In addition, chatbot systems based on large language models (LLMs) show potential in supporting caregivers' personalized information-seeking needs (7). 

Such solutions have proven effective in delivering health advice regarding screening, diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention (8). For example, CataractBot (9), an LLM-based chatbot developed to address patient inquiries regarding cataract surgery, demonstrates the potential of AI in supporting caregivers' access to clinical information.

Despite the promising results, there has been a lack of systematic investigation from the caregivers' perspective regarding their needs in accessing and understanding clinical information (10). Moreover, how to design effective AI-based technologies to address caregivers' needs in accessing and understanding information remains underexplored (11).

The use of chatbots and virtual assistants is becoming increasingly popular, with studies showing that they can improve patient engagement and satisfaction (12). However, the effectiveness of these tools depends on their ability to provide accurate and relevant information to caregivers.

The lack of standardized frameworks for EHRs hinders efficient information sharing between healthcare providers and caregivers (13). The absence of a centralized data storage framework also creates significant barriers for family caregivers in accessing clinical information (14).

In order to address the challenges faced by family caregivers, it is essential to develop AI-based technologies that can provide personalized and contextually relevant guidance tailored to their literacy levels, cultural contexts, and decision-making autonomy (15). The development of these technologies requires a better understanding of the needs and experiences of family caregivers in critical care settings.

The development of AI-based clinical information technologies has shown significant potential in improving caregivers' access to and understanding of clinical information (16). However, more research is needed to address the sociotechnical challenges caregivers face in critical care settings (17).

The following figure illustrates the study procedure for developing AI-based clinical information technologies that support family caregivers in accessing and understanding clinical information (18).
