% Family caregivers are frequently called upon to make critical decisions on behalf of their loved ones____.
% On the other hand, they must prepare for the patient’s post-discharge care by coordinating the necessary support with healthcare providers, as caregiving demands often continue or escalate following ICU discharge____. 

% This dual role—speaking on behalf of the patient and preparing for their care—places an immense burden on caregivers, particularly as they often have limited direct access to patients due to ICU restrictions. 
% ICU wards impose restrictive visitation policies to avoid disruptions caused by the presence of unnecessary non-professional personnel____. 
% These restrictions leave caregivers with an incomplete understanding of the patient’s condition and limit the opportunities for in-person updates.
Consequently, caregivers have to rely heavily on direct communication with healthcare providers to stay informed about the patient’s status____. 
However, the provider teams are always overloaded with caring for critically ill patients and have very limited opportunities and time to talk with caregivers.
Such constrained caregiver-provider communications can hardly meet caregivers' information needs.

% Notably, the number of older adults requiring ICU admission is on the rise____, driven by the aging global population____. This increase is associated with significant costs and resource utilization____, placing additional strain on healthcare systems. Older adults not only face a higher likelihood of experiencing unexpected critical health events but also tend to recover more slowly after acute illnesses____. Upon admission to the ICU, the intensity of treatments—such as the use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy—often varies between younger and older patients. Studies have shown that older patients typically receive less intensive treatment compared to their younger counterparts____.

% While improving survival rates remains a primary goal of ICU care for all patients, another crucial objective, especially for the elderly, is to minimize inherent risks and enhance recovery____. However, older patients are more susceptible to a range of complications, including nosocomial infections, iatrogenic injuries from invasive monitoring, prolonged bed or chair rest, sleep deprivation, delirium, extended hospital stays, and more restrictive visiting hours for families____. These risks contribute to increased morbidity, cognitive impairment, and functional disability____. Given these challenges, it is imperative to pay special attention to older adult patients hospitalized in ICUs. Age itself is a significant independent risk factor for in-ICU mortality____. Additionally, advanced age is associated with longer ICU stays and a higher likelihood of unsuccessful discharge____. Most older adult patients admitted to the ICU present with critical illnesses accompanied by severe physical limitations that complicate their care needs____.

%\subsection{Family Caregivers' Information Needs and Challenges in the ICU}

%The importance of recognizing information needs for family caregivers during critical ICU moments has been well-documented in health literature____.
%Caregivers’ information needs are dynamic and evolve throughout the patient’s ICU stay. Because the ICU environment can change rapidly, even from hour to hour, family members need continuous up-to-date information to stay informed about the patient's condition, treatment, prognosis and diagnostic tests ____.  They also seek to understand the rationale behind specific treatments and daily care decisions, as well as the ICU setting itself (including equipment and protocols) and the various disciplines involved in patient care. Furthermore, caregivers want to know what they can do to support the patient after discharge, emphasizing the need for clear guidance on transitional care and rehabilitation ____.Obtaining such information about older adult patients is consistently a top priority for caregivers____, as it helps reduce stress levels____, allows better adaptation to stressful conditions____, and improves post-ICU care outcomes____.However, caregivers frequently report that their most critical needs — access to information and reassurance — often go unmet during ICU hospitalizations____. 

%The primary issue lies in the lack of a clear and efficient information pathway (e.g., channels or systems for accessing patient-related information) for caregivers, which can be analyzed across several key dimensions. First, information resources for family caregivers are often clinician-driven and passive____, leaving caregivers dependent on updates from healthcare providers. With limited access to healthcare providers due to the busy ICU schedule, caregivers often remain underinformed. For example, studies report that only a small proportion of ICU families at a prominent academic medical center had the opportunity to meet with an attending ICU physician as part of routine care____.  Given that the average ICU in the U.S. cares for approximately 10 patients daily____, it is unrealistic to expect the ICU care team to engage in comprehensive discussions with every family. Further compounding this issue is the fragmentation of information across multiple stakeholders____.  ICU patients are typically cared for by interdisciplinary teams of specialists and nurses, with frequent handoffs occurring across shifts, nights, and weekends.  This fragmented communication often leaves caregivers uncertain about whom to approach for updates or clarification____.  Additionally, wide variations in health literacy of different caregivers — combined with the prevalence of specialized medical jargon — pose significant barriers____. These factors make it harder for caregivers to interpret critical updates and advocate effectively. 
%Although some research has focused on improving caregiver experiences, efforts remain fragmented. 
%Existing interventions, such as pamphlets, checklists, and bedside electronic medical viewers____, provide limited support for creating a clear and caregiver-centric information pathway. 
%Addressing the information challenges faced by caregivers remains a critical and pressing need within the high-stakes, high-pressure environment of the ICU.


% Several interventions have been implemented to improve family access to important information in the form of pamphlets, checklists, and bedside electronic medical viewers____.

%Need for Interventions Supporting ICU Care Transitions

% A lack of clear information pathways for informal caregivers leads to poor communication with care professionals and fragmented or scattered information sources, and so increases the burden for informal caregivers____. 

% There is a clear need to support people with dementia and their caregivers through the journey from diagnosis to care [63] through personalized information and support interventions that increase confidence in making decisions about formal residential care placements [64]. 

% Most interventions to support the care transition focus on providing individual or group-based counseling to informal caregivers provided via phone, email, or in person [53]. Aside from management systems for digital waiting lists, e.g., [46], few digital interventions are developed to address such transitions to higher levels of care in dementia.

% Recent studies show that intentional support for caregivers is lacking, especially in the post-ICU period____

% Prior studies on caregivers of ICU survivors have focused on quantifying the psychosocial burden of caregiving____, but there is little research to inform improvements in care delivery____. 

% Caregivers suggest these needed supports could be supplied in a variety of infrastructural forms—phone calls, home health, post-ICU clinic, peer support, online forums—and individualized to maximize impact at necessary time points____.

%  The ICU can change quickly, even from hour to hour, so the family members need continual, progressive information____.

\subsection{Technologies Supporting Family Caregivers in Clinical Settings}

%Technology Solutions for Non-expert in Clinical Information
%EMR system/ EHR data 
%refine structured EHR data

In recent years, the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have emphasized the critical role caregivers play in patient care within clinical settings____ and emphasized the challenges caregivers face associated with clinical information____. In response, prior research has explored various technological solutions to address these challenges____.

On the one hand, researchers have explored various technology designs to enhance clinical information accessibility, including facilitating the sharing of information between clinicians and caregivers____ and assisting caregivers to seek clinical information of older adult patients____.
For example, ____ developed a mobile application that offers template support for caregivers to document and assess behavioral changes in patients with congenital heart disease, facilitating effective sharing of clinical information with clinicians. 
SaludConectaMX is a mobile application designed for caregivers to access clinical information, including patient medical history and oncology treatments, to assist in tracking patients' evolving health trajectories____.
____ developed a dashboard to present the most relevant clinical information of older adult patients with dementia, including fall events, sleep data, and wellbeing data, for caregiver access to patient status. 
While effective, most of these tools are intended for caregivers of patients with chronic conditions, such as dementia.
Consequently, their accessibility is not suitable for the time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical environment of the ICU.

Another area of research explores using visualization tools to decipher complex clinical information to support caregivers' understanding of clinical information____.
For instance,____ introduced EnGaze, a web-based tool designed to visualize the communication behaviors of children with autism during clinical visits, aiming at improving caregivers' understanding of the condition and promoting their active involvement in care planning.
An interactive system designed by____ assists families and clinicians in reviewing radiology imaging results by offering simplified definitions and diagrams of medical term during consultations.
____ presented a visualization mobile application designed to assist caregivers in recording and visualizing the long-term condition of asthma patients, thereby enhancing the shared understanding of the condition with clinicians.
While these technologies provide valuable assistance for caregivers in routine clinical settings, the complexity and density of information produced in the ICU can significantly overwhelm caregivers compared to other contexts.
The proposed visualization technology solutions are insufficient to support caregivers in understanding the clinical information of older adult patients in the ICU. 

In conclusion, existing tools and technologies remain inadequate in supporting caregivers of older adult ICU patients in accessing and understanding information.
Existing solutions are fragmented in scope, indicating a significant need to leverage novel technologies to systematically address caregivers' difficulties in accessing and understanding clinical information in critical care settings.



%In recent years, the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have advocated for caregivers' critical role in clinical settings, information needs in clinical settings____. 

%Prior work identified a significant barrier that impedes effective information sharing for family caregivers is the absence of a centralized data storage framework____.
% Despite the critical need for timely and accessible health information for family caregivers in ICU settings, the absence of a centralized, user-friendly data storage system creates significant barriers____.
%Today's Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, which are widely adopted by hospitals to support clinical information organization and storage, still suffer from critical limitations____.
% A primary barrier lies within today’s Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, which, despite being widespread, suffer from critical limitations.
% While these systems are widely adopted, their potential is constrained by critical limitations. 
% Chief among these is the lack of standardized frameworks, which severely impedes efficient information sharing____. 
%For instance, data in EHR often remain fragmented, making it difficult to be clearly organized and not possible to be understandable by non-experts ____.
% and pose interpretability challenges, especially for non-specialists____. 
%Furthermore, EHR was primarily designed to document the data generated or recorded from the patients, but not necessarily capture the interactions between providers and the caregivers. 
% Furthermore, EHR documentation often lacks critical care milestones, capturing what was recorded rather than what was actually delivered or experienced by patients and their families.
%For instance, clinicians may engage in important goals-of-care discussions with patients but fail to adequately document these interactions, which leads to difficulties when caregivers want to retrieve such information at a later time____.



% for understanding the comprehensive approaches that address the full range of information management and emotional support challenges.


\subsection{AI-based Clinical Information Technologies}
 
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown significant potential to improve caregivers' access to and understanding of clinical information. 

In order to improve caregivers' access to complex clinical information, researchers have developed AI models to extract complex clinical information from electronic health records (EHRs) through summarization____, identify high-risk factors in medical records____, and predict risks from clinical data, such as sepsis risk____. 
AI can also enhance the understanding of clinical information.
For instance, some models can translate complicated medical jargon into accessible language for the general audience to understand ____, and simplify lengthy medical texts into shorter versions____. In addition, chatbot systems based on large language models (LLMs) show potential in supporting caregivers' personalized information-seeking needs____. 
Such solutions have proven effective in delivering health advice regarding screening, diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention____. 
For example, ____ developed an LLM-based chatbot named CataractBot that addresses patient inquiries regarding cataract surgery.

Overall, AI have demonstrated the potential to address the aforementioned challenges faced by caregivers of older adult patients in the ICU. 
However, there has been a lack of systematic investigation from the caregivers' perspective regarding their needs in accessing and understanding clinical information.
Moreover, how to design effective AI-based technologies to address caregivers' needs in accessing and understanding information remains underexplored.

% caregivers reflects a broader oversight in human-centered AI design: systems often fail to account for indirect end-users who lack formal medical training but bear responsibility for care decisions. 
%For example, AI tools designed to improve clinician-patient communication____ rarely consider how caregivers might misinterpret or operationalize AI-generated insights. 

% A growing body of work has also explored patient-centered AI technologies, such as symptom-tracking chatbots____, personalized treatment recommendation systems, and tools to improve patient-provider communication____.


% This disconnect underscores an urgent need to reconceptualize AI systems as caregiver-facing tools, capable of distilling complex data into contextually relevant, emotionally sensitive, and ethically transparent guidance tailored to caregivers’ literacy levels, cultural contexts, and decision-making autonomy.

% While these efforts emphasize clinical stakeholders and patients, they largely overlook the critical role of family caregivers, particularly in the ICU. 
% In ICU contexts, caregivers serve as intermediaries between clinicians and patients, advocating for care preferences, interpreting complex medical information, and making time-sensitive decisions under significant emotional duress. 
% Despite the critical role, their experiences and needs remain understudied in AI-based healthcare research.
% Few research address the sociotechnical challenges caregivers face, such as reconciling conflicting clinician advice, navigating fragmented health records, or translating jargon-heavy prognoses into actionable choices. 
% This gap is particularly problematic in ICUs, where caregivers  high-stakes information (e.g., prognostic uncertainty, treatment trade-offs) while coordinating with care provider teams.




% Researchers have successfully developed AI-based clinical pre-screening systems (e.g., for diagnostic triage)____, risk prediction algorithms (e.g., for sepsis risk prediction)____, and automated information processing (e.g., EHR summarization)____. These innovations have primarily targeted healthcare providers to optimize clinical workflow efficiency and reduce clinicians' cognitive burdens in high-pressure environments____.
% Existing AI solutions in critical care settings prioritize clinical workflow optimization (e.g., predictive analytics for resource allocation)____ and direct patient monitoring (e.g., AI-based vital sign analysis)____.
