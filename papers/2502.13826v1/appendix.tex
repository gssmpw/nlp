\section{Experiment in resource constrained environment ($R=32$ and $l_b=l_s=64$)}
\label{sec:appendix_exp}

Here are the parameter setups for experiments in the resource constrained environment. 

Parameters for FreshDiskANN: $R=32$, $l_b=l_s=64$, $\alpha=1.2$, consolidate when $20\%$ of the points in the graph are marked deleted

Parameters for \name: $R=32$, $l_b=l_s=l_d=64$, $k=50$, $c=3$, $\alpha=1.2$, consolidate when $20\%$ of the points in the graph are deleted.

From Figure~\ref{fig:lowrecallplots} and Table~\ref{tab:running_time_lowrecall}, our in-place deletion algorithm consistently outperforms the FreshDiskANN baseline, achieving an average recall improvement of 1.2, 1.8, and 5.2 across these runbooks while using fewer distance computations and providing higher query throughput. Additionally, our algorithm requires less time to handle deletions on the two larger runbooks. Although it takes more time on the Wiki-1m-ExpirationTime runbook, we believe this is due to the data size, as we have demonstrated that it scales well on larger datasets. (Please refer to Table~\ref{tab:running_time_highrecall}).
