%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Indices for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) are a basic component for information retrieval
and widely used in database, search, recommendation and RAG systems.
%
In these scenarios, documents or other objects are inserted into and deleted from the 
working set at a high rate, requiring a stream of updates to the vector index. 
%
Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are the most efficient indices for ANNS,
winning many benchmark competitions. 
%
However, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate,
while supporting stable recall after many updates. 
%
Since the graph is singly-linked, deletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a deleted vertex.
%
Therefore, to update the graph, state-of-the-art algorithms such as FreshDiskANN accumulate deletions
in a batch and periodically consolidate, removing edges to deleted vertices and modifying the graph
to ensure recall stability. 
%
In this paper, we present \name (\longname), the first algorithm to avoid batch consolidation by efficiently
processing each insertion and deletion in-place.
%
Our experiments using standard benchmarks show that \name has stable recall
over various lengthy update patterns in both high-recall and low-recall regimes.
%
Further, it's query throughput and update speed are better
than using the batch consolidation algorithm and HNSW.

% Fix one dataset and runbook, e.g. MSTuring30m-clustered

% The default set of parameters are: R=64, lbuild=lsearch=ldelete=128, k=50, num\_to\_copy=3. We vary one parameter at one time.

% Parameter k: k=10/20/30/50

% Parameter num\_to\_replace: num\_to\_replace=1/2/3

% Parameter ldelete: ldelete=60/80/128/200 measure the average fraction of in neighbors

% Consolidation frequency: whenever the size exceeds a prefixed memory budget, 10\% or 20\% of the current size



% Parameter lsearch: lsearch=60/128/200/300. then plot average recall v.s. search

% Ablation on data scales: fix one runbook (for example random expiration time) and three data scales 10m/30m/100m. Measure running time with respect to the default parameter choices.

% \xnote{We examine the recall of the algorithms described above with two further  streaming \textit{runbooks}. The Drop Policy is called in a global background process at the same rate as the Consolidate Policy. A runbook consists of a sequence of insert, delete, and search operations, and recall is measured at each search operation. The first runbook is based the MSTuring-30M~\cite{babdatasets} dataset and designed to mimic the real-world trend of distribution shift within a streaming scenario. The dataset is clustered into 64 clusters, and points are inserted and deleted in clustered order over five rounds. The second runbook, based on the Wikipedia-35M~\cite{babdatasets} dataset, is designed to reflect another real-world scenario: that of an index where data is reliably deleted based on a time window. In this runbook, each point in the dataset is inserted and randomly assigned an expiration date, after which it is deleted.}
