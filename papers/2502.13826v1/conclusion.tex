%\todo{harsha: say we will study runbooks wth replacements in future work?}

In this paper, we introduced \name, the first in-place deletion algorithm for DiskANN
over the common case of a singly-linked proximity graph. 
\name has stable recall over a variety of update patterns and better
query and update complexity compared to previous graph-based indices.
It avoids usage spikes and query inefficiencies of past approaches that
collect updates in delta files that are periodically consolidated into the primary index.

Future work includes finding other adversarial workloads to test robustness,
such as one for replacements, and an experimental comparison of \name with the
best streaming methods for other data structures, such as IVF and LSH.
