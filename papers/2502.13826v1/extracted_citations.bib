	abstract = {The R-tree, one of the most popular access methods for rectangles, is based on the heuristic optimization of the area of the enclosing rectangle in each inner node. By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R*-tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},

The data structure requires O(n) space regardless of the metric's structure yet maintains all performance properties of a navigating net (Krauthgamer & Lee, 2004b). If the point set has a bounded expansion constant c, which is a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality, as defined in (Karger & Ruhl, 2002), the cover tree data structure can be constructed in O (c6n log n) time. Furthermore, nearest neighbor queries require time only logarithmic in n, in particular O (c12 log n) time. Our experimental results show speedups over the brute force search varying between one and several orders of magnitude on natural machine learning datasets.},

abstract = {Finding nearest neighbors has become an important operation on databases, with applications to text search, multimedia indexing, and many other areas. One popular algorithm for similarity search, especially for high dimensional data (where spatial indexes like kd-trees do not perform well) is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), an approximation algorithm for finding similar objects.In this paper, we describe a new variant of LSH, called Parallel LSH (PLSH) designed to be extremely efficient, capable of scaling out on multiple nodes and multiple cores, and which supports high-throughput streaming of new data. Our approach employs several novel ideas, including: cache-conscious hash table layout, using a 2-level merge algorithm for hash table construction; an efficient algorithm for duplicate elimination during hash-table querying; an insert-optimized hash table structure and efficient data expiration algorithm for streaming data; and a performance model that accurately estimates performance of the algorithm and can be used to optimize parameter settings. We show that on a workload where we perform similarity search on a dataset of > 1 Billion tweets, with hundreds of millions of new tweets per day, we can achieve query times of 1-2.5 ms. We show that this is an order of magnitude faster than existing indexing schemes, such as inverted indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest implementation of LSH, with table construction times up to 3.7\texttimes{} faster and query times that are 8.3\texttimes{} faster than a basic implementation.},

abstract = {Vector database management systems have emerged as an important component in modern data management, driven by the growing importance for the need to computationally describe rich data such as texts, images and video in various domains such as recommender systems, similarity search, and chatbots. These data descriptions are captured as numerical vectors that are computationally inexpensive to store and compare. However, the unique characteristics of vectorized data, including high dimensionality and sparsity, demand specialized solutions for efficient storage, retrieval, and processing. This narrative literature review provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts, use-cases, and current challenges associated with vector database management systems, offering an overview for researchers and practitioners seeking to facilitate effective vector data management.}

	abstract = {Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces is inherently computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. As a well-known solution to approximate NN search, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is able to answer c-approximate NN (c-ANN) queries in sublinear time with constant probability. Existing LSH methods focus mainly on building hash bucket based indexing such that the candidate points can be retrieved quickly. However, existing coarse-grained structures fail to offer accurate distance estimation for candidate points, which translates into additional computational overhead when having to examine unnecessary points. This in turn reduces the performance of query processing. In contrast, we propose a fast and accurate LSH framework, called PM-LSH, that aims to compute the c-ANN query on large- scale, high-dimensional datasets. First, we adopt a simple yet effective PM-tree to index the data points. Second, we develop a tunable confidence interval to achieve accurate distance estimation and guarantee high result quality. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm on top of the PM-tree to improve the performance of computing c-ANN queries. Extensive experiments with real-world data offer evidence that PM-LSH is capable of outperforming existing proposals with respect to both efficiency and accuracy.},
