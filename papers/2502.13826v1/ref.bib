abstract = {Applications increasingly leverage mixed-modality data, and must jointly search over vector data, such as embedded images, text and video, as well as structured data, such as attributes and keywords. Proposed methods for this hybrid search setting either suffer from poor performance or support a severely restricted set of search predicates (e.g., only small sets of equality predicates), making them impractical for many applications. To address this, we present ACORN, an approach for performant and predicate-agnostic hybrid search. ACORN builds on Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW), a state-of-the-art graph-based approximate nearest neighbor index, and can be implemented efficiently by extending existing HNSW libraries. ACORN introduces the idea of predicate subgraph traversal to emulate a theoretically ideal, but impractical, hybrid search strategy. ACORN's predicate-agnostic construction algorithm is designed to enable this effective search strategy, while supporting a wide array of predicate sets and query semantics. We systematically evaluate ACORN on both prior benchmark datasets, with simple, low-cardinality predicate sets, and complex multi-modal datasets not supported by prior methods. We show that ACORN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming prior methods with 2--1,000\texttimes{} higher throughput at a fixed recall. Our code is available at: https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ACORN.},

abstract = {As Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)-based dense retrieval becomes ubiquitous for search and recommendation scenarios, efficiently answering filtered ANNS queries has become a critical requirement. Filtered ANNS queries ask for the nearest neighbors of a query’s embedding from the points in the index that match the query’s labels such as date, price range, language. There has been little prior work on algorithms that use label metadata associated with vector data to build efficient indices for filtered ANNS queries. Consequently, current indices have high search latency or low recall which is not practical in interactive web-scenarios. We present two algorithms with native support for faster and more accurate filtered ANNS queries: one with streaming support, and another based on batch construction. Central to our algorithms is the construction of a graph-structured index which forms connections not only based on the geometry of the vector data, but also the associated label set. On real-world data with natural labels, both algorithms are an order of magnitude or more efficient for filtered queries than the current state of the art algorithms. The generated indices also be queried from an SSD and support thousands of queries per second at over recall@10.},

In this paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data-point. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art.},

	abstract = {Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces is inherently computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. As a well-known solution to approximate NN search, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is able to answer c-approximate NN (c-ANN) queries in sublinear time with constant probability. Existing LSH methods focus mainly on building hash bucket based indexing such that the candidate points can be retrieved quickly. However, existing coarse-grained structures fail to offer accurate distance estimation for candidate points, which translates into additional computational overhead when having to examine unnecessary points. This in turn reduces the performance of query processing. In contrast, we propose a fast and accurate LSH framework, called PM-LSH, that aims to compute the c-ANN query on large- scale, high-dimensional datasets. First, we adopt a simple yet effective PM-tree to index the data points. Second, we develop a tunable confidence interval to achieve accurate distance estimation and guarantee high result quality. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm on top of the PM-tree to improve the performance of computing c-ANN queries. Extensive experiments with real-world data offer evidence that PM-LSH is capable of outperforming existing proposals with respect to both efficiency and accuracy.},

	abstract = {The R-tree, one of the most popular access methods for rectangles, is based on the heuristic optimization of the area of the enclosing rectangle in each inner node. By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R*-tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R*-tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R*-tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R*-tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},

	abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

abstract = {Finding nearest neighbors has become an important operation on databases, with applications to text search, multimedia indexing, and many other areas. One popular algorithm for similarity search, especially for high dimensional data (where spatial indexes like kd-trees do not perform well) is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), an approximation algorithm for finding similar objects.In this paper, we describe a new variant of LSH, called Parallel LSH (PLSH) designed to be extremely efficient, capable of scaling out on multiple nodes and multiple cores, and which supports high-throughput streaming of new data. Our approach employs several novel ideas, including: cache-conscious hash table layout, using a 2-level merge algorithm for hash table construction; an efficient algorithm for duplicate elimination during hash-table querying; an insert-optimized hash table structure and efficient data expiration algorithm for streaming data; and a performance model that accurately estimates performance of the algorithm and can be used to optimize parameter settings. We show that on a workload where we perform similarity search on a dataset of > 1 Billion tweets, with hundreds of millions of new tweets per day, we can achieve query times of 1-2.5 ms. We show that this is an order of magnitude faster than existing indexing schemes, such as inverted indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest implementation of LSH, with table construction times up to 3.7\texttimes{} faster and query times that are 8.3\texttimes{} faster than a basic implementation.},

It is shown that the concept of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) allows to choose query sets of a wide range of difficulty for real-world datasets. Moreover, the effect of different LID distributions on the running time performance of implementations is empirically studied. To this end, different visualization concepts are introduced that allow to get a more fine-grained overview of the inner workings of nearest neighbor search principles. The paper closes with remarks about the diversity of datasets commonly used for nearest neighbor search benchmarking. It is shown that such real-world datasets are not diverse: results on a single dataset predict results on all other datasets well.},

abstract = {Multi-stage ranking pipelines have been a practical solution in modern search systems, where the first-stage retrieval is to return a subset of candidate documents and latter stages attempt to re-rank those candidates. Unlike re-ranking stages going through quick technique shifts over the past decades, the first-stage retrieval has long been dominated by classical term-based models. Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning. Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future development. In this article, we describe the current landscape of the first-stage retrieval models under a unified framework to clarify the connection between classical term-based retrieval methods, early semantic retrieval methods, and neural semantic retrieval methods. Moreover, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research on these important yet less investigated topics.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in large models have highlighted the critical significance of data scale, labels and modals. In this paper, we introduce MS MARCO Web Search, the first large-scale information-rich web dataset, featuring millions of real clicked query-document labels. This dataset closely mimics real-world web document and query distribution, provides rich information for various kinds of downstream tasks and encourages research in various areas, such as generic end-to-end neural indexer models, generic embedding models, and next generation information access system with large language models. MS MARCO Web Search offers a retrieval benchmark with three web retrieval challenge tasks that demands innovations in both machine learning and information retrieval system research domains. As the first dataset that meets large, real and rich data requirements, MS MARCO Web Search paves the way for future advancements in AI and system research. MS MARCO Web Search dataset is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/MS-MARCO-Web-Search.},

abstract = {Vector database management systems have emerged as an important component in modern data management, driven by the growing importance for the need to computationally describe rich data such as texts, images and video in various domains such as recommender systems, similarity search, and chatbots. These data descriptions are captured as numerical vectors that are computationally inexpensive to store and compare. However, the unique characteristics of vectorized data, including high dimensionality and sparsity, demand specialized solutions for efficient storage, retrieval, and processing. This narrative literature review provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts, use-cases, and current challenges associated with vector database management systems, offering an overview for researchers and practitioners seeking to facilitate effective vector data management.}

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in large models have highlighted the critical significance of data scale, labels and modals. In this paper, we introduce MS MARCO Web Search, the first large-scale information-rich web dataset, featuring millions of real clicked query-document labels. This dataset closely mimics real-world web document and query distribution, provides rich information for various kinds of downstream tasks and encourages research in various areas, such as generic end-to-end neural indexer models, generic embedding models, and next generation information access system with large language models. MS MARCO Web Search offers a retrieval benchmark with three web retrieval challenge tasks that demands innovations in both machine learning and information retrieval system research domains. As the first dataset that meets large, real and rich data requirements, MS MARCO Web Search paves the way for future advancements in AI and system research. MS MARCO Web Search dataset is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/MS-MARCO-Web-Search.},
