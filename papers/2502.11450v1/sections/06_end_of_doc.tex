\section*{Impact Statement}

This work aims to advance the field of Machine Learning by improving the efficiency of neural network pruning at initialization. By reducing the computational cost of training and inference while maintaining model performance, our approach lowers the hardware requirements for deploying AI systems. This contributes to the democratization of AI, making efficient deep learning models more accessible to researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources. While our work primarily focuses on technical advancements, it has broader implications for increasing the sustainability and inclusivity of AI development.
