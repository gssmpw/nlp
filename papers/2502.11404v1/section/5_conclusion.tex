\section{Conclusion}
% We introduce \texttt{ToolCoder}, which redefines tool learning by framing it as a structured code generation task, leveraging Python functions to enhance clarity and execution reliability. By transforming user queries into function scaffolds, decomposing complex tasks into manageable subtasks embedded as code comments, and generating implementations using validated function repositories, \texttt{ToolCoder} provides a systematic and robust framework for task execution.  Experimental results highlight its superior performance in task accuracy and execution reliability, establishing \texttt{ToolCoder} as a new benchmark in tool learning.


We present \texttt{ToolCoder}, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task, leveraging software engineering principles and Python function structures to enhance complex reasoning and execution reliability. By systematically transforming natural language queries into structured function scaffolds, incorporating descriptive comments for multi-step planning, and maintaining a repository of successfully executed functions, \texttt{ToolCoder} establishes a robust approach to tool learning. Its integrated error diagnosis mechanism further ensures adaptability based on code-based feedback. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in both task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our code-centric approach to tool learning.
