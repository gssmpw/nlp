\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}\vspace{-2mm}

In this paper, we proposed SubZero, which is a framework for robust and efficient zero-shot face, style and action composition. This consists of a Disentangled Stochastic Optimal Controller to inject subjects and styles into latents without causing any leakage. It also consists of the Orthogonal Temporal Aggregation scheme for Cross-Attention features originating from subject, style and text conditioning. We further proposed a novel method to train customized content and style projectors to reduce content and style leakage. Additionally, we discuss the feasibility of Zero-Order optimization for performing Stochastic Optimal Control. Through extensive experiments, we show that SubZero can significantly improve performance over the current state-of-the-art. Our proposed approach is suitable for running on-edge, and shows significant improvements over previous works performing subject, style and action composition. Assessing the performance of SubZero, we believe that our proposed method will lay a foundation for further research in training-free personalization.
