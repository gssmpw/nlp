% Our HeteroBox emulation platform can be runtime configured to emulate different configuration of CXL extended memory tiering system. We implement corresponding configuration registers in our design.
% HeteroMem can manage the memory tiering system transparently, without the intervention of CPU. In order to better understand the behaviour of HeteroMem, we implement a series of profiling registers, each indicating the number of an event. Meanwhile, the behaviour of HeteroMem can be tuned through several parameters, so we implement these parameters as configuration registers as well. 
% We list all the registers in Table ?.

% We implement a series of software interface for HeteroBox configuration and HeteroMem parameters tuning. We expose the configuration registers of our design in the PCIE BAR space. The host can read and write these registers through MMIO interface



% We expose these configuration and profiling registers at the PCIE BAR space of the CXL memory device. Host CPU can read or write these registers through MMIO. In the OS kernel space, we implement a device driver. The device driver expose the MMIO address of these registers to user space as files under $/sys/kernel/mm/heterobox$ directory. User can read or write these files to configure HeteroBox and HeteroMem, and get profiling information. For example, user can read $/sys/kernel/mm/heterobox/migrated\_pages\_cnt$ to get the number of pages which have been migrated by HeteroMem.
% We list all the files in Table~\ref{tab:interface_table}.
