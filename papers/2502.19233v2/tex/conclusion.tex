% In this paper, we introduce HeteroBox, an emulation platform, which is built on CXL-enabled FPGA. 
% HeteroBox support emulating a CXL extended heterogeneous memory system with arbitrary number of regions, each region with configurable latency attribute.
% Based on the HeteroBox emulation platform, we propose HeteroMem, a hardware-based device-side memory tiering system. HeteroMem is transparent to host CPU, and can be runtime configured to adapt to different CXL extended heterogeneous memory system configuration. Meanwhile, HeteroMem achieve high performance through accurate memory access profiling and efficient data movement. 
% Our evaluation result shows that HeteroMem achieves 11.8\%-24.3\% performance improvement across various existing memory tiering solutions.

% In this paper, we introduce HeteroBox, an emulation platform built on a CXL-enabled FPGA. HeteroBox supports emulating a CXL-extended heterogeneous memory system with up to 512 regions, each with configurable latency and bandwidth characteristics. Based on the HeteroBox emulation platform, we propose HeteroMem, a hardware-based, device-side memory tiering system. HeteroMem is transparent to the host CPU and can be runtime configured to adapt to different CXL-extended heterogeneous memory system configurations. Additionally, HeteroMem achieves high performance through accurate memory access profiling and efficient data movement.
% Our evaluation results show that HeteroMem achieves 5.7\% $\sim$ 17.6\% performance improvement over existing memory tiering solutions.

In this paper, we introduce HeteroBox, an innovative emulation platform built on a CXL-enabled FPGA. HeteroBox supports emulating a CXL-extended heterogeneous memory system with multiple regions, each with configurable latency and bandwidth characteristics. Based on the HeteroBox emulation platform, we propose HeteroMem, a novel hardware-based, device-side memory tiering system. HeteroMem is transparent to the host CPU and can be runtime configured to adapt dynamically to different CXL-extended heterogeneous memory system configurations. Additionally, HeteroMem achieves high performance through accurate memory access profiling and efficient data movement.
Our evaluation results show that HeteroMem achieves a 5.1\% to 16.2\% performance improvement over existing memory tiering solutions.
