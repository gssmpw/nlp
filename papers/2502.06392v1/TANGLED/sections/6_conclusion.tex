\section{Discussions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


We have introduced TANGLED, a novel multi-view lineart-conditioned diffusion model for 3D hair strand generation. We present the MultiHair dataset, a diverse collection that expands hairstyle representation with underrepresented textures and complex geometries. Our diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts enables flexible and accurate generation across various styles and viewpoints. Furthermore, our parametric post-processing refines braid-specific constraints, enhancing the coherence of intricate styles.

While TANGLED achieves significant advances, challenges remain. First, the MultiHair dataset, though more diverse, still lacks the capacity to model ultra-high-frequency strand details. Second, our braid generation pipeline struggles with extreme head pose, i.e., yaw/pitch \textgreater 75°, due to anchor point occlusion. Lastly, pixel-level alignment between generated hair and input images is limited, which is largely constrained by dataset size. Future work will focus on expanding dataset coverage, improving pose estimation, and enhancing alignment precision. These efforts will further TANGLED’s potential to create realistic, culturally inclusive 3D hairstyles for diverse digital applications.
