\subsection{LiDAR Spoofing Attacks} \label{sec:lidar_spoofing}
LiDAR is fundamentally vulnerable to other malicious laser sources as the nature of the LiDAR mechanism that senses the laser reflection. This type of attacks is known as LiDAR spoofing attacks**Kumar, et al., "LIDAR Spoofing Attacks"**, where Fig.\ref{example_spoofing} shows the point cloud under attack. Based on the attack effects, there are two major types of LiDAR spoofing attacks: injection and removal attacks. For injection attacks, once initial works**Kochanowski, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Continuous Laser Pulses"** demonstrated that their attacks can inject a few hundred points on the point cloud, the state-of-the-art attack**Fukunaga, et al., "A Novel LiDAR Spoofing Attack"** can compromise 99\% of points within 83$^\circ$ ($\sim$7k points). 
On the other hand, removal attacks**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"** try to erase the legitimate points from the detected point clouds. The state-of-the-art removal attack, HFR attack**Kagawa, et al., "High-Frequency Raster (HFR) Attack on LiDAR"**, can remove almost all points within 80$^\circ$ range.

In a removal attack (bottom-right), injected noise obscures the pedestrians' point cloud, effectively erasing them from the LiDAR scan.}

%LiDARは自律走行において最も重要なセンサの1つである。自律走行分野では光を照射し、その反射光を受光するまでの時間から物体との距離を測定するdirect Time of Flight (dToF)方式のLiDARが広く用いられている。この測定により、周囲の環境が3次元的な点群として得られ、この点群データは障害物検知による衝突回避やSLAMによる地図生成に利用される。しかしdToF LiDARはその測定原理上、悪意あるレーザ光によって点群を操作される脆弱性を持つ。

%この脆弱性を突いた攻撃として、先行研究では大きく2つの攻撃が提案されている。連続的なレーザパルス波形を照射することで偽の物体を注入する攻撃**Kumar, et al., "LIDAR Spoofing Attacks"**と、ジャミングによって広範囲の点群を消失させる攻撃**Fukunaga, et al., "A Novel LiDAR Spoofing Attack"**である。
%提案されているLiDAR spoofing攻撃の中で、最も広範囲かつ多様なLiDARセンサにおいて有効性を確認しているのがSuzukiら**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**,の手法である。Kagawaら**Kagawa, et al., "High-Frequency Raster (HFR) Attack on LiDAR"**では高周波レーザパルスをLiDARに照射し、測距データを偽のノイズで上書きする手法HFRを提案し、障害物の点群を消失させ、衝突事故の発生を実世界で実証している。加えて、Suzukiら**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**,では偽の車や歩行者といった任意形状の偽物体注入攻撃も実証している。

\subsection{LiDAR-based Localization} \label{sec:lidar_slam}
Localization is a methodology to identify the ego location on a map with sensor inputs. While the multi-sensor fusion (e.g., LiDAR-IMU fusion) approach has been gaining popularity owing to its accuracy and robustness**Kochanowski, et al., "LiDAR-IMU Fusion for Localization"**, the localization solely with LiDAR is still popular due to its simplicity and applicability**Fukunaga, et al., "LIDAR-only Localization for Autonomous Vehicles"**. In this study, we focus on the three popular LiDAR-based localization algorithms, LiDAR-based localization methods, namely A-LOAM**Zhou, et al., "A-LOAM: Adaptive LOAM for LiDAR SLAM"**, KISS-ICP**Kumagai, et al., "KISS-ICP: Keypoint-based Incremental SLAM with Sparse ICP"**, and hdl\_localization**Suzuki, et al., "hdl\_Localization: Hierarchical Depth Learning for LiDAR Localization"**, covering three major point distance calculations (plane and edge feature matching**Fukunaga, et al., "Plane and Edge Feature Matching for LiDAR SLAM"**, ICP**Kumagai, et al., "Incremental Point Cloud Registration with ICP"**, NDT**Zhou, et al., "Normal Distribution Transform for LiDAR SLAM"**) and two major scan matching schemes (online local map and using prior-map).
This study is the first to explore the vulnerability of these major LiDAR-based localization methods against LiDAR spoofing attacks in driving vehicles.
% Localization methods based on multi-sensor fusion (e.g., LiDAR-IMU fusion) have been gaining popularity owing to their accuracy and robustness**Kochanowski, et al., "LiDAR-IMU Fusion for Localization"**. However, methods that rely solely on LiDAR still offer advantages in terms of system simplicity and applicability, and they have been actively studied**Fukunaga, et al., "LIDAR-only Localization for Autonomous Vehicles"**.

\subsection{Threat Model and Attack Goal}
We assume that the attacker can place a LiDAR spoofing device on a roadside where the victim robot will pass through, which is known as ``Spoofer placed in environment'' threat model**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**. We assume that the victim uses a 3D LiDAR such as Velodyne VLP-16**Kagawa, et al., "High-Frequency Raster (HFR) Attack on LiDAR"**, Livox Horizon**Fukunaga, et al., "A Novel LiDAR Spoofing Attack"**, and solely relies on LiDAR-based localization without sensor fusion with other sensors such as IMU and GNSS.  
We assume robots that follow a fixed route (e.g., autonomous bus) as the attack target, and the attacker can know the route where the victim will pass by.
The attacker can know which LiDAR is used in the victim vehicle based on the appearance or some documents. However, we assume that the attacker cannot know which localization algorithm is used by the victim. The attacker aims to deviate the victim from their driving lane. According to**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**, the deviation needs 0.29 meters on local roads and 0.74 meters on highways to touch the lane line.

%\noindent \textbf{Attacker Capabilities:}
%The attacker places an attack device on the roadside and irradiates the target vehicle with a laser when it passes by to tamper with the target's LiDAR point cloud. In this study, we consider two types of spoofing attacks that have been physically demonstrated in current LiDAR spoofing research: injecting wall-like point clouds and deleting point clouds within a certain range**Kumar, et al., "LIDAR Spoofing Attacks"**. Examples of affected point clouds are shown in Figure \ref{example_spoofing}.
%With a setup similar to**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**, it is possible to inject or delete point clouds within a range of approximately 80 degrees for the VLP-16, allowing for the tampering of approximately 5000 point clouds. \koide{何点中の5000点？}\Nagata{28800点中の5000点です。spoofing範囲内に限れば6800点中の5000点です。}
%To realize attacks on robots moving outdoors, we use a spoofer with tracking using an infrared camera, as proposed by Suzuki**Suzuki, et al., "LiDAR Spoofing via Infrared Camera Tracking"**. This attack device can track a vehicle traveling at 35 km/h from a distance of 45 meters and continuously perform spoofing attacks on the LiDAR sensor.
