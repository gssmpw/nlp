At training time, the network receives $\btheta_{i-1}$ from Bayesian flow based on data distribution, and tries to improve the belief $\btheta_{i-1}$ over the groundtruth $\calM$ by outputting an estimated distribution $p_O$ and minimizing the gap between estimation and groundtruth. At sampling time with the trained network, the uninformative prior $\btheta_0$ is gradually improved by belief updates until $\btheta_n$ with high fidelity.

\section{Related Work}


Modeling and generating stable materials with data-driven approaches has been applied to discovering new functional materials \citep{peng2022human}. One line of approaches indirectly models crystal space by transforming crystals into human-designed representations \citep{REN2021,hoffmann2019data,noh2019inverse, court20203,yang2023scalable}, though the encoding and decoding process often leads to physical geometry loss 
%(\rebuttal{detailed discussion in \cref{appd:detailed_related_works}}). 
In contrast, another line of research directly models crystals in the sample space, drawing inspiration from the success of Diffusion models~\citep{ho2020denoising,song2020score,song2019generative}. For instance, CD-VAE \citep{xie2021crystal} and SyMat \citep{luo2024towards} employ score-matching \citep{song2019generative} to learn scores for generating stable materials, while their modeled distribution lacks geometric invariance~\citep{zhang2023artificial}. DiffCSP~\citep{jiao2023crystal} addresses this by transforming Cartesian atom coordinates into fractional coordinates, introducing the periodic E(3) equivariance of crystals, and designing an equivariant diffusion crystal generation model based on periodic diffusion \citep{jing2022torsional}. More recently, \citet{flowmm} applies Riemannian Flow Matching \citep{riemannianfm} to crystal generation tasks offering improved sampling efficiency, while at the expense of quality \footnote{For a more detailed discussion of related work, please refer to \cref{appd:detailed_related_works}.}. However, we argue that these methods struggle to balance sampling quality and efficiency due to insufficient guidance during each transition from the noise prior to the data distribution. This issue is particularly pronounced for crystals, where thermodynamically stable materials constitute only a small fraction of the search space~\citep{flowmm}. For instance, early generation states $x_{t-1}$ with low confidence should be retained less than later states to achieve the next state $x_{t}$. 


In this work, we propose to use BFN~\citep{bfn} to model crystals in a principally different way. BFN provides a framework to accurately update each generation state according to its entropy/confidence, the effectiveness of which has been proved in \citet{song2023unified}. 
However, there are no established explorations on the challenging topic of non-Euclidean BFN which is essential to many real-world applications \cite{jing2022torsional, AlphaFold2021}. 
To address the above issues, in this paper, we build a non-Euclidean Bayesian flow from scratch, identifying and tackling the non-additive accuracy via introducing a novel entropy conditioning mechanism.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:discussion}
In this paper, we present the first periodic Bayesian flow modeling on the hyper-torus, addressing an unprecedented theoretical issue related to non-additive accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a novel entropy conditioning mechanism, theoretical reformulations of BFN, a fast sampling algorithm, and a numerical method for determining the accuracy schedule. Leveraging the proposed periodic Bayesian flow, we implement the first periodic E(3) equivariant Bayesian flow networks for crystal generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in crystal generation, with efficiency improved by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, our methodology can be adapted to a wide range of data types and tasks involving hyper-torus data.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
We confirm that our work complies with the ICLR Code of Ethics, and we have carefully considered potential ethical concerns related to the development and use of our proposed method, \modelname, for crystal generation. Our method is designed for general crystal generative modeling tasks and does not involve sensitive data or tasks. We strongly encourage users to ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations and critically assess the model's outputs. We are confirmed that there is no conflict of interest, financial sources or other factors, that could influence the development or presentation of this work. 

With these considerations, we do not anticipate any violations of the ICLR Code of Ethics in the development or use of this model. And we stress once again that \modelname should not be used for malicious purposes, such as creating harmful structures.

% However, we recognize that when generative models are applied in specific domains, such as functional material discovery, they may unintentionally produce synthetic data that resembles unexpected structures. 



\section*{Reproducibility Statement}
To ensure reproducibility, we give a detailed derivation of the periodic Bayesian flow in \cref{appd:bfn_cir} and the proof of the propositions in \cref{appd:geometric_invar}. All datasets and performance evaluation method used in our experiments are publicly available and clearly specified or cited in \cref{sec:exp}. We provide our implementation details including training and sampling procedure, hyper-parameters, used computational resources and anonymous code repository link in \cref{appd:imple_details}.
