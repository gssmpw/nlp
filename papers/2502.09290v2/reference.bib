@article{Su2020,
abstract = {The uncertainty of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviour is a crucial factor that not only influences the peak power demand in distribution networks, but also the tariff plans of EV charging service. The uncertain upstream electricity price considerably complicates the issue regarding how to achieve specific economic goals for distribution network operators (DNOs) while guaranteeing EV users' interest. A rolling horizon scheduling approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper to provide a win-win strategy for both DNOs and EV users. It deals with the online optimal scheduling problem of aggregated EVs in the energy exchange market. The objective of the scheduling strategy is to maximise DNOs' profit margin by charging EVs in the low price time intervals as well as shifting peak charging loads. The operational constraints of EVs' availability and electricity bidding are all considered in the time rolling horizon framework, meaning all this information will be updated, calculated and partially forecasted at each time interval until the end of the day. A case study is carried out with a 33-node distribution network to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy. In detail, specific tariff plans can be determined toward possible values of uncertain market price to satisfy utilities' economic targets. In this way, both individuals and energy providers that participate in the energy market can benefit from the proposed rolling horizon strategy and keep the uncertainty under control.},

@article{Bischi2019,
abstract = {A rolling-horizon algorithm is proposed for optimizing the operating schedule of a given cogeneration energy system while taking into account time-variable loads, tariffs and ambient conditions, as well as yearly fiscal incentives. The presented algorithm is based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model developed by the authors for optimizing the daily schedule of cogeneration systems and networks of heat and power plants. First the MILP model is extended to optimize the weekly operation schedule to better manage the heat-cold storage systems. However, in order to account for the European qualification framework for high efficiency cogeneration, as well as for country-specific incentive policies, it is necessary to consider average yearly-basis energy saving indexes, thus requiring to tackle the problem for the whole year. Since the extension of the MILP model from one day to seven days already increases remarkably the computational requirements, a simple application of the same optimization approach to a whole year would be practically unfeasible; therefore, this work proposes a rolling-horizon algorithm in which a sequence of weekly MILP submodels is solved, while considering production and consumption estimates based on demand profiles from historical data. The results obtained for a real-world test case are reported and discussed.},
