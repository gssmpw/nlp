% Code review is a critical quality assurance method in software development, essential for both commercial and open-source projects. It involves peer examination of modified code prior to merging, improving code quality by identifying coding defects, vulnerabilities, and style violations early on. Despite advancements, automating code refinement, the core task in code review, remains challenging. Current models often fail to accurately understand the reviewer’s intent, treating code refinement primarily as a code generation task. This paper proposes an intention-based framework for automating code refinement, dividing the task into Intention extraction and execution. By defining 11 Intention templates and incorporating critical inputs such as ReviewLine and LastCodeDiffHunk, our approach enhances the model’s ability to understand and implement reviewer suggestions accurately. Experimental validation across multiple models, including Gpt4o and DeepseekV2, demonstrates that our framework achieves 79\% accuracy in Intention extraction and up to 68\% exact match accuracy in generating RevisedCode. Additionally, our framework addresses data quality issues prevalent in existing code review datasets, achieving 81\% accuracy and 91\% precision in identifying valid data. This intention-based approach significantly improves code refinement accuracy and provides a robust foundation for future research in automating this crucial software development process.



Code refinement aims to enhance existing code by addressing issues, refactoring, and optimizing to improve quality and meet specific requirements. As software projects scale in size and complexity, the traditional iterative exchange between reviewers and developers becomes increasingly burdensome. While recent deep learning techniques have been explored to accelerate this process, their performance remains limited, primarily due to challenges in accurately understanding reviewers' intents.

This paper proposes an \textit{intention}-based code refinement technique that enhances the conventional \textit{comment-to-code} process by explicitly extracting reviewer intentions from the comments.
Our approach consists of two key phases: Intention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation. Intention Extraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention Guided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate revised code based on these defined intentions. Three categories with eight subcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a hybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate classification. Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings demonstrate that our approach achieves 79\% accuracy in intention extraction and up to 66\% in code refinement generation. Our results highlight the potential of our approach in enhancing data quality and improving the efficiency of code refinement.
