\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose an intention-based code refinement framework to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of code refinement tasks. Our framework decomposes the process into two sequential phases: Intention Extraction and Intention-Guided Revision Generation. We evaluate the framework using five models, i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, and CodeQwen7B, across various prompting strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both traditional methods and end-to-end LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we show that larger models with stronger reasoning capabilities achieve more significant improvements.
