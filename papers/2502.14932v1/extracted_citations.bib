    abstract = "Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed impressively in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their inherent hallucination phenomena severely challenge their credibility in complex reasoning. Combining explainable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs is a promising path to address this issue. However, structured KGs are difficult to utilize, and how to make LLMs understand and incorporate them is a challenging topic. We thereby reorganize a more efficient structure of KGs, while designing the KG-related instruction tuning and continual pre-training strategies to enable LLMs to learn and internalize this form of representation effectively. Moreover, we construct subgraphs to further enhance the retrieval capabilities of KGs via CoT reasoning. Extensive experiments on two KGQA datasets demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines."

    abstract = "Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."
