However, each reveals a different portion of the hybrid AI analysis and stock prediction puzzle. The principal objective of this research was to systematically review the existing systematic reviews on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models applied to stock market prediction to provide valuable inputs for the development of strategies in stock market investments. Keywords that would fall under the broad headings of AI and stock prediction were looked up in Scopus and Web of Science databases. We screened 69 titles and read 43 systematic reviews, including more than 379 studies, before retaining 10 for the final dataset. This work revealed that support vector machines (SVM), long short-term memory (LSTM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are the most popular AI methods for stock market prediction. In addition, the time series of historical closing stock prices are the most commonly used data source, and accuracy is the most employed performance metric of the predictive models. We also identified several research gaps and directions for future studies. Specifically, we indicate that future research could benefit from exploring different data sources and combinations, while we also suggest comparing different AI methods and techniques, as each may have specific advantages and applicable scenarios. Lastly, we recommend better evaluating different prediction indicators and standards to reflect prediction models’ actual value and impact.}, journal={Social Sciences, Humanities Open}, author={Lin, Chin Yang and Lobo Marques, João Alexandre}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={100864} }

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
