\section*{Limitations}
We believe that \mytitle has four limitations:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item
    \mytitle is currently a monolingual benchmark, focusing solely on Solidity code generation.
    This approach overlooks the necessity for LLMs to comprehend requirements in various natural languages and to generate code in multiple programming languages, including Vyper and Rust.
    Recognizing this limitation, we plan to develop a multilingual version of \mytitle in future work to better assess LLMs' capabilities across diverse linguistic and programming contexts.
    \item
    Due to funding constraints, we were unable to evaluate \mytitle on GPT-o3-mini-high and its competitors (e.g., Claude 3.5) in our study. 
    This limitation may affect the generalizability of our findings, as these models have demonstrated advanced capabilities in various benchmarks.
    \item
    The function samples in \mytitle are drawn from 9 GitHub repositories, which may not be sufficient for a benchmark on par with those for mainstream programming languages. However, given the limited availability and accessibility of high-quality Solidity datasets, we have made a trade-off between repository quality and quantity.
    \item
    The gas fee and vulnerability rate metrics used in \mytitle are limited to evaluating the gas efficiency and potential vulnerabilities of smart contracts without providing mechanisms for their optimization or remediation.
    In future work, we plan to extend our research to include methods for gas optimization and vulnerability detection, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of \mytitle in improving smart contract performance and security.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Ethics Consideration}

\datasetname is collected from real-world smart contract repositories. 
All samples in \datasetname are manually reviewed by five master's students, under the supervision of two PhD researchers in the field of code generation. 
We ensure that none of the samples contain private information or offensive content.
