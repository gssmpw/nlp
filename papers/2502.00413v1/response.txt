The main stages of web usage mining consist of data preprocessing, pattern discovery, and pattern analysis ____. The first stage, data preprocessing, is essential for making raw web log data analyzable, involving tasks such as data cleaning, user identification, and session identification ____. However, inaccuracies and errors in web log data can negatively impact the accuracy of analyses. For instance, incorrect session merging or user identification errors can lead to misleading results during modeling processes ____. Therefore, careful execution of data cleaning and session management processes is critical to the success of WUM.

Predictive modeling is a strategic method used to forecast users' future behaviors. These models utilize large-scale data analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict users' browsing habits, interactions, or purchasing tendencies ____. Such predictions provide valuable contributions, especially in dynamic fields like e-commerce and online services ____. On the other hand, anomaly detection identifies activities that deviate from standard user behavior patterns, providing crucial feedback in terms of security and performance ____. This section will examine recent developments in predictive modeling and anomaly detection within WUM, exploring studies and new approaches to enhance these processes' effectiveness.




\subsection{ Data preprocessing and session identification techniques}

Data preprocessing is critical in web usage mining as it optimizes large datasets and creates a more suitable environment for successful prediction and anomaly detection. Correcting errors in raw data and filtering out irrelevant information improves the accuracy of results significantly obtained from WUM processes. A recent study highlights the importance of data preprocessing in modeling user behavior ____. This study analyzed page views during user sessions, enabling more accurate session identification.

Session identification, an essential step in data preprocessing, plays a critical role in accurately analyzing users' navigation behavior. A new method for identifying web user sessions was developed, successfully generating all possible maximal paths ____. This approach enabled more accurate structuring of user sessions, leading to superior results in subsequent page predictions. This process plays a significant role in making predictive modeling more efficient. Similarly, the Online Web Navigation Assistant (OWNA) analyzes real-time data streams during session identification, providing recommendations to users ____. This model optimizes user navigation behavior throughout sessions, improving the prediction of their actions on the web.

Tools used for data preprocessing in web usage mining also enhance the efficiency of processes. A hybrid approach has been developed that combines techniques like Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm to improve classification accuracy during the data preprocessing stage ____. Such tools filter errors and anomalies in large datasets, contributing to more successful prediction and anomaly detection outcomes.


\subsection{ Predictive modeling techniques}


Predictive modeling is one of the critical techniques used to anticipate users' next steps and predict potential actions on the web.

Similarly, recent research has highlighted the effectiveness of hybrid machine learning methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting in predicting web page transitions by utilizing both static and dynamic page features ____. Algorithms like these, employed to predict users' following pages, stand out as some of the most potent approaches in Web Usage Mining (WUM). Another study developed a web session reconstruction algorithm using a dynamic link repository ____. In this approach, web sessions were modeled graphically, and Bayesian networks were used to predict the next page, providing a dynamic prediction mechanism to optimize user movements across the web.

Another practical approach for predicting user behavior is the use of fuzzy logic-based algorithms. Using fuzzy data mining, one study analyzed proxy server log files to predict users' subsequent web requests ____. By analyzing users' browsing frequency and behaviors, fuzzy association rules were created, enabling the accurate prediction of their next steps.
