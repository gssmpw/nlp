This section will examine recent developments in predictive modeling and anomaly detection within WUM, exploring studies and new approaches to enhance these processes' effectiveness.




\subsection{ Data preprocessing and session identification techniques}

Data preprocessing is critical in web usage mining as it optimizes large datasets and creates a more suitable environment for successful prediction and anomaly detection. Correcting errors in raw data and filtering out irrelevant information improves the accuracy of results significantly obtained from WUM processes. A recent study highlights the importance of data preprocessing in modeling user behavior ____. This study analyzed page views during user sessions, enabling more accurate session identification.

Session identification, an essential step in data preprocessing, plays a critical role in accurately analyzing users' navigation behavior. A new method for identifying web user sessions was developed, successfully generating all possible maximal paths ____. This approach enabled more accurate structuring of user sessions, leading to superior results in subsequent page predictions. This process plays a significant role in making predictive modeling more efficient. Similarly, the Online Web Navigation Assistant (OWNA) analyzes real-time data streams during session identification, providing recommendations to users ____. This model optimizes user navigation behavior throughout sessions, improving the prediction of their actions on the web.

Tools used for data preprocessing in web usage mining also enhance the efficiency of processes. A hybrid approach has been developed that combines techniques like Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm to improve classification accuracy during the data preprocessing stage ____. Such tools filter errors and anomalies in large datasets, contributing to more successful prediction and anomaly detection outcomes.


\subsection{ Predictive modeling techniques}


Predictive modeling is one of the critical techniques used to anticipate users' next steps and predict potential actions on the web.
