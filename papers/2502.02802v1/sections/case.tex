\section{Case Study}
\label{app:case}

In this section, we present the generated counseling sessions using simulated clients of different methods. First, Table~\ref{tab:real conv} and Table~\ref{tab:real profile} show the real conversation and the extracted profile, respectively.

Table~\ref{tab:example-based conv} shows the session generated by the example-based method. In this case, the simulated client is motivated by avoiding trouble situations and plans to distance from drinking environments. This is inconsistent with the real client's motivation related to sports and non-existent preferred plan to change. 

Table~\ref{tab:profile-based conv} shows the session generated by the profile-based method. In this case, the client proactively mentions motivation and knowledge about the risks of drinking, which is inconsistent with the real client's profile. Moreover, the simulated client plans to refrain from alcohol, which is not mentioned in the given profile. 

Table~\ref{tab:action-based conv} shows the session generated by the action-based method. The simulated client in this session is also motivated by an inconsistent reason and adopt a non-existent preferred plan. Although the action-based prompt provides action options, it still results in a longer counseling session. The topic about friends is also inconsistent with the given profile. 

Finally, Table~\ref{tab:our conv} shows the session generated by our framework-based method. The motivation of the simulated client is consistent with the given profile, and the client does not express the motivation on its own. Moreover, the simulated client ends the conversation proactively instead of proposing a plan, which is aligned with the given profile.

Incidentally, these session examples also reveal the common shortcomings of LLM-based counselors which almost always employ a reflection followed by a question, which may not be effective in counseling. To make progress, the simulated counselor may incorrectly determine the client's state and ask the client direct questions about motivation or plans.

Counselor: Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself. \newline Client: You're welcome. \newline Counselor: I see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that? \newline Client: Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer. \newline Counselor: That must be really scary. \newline Client: Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me. \newline Counselor: I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink? \newline Client: Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice. \newline Counselor: I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right? \newline Client: Yeah, that's right. \newline Counselor: As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay? \newline Client: Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice. \newline Counselor: I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are? \newline Client: Well, all I really know is that it's not good for me. \newline Counselor: Are you surprised what that might be true? \newline Client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too. \newline Counselor: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information? \newline Client: I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports. \newline Counselor: Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that. \newline Client: Yeah, I would like to play soccer in college. \newline Counselor: That's a great goal to have for yourself. \newline Client: Yeah, I would also like to get scholarships. \newline Counselor: Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals. \newline Client: Yeah. \newline Counselor: I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that? \newline Client: Well, I will take a look at it, and I'll definitely read it, and I don't wanna become addicted, and I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible. \newline Counselor: It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions. \newline Client: Thanks for all the information. \newline Counselor: You're welcome.  \\ \bottomrule
