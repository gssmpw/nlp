\section{Expert Annotation}
\label{app:human evaluation}


\subsection{Demographics for Annotators}

Our annotation team comprises four experts who are co-authors of this paper. Three of them hold postgraduate degrees in counseling and one is a senior-year university student pursuing a psychology major. They all have relevant experience in mental health counseling.

\subsection{Annotation Instruction}

Table~\ref{tab:human_instruction1} presents the profile consistency rating score descriptions and client profile components for an expert to evaluate the profile consistency scores of a generated counseling session in all the four profile aspects (i.e., persona, beliefs, motivation, and acceptable plan). Table~\ref{tab:human_instruction2} shows the realism rating score descriptions for an expert to assess the realism of client in a generated session. Finally, Table~\ref{tab:human_instruction3} shows the score descriptions for an expert to determine the receptivity level of client in a generated counseling session.

\begin{table*}[tb]

\toprule
\textbf{Consistency Rating (To rate how consistent is the client with the four aspects of profile)}\newline
5 (High): Perfectly aligns with profile across all aspects \newline
4 (Moderately High): Mostly aligns with profile with minor variations \newline
3 (Moderate): Partially aligns with profile with some discrepancies \newline
2 (Moderately Low): Limited alignment with profile with multiple discrepancies \newline
1 (Low): Consistently contradicts profile information \newline
