\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we proposed a method that leverages HLIP to guide CIMPC and allows the robot to make and break contact as needed. This framework enables diverse behavior for whole-body humanoid control like robust walking, disturbance recovery, and multi-contact stabilization. We have shown the effectiveness of this framework by testing it in simulation under disturbances, model and state uncertainty, and over adverse terrain. Future work will focus on realizing this framework on hardware as well as addressing the limitations delineated in Section \ref{sec:limitations}.
