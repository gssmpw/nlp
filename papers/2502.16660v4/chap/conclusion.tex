\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we introduce \benchname, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and reason about biological pathways. Extensive evaluations using \benchname, incorporating advanced methods like CoT and graph-augmented approaches, show that LLMs struggle with understanding pathway mechanisms. We also propose \modelname, a novel LLM agent that uses interactive subgraph exploration to enhance reasoning in biological pathways.
