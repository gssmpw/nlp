The pathway reasoning benchmark, \benchname, is derived from biological literature, which may already be included in the training data for large language models (LLMs). As a result, some questions in \benchname may carry a risk of leakage for LLMs. A new, de novo subset will be developed in future versions to more accurately evaluate the reasoning ability of LLMs.

The pathway graph database used in this study is based on KEGG and can be further expanded by incorporating additional databases in future work to enhance pathway reasoning capabilities.
