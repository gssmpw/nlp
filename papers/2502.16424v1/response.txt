\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Image SemCom systems}
Zhang et al., "Predictive and Adaptive Deep Coding (PADC) Framework for Flexible Bitrate Optimization in Image SemCom" 
Liu et al., "Dynamic Decision Generation Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks Based Image SemCom Method"
Pan et al., "Semantic Information Extractor based on Swin Transformer and Semantic Information Decoder and Reconstructor for Efficient Visual Data Transmission"

All of these works adopted a direct semantic encoding approach for images, aiming to eliminate redundancy at the semantic level. However, they did not consider information compression at the pixel level of the image.

\subsection{Large AI models for SemCom systems}
Jiang et al., "Multimodal Language Models Based Multimodal SemCom Framework with LLM Knowledge Base" 
Zhao et al., "LaMoSC: LLM-Driven Multimodal Fusion Framework for Visual Information Reconstruction"
Wang et al., "LLM-Based End-to-End Learning SemCom Model with Subword-Level Tokenization and Gradient-Based Rate Adapters"

However, these SemCom systems overlook the high energy consumption and latency caused by the enormous parameter numbers of LAMs, as well as the resource constraints of edge devices in mobile communication systems.

\subsection{Multi-user SemCom systems}
Xie et al., "Transformer-Based Framework for Task-Oriented Multi-User SemCom Systems with DeepSC-IR, DeepSC-MT and DeepSC-VQA Models"
Li et al., "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Based Multi-User SemCom System (NOMASC) with Asymmetric Quantizers and Neural Network Models"
Mu et al., "Heterogeneous Semantic and Bit Multi-User Communication Framework with Semi-NOMA Scheme and Opportunistic Communication Method"

These multi-user SemCom systems rely on physical resources to differentiate user signals and fail to exploit the commonalities and differences between the information of different users in the semantic space. As LAMs become increasingly capable of extracting more precise semantic information, leveraging the commonality among semantics transmitted by different users to further enhance the efficiency of SemCom systems represents a novel research direction.
