\section{Evaluating the Impact of Cyber Threats on OT Systems: A Quantitative Perspective}
\label{sec:EmergingTrends}

While the adoption of emerging technologies has opened new avenues for enhancing OT cybersecurity, quantifying the current state of vulnerabilities and defenses is crucial to understanding their real-world impact. This section examines the financial repercussions of breaches, the prevalence of various attack types, and the effectiveness of established and emerging cybersecurity measures. By analyzing data from industry reports and case studies, this segment underscores the scale of the challenges faced by OT systems and highlights actionable insights to address them.

\subsection {Cost of OT Breaches} 
OT environments are increasingly susceptible to cyberattacks, leading to significant financial repercussions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Financial Impact}: According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024, the global average cost of a data breach has reached \textbf{\$4.88 million}, marking a \textbf{10\% increase} from the previous year and representing the highest average to date \cite{IBM}. This escalation is attributed to factors such as business disruption and post-breach response activities.

    The \textbf{Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack} in 2021 further illustrates the severe financial consequences of OT breaches \cite{cisa}. The incident resulted in a direct ransom payment of \$4.4 million, along with substantial financial losses due to fuel supply interruptions across the eastern United States \cite{TheGuardian}. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) emphasized the critical vulnerabilities exposed by this event, underscoring the need for enhanced OT security measures.

    \item \textbf{Operational Downtime}: Downtime in OT environments incurs significant costs. Gartnerâ€™s analysis reports that such downtime can result in losses of approximately \$260,000 per hour, with extended outages severely impacting production capabilities and supply chains.
