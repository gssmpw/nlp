In this work, we introduced a novel approach for solving inverse problems using diffusion models when observations follow distributions from the exponential family. 
Our posterior approximation closely aligns with MCMC methods while scaling to larger observational datasets and accommodating empirical priors. We demonstrate strong performance in image denoising under Poisson noise and further highlight the methodâ€™s effectiveness in real-world problems. Notably, our results suggest that an ImageNet prior can be a powerful tool for spatial statistics, enabling the recovery of latent patterns that extend beyond those present in ImageNet itself.
