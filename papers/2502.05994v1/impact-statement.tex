Most real-world phenomena, such as disease case counts, the time between occurrences of natural climate events, and the proportion of individuals with certain health conditions, exhibit non-Gaussian characteristics. A key challenge in modeling such data lies in solving inverse problems to estimate latent functions of scientific interest. Diffusion models have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in addressing inverse problems and form the foundation of many recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research. By introducing an approach that leverages diffusion models within the framework of the exponential family, we significantly expand the scope of applications where these models can be effectively leveraged.
