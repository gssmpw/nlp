% \begin{itemize}
%     % \item potentials of our Hegelian-Inspired design
%     %     \begin{itemize}
%     %         \item a more mature and organic unit of intelligent
%     %         \item ability to describe why other prompt engineering techs (like self-reflection) work
%     %         \item a structured framework for generating synthetic data
%     %     \end{itemize}
%     \item maybe you didn't do it right and LLMs are capable of doing this task? That might be a fair criticism, but the point we raise it that ACE can use the same engineering prompts and achieve higher performance. Of curse, we're not arguing that LLM$^+$ is the best default scheme, but we argue it is a good enough baseline to show that even after having a thoughtful and somewhat complicated prompt, LLMs' performance remains low in this setting. 
%     \item Is it always beneficial? This is a question for future work
%     \item Does it still useful if new more powerful models come to the play?
