\section{Final Note}
Our exploration into the capabilities of LLMs in tackling sequential optimization problems has revealed both their potential and their current limitations. Through the development and use of WorldGen, we have shown that while LLMs exhibit impressive abilities, they still face challenges with even relatively simple SOPs. These findings have led us to propose a novel approach inspired by philosophical reasoning frameworks, aiming to enhance LLM performance in innovative yet easy to reason about ways.
We believe that this work can open new avenues, encouraging the integration of philosophical reasoning frameworks into AI systems. By fostering a deeper understanding and application of these frameworks, we can pave the way for more robust and intelligent systems. We hope our efforts inspire others to explore these interdisciplinary approaches, ultimately contributing to the advancement of LLMs and its applications across diverse fields.
