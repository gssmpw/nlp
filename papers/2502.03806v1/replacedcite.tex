\section{Background and Related Work}
\subsection{Neural Code Models}
The success of neural language models in the natural language domain has inspired researchers to apply similar methods to programming languages. 
To alleviate the software engineering workload, a large plethora of research has explored automating SE tasks, such as vulnerability detection____, bug-fixing____, code translation____, code clone detection____ and code summarization____. 
Specifically, the techniques involve training neural language models on data from public repositories such as GitHub and Stack Overflow____.
Leveraging the naturalness properties of human written code, these neural code models have learned useful patterns that unlock their potential as practical software development assistants____.

\subsection{Curriculum Learning}

Replicating the pedagogical learning process of humans, CL is a training strategy that gradually increases the difficulty of examples presented to the model____, which contrasts with the conventional unordered training schedule.
CL has been effective for a wide range of model architectures and tasks____. 
It improves model performance on complex examples by aligning training schedules with the model's skill-acquiring pace____.
Using generated programs, Na√Ør et al.____ investigated the effects of CL in code completion, whilst Liu et al.____ focused on the task of code execution in competitive programming.
Although conventional difficulty measures such as length and cyclomatic complexity were investigated, these studies focused on synthetic programming problems, which may not generalise to real-world software.
In terms of real-world SE, CL has been employed in tasks, such as code clone detection, code search____ and automated program repair____, however, the methods largely focused on augmenting code to create difficult synthetic examples.
Additionally, past studies mainly focused on the final result, rather than investigating how the code model improves during CL, leaving us with an opaque understanding of the process.
Past studies have also yet to investigate the code-to-text task of code summarization.
