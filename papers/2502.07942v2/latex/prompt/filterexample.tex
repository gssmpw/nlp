\textbf{Instruction:} 
\begin{lstlisting}
Another GPT model needs to predict the next action based on the **Instruction, Interaction History, and Observations**.  

- The **system message** defines what the model can do.  
- The **instruction** represents the final goal.  
- The **interaction history** consists of completed steps.  
- The **observation** reflects the current state of the environment.  

Based on these elements, the model predicts the next action to achieve the goal.

### **Action Choices and Their Meanings:**
- **click [id]:** Click on an element identified by its numerical ID. Example: `click [7]`.  
If clicking doesn't change the web state, try interacting with other similar or relevant elements instead.

- **go_back:** Return to the previously viewed page.

- **stop [answer]:** Stop the interaction and return a response.  
  - If the task doesn't require a textual answer or is unachievable, indicate `"N/A"` and provide reasoning.  
  - Example: `stop [N/A ...]`.  
  - If returning a direct response, the exact value/token should be enclosed in brackets, e.g., `stop [ABC_123]`.

- **note [content]:** Save important information for review.  
  - Example: `note [Spent $10 on 4/1/2024]`.

- **type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]:** Enter text into a field with a specific ID.  
  - Default behavior presses "Enter" unless `press_enter_after=0`.  
  - Example: `type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]`.  
  - If the initial search fails, refine keywords.

- **branch [parent_plan_id] [new_subplan_intent]:** Create a subplan based on previous plans.  
  - Ensure the subplan is linked to the appropriate parent plan.  
  - Example: `branch [12] [Navigate to the "Issue" page to check all the issues.]`.

- **prune [resume_plan_id] [reason]:** Return to a previous plan state when the current plan is impractical.  
  - Example: `prune [5] [The current page lacks items "black speaker," prompting a return to the initial page to restart the item search.]`.

### **Evaluation of External Knowledge:**
External knowledge is provided as examples to assist in completing the task.  
- Evaluate whether the given **External Knowledge** is genuinely helpful in predicting an action, rather than just related.  
- Identify useful external knowledge and explain why it is valuable.  
- Finally, output the **useful external knowledge** in the format: `[External knowledge0, External knowledge1]`.

\textbf{Filter Output:} 
\begin{lstlisting}
Thinking:
Let me carefully analyze the given information and evaluate the External knowledge provided.

1. **Instruction:**  
   The instruction is to add "DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit" to the wish list.

2. **Interaction History:**  
   There is no interaction history provided in this case.

3. **Observations:**  
   The current observation shows a search results page with the target product listed. The "Add to Wish List" button [4606] is available for this product.

4. **External Knowledge:**  
   There are three pieces of external knowledge provided:

   - **External Knowledge0** and **External Knowledge1** describe a different task about filling out a contact form for a refund. These are not relevant to the current instruction of adding an item to the wish list.
   - **External Knowledge2** provides a summary of steps taken to add the exact item we are looking for to the wish list. This knowledge is directly relevant and helpful for predicting the next action.

**Evaluation:**  
External Knowledge2 is extremely useful for predicting the next action because:  
1. It confirms that clicking the "Add to Wish List" button is the correct action to take.  
2. It shows that after clicking the button, the item is successfully added to the wish list.  
3. It provides information about what to expect after the action is taken (e.g., an alert message confirming the addition).  

The other two pieces of external knowledge (0 and 1) are not useful for this specific task.

**Useful External Knowledge:**  
[External Knowledge2]

Based on this analysis, the only useful external knowledge for predicting the next action is **External Knowledge2**.
