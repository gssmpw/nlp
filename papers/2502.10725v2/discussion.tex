\section{Discussion}

\textbf{Multimodal Foundation.} Instance nodes are necessary not only to process language, but also to empower PropNet with the potential to function as the backbone of understanding human's vision and control. Imagine this: you see an apple on the table and stretch out your arm to pick it up. An instance node corresponding to this apple makes it possible to aggregate shape, color and name information together, distinguish this apple from other apples on the table, and also possible to track this apple and compute its relative positions to other objects when it is picked up. 

\textbf{Text Generation.} If PropNet can represent an image or a video, the rules used in the splitting and parsing phases can be reversed to generate a meaningful sentence. For instance, given the subject "apple", the action "fall", and the action source "tree" perceived from an image or a video, PropNet can generate the sentence "apple fall from tree". This represents a novel approach to generate text, fundamentally distinct from the current mainstream multimodal large language models. It is completely transparent and is likely to be closer to the way humans generate language.

\textbf{Long Text Understanding.}  Although in this work we mainly discuss the representation of a single sentence, it is possible to extend this method to a discourse or a conversation. Instance nodes enable PropNet to have potentials in addressing coreference resolution and representing contextual information effectively. Minor changes to current merging strategies can meet the need for linking the representations of each sentence into a unified network. This will provide novel perspectives for the research of long-text understanding in a white-box and human-like manner.

\textbf{Cognitive Process Analysis.} With the emergence of deep learning algorithms, the past decade has witnessed the generation of massive amounts of manually labeled data for training models. Therefore, cognitive processes underlying how humans label input data according to specific instructions, are recorded in these vast datasets. White-box and human-like approaches have the potential to illuminate the cognitive processes, which is exemplified by Section~\ref{cog_diff_in_sts}. It can significantly contribute to a deeper understanding of humanity, such as our behaviors, mentality, and intelligence. 



\section{Limitation}

PropNet would fail to represent if there are errors from spaCy part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing results. For instance, in the sentence ``Blizzard wallops US Northeast, closes road'', the subject of ``close'' is identified as ``wallop''.
