% In this section we aim to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of our approach. In the first experiment we evaluate the scalability of the proposed method by constructing a synthetic task where we can control the size of the symbolic component. We compare the runtime of our approach against two baselines, showing that our novel method for end-to-end abstract NeSy verification scales exponentially better. We also show that our approach is comparable in performance with the one baseline which output bounds. 

% In the second experiment we apply our approach to a real-world autonomous driving dataset. In this case, the aforementioned scalability benefits allow us to handle the larger input dimensionalities that are inherent in real-world applications and verify a safety property on top of two 6-layer convolutional NNs.


In this section we empirically evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach. We assess the scalability of the proposed method via a synthetic task based on MNIST addition, a standard benchmark from the NeSy literature \cite{manhaeve2018deepproblog}. Further, we apply our approach to a real-world autonomous driving dataset and verify a safety driving property on top of two 6-layer convolutional NNs. In this case, the scalability of our technique allows us to handle high-dimensional input and larger networks, which are typical of real-world applications. All experiments are run on a machine with 128 AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core processors (3.7GHz) and 400GB of RAM. The code is available online\footnote{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/nesy-veri-6FBD/}.
