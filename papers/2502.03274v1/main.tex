    \caption{A motivating example for probabilistic NeSy verification. In this autonomous driving example we want to verify two logical constraints $\phi$, a safety-oriented one and a common-sense one, on top of two neural networks accepting the same dashcam image as input. The symbolic constraints are compiled into a tractable representation containing only addition, subtraction, and multiplication. During inference, this is used to reason over the NN outputs and calculate the probability that the constraints are satisfied. For verification, we exploit this structure to scalably compute how perturbations in the input affect the probabilistic output of the whole (NNs + reasoning) NeSy system.}

% \section{TODOs}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Intro: exact approaches sacrifice scalability wrt what?
%     \item What we're doing is actually \textit{harder} than just neurosymbolic verification. We can do quantitative things like what is the \textit{probability} of the NN saying X?
%     \item The effect of reasoning shortcuts on neurosymbolic verification. Why do we care about NeSy verification (and not just neural verification):
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item I don't have NN labels (latent concept annotations).
    %     \item I don't care about NN predictions.
    %     \item My NN doesn't have correct outputs (e.g. action selectors via policy network).
    % \end{itemize}
%     \item NeSy training and its effect on robustness.
    % \item Our approach allows us to verify complicated properties on top of large NNs which were previously out of reach.
% \end{itemize}
