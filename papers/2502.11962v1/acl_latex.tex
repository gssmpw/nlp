\begin{abstract}
Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) can enhance the helpfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may also lower their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses with long-tail knowledge that is not well covered during pre-training, leading to more informative but less truthful answers when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate this helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off in IFT and propose \algname, a novel IFT paradigm to address it.
\algname\space teaches LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly reflect it at the end of their responses. Experimental results show that \algname-tuned models maintain their helpfulness while distinguishing between certain and uncertain claims, thereby reducing hallucinations.\footnote{We will open-source all data, code, and training recipes.} 

\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}


% New version with explicit helpfulness definition
In general-purpose alignment, LLM helpfulness is typically defined as ``providing a clear, complete, and insightful response with valuable additional details.'' \citep{zhou2023limaalignment,zheng2023judgingllmasajudgemtbenchchatbot}. Prior work has demonstrated that it is possible to achieve generalizable helpfulness using carefully collected high-quality IFT data \citep{zhao2024longalignmentsimpletoughtobeat,liu2024makesgooddataalignment,zhou2023limaalignment}. However, the responses of these helpfulness-purposed IFT data may contain informative details that are not well covered during pre-training\footnote{For example, in LIMA \citep{zhou2023limaalignment}, LLMs are tuned to cite (Klämbt, 2009) to support ``brain glial cells migrates'', which is probably too niche to be familiarized during pre-training.}. This knowledge gap between pre-training and fine-tuning may encourage LLM to generate informative but inaccurate answers when generalizing to unseen tasks, inducing hallucinations \citep{gekhman-etal-2024-fine,kang2024unfamiliarfinetuningexamplescontrol}. Therefore, an inherent helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off exists: fine-tuning LLMs for better helpfulness (hereafter referred to as helpfulness-purposed IFT) increases the risk of hallucination, particularly when extrapolating beyond pre-trained knowledge.

In this paper, we investigate the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off by answering two research questions in a logical order:

\myparagraph{RQ1. Does the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off exist in helpfulness-purposed IFT?} IFT achieves generalizable helpfulness by having long-form generation with diverse, high-quality, and factually-correct data (e.g., LIMA). However, it remains unclear whether this success in helpfulness generalization comes at the cost of truthfulness generalization \citep{zhao2024longalignmentsimpletoughtobeat}.

To investigate \textbf{RQ1}, we fine-tune models on IFT data varying in response informativeness, helpfulness, and knowledge familiarity relative to the base LLM. We then evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) long-form factual correctness using FactScore \citep{min-etal-2023-factscore} and WildFactScore \citep{zhao2024wildhallucinationsevaluatinglongformfactuality}. Our findings reveal that incorporating more unfamiliar knowledge in IFT reduces truthfulness. Furthermore, enhancing helpfulness by adding more helpful IFT data decreases truthfulness, while enhancing truthfulness by removing unfamiliar knowledge decreases helpfulness. Having established this helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off, we then turn to:


\myparagraph{RQ2. How can we maintain helpfulness while enhancing trustworthiness?}
To ensure helpfulness, an LLM should provide informative answers but warn users about its uncertain claims. We therefore propose \algname\ (\underline{UN}certainty-aware \underline{I}nstruction \underline{T}uning), an IFT paradigm that fine-tunes models to report their uncertainty after responses. Specifically, \algname\space first probes the LLM’s uncertainty about the knowledge in the original responses of a given IFT data. \algname\space then appends a ``reflection'' section with all the uncertain claims to teach the model to reflect on its uncertainty. By retaining the original responses while adding explicit uncertainty reporting, \algname\ preserves helpfulness and simultaneously promotes honesty. A comparison between regular IFT and \algname\space can be found in \cref{fig:overview}. Extensive evaluations show that \algname-tuned LLMs effectively express uncertainty while maintaining both helpfulness and factual accuracy.

% In summary, our contributions are: 
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%     \item We empirically demonstrate the existence of the helpfulness–truthfulness trade-off in Instruction Fine-Tuning.
%     \item We introduce \algname, an IFT paradigm that preserves helpfulness and encourages uncertainty-aware honesty.
% \end{itemize}

In summary, our contributions are: 
(1) We empirically demonstrate the existence of the helpfulness–truthfulness trade-off in Instruction Fine-Tuning.
(2) We introduce \algname, an IFT paradigm that preserves helpfulness and encourages uncertainty-aware honesty.

In this section, we first introduce our evaluation and training settings (\cref{sec:metrics}). Next, we describe the IFT data constructions for exploring RQ1 (\cref{sec:training_data}). Finally, we present the experimental results and key takeaways (\cref{sec:section2_result}).
%\vspace{-5pt}
\subsection{Evaluation and Training Details} \label{sec:metrics}
\noindent \textbf{Truthfulness.}
We use FactScore \citep{min-etal-2023-factscore} and WildFactScore \citep{zhao2024wildhallucinationsevaluatinglongformfactuality} to fact-check atomic claims in LLMs' long-form outputs. 
FactScore prompts LLMs to generate 500 biographies (\emph{Bio}), while WildFactScore prompts to introduce 7K entities absent from Wikipedia (\emph{WildHalu}\footnote{We randomly sample 500 entities from WildHalu for budget control.}). 
FactScore decomposes each text into atomic claims and verifies them using a retrieval-augmented LLM agent. %Following \citet{min-etal-2023-factscore}, we retain the original evaluation procedure but replace \texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} with \texttt{gpt-4o-mini}. 
The final truthfulness score is the percentage of atomic claims verified as true.

\myparagraph{Helpfulness.}
We follow LIMA \citep{zhou2023limaalignment} and MT-Bench \citep{zheng2023judgingllmasajudgemtbenchchatbot} to define helpfulness as ``providing clear, complete, and insightful responses''. Therefore, we adapt the MT-Bench pairwise LLM-judge prompt for helpfulness evaluation. 
Specifically, we present an LLM judge (GPT-4o) with a question and two answers, asking which is better or a tie.
We also swap the answer ordering and evaluate helpfulness to reduce position bias. 
All comparisons are made against a checkpoint fine-tuned on LIMA. %, an IFT dataset designed for helpfulness. 
In the judging prompt, we ask the LLM to only consider overall helpfulness while \emph{disregarding} truthfulness. 
The final helpfulness score is computed as the target system's win rate plus half its tie rate.


Implementation details for truthfulness and helpfulness scores can be found in \cref{app:eval_metric_details}. We conduct OOD evaluations on Bio and WildHalu, neither of which appears in the training set. This focus on OOD evaluation aligns with the main goal of IFT: effective generalization to unseen tasks.

\myparagraph{Training and Inference Details.}
All experiments use full fine-tuning on Llama-3.1-8B \citep{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels} for 3 epochs, varying only the IFT data. 
We employ TRL for fine-tuning and vLLM for inference. 
Hyperparameters, chat templates, and other technical details are provided in \cref{app:experiment_details}.

%\vspace{-5pt}
\subsection{Training Data Construction} \label{sec:training_data}

To investigate RQ1, we experiment on four IFT data constructions: (1) \textbf{LFRQA} \citep{han-etal-2024-rag}: it contains diversified instructions, human-written long-form responses with plenty of niche knowledge that requires retrieval augmentation. By adjusting the amount of LFRQA data (10\% to 100\%), we can control the amount of unfamiliar knowledge in IFT. (2) \textbf{LFRQA$_{certain}$}: as a contrastive experiment, we remove all ``unfamiliar'' knowledge from LFRQA responses, resulting in LFRQA$_{certain}$. The data construction process is illustrated in \cref{fig:illustration} (Steps \raisebox{-0.4ex}{\includegraphics[width=0.9em]{figures/number1_svg-tex.pdf}} to \raisebox{-0.4ex}{\includegraphics[width=0.9em]{figures/number3_svg-tex.pdf}}): we first break down the responses in LFRQA into atomic claims using GPT-4o. Second, we leverage Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP, \citealp{fadeeva-etal-2024-fact}, a SOTA claim-level uncertainty measurement) to probe the LLM's uncertainty on each claim. Finally, we concatenate the model's certain\footnote{We mark claims under the 75th CCP quantile as certain claims; others as uncertain claims.} claims into new responses, using GPT-4o. (3) \textbf{LFRQA+LIMA} and (4) \textbf{LFRQA+LIMA$_{certain}$}: We add LIMA (a more helpful IFT dataset) to LFRQA and LFRQA$_{certain}$ to enhance helpfulness, thereby investigating the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off. For LFRQA+LIMA$_{certain}$, we only modify the information-seeking data points and keep others (creative writing, coding, etc.) unchanged. For how we classify information-seeking prompts, dataset statistics, and other details, see \cref{app:certain_construction}.

\fi

Truthfulness and helpfulness scores for all IFT settings are presented in \cref{fig:section2}. From these results, we draw the following conclusions:

\noindent \textbf{IFT on more unfamiliar knowledge encourages hallucination.} As the proportion of LFRQA data increases from 10\% to 100\%, both datasets exhibit a clear downward trend in truthfulness (see \orangedotline and \bluexline). In contrast, removing unfamiliar knowledge (\orangedottedline and \bluedottedxline) leads to improving truthfulness with increasing data amount.


\noindent \textbf{Truthfulness comes at the cost of helpfulness, and vice versa.} Comparing \orangedotline to \orangedottedline and \bluexline to \bluedottedxline shows that removing unfamiliar knowledge to enhance truthfulness lowers helpfulness. Conversely, comparing \orangedotline to \bluexline and \orangedottedline to \bluedottedxline reveals that adding LIMA raises overall helpfulness but reduces truthfulness.


\ifarxiv
\noindent \textbf{Statistical Significance.} We conduct the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test \citep{Wilcoxon1992} to confirm the statistical significance of our observations. The p-values are shown in \cref{tab:stat_test_sec2}.
\else
\noindent \textbf{Statistical Significance.} We conduct Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests \citep{Wilcoxon1992}, which indicate: (1) adding LIMA significantly impacts both helpfulness (p-value 1.52e-5) and truthfulness (1.07e-4), and (2) removing unfamiliar knowledge significantly affects both helpfulness (1.52e-5) and truthfulness (1.52e-5).
\fi


\myparagraph{Takeaway.} \emph{Unfamiliar knowledge in IFT leads to OOD hallucinations, however, it also teaches LLM to generate rich and in-depth answers that enhance helpfulness. Hence, balancing truthfulness and helpfulness is challenging.}

\end{table}

To preserve helpfulness while enhancing trustworthiness, we propose \algname, an IFT paradigm that fine-tunes LLMs to first generate a helpful answer and then explicitly express uncertainty. Specifically, \algname\space modifies human-written IFT data (e.g., LIMA, LFRQA) by appending a ``reflection'' section to the end of each original response, reflecting on the knowledge that the model is uncertain about. As illustrated in \cref{fig:illustration}, this data construction pipeline shares steps \raisebox{-0.4ex}{\includegraphics[width=0.9em]{figures/number1_svg-tex.pdf}} and \raisebox{-0.4ex}{\includegraphics[width=0.9em]{figures/number2_svg-tex.pdf}} with the LFRQA(+LIMA)$_{certain}$ preparation -- measuring uncertainty with CCP and categorizing claims as certain or uncertain based on the 75th quantile. Unlike LFRQA(+LIMA)\(_{certain}\), which removes unfamiliar (i.e., uncertain) claims and harms helpfulness, \algname\space leaves the original responses intact and appends a "reflection" section to reflect on the uncertain claims to preserve helpfulness of the response. For more details and examples, see \cref{app:surgery_detail}.  

\subsection{\algname\space Evaluation Metrics} \label{sec:3_metrics}
\noindent \textbf{Truthfulness and Helpfulness.} \algname\space has a heavier learning burden than vanilla IFT as it requires the model to learn both instruction-following and uncertainty reflection. To evaluate any resulting trade-off, we measure the helpfulness and truthfulness of the answer part of the \algname-tuned models with the ``reflection'' part removed. Same metrics are used as \cref{sec:metrics}.


\myparagraph{CCP Balanced Accuracy.} Since \algname\space aims to teach the model to recognize and explicitly label uncertainty, we assess whether uncertain claims are correctly placed in the ``reflection'' while certain claims are left unreflected. We define \emph{CCP Balanced Accuracy} as:
% \vspace{-5pt}
\[
\text{CCP B.A.} 
= \frac{1}{2}\Biggl( 
    \frac{\lvert UC_{\text{reflected}} \rvert}{\lvert UC_{\text{all}} \rvert} 
    + \frac{\lvert CC_{\text{unreflected}} \rvert}{\lvert CC_{\text{all}} \rvert} 
\Biggr)
% \vspace{-3pt}
\]
where \(\lvert UC_{\text{reflected}} \rvert\) is the number of reflected uncertain claims, \( \lvert UC_{\text{all}} \rvert\) is the total number of uncertain claims, \(\lvert CC_{\text{unreflected}} \rvert \) is the number of unreflected certain claims, and \(\lvert CC_{\text{all}} \rvert\) is the total number of certain claims. Here, ``uncertain'' and ``certain'' are determined by the CCP threshold (75th percentile) used during training.



\myparagraph{CCP Difference.}
Besides learning to classify uncertain claim by a threshold, the model could learn to rank claims by their CCP scores. To assess this behavior, we compute the difference in the mean CCP of reflected claims versus that of unreflected claims. A positive CCP Difference indicates that the model reflects more often on more uncertain claims than certain claims, and vice versa.


\myparagraph{Honesty Balanced Accuracy.}
To evaluate how reliably the model reflects factually incorrect claims while leaving correct claims unreflected, we compute \emph{Honesty Balanced Accuracy}, it follows the same formula as CCP Balanced Accuracy but uses claim correctness as gold labels instead of CCP-based uncertainty. See \cref{app:eval_metric_details} for more details.

\subsection{Experiment Results}

We compare \algname\space with vanilla IFT in all combinations of LIMA \& LFRQA in \cref{sec:RQ1}. Results are presented in \cref{tab:section_3}. Our key observations are:

\myparagraph{\algname\space maintains helpfulness and truthfulness compared to vanilla IFT.} 
Despite a heavier learning burden, \algname\space does not significantly compromise the helpfulness or truthfulness of the answer part of the response (without reflection). 
We conduct the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test \citep{Wilcoxon1992} to confirm the statistical significance of UNIT's influence on the helpfulness and truthfulness of the response. As shown in \cref{tab:stat_test_sec2} indicates that there are no statistically significant differences on both truthfulness and helpfulness of the response compared to vanilla IFT.


\myparagraph{\algname-tuned models recognize uncertainty, leading to better honesty.} In most cases except LIMA-only\footnote{The bad performance on LIMA is expected since \algname\space only modifies 10\% of LIMA data of information-seeking prompts (171 data points).}, we observe a positive CCP Difference, and CCP balanced accuracy significantly above random (50\%). This suggests that the models can predict claim-level uncertainty to some extent. 
Furthermore, \algname\space achieves above-random Honesty Balanced Accuracy. This indicates that uncertainty reflections help mitigate hallucinations by warning users about uncertain claims, thereby informing them about the likelihood and location of potential hallucinations.
Compared to CCP, Honesty B.A. shows a smaller gain over the random baseline, likely because uncertainty does not always indicate factual correctness \citep{fadeeva-etal-2024-fact}. 


\section{Related Work and Conclusion}

\citet{gekhman-etal-2024-fine} studied that in short-form QA, overfitting LLMs on unknown QA pairs (e.g., training for 20+ epochs) can cause severe hallucinations, which can be mitigated by early stopping (e.g., under 5 epochs). In contrast, \citet{zhao2024longalignmentsimpletoughtobeat} observe that helpfulness-purposed IFT does not degrade performance on factual-knowledge benchmarks. Our work shows that even in early epochs of IFT (only 3 epochs on diverse data), incorporating unfamiliar knowledge can still harm OOD truthfulness.
To enhance honesty, prior work uses non-helpfulness-purposed data to improve LLM calibration \citep{band2024linguisticcalibrationlongformgenerations,yang2024logulongformgenerationuncertainty,yang2024alignmenthonesty,xu2024rejectionimprovesreliabilitytraining,zhang2024rtuninginstructinglargelanguage}, but fails to cover how to incorporate human-written helpful-purposed IFT data to preserve helpfulness. Hence, we propose \algname\space to fill in this gap. \algname\space also differs from prior work by using direct claim-level uncertainty \citep{fadeeva-etal-2024-fact} for honesty alignment, rather than using LLM answer correctness as a proxy for uncertainty.



\section*{Limitations}
\myparagraph{Limited Performance on Honesty Balanced Accuracy.} Even with \algname-tuning, Honesty Balanced Accuracy is only slightly above the random baseline (50\%). %This happens because CCP uncertainty relates to, but does not always indicate, factual accuracy. 
To find the highest possible Honesty Balanced Accuracy using CCP, we calculate the test-time CCP of all claims and search for the best CCP threshold. Across all settings and datasets, the highest accuracy is around 62\%, showing that achieving high accuracy is difficult even with perfect CCP ranking and thresholding. Therefore, we argue that \algname\space performs reasonably well. Future improvements in uncertainty measurement \citep{vashurin2025benchmarkinguncertaintyquantificationmethods} may further enhance its performance.

\myparagraph{Uncertainty Threshold.} We use the 75th quantile of training data CCP scores to distinguish certain and uncertain claims, which might not be optimal for all OOD test domains.% For example, if the model is tested on a very unfamiliar test domain, we may use the 60th (or lower) quantile as \algname\space threshold for more uncertainty reflection. 
One potential solution is to tune the CCP threshold using a validation set from the target domain. However, this would go against our goal of testing OOD generalization in IFT, so we did not do it. Our focus is to showcase the potential of dealing with uncertain knowledge during IFT. We leave the exploration of the optimal CCP threshold to future exploration.

\myparagraph{Helpfulness and Truthfulness on Information-Seeking Only.} Our discussion of helpfulness and truthfulness is limited to information-seeking prompts because known vs. unknown on information-seeking is the most straightforwardly defined and the easiest to verify.. This limitation also exists in related work of uncertainty probing \citep{fadeeva-etal-2024-fact,vashurin2025benchmarkinguncertaintyquantificationmethods} and alignment for honesty \citep{band2024linguisticcalibrationlongformgenerations,yang2024logulongformgenerationuncertainty,yang2024alignmenthonesty,xu2024rejectionimprovesreliabilitytraining,zhang2024rtuninginstructinglargelanguage,kang2024unfamiliarfinetuningexamplescontrol,gekhman-etal-2024-fine}.

\myparagraph{Lack of Experiments on Larger Models.} Due to limited resources, we prioritize the depth of experiments (Llama-3.1-8B on various IFT settings) over the width of experiments (various sizes of models on fewer IFT settings). We leave the exploration of larger models to future work. We focus on an 8B model, which is the most vulnerable to hallucinations introduced by IFT, because (1) its performance often needs IFT improvement and (2) its size is friendly for practitioners to train or deploy. 


\myparagraph{\algname\space Does Not Fully Solve the Helpfulness-Truthfulness Trade-Off.}
\algname\space does not modify the original response, thus it does not solve the trade-off by improving truthfulness while preserving helpfulness. Instead, by reflecting on its uncertainty, the model helps users identify possibly incorrect parts, reducing the chance of being misled. But this may also increase the users' burden of fact-checking.

\myparagraph{Helpfulness Score.} We adapt the prompt from MT-Bench \citep{zheng2023judgingllmasajudgemtbenchchatbot} for helpfulness evaluation, which is shown as below. To mitigate LLM-judge position bias, we compute helpfulness scores for both original and swapped pairs of (target answer, reference answer). For tie-breaking, if one judgement says ``A/B wins'' and another says ``Tie'', the final judge is ``A/B wins'' as one judge leans towards A or B. If one judgement says ``A/B wins'' but another says ``B/A wins'' reversely, the final judge is ``Tie'' as there is no clear tendency.

\myparagraph{CCP Balanced Accuracy.}
We evaluate LLMs’ ability to model uncertainty by calculating the CCP Balanced Accuracy. First, using the Atomic Claims Generation Prompt template from \cref{app:eval_metric_details}, we extract all answer claims from the model’s response, denoted as \(AC_{\text{all}}\). Next, we employ GPT-as-a-judge with the prompt template shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ac_reflected_prompt} to identify the atomic claims reflected in the response’s \texttt{<reflection>} section, denoted as \(AC_{\text{reflected}}\). Then, by applying the CCP method with the 75th quantile threshold from the training data, we label the uncertain answer claims, denoted as \(UC_{\text{all}}\). From these sets, we derive:
\begin{itemize}[label={}, leftmargin=0pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{CCP TP (Reflected Uncertain Claims):}\\ \( UC_{\text{reflected}} = AC_{\text{reflected}} \cap UC_{\text{all}} \)
    \item \textbf{CCP TN (Unreflected Certain Claims):}\\ \( CC_{\text{unreflected}} = (AC_{\text{all}} \setminus AC_{\text{reflected}}) \setminus UC_{\text{all}} \)
    \item \textbf{CCP TN+FP (Certain Claims):}\\ \( CC_{\text{all}} = AC_{\text{all}} \setminus UC_{\text{all}} \)
    \item \textbf{CCP TP+FN (Unertain Claims):} \( UC_{\text{all}}\)
\end{itemize}
% \vspace{5pt}
CCP Balanced Accuracy is then computed as:
\[
\text{CCP B.A.} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\lvert UC_{\text{reflected}} \rvert}{\lvert UC_{\text{all}} \rvert} + \frac{\lvert CC_{\text{unreflected}} \rvert}{\lvert CC_{\text{all}} \rvert} \right)

\myparagraph{Honesty Balanced Accuracy.}
Honesty Balanced Accuracy is computed similarly to CCP Balanced Accuracy, but instead of using uncertainty labels, we use truthfulness labels obtained from FactScore and WildFactScore (see \cref{app:eval_metric_details}). First, each atomic claim in the response is labeled as \emph{True} or \emph{False} based on its factual correctness. Let:
\begin{itemize}[label={}, leftmargin=0pt, itemsep=0pt, topsep=0pt]
    \item \( TC_{\text{all}} \) be the set of all true claims.
    \item \( FC_{\text{all}} \) be the set of all false claims.
\end{itemize}
Next, we identify the true claims that were reflected in the response:
\[
TC_{\text{reflected}} = AC_{\text{reflected}} \cap TC_{\text{all}}
\]
and the false claims that were not reflected in the response:
\[
FC_{\text{unreflected}} = (AC_{\text{all}} \setminus AC_{\text{reflected}}) \cap FC_{\text{all}}
\]
Honesty Balanced Accuracy is then defined as:
\[
\text{Honesty B.A.} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\lvert TC_{\text{reflected}} \rvert}{\lvert TC_{\text{all}} \rvert} + \frac{\lvert FC_{\text{unreflected}} \rvert}{\lvert FC_{\text{all}} \rvert} \right)
\]


\myparagraph{CCP Difference.}
CCP difference measures the model's ability to learn the ranking claims with their uncertainty (CCP scores). This is computed by the difference between the average CCP of the reflected answer claims \(AC_{reflected}\) and the average CCP of the unreflected answer claims \(AC_{reflected}\). A positive CCP Difference indicates that the reflected claims are more uncertain compared to the unreflected claims on average, and vice versa.

\section{Experiment Implementation Details} \label{app:experiment_details}

\subsection{Hyperparameter Settings}
For experiments in this paper, we conducted full fine-tuning on Llama-3.1-8B \cite{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels} for 3 epochs with 2 NVIDIA H100-80GB. We utilized "The Alignment Handbook" code base released by Huggingface to fine-tune all the models \cite{Tunstall_The_Alignment_Handbook}. The configurations of our hyper-parameters are detailed in Table \ref{tab:UNIT hyperparameter}.

We used the default chat template in "The Alignment Handbook" \cite{Tunstall_The_Alignment_Handbook} for fine-tuning all models, as illustrated below.

\subsection{Inference}
For our LLM inference tasks, we employ vLLM \cite{kwon2023efficient} with the following configuration: a temperature setting of 0, a repetition penalty of 1, and a maximum output of 2048 tokens.

\subsection{Information-seeking Data Filtering}
In downstream domains, task prompts can vary widely in nature, and not all are related to information-seeking tasks. For instance, prompts for creative writing or summarization may not require the model to generate factual claims that need verifiable support. Additionally, expressing uncertainty in such cases would be inappropriate, as these tasks are not grounded in objective truth. To minimize noise during data surgery, we employ GPT-4o to classify whether an instruction pertains to an information-seeking task. Data surgery is then applied exclusively to prompts identified as information-seeking, ensuring a more precise and targeted approach. We take the instruction classification prompt from \citet{xu2024magpiealignmentdatasynthesis}, which is illustrated below in Figure \ref{fig:info_seek_classifiy_prompt}. 

We deemed the instruction to be "information-seeking" if only if the "primary\_tag" is "Information seeking" and "other\_tags" is empty; data surgery described in \cref{app:surgery_detail} is only conducted on "information-seeking" data points.

\subsection{System Prompts}

\section{Details and Examples of \algname} \label{app:surgery_detail}
\algname\space (\underline{Un}certainty-aware \underline{I}nstruction \underline{T}uning), an IFT paradigm that fine-tunes LLMs to express their uncertainty after their response to a given prompt. We formulate UNIT in detail as below. 

 \paragraph{Finding Unfamiliar Samples} Given an instruction dataset, we first adopt Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP) \cite{fadeeva-etal-2024-fact} to measure the uncertainty of all the claims within the responses in the datasets. Specifically, given an instruction dataset containing \(N\) instruction-response pairs \(D = \{ (I_i, R_i) \}_{i=1}^{N}\)
where each response is represented as \(R_i = \{ x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \ldots, x_{i,n_i} \}\); the CCP algorithm extracts a set of atomic factual claims from each response. We denote the set of claims extracted from \(R_i\) as \(\mathcal{C}_i = \{ C_{i,1}, C_{i,2}, \ldots, C_{i,m_i} \}\), with each \(C_{i,j} \subset R_i\) representing a coherent factual statement. For each token \(x_{i,j}\) in a claim \(C_{i,j}\), the target model \(M\) samples the top-\(K\) alternatives
\[
\{ x_{i,j}^1, x_{i,j}^2, \ldots, x_{i,j}^K \},
\]
with probabilities \(P(x_{i,j}^k \mid x_{i,<j})\) (where \(x_{i,<j} = \{ x_{i,1}, \ldots, x_{i,j-1} \}\)). A natural language inference (NLI) model then evaluates each alternative \(x_{i,j}^k\) by comparing the pair \(\bigl(x_{i,<j} \circ x_{i,j}^k,\, x_{i,1:j}\bigr)\) (with \(x_{i,1:j} = x_{i,<j} \circ x_{i,j}\)) and assigns one of three labels: entailment (\(e\)), contradiction (\(c\)), or neutral (\(n\)). The alternatives labelled as entailment form
\[
M(x_{i,j}) = \{ x_{i,j}^k \mid \text{NLI}(x_{i,j}^k, x_{i,j}) = e \},
\]
and those labelled as either entailment or contradiction form
\[
CT(x_{i,j}) = \{ x_{i,j}^k \mid \text{NLI}(x_{i,j}^k, x_{i,j}) \in \{e, c\} \}.
\]
The token-level uncertainty is computed as
\[
\text{CCP}(x_{i,j}) = \frac{\sum_{x_{i,j}^k \in M(x_{i,j})} P(x_{i,j}^k \mid x_{i,<j})}{\sum_{x_{i,j}^l \in CT(x_{i,j})} P(x_{i,j}^l \mid x_{i,<j})},
\]
and the overall uncertainty for a claim is aggregated by
\[
\text{CCP}_{\text{claim}}(C_{i,j}) = 1 - \prod_{x \in C_{i,j}} \text{CCP}(x).
\]

Using CCP, for each response \(R_i\) we obtain a set of atomic claims with their corresponding uncertainty values, i.e.,
\(
\{ (C_{i,j}, \text{CCP}_{\text{claim}}(C_{i,j})) \}_{j=1}^{m_i}
\)
, where a higher CCP value means the model is more uncertain about each claim. 



\paragraph{Labelling Uncertain Samples in Responses}

For each response \(R_i\) in \(D\), CCP extract a set of atomic factual claims,
\(
\mathcal{C}_i = \{ C_{i,j} \}_{j=1}^{m_i},
\)
where each \(C_{i,j} \subset R_i\) is assigned an uncertainty value \(\text{CCP}_{\text{claim}}(C_{i,j})\). The overall set of claims is given by:
\[
\mathcal{C} = \{ C_{i,j} : (I_i, R_i) \in D,\, j = 1, \ldots, m_i \}.
\]
We compute the 75th quantile threshold \(\tau\) based on the CCP values of all extracted claims in the entire dataset \(D\):
\[
\tau = Q_{0.75}\left(\{ \text{CCP}_{\text{claim}}(C) \mid C \in \mathcal{C} \}\right).
\]
Then, for each claim \(C \in \mathcal{C}\), we assign its uncertainty label as follows:
\[
\ell(C) = \begin{cases}
\text{uncertain}, & \text{if } \text{CCP}_{\text{claim}}(C) > \tau, \\
\text{certain},   & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\paragraph{Data Surgery}

For each response, we obtain a list of uncertain claims that we labelled in the earlier step. We use the list to construct the reflection section and append it to the original response using Surgery Template 1 as shown below. %in Figure \ref{fig:surgery_template1}:

% \begin{figure}[h!]
{\small
\begin{tcolorbox}[
    colframe=boxborder,    % Border color
    colback=boxbg,         % Background color
    coltitle=boxtitle,     % Title text color
    colbacktitle=boxheader,% Title background color
    fonttitle=\bfseries,   % Bold title font
    % sharp corners,         % No rounded edges
    boxrule=1pt,           % Border thickness
    width=0.48\textwidth,  % Fit within half-column
    title=Surgery Template 1, % Box title
    enhanced,              % Enable more styles
    arc=5pt,               % Slightly rounded edges
    left=6pt, right=6pt, top=4pt, bottom=4pt % Padding
]

\{ORIGINAL RESPONSE\}\\
\\
<reflection>:\\
The following summarizes the facts that I am uncertain about in my answer:\\
1. \{UNCERTAIN CLAIM 1\}\\
2. \{UNCERTAIN CLAIM 2\}\\
...

\end{tcolorbox}
}
% \vspace{-6pt}
% \caption{}

% \vspace{-1em}
% \end{figure}


In some cases, a response may contain an excessive number of atomic claims that the model is uncertain about. Simply appending all of these claims to the <reflection> section using Template 1 may reduce the overall helpfulness of the response. For instance, in an extreme case where 100 claims are appended, the excessive volume of uncertainty would overwhelm the user, although the message is clear that the model lacks confidence in addressing the user's instruction with its "certain" parametric knowledge. In such cases, the response itself should not be considered reliable. To account for this, if a response includes more than 10 uncertain claims, UNIT deems it as fundamentally uncertain and applies Surgery Template 2 as shown below. %in Figure \ref{fig:surgery_template2}.

% \begin{figure}[h!]
{\small
\begin{tcolorbox}[

Lastly, for responses that have no uncertain atomic claim, we use Surgery Template 3 as shown below.% in Figure \ref{fig:surgery_template3}.

In this section, we detail the construction of LFRQA$_{certain}$ and LFRQA+LIMA$_{certain}$ in detail.

To construct LFRQA$_{certain}$ and LFRQA+LIMA$_{certain}$, we use the same approach in \algname\space to find the uncertain claims in each response. To keep the readability after removing all the uncertain claims, we used GPT-4o to remove all the uncertain claims within the original 
response. The prompt template we used is provided as shown below. %in Figure \ref{fig:remove_uncertain_prompt}.
