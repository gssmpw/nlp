\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a complete real-time planning and control approach for continuous, reliable, and fast online generation of dynamically feasible Bernstein trajectories and control for FW aircrafts. The generated trajectories span kilometers, navigating through multiple waypoints. By leveraging differential flatness equations for coordinated flight, we ensure precise trajectory tracking. Our approach guarantees smooth transitions from simulation to real-world applications, enabling timely field deployment. The system also features a user-friendly mission planning interface. Continuous replanning  maintains the rajectory curvature 
$\kappa$ within limits, preventing abrupt roll changes.

Future works will include the ability to add  a higher-level kinodynamic path planner to optimize waypoint spatial allocation and improve replanning success, and enhancing the trajectory-tracking algorithm by refining the aerodynamic coefficient estimation.
