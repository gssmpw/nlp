\begin{abstract}

Efficient real-time trajectory planning and control for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles is challenging due to their non-holonomic nature, complex dynamics, and the additional uncertainties introduced by unknown aerodynamic effects. 
In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path. 
Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in generating trajectories even in challenging conditions for small FW such as wind disturbances.

% In this paper, we present an efficient real-time trajectory planning and generation framework for fixed-wing aircraft. This framework ensures dynamic feasibility, which is critical for non-holonomic systems like fixed-wings. Due to fixed-wings' continuous forward motion, we require a smooth transition between trajectories at waypoints while maintaining coupled dynamics and constant speed. In our approach, we represent our trajectory using a Bernstein polynomial with continuous replanning to respect non-linear coupled dynamics.
