With the vast and dynamic user-generated content on Roblox, creating effective game recommendations requires a deep understanding of game content. However, due to the inconsistent and sparse nature of game text features—such as titles and descriptions—traditional recommendation models struggle to interpret and utilize this information effectively. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for enhancing recommendation systems by extracting and analyzing in-game text data. This paper addresses two primary challenges: \textbf{(1) generating high-quality, structured text features for games without extensive human annotation}, and \textbf{(2) validating the quality of these features to ensure they improve recommendation relevance}. To tackle these, we propose an approach centered on extracting in-game text and leveraging LLMs to infer essential attributes, such as genre and gameplay objectives, from raw player interactions. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based re-ranking mechanism to verify the effectiveness of the generated text features, thereby enhancing personalization and user satisfaction. Beyond recommendations, our approach enables applications such as user engagement-based integrity detection, which has already been deployed in production. Our method provides a scalable, content-driven framework for improving recommendation quality on Roblox, demonstrating the potential of in-game text understanding to adapt recommendations to the platform's unique, user-generated ecosystem.
