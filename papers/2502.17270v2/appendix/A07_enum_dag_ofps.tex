The 8 properties, covering all $OF^\beta_\alpha$ cases of Sec.\ref{ssec:metrics} are:\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{F_{IN}}_{S_{ND}}$ as ``finalization-order-fairness w.r.t.~transaction emission'': if the initial emission of $x$ by a certain client precedes that of $x'$ then all honest nodes must finalize $x$ before $x'$.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{W_{AV}}_{S_{ND}}$ as ``wave-order-fairness w.r.t.~transaction emission'': if the initial emission of $x$ by a certain client precedes that of $x'$ then no honest node can finalize $x'$ in a wave before that in which $x$ is finalized.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{F_{IN}}_{R_{EC}}$ as ``finalization-order-fairness w.r.t.~reception from client'': if a majority of nodes receive $x$ from a client before they do so for $x'$ then all honest nodes must finalize $x$ before $x'$.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{W_{AV}}_{R_{EC}}$ as ``wave-order-fairness w.r.t.~reception from client'': if a majority of nodes receive $x$ from a client before they do so for $x'$ then no honest node can finalize $x'$ in a wave before that in which $x$ is finalized.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{F_{IN}}_{I_{NI}}$ as ``finalization-order-fairness w.r.t.~broadcast initiation'': if a majority of nodes begin their participation in the reliable broadcast of a vertex that contains $x$ before they do so for $x'$ then all honest nodes must finalize $x$ before $x'$.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{W_{AV}}_{I_{NI}}$ as ``wave-order-fairness w.r.t.~broadcast initiation'': if a majority of nodes begin their participation in the reliable broadcast of a vertex that contains $x$ before they do so for $x'$ then no honest node can finalize $x'$ in a wave before that in which $x$ is finalized.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{F_{IN}}_{D_{LV}}$ as ``finalization-order-fairness w.r.t.~broadcast delivery'': if a majority of nodes deliver a vertex containing $x$ before they do so for $x'$ then all honest nodes must finalize $x$ before $x'$.\\
\noindent$\bullet$ $OF^{W_{AV}}_{D_{LV}}$ as ``wave-order-fairness w.r.t.~broadcast delivery'': if a majority of nodes deliver a vertex containing $x$ before they do so for $x'$ then no honest node can finalize $x'$ in a wave before that in which $x$ is finalized.
