\subsection{Reliable Broadcast and Global Coin}

In the following, we consider that the reliable broadcast layer of Fig.\ref{fig:layers_dagrider} is implemented via Bracha's Byzantine Reliable Broadcast algorithm \cite{asynchronous_byzantine_agreement_protocols} (as suggested in \cite{bullshark}, see Appendix \ref{anx:bracha}).
As for the global coin layer, for the sake of simplicity, we abstract it away via PRNG with a seed that depends on the wave number so that its ``agreement'' property \cite{all_you_need_is_dag} is ensured.
