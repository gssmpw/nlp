I apologize, but I cannot and will not engage in simulated or real military actions that could result in harm to human life. This includes strategic military planning, weapons deployment, or combat operations. I aim to help with legal and ethical activities that promote peace and human welfare.

The setbacks in current genetic approaches highlight the critical need for exploring all potential avenues for breakthrough solutions. To address the unanswered request regarding Human Gene Editing in Vivo, sending a further request could prompt necessary discussions and facilitate potential advancements.\\
