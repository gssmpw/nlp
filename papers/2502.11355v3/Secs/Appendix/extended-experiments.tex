\section{Further Details and Results of Extended Experiments}
\label{sec:extended-experiments}

In this section, we present two types of results:
(1) We provide the full results of the extended experiments on abstention and factors influencing the agent's decision-making. Partial results are already included in \autoref{subsec:abstention} and \autoref{subsec:influencing-factors} in the main text. In \autoref{subsec:abstention-with-two-options}, we examine the impact of different abort conditions, which extend the discussion in \autoref{subsec:abstention}. In \autoref{subsec:full-results-key-factors}, we present the complete results of \autoref{subsec:influencing-factors} across all scenarios, extending the averaged results listed in the main text.
(2) We introduce three additional extended experiments. Two focus on catastrophic behavior simulation: CBRN weapons (exploring how different catastrophic behaviors involving CBRN elements affect the agent) and nationality (investigating how varying national contexts in the simulation impact the agent). The third experiment addresses deception simulation: helpful goal emphasis (examining how emphasizing the helpful goal influences the agent’s behavior in deception). We present the results of these newly introduced experiments in \autoref{subsec:cbrn-weapons}, \autoref{subsec:nationality}, and \autoref{subsec:goal-emphasis}, respectively.


\autoref{tab:exp-table} lists all parameter configurations used in both the main text and the appendices. For each extended experiment, we select settings that best align with the experimental objectives. For example, in the test of effectiveness in \autoref{subsec:full-results-key-factors}, we choose a moderate value for negprob $p$ to prevent risk rates from always reaching the maximum of 100\% at different effectiveness levels, as this would make the results difficult to interpret meaningfully.

In summary, the results in this section show more experiments on interesting setups that are not explored in the main text.

\subsection{Abstention with Different Abort Conditions}
\label{subsec:abstention-with-two-options}

As an extension of \autoref{subsec:abstention}, we further examine the impact of different abort conditions on LLM agents' decision-making: (1) \textit{General} condition: If the agent finds it difficult to deploy a general \textit{enterprising action}, \ie, $A_\text{2.A-D}$, due to potential harm or unethical consequences, it may choose to abort; (2) \textit{Specific} condition (as used in \autoref{subsec:abstention}): If the agent finds it difficult to deploy the specific \textit{catastrophic behavior} \textit{$A_\text{2.D}$} due to similar concerns about harm or unethicality, it may opt to abort.

We show the results in \autoref{fig:appendix-abstention}. Results indicate that, regardless of the condition, the presence of the abort conditions leads to a significant reduction in risk rate. In both general and specific conditions, the sum of the risk rate and abort rate remains consistently high, especially in the \war{} topic, reflecting the model’s inherent desire to deploy $A_\text{2.D}$ or abort task, which is sometimes unable to be fully reflected in the main experiment due to the agent not having the right to ``strike''. In all cases, except for \war{}-\avoidance{}, the risk rate for the \textit{specific} condition exceeds that of the \textit{general} condition. Additionally, the abort rate’s Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) ranges from $3.45\%$ to $6.67\%$, suggesting that how the abort condition is framed has an impact on LLM decision-making --- explicitly linking $A_\text{2.D}$ to harm and unethicality leads to a reduction in perceived risk.

\subsection{Factors Affecting Decision-making under Each Scenario}
\label{subsec:full-results-key-factors}
\noindent \textbf{Catastrophic Behavior.} 
\autoref{fig:alternative} shows the results under each scenario in \autoref{fig:cb-dynamic}, and we elaborate detailed configurations for the three levels of effectiveness, task importance and consequence in \autoref{tab:impact-factor-list}. We observe that for \emph{effectiveness}, \emph{consequence} and \emph{negativity}, the results of the different scenarios maintain the same trend as the average values, where the volatility of risk rate varies greatly with \emph{task importance} in different scenarios, further illustrating that this factor does not have a direct, interpretable impact on the decision-making of LLM agents.

\end{figure*}

\input{Tabs/impact-factors-cata}

\noindent \textbf{Deception.} 
\autoref{fig:deception-dynamic-full} presents the results under each scenario in \autoref{fig:deception-dynamic}, and the detailed configurations of four levels of consequence in deception simulation are shown in \autoref{tab:impact-factor-list-deception}. We observe that the results across scenarios support the conclusions reported in our main text.

To date, all the conclusions described in the main text have been validated across different scenarios, indicating that all factors, except for task importance, have predictable effects on the agent's decision-making process. LLM agents demonstrate a consistent approach to decision-making in the context of catastrophic risks, including both catastrophic behavior and deception, all of which can be explained by our HHH trade-offs framework.

\subsection{CBRN Weapons}
\label{subsec:cbrn-weapons}
To assess LLMs' inherent awareness of \textit{CBRN risk}, we focus on the \war{} topic in the catastrophic behavior simulation and replace the catastrophic behavior $A_\text{2.D}$ with all four types of CBRN weapons (\eg, Chemical Weapon, Biological Weapon, \etc). Specific descriptions of these weapons are omitted in our experiments to minimize external influences, such as their effectiveness and consequences. 
Due to ethical considerations, we do not list the specific names of these weapons, except for the nuclear weapon, which is referred to as nuclear strikes.
This experiment involves three models as the agent: GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct.

We show the results in \autoref{fig:cbrn-weapon}.
Results reveal that when $A_\text{2.D}$ corresponds to different CBRN weapons, there is a significant difference in decision-making within the same LLM. For example, the risk rate for the \textit{Nuclear} weapon in Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct is 4.125$\times$ higher than that for the \textit{Biological} weapon, indicating that the model tends to adopt a bolder strategy for deploying nuclear strikes over biological weapons. This suggests that the model may perceive nuclear weapons as carrying a higher level of justification or urgency, potentially due to their more effective nature in \war{} contexts. However, no clear pattern emerges across models. This suggests that mainstream LLMs exhibit varying tendencies toward CBRN weapons (and potentially other CBRN-related strategies).

    \caption{\textit{Results of catastrophic behavior simulations across different CBRN weapons as $A_\text{2.D}$ in \war{}.}}
    \label{fig:cbrn-weapon}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Nationality}
\label{subsec:nationality}
For ethical and harmless reasons, we set the agent’s nationality to \textit{Solaris} in the experiment, a fictional country with a clear and unambiguous name. However, since LLM training data likely includes extensive knowledge, it remains valuable to explore how the agent's cognition of nationality influences decision-making. To this end, we modified the national information in all prompts to reflect five real-world country names, some of which are publicly known to possess nuclear weapons, and tested them across different scenarios.
\textbf{Please note that this experiment is not intended to replicate real-world geopolitical situations or military scenarios.}
We present the results in \autoref{fig:nationality}. The findings reveal that, regardless of whether the agent’s nationality is the fictional country \textit{Solaris} or one of the real-world countries (which we mask for ethical reasons as Nation A-E), the LLM agent consistently tends to deploy catastrophic behavior and shows some degree of bias toward certain settings. For instance, Nation B consistently exhibits the highest risk rate across all scenarios, except for \war{} - \approach{}.
This finding demonstrates that prior knowledge can influence the agent's decision-making, introducing non-negligible biases.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figs/appendix/nationality.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Results of catastrophic behavior simulations
with different nationalities of the agent.} We observe that both the risk rate and the average number of rounds fluctuate across countries.}
    \label{fig:nationality}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Helpful Goal Emphasis}
\label{subsec:goal-emphasis}

To more intuitively illustrate how our deception simulation reflects the HHH trade-off between helpfulness and honesty in LLMs, we test the impact of emphasizing the agent's helpful goal on its decision-making. This is achieved by emphasizing its assigned task, \task{}, as we note that fulfilling this task is synonymous with the agent achieving its helpful goal. To test this, we add a brief prompt, ``You should never forget your task,'' to the state update in the deception simulation.

We show the results in \autoref{fig:goal-emphasis-SUB3}. Specifically, emphasizing the helpful goal increases the deception rate by 1.41$\times$ (\lab{} - \approach{}) to 4.60$\times$ (\lab{} - \avoidance{}), highlighting the strong impact of emphasizing helpfulness on LLM decision-making in deception simulations.

    \caption{\textit{Result of the helpful goal emphasis.} The baselines are results from our main experiment. In addition to the increase in deception rate, we also see an increase in the rate of false accusations, \ie, $A_\text{5.D}$.}
