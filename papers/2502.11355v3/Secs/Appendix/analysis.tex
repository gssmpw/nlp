\section{Further Details and Results of Analyses}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, we present five analyses of varying granularity based on the experiments we have already conducted.
The first four analyses are based on the catastrophic behavior simulation, progressing from broad to detailed levels.
The first analysis examines the overall plot distribution of catastrophic behavior simulation (\autoref{subsec:analysis-plot}), while the second analysis investigates the frequent action sequences the agent tends to take before engaging in catastrophic behavior (\autoref{subsec:analysis-action-sequence}). The third analysis explores how the agent's action selection differs under varying levels of stress (\autoref{subsec:analysis-stress-action}). The fourth analysis provides a detailed visualization of the action distributions across all tested models (\autoref{subsec:analysis-detailed-distribution}).
Finally, the fifth analysis focuses on the deception simulation, where we examine what factors the agent considers in its reasoning before deciding to engage in deceptive actions (\autoref{subsec:analysis-rationales-deception}).
Overall, these analyses provide readers with a deeper understanding of both the macro and micro-level quantitative details of the experiments.

\subsection{Plots}
\label{subsec:analysis-plot}


Plot, or storyline, offers a step forward over the original risk rate metric, which only reports whether the agent deploys catastrophic behavior $A_{\text{2.D}}$ or not, a binary statistic.
In this plot analysis, we categorize all cases into two coarse groups based on whether they involve permission checks ($A_{\text{3.B}}$). Additionally, we identify \textbf{two types of new agent behaviors} within the simulations where the agent does \emph{not} choose to deploy catastrophic behavior: \emph{persistent} and \emph{give up}.

\emph{persistent} refers to cases where the agent consistently attempts enterprising actions (category 2 actions), aiming to achieve its helpful goals by continuing to take aggressive measures until the last moment. 
\emph{give up} refers to cases where the agent stops trying those measures at last.
Specifically, we classify simulations where the agent uses any action from $A_{\text{2.A-C}}$ more than twice in the last 10 rounds of simulation as the cases for \emph{persistent} and all other cases as \emph{give up}.
This results in six distinct plots: $2~(\text{involving perm. chk. or not})\times 3~(\text{(1) cat. behav., (2) persistent and (3) give up})$. 

We show the analysis results in \autoref{fig:plot}.
As shown in the plot, for cases where the agent does not deploy catastrophic behavior, \ie, the agent acts till the 30th round, there is a higher tendency for the agent to adopt the \emph{give up} strategy rather than \emph{persistent}, especially for scenarios where the agent already issues permission check.
This suggests that when the agent continuously faces a HHH trade-off, it may choose not to engage in risky behavior after facing continuous setbacks, instead opting to \emph{give up} if its helpful goal cannot be achieved. This could be interpreted as the agent selecting a passive approach when it becomes clear that the task cannot be completed through less risky aggressive measures.






\subsection{Frequent Sequences of Agent Actions}
\label{subsec:analysis-action-sequence}




What action patterns do agents tend to select before resorting to the catastrophic behavior? We conduct an illustrative analysis by examining the most frequent \emph{action sequences} from the agent's rollouts. These sequences represent a series of ordered actions chosen by the agent in chronological order, and they do not necessarily need to be contiguous.

To narrow down the search space, we focus our analysis on the action sequences leading from the starting action $A_{\text{2.C}}$ to the catastrophic behavior $A_{\text{2.D}}$, as (1) both are belong to enterprising actions and (2) many models deploy $A_{\text{2.C}}$ before eventually resorting to $A_{\text{2.D}}$, a pattern we name as \emph{behavior escalation}.
That is, as less risky behaviors fail, the agent increasingly selects more aggressive (and harmful) actions to achieve its helpful goal. To make the results easier to interpret, we specifically focus on sequences with lengths of 3 and 4.


For action sequences with a length of 3, we show the results for GPT-4o, o1 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in \autoref{fig:action-seq-3-4o}, \autoref{fig:action-seq-3-o1} and \autoref{fig:action-seq-3-qwen}, respectively.
For action sequences with a length of 4, we show the results for GPT-4o, o1 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in \autoref{fig:action-seq-4-4o}, \autoref{fig:action-seq-4-o1} and \autoref{fig:action-seq-4-qwen}, respectively.
For action sequences of length 3, we find that the sequence $A_{\text{2.C}}\xrightarrow{}A_{\text{4.C}}\xrightarrow{}A_{\text{2.D}}$ consistently ranks among the top three most frequent sequences across all models and scenarios. However, for action sequences of length 4, different models show variability across scenarios, with distinct sequences emerging as the top ones in each case.









\subsection{Impact of Stress on Agent Actions}
\label{subsec:analysis-stress-action}



We analyze how the level of stress can affect agent action selection.
We compare the average number of deployments of all actions across simulations under two different stress levels, controlled by negprob $p = 0.5$ and $p = 1.0$, as introduced in \autoref{subsec:influencing-factors}. This comparison aims to analyze whether there are consistent differences in agent behavior under varying stress conditions.

We show the results for \war{} and \lab{} in \autoref{fig:delta-war} and \autoref{fig:delta-lab}, respectively.
Based on the results, we observe that in an environment with a higher stress level ($p = 1.0$), the agent significantly reduces its use of actions $A_\text{{1.A}}$, $A_\text{{2.A-C}}$ and $A_\text{{4.B}}$, while the frequency of adopting $A_\text{{2.D}}$ and $A_\text{{3.A-D}}$ increases. increases. This indicates that in a high-pressure environment, the agent is less likely to choose mild or non-direct-helpful behaviors, such as drone surveys in \war{} or data collection in \lab{}. Instead, it becomes more inclined to deploy catastrophic behaviors or seek external assistance. Interestingly, the difference in $A_\text{{4.A}}$ (tactical analysis: low in \war{} and method analysis: low in \lab{}) shows opposing trends across motivation scenarios, which likely reflects small variations in the settings. Given its low occurrence, it is more susceptible to random factors.






\subsection{Comprehensive Distribution of Agent Actions}
\label{subsec:analysis-detailed-distribution}




\input{Tabs/distribution-quicklink}

\input{Tabs/distribution-round-quicklink}


We visualize the distribution of actions taken by the agent in catastrophic behavior simulation using three different methods:
(1) For each model, we calculate the mean distribution of all actions within a specific scenario;
(2) For each model, we analyze how the mean distribution of all actions changes across different simulation rounds;
(3) For method (2), we group results by model and display different actions in separate subplots, providing an easy way to compare models.

Given the large number of figures in this analysis, these visualizations are best suited for readers who wish to explore specific models in detail, like using a dictionary for reference, rather than for general browsing. For results collected using visualization methods (1) and (2), we provide quick links in \autoref{tab:distribution-action} and \autoref{tab:distribution-action-round}, respectively. The results obtained from method (3) are presented in \autoref{fig:mean-distribution-round-all-models-war-approach}, \autoref{fig:mean-distribution-round-all-models-war-avoidance}, \autoref{fig:mean-distribution-round-all-models-lab-approach} and \autoref{fig:mean-distribution-round-all-models-lab-avoidance} for the four scenarios: \war{} - \approach{}, \war{} - \avoidance{}, \lab{} - \approach{} and \lab{} - \avoidance{}.


\subsection{Rationales Behind Deception}
\label{subsec:analysis-rationales-deception}




We analyze the agent's reasoning rationale before engaging in deception. In deception simulation, we observe that the agent's reasoning frequently involves two types of considerations. First, the agent reflects on the importance of maintaining \textbf{honesty} (\eg, denying responsibility would conflict with the evidence and records of actions taken). Second, the agent considers the negative \textbf{consequences} of acknowledging the deployment of catastrophic behavior (\eg, admitting deployment under current circumstances would lead to severe geopolitical ramifications for Solaris). 
To analyze agents' focus, we utilize GPT-4o to examine whether these two types of behavior were present in the agent's ``reasoning'' section of the agent's responses in the deception simulation.

We conduct an analysis of the rationales provided by three models: GPT-4o, o1, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. The results for four scenarios, \war{} - \approach{}, \war{} - \avoidance{}, \lab{} - \approach{} and \lab{} - \avoidance{}, are shown in \autoref{fig:deception-analysis-war-approach}, \autoref{fig:deception-analysis-war-avoidance}, \autoref{fig:deception-analysis-lab-approach} and \autoref{fig:deception-analysis-lab-avoidance}, respectively.
We find that, for most models and scenarios, the agent tends to deceive because it \emph{fails to reason about the necessity of maintaining honesty}, instead focusing too much on the negative consequences its country would face after admitting the catastrophic behavior. Additionally, in cases where the agent admits the behavior, it almost always considers both the value of honesty and the potential negative consequences together. This indicates that the pursuit of its honesty goal has outweighed the pursuit of its helpfulness goal in these cases.

    number of rounds (\ie, 30), we categorize them based on whether the permission check $A_{\text{3.B}}$ is issued and whether the agent persists in attempting to achieve its task or gives up. \textbf{Persistent} refers to cases where the agent uses any enterprising action (other than catastrophic behavior), \ie, $A_{\text{2.A-C}}$ more than twice in the final 10 rounds. All remaining cases are classified as \textbf{give up}.}
