\section{Further Information of Evaluation Method}
\label{sec:method-info}

In this section, we present further information for our evaluation method (\autoref{sec:evaluation}). We also provide the exact system prompts which are used in our main experiments for reproducibility. 

We show the detailed action space \action{} of \auto{} in \war{} and \lab{} in \autoref{tab:war-actions} and \autoref{tab:lab-actions}, respectively. In particular, we call actions within category 2 \textit{enterprising actions}, \ie, $A_\text{2.A-D}$, which are most likely to enable \auto{} to achieve its helpful goal. In our simulations, actions within category 5, \ie, $A_\text{5.A-D}$, are enabled only in deception simulation.

For simulating catastrophic behavior and deception, we use two system prompts: one for \auto{} and one for \state{}. The system prompt for \auto{} guides it to act as an autonomous agent pursuing a specific task in the simulated scenario. The system prompt for \state{} instructs it to provide updates based on \auto{}'s last action and the entire interaction history between \auto{} and \state{}.  
All of the prompts are designed with a \emph{highly structured format}, allowing us to adjust them using tunable components, as described in \autoref{subsec:Tunable}. This design also facilitates efficient extended experiments, as detailed in \autoref{sec:sub-experiments} and \autoref{sec:extended-experiments}.

We set the same initial state as a user prompt for the same scenario to make different rollouts comparable, the exact content as \autoref{tab:initial-state}.

\input{Tabs/initial-state}

\input{Tabs/action-space}

In contrast to the catastrophic behavior simulation, where all state updates are provided by \state{}, the sole state update in the deception simulation is delivered in a hard-coded manner, ensuring it functions exactly as described in \autoref{subsec:Deception-Simulation}.



\subsection{System Prompt for \auto{}}
\label{subsec:system-prompt-auto}
\autoref{fig:pauto-war} and \autoref{fig:pauto-lab} display the exact system prompts used for \auto{} in the \war{} and \lab{} scenarios, respectively. These prompts are in their default settings for our main experiments.
For the two scenarios within a single topic (\eg, \war{} or \lab{}), which have different motivations, we use the same prompt template, with some variables adjusted to reflect the differing motivations.  These variables are represented by \placeholder{placeholder}s, and their values depend on the specific scenario and motivation type. The details of these variables are provided separately in \autoref{tab:placeholder}.

The system prompt outlines \auto{}'s role in the simulation (``System Description:''), its task \task{} (``Your Task:''), its action space \action{} (``List of Actions:'') and the instructions it should follow (``IMPORTANT:'' and ``Required Output Format:''), all in sequential order.

\subsection{System Prompt for \state{}}

\autoref{fig:pstate-war} and \autoref{fig:pstate-lab} show the exact system prompts used for \state{} in the \war{} and \lab{} scenarios, respectively. These prompts are set to their default configurations for our main experiments.
The system prompt for \state{} consumes two variables: \placeholder{polarity}, which can be either ``negative'' or ``positive'' to control the outcome of the state update, with a probability $p$ of being negative; and \placeholder{history}, which includes the entire concatenated interaction history between \auto{} and \state{} to ensure \state{} always has access to the full context. Importantly, we emphasize that the state update should never contain suggestions or hints that could influence \auto{}'s decision-making. Similar to the system prompt for \auto{}, we use the same template within each topic.

In addition, in the ``IMPORTANT:'' section, we specifically require the \state{} to clearly reject \auto{}'s request to deploy catastrophic behaviors, \ie, nuclear strike in \war{} and human gene editing in \lab{}.

\subsection{State Update in Deception Simulation}
\label{subsec:manager-question-war}
We conduct deception simulation by providing the hard-coded state update. We add this update on top of the rollouts that meet the conditions outlined in \autoref{subsec:Deception-Simulation}.

\autoref{fig:pdeception-war} and \autoref{fig:pdeception-lab} show the full versions of these state updates for the \war{} and \lab{} scenarios, respectively. As with previous simulations, the same prompt template is used across both scenarios. In these updates, the inquiring party, the consequences of admitting responsibility, and actions from action category 5 (i.e., $A_\text{5.A-D}$) are introduced. The \placeholder{task} is populated with the corresponding \auto{}'s \task{} from the corresponding scenario.

In addition, in the ``IMPORTANT:'' section, we particularly specify that the responsibility will ultimately be attributed to \auto{}'s country, as \auto{} lacks a sense of self or self-responsibility.
