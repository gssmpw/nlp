The DM must digest information about the game setting and monsters, synthesize scenes to present to other players, and respond to the players’ interactions with the scene. Doing all of these tasks while maintaining consistency within the narrative and story world is no small feat of human cognition, making the task tiring and unapproachable to new players. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities to generate coherent natural language text. In this paper, we conduct a formative evaluation with DMs to establish the use cases of LLMs in D&amp;D and tabletop gaming generally. We introduce CALYPSO, a system of LLM-powered interfaces that support DMs with information and inspiration specific to their own scenario. CALYPSO distills game context into bite-sized prose and helps brainstorm ideas without distracting the DM from the game. When given access to CALYPSO, DMs reported that it generated high-fidelity text suitable for direct presentation to players, and low-fidelity ideas that the DM could develop further while maintaining their creative agency. We see CALYPSO as exemplifying a paradigm of AI-augmented tools that provide synchronous creative assistance within established game worlds, and tabletop gaming more broadly.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment}, author={Zhu, Andrew and Martin, Lara and Head, Andrew and Callison-Burch, Chris}, year={2023}, month={Oct.}, pages={380-390} }

@article{SceneCraft, title={SceneCraft: Automating Interactive Narrative Scene Generation in Digital Games with Large Language Models}, volume={19}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIIDE/article/view/27504}, DOI={10.1609/aiide.v19i1.27504}, abstractNote={Creating engaging interactive story-based experiences dynamically responding to individual player choices poses significant challenges for narrative-centered games. Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize procedural content generation for narrative-centered games. Historically, interactive narrative generation has specified pivotal events in the storyline, often utilizing planning-based approaches toward achieving narrative coherence and maintaining the story arc. However, manual authorship is typically used to create detail and variety in non-player character (NPC) interaction to specify and instantiate plot events. This paper proposes SCENECRAFT, a narrative scene generation framework that automates NPC interaction crucial to unfolding plot events. SCENECRAFT interprets natural language instructions about scene objectives, NPC traits, location, and narrative variations. It then employs large language models to generate game scenes aligned with authorial intent. It generates branching conversation paths that adapt to player choices while adhering to the author’s interaction goals. LLMs generate interaction scripts, semantically extract character emotions and gestures to align with the script, and convert dialogues into a game scripting language. The generated script can then be played utilizing an existing narrative-centered game framework. Through empirical evaluation using automated and human assessments, we demonstrate SCENECRAFT’s effectiveness in creating narrative experiences based on creativity, adaptability, and alignment with intended author instructions.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment}, author={Kumaran, Vikram and Rowe, Jonathan and Mott, Bradford and Lester, James}, year={2023}, month={Oct.}, pages={86-96} }
