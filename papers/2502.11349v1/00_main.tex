\begin{abstract}

The integration of large language models (LLMs) on low-power edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, known as edge language models (ELMs), has introduced opportunities for more personalized, secure, and low-latency language intelligence that is accessible to all. 
However, the resource constraints inherent in edge devices and the lack of robust ethical safeguards in language models raise significant concerns about fairness, accountability, and transparency in model output generation. 
%
This paper conducts a comparative analysis of text-based bias across language model deployments on edge, cloud, and desktop environments, aiming to evaluate how deployment settings influence model fairness. Specifically, we examined an optimized Llama-2 model running on a Raspberry Pi 4; GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-flash, and Grok-beta models running on cloud servers; and Gemma2 and Mistral models running on a MacOS desktop machine.
Our results demonstrate that Llama-2 running on Raspberry Pi 4 is 43.23\% and 21.89\% more prone to showing bias over time compared to models running on the desktop and cloud-based environments. 
We also propose the implementation of a feedback loop, a mechanism that iteratively adjusts model behavior based on previous outputs, where  predefined constraint weights are applied layer-by-layer during inference, allowing the model to correct bias patterns, resulting in 79.28\% reduction in model bias.
