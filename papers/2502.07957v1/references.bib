    abstract = "Vision-and-language reasoning requires an understanding of visual concepts, language semantics, and, most importantly, the alignment and relationships between these two modalities. We thus propose the LXMERT (Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework to learn these vision-and-language connections. In LXMERT, we build a large-scale Transformer model that consists of three encoders: an object relationship encoder, a language encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. Next, to endow our model with the capability of connecting vision and language semantics, we pre-train the model with large amounts of image-and-sentence pairs, via five diverse representative pre-training tasks: masked language modeling, masked object prediction (feature regression and label classification), cross-modality matching, and image question answering. These tasks help in learning both intra-modality and cross-modality relationships. After fine-tuning from our pre-trained parameters, our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on two visual question answering datasets (i.e., VQA and GQA). We also show the generalizability of our pre-trained cross-modality model by adapting it to a challenging visual-reasoning task, NLVR2, and improve the previous best result by 22{\%} absolute (54{\%} to 76{\%}). Lastly, we demonstrate detailed ablation studies to prove that both our novel model components and pre-training strategies significantly contribute to our strong results.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms behind those prejudicial biases to ensure that model performance does not result in discriminatory behaviour toward certain groups or populations. In this work, we define gender bias as our case study. We quantify bias amplification in pretraining and after fine-tuning on three families of vision-and-language models. We investigate the connection, if any, between the two learning stages, and evaluate how bias amplification reflects on model performance. Overall, we find that bias amplification in pretraining and after fine-tuning are independent. We then examine the effect of continued pretraining on gender-neutral data, finding that this reduces group disparities, i.e., promotes fairness, on VQAv2 and retrieval tasks without significantly compromising task performance."

	abstract = {Large multimodal deep learning models such as Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have become increasingly powerful with applications across several domains in recent years. CLIP works on visual and language modalities and forms a part of several popular models, such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. It is trained on a large dataset of millions of image-text pairs crawled from the internet. Such large datasets are often used for training purposes without filtering, leading to models inheriting social biases from internet data. Given that models such as CLIP are being applied in such a wide variety of applications ranging from social media to education, it is vital that harmful biases are detected. However, due to the unbounded nature of the possible inputs and outputs, traditional bias metrics such as accuracy cannot detect the range and complexity of biases present in the model. In this paper, we present an audit of CLIP using an established technique from natural language processing called Word Embeddings Association Test (WEAT) to detect and quantify gender bias in CLIP and demonstrate that it can provide a quantifiable measure of such stereotypical associations. We detected, measured, and visualised various types of stereotypical gender associations with respect to character descriptions and occupations and found that CLIP shows evidence of stereotypical gender bias.},

	abstract = {Driven by the goal of eradicating language barriers on a global scale, machine translation has solidified itself as a key focus of artificial intelligence research today. However, such efforts have coalesced around a small subset of languages, leaving behind the vast majority of mostly low-resource languages. What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety. Our model achieves an improvement of 44\% BLEU relative to the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a universal translation system. Finally, we open source all contributions described in this work, accessible at https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb.},

As a result, we present NLLB-CLIP - CLIP model with a text encoder from the NLLB model. To train the model, we used an automatically created dataset of 106,246 good-quality images with captions in 201 languages derived from the LAION COCO dataset. We trained multiple models using image and text encoders of various sizes and kept different parts of the model frozen during the training. We thoroughly analyzed the trained models using existing evaluation datasets and newly created XTD200 and Flickr30k-200 datasets. We show that NLLB-CLIP is comparable in quality to state-of-the-art models and significantly outperforms them on low-resource languages.},

Combined with Locked-image Tuning, with only four TPUv4 chips, we train a SigLiT model that achieves 84.5\% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy in two days. The disentanglement of the batch size from the loss further allows us to study the impact of examples vs pairs and negative to positive ratio. Finally, we push the batch size to the extreme, up to one million, and find that the benefits of growing batch size quickly diminish, with a more reasonable batch size of 32k being sufficient.

	abstract = {Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning. While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this work, we study the problem of learning a *data filtering network* (DFN) for this second step of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on ImageNet can yield worse training sets than a model with low ImageNet accuracy that is trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset DFN-5B enables us to train state-of-the-art models for their compute budgets: among other improvements on a variety of tasks, a ViT-H trained on our dataset achieves 83.0\% zero-shot transfer accuracy on ImageNet, out-performing larger models trained on other datasets such as LAION-2B, DataComp-1B, or OpenAI‚Äôs WIT. In order to facilitate further research in dataset design, we also release a new 2 billion example dataset DFN-2B and show that high performance data filtering networks can be trained from scratch using only publicly available data.},

We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its {\textbackslash}textit\{data\} and {\textbackslash}textit\{not\} the {\textbackslash}textit\{model\} architecture or pre-training \{objective\}. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8{\textbackslash}\% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3{\textbackslash}\% on {\textbackslash}mbox\{ViT-B\} models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains {\textbackslash}textbf\{72.4{\textbackslash}\%\}.
