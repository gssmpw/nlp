\section*{Limitations}

Even though PGMR exhibits markedly improved performance in generating correct URIs and reducing hallucinations, its effectiveness is tempered by the LLM's ability to construct SPARQL query structures accurately.
This is especially evident when looking at the results on the QALD-10 dataset (see \reftbl{tbl:t5_qald_results}), which features notably complex queries involving diverse clauses and literal expressions compared to LCQUAD 2.0.
This limitation may be addressed by using more powerful large LLMs pre-trained specifically over SPARQL query data, combined with the PGMR generation paradigm, but we leave that for future work.
