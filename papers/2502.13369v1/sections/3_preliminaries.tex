\subsection{Knowledge Graphs (KGs)}
\label{sec:kg}
A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a multi-relational graph with entities (e.g., "The Truman Show" and "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor") as nodes and relations $r$ (e.g., "nominated for") as typed edges between the entity nodes \{$s, o$\}. Thus, each edge of the KG represents a fact \{$s, r, o$\}, e.g., \{The Truman Show, nominated for, Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\}.

\subsection{Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)}
\label{sec:uri}
Each entity, relation, and property in a large KG like Wikidata is associated with a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI and a natural language URI label. For example, for an entity with the URI label "The Truman Show," the associated Wikidata URI is "q214801." There are two types of URIs in the Wikidata KG namely, "Q-ids" which correspond to the entities (e.g., "q76" refers to the entity "Barack Obama"), and "P-ids" which correspond to relations, properties, and classes in the KG (e.g., "p26" refers to the relation "spouse").
Generating Wikidata URIs within a SPARQL query using LLMs presents a significant challenge as each URI is just one letter followed by a random number. The LLM can only depend on its internal parametric memory to remember these URI mappings.
