% \section{Analyzing the identified review items based on targets and aspects}

% \ignore{

% To further analyze what LLMs excel at and where they fall short in identifying major strengths and weaknesses, we conducted a follow-up analysis that aims to categorize the strengths and weaknesses based on their targets and aspects (Table~\ref{tab:coding_schema}) and compare the distribution of the categories between LLM-generated review and expert-generated review. This analysis helps us understand how LLMs prioritize different parts of a paper for reviewing papers and which aspects they are better or worse at identifying, offering insights for improving their performance in review generation.
