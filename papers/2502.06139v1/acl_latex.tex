\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
While large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent and contextually rich outputs, their capacity to efficiently handle long-form contexts is limited by fixed-length position embeddings. Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. 
To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model.
We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.

\section*{Limitations}
Although our proposed method, LCIRC, demonstrates notable improvements in handling long-form contexts, several limitations remain. First, the training and evaluation of query dependent context modeling were restricted to question-answering tasks, leaving its generalizability to other query-driven applications, such as information retrieval and dialogue systems, unexplored. Future work is needed to assess its broader applicability. Furthermore, despite the reduction in computational complexity during inference, LCIRC incurs substantial training costs due to the introduction of cross-attention layers, which increases both the computational load and the amount of training data required. This constraint may limit the method’s deployment in resource-constrained environments. Lastly, the experimental evaluation was primarily conducted on English-language datasets, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about LCIRC performance in multilingual or non-English contexts. Further experimentation on diverse linguistic datasets is necessary to evaluate the model’s cross-lingual capabilities.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
All experiments conducted in this study were performed with fairness and transparency in mind. The datasets used were sourced from publicly available data, and no personally identifiable information (PII) was involved. Our experimental design ensured that all models were trained and evaluated under consistent conditions, allowing for fair comparisons. We commit to maintaining high ethical standards in the use and development of our models, promoting responsible research practices.
