\section{Limitation}
There are still a number of limitations in this work. Specifically, the visual-text data was collected by the authors using either a robot-mounted camera or a smartphone. While we have not yet explored the feasibility of leveraging internet-sourced visual-text data, it presents an intriguing avenue for future research.  Specifically,  investigating the necessary degree of visual similarity between internet images and target objects for effective skill transfer would be valuable. Our primary focus here is to introduce a novel pipeline that enables deep learning models to transfer skills to new objects without explicit demonstrations.  Determining the limits of this transferability, particularly concerning the permissible visual gap between training and target objects, remains an open question for future investigation. Currently, our method struggles to generalize to novel backgrounds and lighting conditions. We believe the visual gap between our collected visual-text data and the robot's operational environment contributes to this challenge.  Bridging this gap to improve generalization is a key focus for future development.
