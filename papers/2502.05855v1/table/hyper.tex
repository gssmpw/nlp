    \caption{\textbf{Overview of our dataset for stage 1 training.} Our dataset comprises approximately 100 hours of collected data spanning 91 distinct tasks. The majority of this data was collected using two robot platforms: the Agilex (ARX arm) (42.7\%) and the single Franka Emika robot (34.7\%). The ``ARX arm'' and ``PIPER arm'' represent two distinct robotic arm configurations, both featuring six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) but differing in their kinematic structures and operational characteristics.}\label{fig:data_allocation}
