As mentioned in the manuscript, this paper is an extension of our conference paper presented at WACV 2025. To ensure that this submission represents a significant advancement over the initial version, we would like to emphasize that approximately 50\% of the content in this journal paper is new compared to the conference version. In other words, the content of the current version is approximately twice the initial version. Below, we outline the key enhancements made in this submission:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Thorough Literature Review and Background:} We have significantly expanded the literature review, incorporating recent publications to provide a more comprehensive context. Additionally, we've enriched the background and related work sections to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
   
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Content and Clarity:} We have refined the main contributions and improved the narrative flow to enhance clarity and accessibility. New subsections have been introduced to provide a more detailed explanation of the architecture of our proposed method, along with more comprehensive explanations.
    
    \item \textbf{Experiments.}  We have nearly doubled the amount of empirical results and added explorations that are absent in the journal version.  Specifically, we have conducted further experiments on two new datasets and we have added detailed text enrichment results.  These additions offer deeper insights to the reader and provide a deeper insight compared to the   conference paper.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the length of the paper (excluding the references) has increased from about 14 pages to about 29 pages in the current template. We think these changes would convince you that this paper is a significantly different version compared to the previous conference version and following the IJCV guidelines regarding submission of papers with a conference version, it constitute an appropriate manuscript  for your review. Thank you for your time and consideration.
