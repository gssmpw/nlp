In this demonstration paper, we introduced DenseReviewer, a framework for title and abstract screening for medical systematic reviews with dense retrieval and active learning. We presented a web application, which showcased two interfaces to screen studies. We also presented the underlying Python library which showcased dense retrieval active learning experimentation.

Going forward, we have several new functionalities planned. 
The first planned functionality is to extend the PICO query to allow users to express exclusion criteria. 
The second planned functionality is the automatic extraction and highlighting of potential words or sentences associated with (non-)relevant PICO elements. Several studies have shown the potential of large language models (LLMs) in supporting this task~\cite{ghosh2024alpapico,reason2024automated}. 
The third planned functionality is to automate relevance judgements during screening. We will investigate LLM-assisted screening to further reduce screeners' workload. Several studies have shown the applicability of LLMs at this task~\cite{cao2024prompting,bron2024combining,scherbakov2024emergence}.

%%% TODO:
% also zero-shot dense retrieval?
