\section{Conclusion}
We present Covariate-Adjusted Pre-Training for Epidemic time series forecasting, showcasing the benefits of pre-training and environment modeling. While leveraging pre-training materials, CAPE explicitly learns latent representations of the environment and performs backdoor adjustment. Extensive experiments validate CAPE's effectiveness in various settings, including few-shot and zero-shot.
