Following Dearden, Friedman and Andre (1999), it is proposed that the learning process estimates online the full posterior distribution over models. To determine behavior, a hypothesis is sampled from this distribution and the greedy policy with respect to the hypothesis is obtained by dynamic programming. By using a different hypothesis for each trial appropriate exploratory and exploitative behavior is obtained. This Bayesian method always converges to the optimal policy for a stationary process with discrete states. 1.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

	abstract = {Animals, humans, and organizations are known to adjust how (much) they explore complex environments that exceed their information processing capacity, rather than relentlessly search for the optimal action. The adjusted depth of exploration is supposed to depend on the aspiration level internal to the agent. This action selection tendency is known as satisficing. The Risk-sensitive Satisficing (RS) model implements satisficing in the reinforcement learning framework through conversion of action values into gains (or losses) relative to the aspiration level. The risk-sensitive evaluation of action values by RS has been shown to be effective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, first we analyze RS in comparison with UCB and Thompson sampling algorithms. We also show that RS shows differential risk-attitudes considering the risks. Then we propose the Softsatisficing policy that is a stochastic equivalent of RS and further analyze the exploratory behavior of risk-sensitive satisficing that RS and Softsatisficing implement. We emphasize that Softsatisficing has the potential of modeling risk-sensitive foraging and other decision-making behaviors by humans, animals, and organizations.
In reinforcement learning (RL), the intrinsic reward estimation is necessary for policy learning when the extrinsic reward is sparse or absent. To this end, Unified Curiosity-driven Learning with Smoothed intrinsic reward Estimation (UCLSE) is proposed to address the sparse extrinsic reward problem from the perspective of completeness of intrinsic reward estimation. We further propose state distribution-aware weighting method and policy-aware weighting method to dynamically unify two mainstream intrinsic reward estimation methods. In this way, the agent can explore the environment more effectively and efficiently. Under this framework, we propose to employ an attention module to extract task-relevant features for a more precise estimation of intrinsic reward. Moreover, we propose to improve the robustness of policy learning by smoothing the intrinsic reward with a batch of transitions close to the current transition. Extensive experimental results on Atari games demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both score and training efficiency.},

The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy the policy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected from deploying a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be used to produce unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standard technique. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy --- the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. We present a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performance estimates.},

We introduce the novel Logging-Policy Optimization Algorithm (LogOpt), which optimizes the policy for logging data so that the counterfactual estimate has minimal variance. As minimizing variance leads to faster convergence, LogOpt increases the data-efficiency of counterfactual estimation. LogOpt turns the counterfactual approach - which is indifferent to the logging policy - into an online approach, where the algorithm decides what rankings to display. We prove that, as an online evaluation method, LogOpt is unbiased w.r.t. position and item-selection bias, unlike existing interleaving methods. Furthermore, we perform large-scale experiments by simulating comparisons between thousands of rankers. Our results show that while interleaving methods make systematic errors, LogOpt is as efficient as interleaving without being biased.},

	abstract = {Methods for offline A/B testing and counterfactual learning are seeing rapid adoption in search and recommender systems, since they allow efficient reuse of existing log data. However, there are fundamental limits to using existing log data alone, since the counterfactual estimators that are commonly used in these methods can have large bias and large variance when the logging policy is very different from the target policy being evaluated. To overcome this limitation, we explore the question of how to design data-gathering policies that most effectively augment an existing dataset of bandit feedback with additional observations for both learning and evaluation. To this effect, this paper introduces Minimum Variance Augmentation Logging (MVAL), a method for constructing logging policies that minimize the variance of the downstream evaluation or learning problem.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of evaluating learning systems in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, where failures can have catastrophic consequences. We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents. We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days.},

  abstract = 	 { Motivated by practical needs in online experimentation and off-policy learning, we study the problem of safe optimal design, where we develop a data logging policy that efficiently explores while achieving competitive rewards with a baseline production policy. We first show, perhaps surprisingly, that a common practice of mixing the production policy with uniform exploration, despite being safe, is sub-optimal in maximizing information gain. Then we propose a safe optimal logging policy for the case when no side information about the actionsâ€™ expected rewards is available. We improve upon this design by considering side information and also extend both approaches to a large number of actions with a linear reward model. We analyze how our data logging policies impact errors in off-policy learning. Finally, we empirically validate the benefit of our designs by conducting extensive experiments. }
