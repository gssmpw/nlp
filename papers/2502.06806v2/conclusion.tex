\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1mm}
We propose \textit{Plugin}, a token-level probability reweighting framework that adapts black-box LLMs using only logits and small task-specific data. Framing next-token prediction as a label noise correction problem, we demonstrate both theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight the potential of logit-based adaptation and advocate for broader access to token logits in closed-source LLMs.
