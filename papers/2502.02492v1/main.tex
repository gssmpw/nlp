\section{Conclusions}

Video generation poses a unique challenge, requiring the modeling of both spatial interactions and temporal dynamics. Despite impressive advancements, video models continue to struggle with temporal coherence, even for basic motions well-represented in training datasets (Fig.~\ref{fig:failures}). In this work, we identify the training objective as a key factor that prioritizes appearance fidelity over motion coherence.

To address this, we propose VideoJAM, a framework that equips video models with an explicit motion prior. The core idea is intuitive and natural: a single latent representation captures both appearance and motion jointly. Using only two additional linear layers and no additional training data, VideoJAM significantly improves motion coherence, achieving state-of-the-art results even against powerful proprietary models.
Our approach is generic, offering numerous opportunities for future enhancement of video models with real-world priors such as complex physics, paving the way for holistic modeling of real-world interactions.

\section*{Impact Statements}
The primary goal of this work is to advance motion modeling in video generation, empowering models to understand and represent the world more faithfully. As with any technology in the content generation field, video generation carries the potential for misuse, a concern that is widely discussed within the research community. However, our work does not introduce any specific risks that were not already present in previous advancements. We strongly believe in the importance of developing and applying tools to detect biases and mitigate malicious use cases, ensuring the safe and fair use of generative tools, including ours.

\section{Compositional Guidance vs. Inner-Guidance}
\label{sec:IP2P}
\citet{Liu2022CompositionalVG} proposed \emph{Composable Diffusion Models} where a diffusion model can be conditioned on several signals $c_1, \dots, c_n$. The model's conditional sampling distribution is, therefore,
\begin{align}
    p_\theta(x | c_1, \dots, c_n) = \frac{p_\theta(x,c_1, \dots, c_n)} {p_\theta (c_1,\dots, c_n)} \propto p_\theta(x, c_1, \dots, c_n) \propto p_\theta(x) \prod_{i=1}^n p_\theta(c_i | x).
\end{align}
where $\theta$ represents the model weights, and $p$ is the sampling distribution. Importantly, this formulation assumes that $c_1,\dots, c_n$ are \emph{independent of each other and the weights of the model $\theta$}, allowing to drop the denominator $p_\theta (c_1,\dots, c_n)$. Notice that this assumption does not hold in our setting, where the motion condition $d_t$ is noisy and strictly dependent on the neural network, as one of its outputs, as well as the text conditioning, as it serves as another input to the model. 

Inspired by \citet{Liu2022CompositionalVG}, InstructPix2Pix (IP2P)~\cite{brooks2022instructpix2pix} used a similar compositional formulation to extend Classifier-Free Guidance~\cite{ho2022classifier} to two conditioning signals. Formally, given two conditions $c_1, c_2$,
\begin{align}
    p_\theta(x | c_1, c_2) = \frac{p_\theta(x, c_1, c_2)} {p_\theta (c_1, c_2)} =\frac{p_\theta (c_1 | c_2,x) p_\theta (c_2 | x) p_\theta (x)}{p_\theta (c_1, c_2)},
\end{align}
taking the log derivative this gives us,
\begin{align}
    \nabla \log p_\theta(x | c_1, c_2) =\nabla \log p_\theta (c_1 | c_2,x) + \nabla \log p_\theta (c_2 | x) p_\theta (x) - \nabla \log p_\theta (c_1, c_2),
    \label{eq:ip2p}
\end{align}
next, the IP2P formulation assumes (similar to \citet{Liu2022CompositionalVG}) that we can omit the term $p_\theta (c_1, c_2)$ since it is independent of $\theta$, which is again incorrect in our case.

For completeness, our ablations in Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments} compare our Inner-Guidance formulation with that of IP2P, and find that this theoretical gap causes significant degradation in the performance. The direct interpretation of Eq.~\ref{eq:ip2p} to VideoJAM employed in our experiments is as follows,
\begin{align*}
    \bold{\Tilde{u}^+}([x_t, d_t], y, t; \theta') = \bold{u^+}([x_t, \emptyset]), \emptyset, t; \theta') + \quad \quad \\
     w_1\cdot \left( \bold{u^+}([x_t, d_t], \emptyset, t; \theta') - \bold{u^+}([x_t, \emptyset]), \emptyset, t; \theta') \right) + \\
     w_2\cdot \left( \bold{u^+}([x_t, d_t], y, t; \theta') - \bold{u^+}([x_t, d_t], \emptyset, t; \theta') \right) \quad
\end{align*}   
where the notations follow Sec.~\ref{sec:inner_guidance}, and we employ the same guidance scales as we do for Inner-Guidance, i.e. $w_1=3, w_2=5$. Note that the notations for $w_1, w_2$ are reversed with respect to Eq.~\ref{eq:guidance} since IP2P condition on the visual signal first and the textual signal second and order matters for IP2P, while our Inner-Guidance formulation is order invariant.

\label{fig:motivation_supp}}
\vspace{-14px}
\end{wrapfigure}
To exemplify that steps $t\leq 60$ of the generation are indeed meaningful to determine the motion, we conduct an SDEdit~\cite{meng2021sdedit} experiment, in which we noise videos to different timesteps ($20, 60, 80$), and continue the generation given the noised videos. In Fig.~\ref{fig:motivation_supp}, we show a representative appearance frame and two motion frames for each video, using RAFT~\cite{raft} to estimate optical flow. We observe that the coarse motion and structure of the generated videos are determined between steps $20$ and $60$, since the generation from step $20$ changes the entire video while starting from step $60$ maintains the coarse motion and structure of the input video, suggesting that they are already determined by the input noisy video.
Note that the appearance may still change between steps $60$ and $80$ (right), whereas from step $80$, both appearance and motion seem to be determined.

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:implementation_details}
VideoJAM-4B was fine-tuned using $32$ A100 GPUs with a batch size of $32$ for $50,000$ iterations on a spatial resolution of $256\times 256$. It has a latent dimension of $3072$ and $32$ attention blocks (same as the base model). 
VideoJAM-30B was fine-tuned using $256$ A100 GPUs with a batch size of $256$ for $35,000$ iterations on a spatial resolution of $256\times 256$. It has a latent dimension of $6144$ and $48$ attention blocks (same as the base model). Each attention block is constructed of a self-attention layer that performs spatiotemporal attention between all the video tokens, and a cross-attention layer that integrates the text.
Both models were trained with a fixed learning rate of $5e-6$, using the Flow Matching paradigm~\cite{flow-matching} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminaries}). 

During inference, we perform $100$ denoising steps with a linear quadratic t-schedule using a text guidance scale of $w_1=5$ and a motion guidance scale of $w_2=3$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:guidance}), other than the ablations that test these components. Additionally, we only employ the motion guidance for the first half of the generation steps ($50$ steps) following the conclusions from our motivational experiments (Sec.~\ref{sec:motivation}), as these are the steps that determine the coarse motion in the video, and display less sensitivity to temporal incoherence before applying VideoJAM. In practice, Inner-Guidance is performed similarly to Classifier-Free Guidance~\cite{ho2022classifier}, where all results are generated in a batch 
$\bold{u^+}([x_t, d_t]), y, t; \theta'), \bold{u^+}([x_t, d_t], \emptyset, t; \theta'), \bold{u^+}([x_t, \emptyset], y, t;)$ and the final prediction is calculated following Eq.~\ref{eq:guidance}. The models are trained to generate $128$ frame videos at 24 frames per second, resulting in 5-second video generations.

The models operate in the latent space of a TAE, as specified in Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminaries}. The TAE structure follows that of~\citet{moviegen}, with a temporal compression rate of $\times8$ and a spatial compression rate of
$8\times8$. The Transformer patch size is $1\times 2\times2$.  The text prompt conditioning is processed by three different text encoders: UL2~\cite{tay2022ul2}, ByT5~\cite{xue2022byt5}, and MetaCLIP~\cite{xu2023demystifying}.

Both DiT models were pre-trained using the framework in Sec.~\ref{sec:preliminaries} on a dataset of $\mathcal{O}(100 \text{ M})$ videos. We then fine-tune the models using VideoJAM on under $3$ million random samples from the model's original training set, which constitute less than $3\%$ of the training videos. This allows our fine-tuning phase to be light and efficient. During this fine-tuning, we employ RAFT~\cite{raft} to obtain optical flow per training video.

 
Since each of the baselines generates videos in different resolutions, we resize the baseline results to a $256$ resolution to facilitate a fair and unbiased comparison. No cherry-picking is involved in the evaluation of any of the models, and the first result obtained by each model is taken. All baselines produce the same length of videos ($5$ seconds), therefore we only resize the videos spatially.
For the qualitative results in the website, we train an additional super-resolution model to spatially upsample the $256\times256$ videos to $512\times512$ videos. The training regime follows that of VideoJAM-30B. Note that all our experiments (besides the visualizations on the website) are in the lower $256$ resolution due to resource limitations.

\subsection{VBench Metrics} 
\label{sec:vbench}
We employ all metrics supported by VBench on both VideoJAM-bench and the Movie Gen benchmark. Inspired by the protocol in the VBench paper, we split the metrics into a motion category and an appearance category.
For the appearance category, we include the aesthetic quality and image quality metrics, which assess the per-frame quality of the generated videos, as well as subject consistency and background consistency, which assess the model's ability to maintain a consistent appearance. 
For motion comprehension, we include the motion smoothness score, which aims to assess the realism of the motion, and the dynamic degree score which estimates the amount of motion in the generated videos. In other words, the motion score measures the model's ability to generate meaningful motion (i.e., non-static videos) that is also coherent and plausible.

All scores are normalized and a weighted score is calculated according to the weights suggested in the VBench paper. 
The full results of all VBench metrics for each benchmark are reported in App.~\ref{sec:motion_benchmark},~\ref{sec:moviegen_benchmark}.


\section{VideoJAM-bench: Automatic Metrics Breakdown and Prompts}
\label{sec:motion_benchmark}
In the following, we provide a breakdown of the automatic metrics calculated on our motion benchmark using VBench~\cite{huang2023vbench} for the 4B model (Tab.~\ref{tab:4b_metrics}) and the 30B model (Tab.~\ref{tab:30b_metrics}). As mentioned in App.~\ref{sec:vbench}, the motion metrics measure the amount of motion in the video and the coherence of the motion. In the smaller model category, CogVideo2B scores the highest dynamic degree and the lowest motion smoothness. This indicates that while there is abundant motion in the generated videos, it is incoherent. The DiT-4B base model obtains the best smoothness score, and the worst dynamic degree, indicating that it produces videos with very subtle movements. As can be observed, VideoJAM strikes the best balance, where plenty of motion is generated while maintaining strong coherence.  

For the larger DiT-30B model, we observe, again, that there is a trade-off between the dynamic degree and the motion smoothness, where CogVideo5B produces the most motion, yet it is incoherent. Among the competitive proprietary baselines, notice that Runway Gen 3 obtains a very high dynamic degree, yet it has the lowest motion smoothness among all the proprietary baselines (Runway Gen 3, Sora, Kling 1.5). In Fig.~\ref{fig:qualitative}, we show comparisons to Sora and Kling since these are the most competitive with VideoJAM according to the human evaluation, which is generally considered to be a more reliable evaluation form~\cite{Lumiere,moviegen,Wang2024MotiF}. However, in the website, we include a comparison to Runway Gen 3 in addition to Sora and Kling for completeness. Furthermore, Kling shows the best motion smoothness, with the lowest dynamic degree. Observe that VideoJAM, again, strikes the best balance between motion coherence and the amount of generated motion. Additionally, it outperforms the base model (DiT-30B) across all motion metrics, and nearly all appearance metrics, indicating that our method improves all aspects of the generation.

A full list of the prompts considered in our motion benchmark is provided in App.~\ref{sec:motion_benchmark_prompts}.

\section{Movie Gen Benchmark}
\label{sec:moviegen_benchmark}

We employ the prompts from the official benchmark labeled as containing ``high'' motion since our primary objective is to estimate motion coherence. Additionally, since the Movie Gen benchmark is significantly larger than VideoJAM-bench, and mostly contains less relevant prompts (Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments}), we consider the baselines that provide open-source code and can run automatically. Importantly, note that the apples-to-apples comparison to the pre-trained model, DiT-30B is presented for this benchmark as well, allowing us to assess the direct impact of VideoJAM on a large video generation model.

The results are reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:moviegen}, with a breakdown of the automatic metrics in Tab.~\ref{tab:moviegen_metrics}.
Similarly to the results on our motion benchmark, VideoJAM strikes the best balance between the amount of motion and the coherence of the generated motion. While  CogVideo5B consistently produces the most motion, it is also consistently the least coherent baseline. Mochi, on the other hand, suffers from the complementary problem where less motion is generated. Notably, VideoJAM outperforms all baselines, by a significant margin across all metrics, both human-based and automatic (other than the dynamic degree, where CogVideo5B scores the highest, as mentioned). Importantly, we observe a consistent improvement over the base model used by VideoJAM, DiT-30B in both the appearance and motion metrics across all evaluations, which further substantiates our method's ability to improve all aspects of video generation.

\section{VideoJAM-bench Prompts}
\label{sec:motion_benchmark_prompts}
Below, we present the full set of $128$ prompts used in our motion benchmark, VideoJAM-bench. The benchmark is designed to be diverse, encompassing simple motions (e.g., walking), complex human movements (e.g., gymnastics), rotational motions (e.g., spinning balls), and physics-based actions (e.g., a woman hula hooping). To ensure clarity, the prompts were refined using an LLM to focus on specific motion types, enabling a precise evaluation of the model’s ability to generate coherent movement. Additionally, the prompts vary in detail and include camera instructions to test the model’s performance across a wide range of scenarios.
