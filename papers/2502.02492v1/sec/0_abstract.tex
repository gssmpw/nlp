Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence.
To address this, we introduce \textbf{VideoJAM}, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn \emph{a joint appearance-motion representation}. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. 
During inference, we introduce \textbf{Inner-Guidance}, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal.
Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model.
VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations.
These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.
