\textbf{MLIP architectures} have made significant progress since their initial proposal____. These architectures are usually symmetry-preserving____, with increasingly expressive atom environment embeddings and message-passing operations____. Notably, equivariant architectures based on spherical harmonics representations____ have shown strong performance on large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, the high computational cost of these architectures has sparked significant interest in scalable architectures that may not respect physical principles such as energy conservation____. These models have demonstrated strong performance in accuracy, scalability, and relaxation tasks____. While their non-physical nature may make them unsuitable for direct usage in some physical property prediction tasks, they may still provide benefit by using the pre-training strategy proposed in this paper, distilling them to conservative models____, or combining them with a conservative model in a multiple-time-step integration scheme____. 

\textbf{MLIPs and physical observables.} While MLIPs continue to improve, it is necessary to evaluate them in realistic tasks that are relevant to scientific discovery. Physical property prediction benchmarks that involve geometry optimization____, MD simulations____, vibrational analysis and phonon calculations____, and others are increasing in scale with broader applications and wider adoption. Training strategies for learning from physical observables____ and the higher-order derivatives of the PES____ are promising directions to further improve MLIPs for predicting physical properties.
