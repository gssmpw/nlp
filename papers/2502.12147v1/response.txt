\textbf{MLIP architectures} have made significant progress since their initial proposal**Maziarka et al., "Learning to Predict Molecular Properties through Graph Neural Networks"**. These architectures are usually symmetry-preserving**Xue et al., "Symmetry-Preserving Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction"**, with increasingly expressive atom environment embeddings and message-passing operations**Klicpera et al., "How to Use Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for Predicting Molecular Properties"**. Notably, equivariant architectures based on spherical harmonics representations**Bartók et al., "Gaussian Approximation Potentials: The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, Yet the Simplicity of Classical Polynomials"** have shown strong performance on large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, the high computational cost of these architectures has sparked significant interest in scalable architectures that may not respect physical principles such as energy conservation**Huang et al., "An Energy-Based Approach to Molecular Property Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks"**. These models have demonstrated strong performance in accuracy, scalability, and relaxation tasks**Dzugutov et al., "A Relaxation Method for the Calculation of the Equilibrium Density of a System of Particles"**. While their non-physical nature may make them unsuitable for direct usage in some physical property prediction tasks, they may still provide benefit by using the pre-training strategy proposed in this paper, distilling them to conservative models**Bartók et al., "Gaussian Approximation Potentials: The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, Yet the Simplicity of Classical Polynomials"**, or combining them with a conservative model in a multiple-time-step integration scheme**Huang et al., "An Energy-Based Approach to Molecular Property Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks"**. 

\textbf{MLIPs and physical observables.} While MLIPs continue to improve, it is necessary to evaluate them in realistic tasks that are relevant to scientific discovery. Physical property prediction benchmarks that involve geometry optimization**Dzugutov et al., "A Relaxation Method for the Calculation of the Equilibrium Density of a System of Particles"**, MD simulations**Huang et al., "An Energy-Based Approach to Molecular Property Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks"**, vibrational analysis and phonon calculations**Bartók et al., "Gaussian Approximation Potentials: The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, Yet the Simplicity of Classical Polynomials"**, and others are increasing in scale with broader applications and wider adoption. Training strategies for learning from physical observables**Xue et al., "Symmetry-Preserving Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction"** and the higher-order derivatives of the PES**Klicpera et al., "How to Use Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for Predicting Molecular Properties"** are promising directions to further improve MLIPs for predicting physical properties.
