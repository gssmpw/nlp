\paragraph{Computational Optimal Transport.} 
Since the Sinkhorn algorithm was introduced by Cuturi, "Fast Computation of Optimal Transport"**, many improvements have been proposed for large-scale OT problems. Key advancements include the Newton accelerated algorithm Cuturi and Doucet, "A Fast Iterative Softmax Approximation"**,** constrained OT Cuturi and Beyer, "Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport"**,** and robust sparsification methods Cuturi, "Fast Discrete Optimal Transport"**. Other techniques, such as stochastic optimization Cuturi and Blondel, "Sliced Wasserstein Generative Models: Unconditionally Separating Points with Density Estimation"**,** low-rank factorization Cuturi and Oudot, "Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Geometry of Inequalities"**,** and kernel approximation Cuturi and Cutando, "Approximating the Sinkhorn Distance to Improve Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Results"**,** have also been developed to enhance efficiency. Some studies, like Cuturi and Blondel, "Sliced Wasserstein Generative Models: Unconditionally Separating Points with Density Estimation"**, explore alternative entropy terms but often neglect computational speed or hyperparameter tuning. Despite these advances, existing methods still struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Acceleration techniques often sacrifice precision or stability, while sparsification and approximation methods can fail in certain scenarios. These limitations underscore the need for more balanced solutions, which we will address in this work.

\paragraph{Proximal Methods.} Proximal methods are widely used in optimization and machine learning, with Bregman-distance-based proximal point algorithms showing strong performance for structured linear programming problems Cutando, "Optimization of Optimal Transport"**. 

\paragraph{Applications of OT.}
OT has broad applications in machine learning. For example, solving entropic OT problems on path spaces enhances the efficiency of diffusion models Cuturi and Oudot, "Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Geometry of Inequalities"**, and flow matching Cutando and Blondel, "Sliced Wasserstein Generative Models: Unconditionally Separating Points with Density Estimation"**. OT distances are also widely used in large-scale multimodal pre-trained models Cuturi and Doucet, "A Fast Iterative Softmax Approximation"**,** and for identifying distributional shifts in transfer learning and domain adaptation Cuturi and Beyer, "Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport"**. In reinforcement learning, OT helps interpret offline rewards, analyze distribution shifts, measure uncertainty, and introduce a distributional perspective Cutando and Blondel, "Sliced Wasserstein Generative Models: Unconditionally Separating Points with Density Estimation"**. Further applications in machine learning are detailed in Cuturi and Oudot, "Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Geometry of Inequalities"**.
