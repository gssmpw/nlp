% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Transformers demonstrate significant advantage as the building block of Large Language Models. Recent efforts are devoted to understanding the learning capacities of transformers at a fundamental level. This work attempts to understand the intrinsic capacity of transformers in performing dimension reduction from complex data. Theoretically, our results rigorously show that transformers can perform Principle Component Analysis (PCA) similar to the Power Method, given a supervised pre-training phase. Moreover, we show the generalization error of transformers decays by $n^{-1/5}$ in $L_2$. Empirically, our extensive experiments on the simulated and real world high dimensional datasets justify that a pre-trained transformer can successfully perform PCA by simultaneously estimating the first $k$ eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These findings demonstrate that transformers can efficiently extract low dimensional patterns from high dimensional data, shedding light on the potential benefits of using pre-trained LLM to perform inference on high dimensional data.

% \section{Submission of conference papers to ICLR 2025}

% ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by
% \url{https://openreview.net/}. See ICLR's website for more instructions.

% If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement {\tt
%   {\textbackslash}iclrfinalcopy} should be inserted to adjust the
% format to the camera ready requirements.

% The format for the submissions is a variant of the NeurIPS format.
% Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
% faithfully.

% \subsection{Style}

% Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2025 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here.

%% Please note that we have introduced automatic line number generation
%% into the style file for \LaTeXe. This is to help reviewers
%% refer to specific lines of the paper when they make their comments. Please do
%% NOT refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will be removed from the
%% style file for the final version of accepted papers.

% Authors are required to use the ICLR \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and
% not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.

% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}

% The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available online at:
% \begin{center}
%    \url{http://www.iclr.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+iclr2025_conference.pdf+ contains these
% instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy.
% Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
% \verb+iclr2025_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2025_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
% \verb+iclr2025_conference.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you
% have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
% your own.

% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
% Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
% with no indentation.

% Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
% All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

% Authors' names are
% set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
% address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
% the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
% same address can be on the same line.

% Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


% There will be a strict upper limit of 10 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. 

% % \section{Headings: first level}
% % \label{headings}

% % First level headings are in small caps,
% % flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
% % heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

% % \subsection{Headings: second level}

% % Second level headings are in small caps,
% % flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
% % heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

% % \subsubsection{Headings: third level}

% % Third level headings are in small caps,
% % flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
% % heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}

% These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.
