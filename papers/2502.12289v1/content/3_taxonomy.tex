\section{Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}

% \input{tables/metrics} -> appendix

This section aims to provide a clear taxonomy of criteria for evaluating step-by-step reasoning. Existing criteria can be seen as falling into one of the four categories, namely \textbf{Groundedness}, \textbf{Validity}, \textbf{Coherence}, and \textbf{Utility}. These definitions are \textit{independent} (aim at different objectives -- Section \ref{sec:comparison-ours}), but \textit{not mutually exclusive} (a step can fail to suffice multiple criteria at once).

\subsection{Groundedness}

\textbf{Groundedness} evaluates if the \textit{step is factually true} according to the query \citep{NEURIPS2020_6b493230, gao2024retrievalaugmentedgenerationlargelanguage}. A step can be ungrounded to any part of the query, \textit{e.g.} the question (Figure \ref{fig:metric_intro}-Groundedness) or evidence (\textit{e.g.} falsely stating that \textit{Buddy Rich was born in Chicago}, where the retrieved document states that he was born in New York). 

\subsection{Validity}

\textbf{Validity} evaluates if a reasoning step contains no errors.

The validity of a reasoning step can be defined in terms of \textit{entailment} \citep{bowman-etal-2015-large}, which is widely accepted in factual/commonsense reasoning. Under this definition, a step is considered valid if it can be directly entailed from previous steps \citep{tafjord-etal-2021-proofwriter, dalvi-etal-2021-explaining, PrOntoQA} or at least does not contradict them \citep{DBLP:conf/iclr/GolovnevaCPCZFC23, prasad-etal-2023-receval, zhu2024deductivebeamsearchdecoding}.

The notion of validity often used in symbolic tasks is \textit{correctness}, \textit{e.g.} performing accurate calculations in math reasoning \citep{DBLP:conf/iclr/LightmanKBEBLLS24, jacovi-etal-2024-chain, zheng2024processbenchidentifyingprocesserrors} or inferring the correct logical conclusion based on the provided premises \citep{wu2024cofcastepwisecounterfactualmultihop, jacovi-etal-2024-chain, song2025prmbenchfinegrainedchallengingbenchmark}.

% While early works do not identify the type of fallacies by applying binary or ternary label, recent works tend to include fine-grained error types \citep{song2025prmbenchfinegrainedchallengingbenchmark} or human-written explanations \citep{jacovi-etal-2024-chain} to improve the explainability of the evaluation process.

\subsection{Coherence}
\label{sec:coherence}

\textbf{Coherence} measures if a reasoning step's \textit{preconditions are satisfied} by the previous steps \citep{wang-etal-2023-towards}. For instance, if a trace includes the reasoning step \textit{"Next, we add 42 to 16."} but the origin of the value 42 was never explained in the previous steps, this step is considered incoherent. An intuitive way to obtain an incoherent trace is randomly shuffling a coherent trace \citep{wang-etal-2023-towards, nguyen-etal-2024-direct}, as the premise of some steps will not appear anywhere in the previous steps even though it can be eventually deduced (\textit{valid}).

Note that coherence judgment is inherently subjective and pragmatic compared to other criteria. For instance, seemingly trivial steps like \textit{"A part of something is present in that something"} in WorldTree V2 \citep{xie-etal-2020-worldtree} is annotated as necessary in \citet{dalvi-etal-2021-explaining} but not necessary in \citet{Ott_2023}.

% The same concept is also referred to as \textit{broad validity} (as opposed to strict validity) \citep{PrOntoQA} and \textit{prerequisite sensitivity} \citep{song2025prmbenchfinegrainedchallengingbenchmark}.

% \textbf{Symbolic solutions.} \hspace{0.1cm} Coherence can be clearly defined in \textit{symbolic} reasoning tasks, where the dependency between steps can be symbolically defined. \citep{PrOntoQA} defined steps that require applying two inference rules as valid but incoherent (\textit{broadly valid}). However, as they used a simple synthetic dataset that only includes \textit{Modus ponens}, observed instances of broadly valid steps can be well seen as coherent in common sense. \citet{nguyen-etal-2024-direct}, where a reasoning trace corresponds to a directed path in knowledge graphs (KGs), defines a coherent ERU as a directed KG edge where its source node was already introduced as a target node.

\subsection{Utility}
\label{sec:utility}

\textbf{Utility} measures whether a reasoning step contributes to getting the correct final answer (\textit{answer correctness}).

One interpretation of utility is \textit{progress}, or whether the step is correctly following the ground truth solution. For instance, in Game of 24 (making the number 24 using 4 natural numbers and basic arithmetic operations) \citep{NEURIPS2023_271db992}, a solution can be defined as a sequence of operations (\textit{e.g.} 5+7=12$\rightarrow$12-6=6$\rightarrow$6*4=24.). In this task, the utility of a step (making $5+7=12$ from $5$ and $7$) can be directly assessed by checking if it is a part of a correct solution.
% \footnote{Value function is also often described as \textit{progress} under the policy (\textit{i.e.} LLM) \citep{setlur2024rewardingprogressscalingautomated}. However, for clarity, we restrict the term to \textit{discrete} progress.}

Utility can also be interpreted as \textit{value function} (estimated reward), which is proportional to the probability of reaching the correct answer starting from the step \citep{hao-etal-2023-reasoning, wang-etal-2024-math, xie2024montecarlotreesearch, chen-etal-2023-rev}. This black-box interpretation of utility offers high scalability as it only requires the gold answer, without any human annotation or ground-truth solutions \citep{wang-etal-2024-math, lai2024stepdpostepwisepreferenceoptimization}.
