    abstract = "Inspired by the superior language abilities of large language models (LLM), large vision-language models (LVLM) have been recently proposed by integrating powerful LLMs for improving the performance on complex multimodal tasks. Despite the promising progress on LVLMs, we find that they suffer from object hallucinations, i.e., they tend to generate objects inconsistent with the target images in the descriptions. To investigate it, this work presents the first systematic study on object hallucination of LVLMs. We conduct the evaluation experiments on several representative LVLMs, and show that they mostly suffer from severe object hallucination issues. We further discuss that the visual instructions may influence the hallucination, and find that: objects that frequently appear in the visual instructions or co-occur with the image objects are obviously prone to be hallucinated by LVLMs. Besides, we further design a polling-based query method called POPE for better evaluation of object hallucination. Experiment results show that our POPE can evaluate object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way.",
