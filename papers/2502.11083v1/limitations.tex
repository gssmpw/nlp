% In this section, we discuss the limitations of our FTHSS.
While our method is effective for open-source models, it cannot be directly applied to closed-source models that only provide API access, limiting its applicability in such settings. Additionally, because the method involves fine-tuning, experiments were not conducted on large models, such as those with 70B parameters, due to computational resource constraints. Future work should explore the generalizability of hidden state sharing methods in larger models and across diverse, high-quality, and challenging datasets.
