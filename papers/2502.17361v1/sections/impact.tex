\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning, especially on tabular data ubiquitous in various real-world applications. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here. Specifically, compared to prior work in tabular deep learning, we do not see additional negative ethical and societal impacts that would be created by our work.
