\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	We consider the following system of
	first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
	\beql{bfx'}
		\bfx' = \bff(\bfx)
	\eeql
	where $\bfx=[x_1\dd x_n]\in\RR^n$
	are functions of time and $\bfx'=[x_1'\dd x_n']$
	indicate differentiation with respect to time,
	and $\bff=[f_1\dd f_n]:\RR^n\to\RR^n$.
	Our ODE is autonomous since $\bff$ does not
	depend on time, and so we can assume an initial time
	$t=0$.  Up to time scaling, we can also assume that the end time
	is $h=1$.  

	Given $\bfp_0\in\RR^n$ and $h>0$,
	the \dt{initial value problem} (IVP) for $(\bfp_0,h)$ is the
	mathematical problem of finding a \dt{solution},
	i.e.,
	a continuous function $\bfx: [0,h]\to\RR^n$
	that satisfies \refeq{bfx'}, 
	subject to $\bfx(0)=\bfp_0$.
	Let $\ivp_\bff(\bfp_0,h)$ denote the set of all such solutions.
	%%
    Since $\bff$ is usually fixed or understood,
	we normally omit $\bff$ in our notations.
	%%
	We say that $(\bfp_0,h)$ is \dt{well-defined} if
	the solution exists and is unique, i.e.,
	$\ivp(\bfp_0,h)=\set{\bfx_0}$ is a singleton. 
	In this case, we write $\bfx_0= \ivp(\bfp_0,h)$.
	%% Move away from intro:
	It is convenient to write
			$\bfx(t;\bfp_0)$ for $\bfx_0(t)$.
	%
	See \refFig{Volterra-21-13} for the solution to the
	Volterra system (see Eg1 in \refTab{problems}).
	% described as Eg1 in our list of examples below.
	%%
	The IVP problem has numerous applications including
	in modeling physical, chemical or biological systems,
	%%

	The mathematical IVP gives rise to a several
	algorithmic formulations since we cannot explicitly represent
	$\bfx_0= \ivp(\bfp_0,h)$.
	We choose the simplest algorithm form of IVP,
	that of computing an enclosure for $\bfx(h;\bfp_0)$.
	In any real world applications, we only have 
	approximate values for $\bfp_0$; so we replace $\bfp_0$ by a
    region $B_0\ib\RR^n$ and let
    $\ivp(B_0,h)\as \bigcup_{\bfp\in B_0}\ivp(p_0,h)$.  
	Call $B_1\ib \RR^n$ an \dt{end-enclosure} for $\ivp(B_0,h)$
	if we have the inclusion
		$\set{\bfx(h) : \bfx\in \ivp(B_0,h)}\ib B_1$.

		Corliss \cite[Section 3]{corliss:survey-ode-intvl:89}
		confirms that this is the interval viewpoint.

	So our formal formal algorithmic problem is
	the following \dt{End Enclosure Problem}:

% Remarks about our new notations
One of the barriers to the validated IVP literature
	is its cumbersome notations and lack of precise
	input/output criteria for its algorithms.
	We provide a streamlined notation by exploiting
	the autonomous nature of our ODE, and introducing
	high-level data structures such as the scaffold.

\ssect{Paper Overview}
	%%
	The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: 
	\dt{Section 2} introduces some key concepts and computational tools. 
	\dt{Section 3} gives an overview of our algorithm.
	\dt{Section 4} describes our \stepA\ and \stepB\ subroutines.
	\dt{Section 5} compares our transform approach to
		the classic Euler in a suitable local neighborhood.
	\dt{Section 6} describes the \Extend\ and \Refine\ subroutines.
	\dt{Section 7} presents our end-enclosure algorithm and some experiments.
	We conclude in \dt{Section 8}.
	\issacArxiv[
		\dt{Appendix A} gives some critical proofs. Due
		to space limitation, the remaining proofs
		in found in arXiv \cite{zhang-yap:ivp:25arxiv}.
	]{
		\dt{Appendix A} gives all the proofs.
		\dt{Appendix B} provide details of the affine
		transform $\olpi$.
	}
	

	\ignore{
	In Sections 8 and 9, we present the theoretical details of our
		refinement method, with Section 8 addressing the case where the
		logarithmic norm is negative and Section 9 covering the case where
		the logarithmic norm is non-negative. 
	Finally, in Section 10, we provide the algorithmic details of our
		method and prove that it is guaranteed to terminate.

%	A common scheme in Validated IVP is the 2-step scheme:
%	Step A is finds an initial step size
%	and an domain of existence and uniqueness of solution;
%	Step B refinds the domain of Step A (possibly
%	reducing the step size).
%
%	Besides certified computation (or interval methods),
%		this is of interest for verification research.
%	E.g., Kellison-Appel \cite{kellison-appel:verified-ode:22}
%	developed a framework based on the Coq Proof assistant to
%	verify the accuracy and correctness of ODEs.
