% Mean field game (MFG) \cite{b1} is a mathematical theory developed to study the strategic behavior of large populations of small interacting agents. Drawing inspiration from mathematical physics, specifically from models that examine the collective dynamics of numerous identical particles, the term ``mean field" captures this essence well. It was first introduced in the engineering community by Huang et al. \cite{huang2006large} and independently by Lions and Lasry \cite{b12} in academia. The theory of MFG was expanded by Gomes et al. \cite{b24}, and further by Carmona et al. \cite{b25}, who incorporated the aspect of common noise into the framework. Huang \cite{huang2010large} and
% Carmona and Zhu \cite{b26} explored the dynamics of MFG featuring a dominant player whose impact remains significant even as the player count approaches infinity. They introduced a probabilistic method, revealing that the Nash Equilibrium serves as the resolution to the intertwined system of an MFG and a Mean Field Control problem.
