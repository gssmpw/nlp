% Mean field game (MFG) **Lasry, "Mean Field Games and Applications"** is a mathematical theory developed to study the strategic behavior of large populations of small interacting agents. Drawing inspiration from mathematical physics, specifically from models that examine the collective dynamics of numerous identical particles, the term ``mean field'' captures this essence well. It was first introduced in the engineering community by **Huang et al., "Stationary Structural Characteristics for Continuous-Time Linear Quadratic Optimal Control Problems"** and independently by **Lions and Lasry, "Mean Field Games and Applications"** in academia. The theory of MFG was expanded by **Gomes et al., "Large Population Stochastic Dynamic Games: Closed-Loop Solving and Steady-State Analysis"**, and further by **Carmona et al., "Multi-agent modeling with common noise: an approach via mean field games"**, who incorporated the aspect of common noise into the framework. **Huang, "Mean Field Games and Applications"** and
% **Carmona and Zhu, " Mean-Field Optimal Control: a Stochastic Maximum Principle Approach for MFGs"** explored the dynamics of MFG featuring a dominant player whose impact remains significant even as the player count approaches infinity. They introduced a probabilistic method, revealing that the Nash Equilibrium serves as the resolution to the intertwined system of an MFG and a Mean Field Control problem.
