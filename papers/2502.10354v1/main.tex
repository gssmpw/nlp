\begin{abstract}
Diffusion models generate samples by estimating the score function of the target distribution at various noise levels. The model is trained using samples drawn from the target distribution, progressively adding noise. In this work, we establish the first (nearly) dimension-free sample complexity bounds for learning these score functions, achieving a double exponential improvement in dimension over prior results. A key aspect of our analysis is the use of a single function approximator to jointly estimate scores across noise levels, a critical feature of diffusion models in practice which enables generalization across timesteps. Our analysis introduces a novel martingale-based error decomposition and sharp variance bounds, enabling efficient learning from dependent data generated by Markov processes, which may be of independent interest. Building on these insights, we propose Bootstrapped Score Matching (BSM), a variance reduction technique that utilizes previously learned scores to improve accuracy at higher noise levels. These results provide crucial insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models for generative modeling.
