\subsection{Simulation Evaluation}
\label{sec:appendix:simulation_results}
We also perform controlled experiments in simulation. We use Colosseum~\citep{pumacay2024colosseum} as the benchmark as it displays considerable visual and semantic variations. In simulation, we paired our high-level VLM, with 3D Diffuser Actor~\citep{ke20243d} as the low-level policy, since this is one of the state-of-the-art models on RLBench. We compare {\method} with a vanilla 3D Diffuser Actor implementation without path guidance. \Cref{tab:experiments:colosseum} summarizes our results in simulation. \method \ significantly outperforms vanilla 3D-DA by 21\%. This shows that the 2D paths produced by the VLM in {\method} can help low-level policies to generalize better to novel unseen variations. We refer readers to \citet{pumacay2024colosseum} for details on the variations and \Cref{sec:appendix:simulation_details} for further details.
