\caption{\footnotesize{Ranking-based human evaluation of different VLMs, averaged across various real-world evaluation tasks. Results indicate that \method\ including simulation data is most effective since it captures both spatial and semantic information across diverse tasks from RLBench (RLB). 
%This significantly outperforms zero-shot VLM-based trajectory generation, as described in \citet{gu2023rttrajectory}}}
