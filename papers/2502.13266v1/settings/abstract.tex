The paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach to the pathfinding problem on extremely large graphs. This method leverages diffusion distance estimation via a neural network and uses beam search for pathfinding. We demonstrate its efficiency by finding solutions for 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Rubik's cubes with unprecedentedly short solution lengths, outperforming all available solvers and introducing the first machine learning solver beyond the 3$\times$3$\times$3 case. In particular, it surpasses every single case of the combined best results in the Kaggle Santa 2023 challenge, which involved over 1,000 teams. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Rubik's cube, our approach achieves an optimality rate exceeding 98\%, matching the performance of task-specific solvers and significantly outperforming prior solutions such as DeepCubeA (60.3\%) and EfficientCube (69.6\%). Additionally, our solution is more than 26 times faster in solving 3$\times$3$\times$3 Rubik's cubes while requiring up to 18.5 times less model training time than the most efficient state-of-the-art competitor.
