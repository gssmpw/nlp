\section{Introduction}
Content analysis is a critical research method in various disciplines~\citep{benoit2014content,dart2014sports,macnamara2005media,hara2000content}. It breaks down complex and unstructured text into numeric categories based on theory-driven rules~\citep{krippendorff2018content,weber1990basic}, offering a systematic and quantitative approach to interpreting sophisticated information~\citep{holsti1969content,neuendorf2017content,riffe2023analyzing}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figure/illustration.pdf}
    \vspace{-10mm}
    \caption{Illustration of content analysis. Social scientists convert text into categories based on a codebook, discuss discrepancies, and refine the codebook.}
    \label{fig:illustration}
    \vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}
Particularly, in social science, content analysis is usually labor-intensive and time-consuming~\citep{hopkins2010method,zhao2024automated}. It often requires a team of researchers to manually annotate sizable datasets, conduct comprehensive discussion, and iteratively refine coding rules (a.k.a. codebook) in multiple rounds to ensure reliability and validity of findings~\citep{cohen1960coefficient,krippendorff2018content,riffe2023analyzing}, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:illustration}. This artificial process, while rigorous, presents two challenges: First, it relies heavily on domain-specific knowledge and individual scientists, potentially introducing subjectivity and limiting generalizability. Second, the substantial human resources demanded by content analysis tasks make it difficult to scale, especially as the volume of digital data expands exponentially.

Recent years have witnessed significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs)~\citep{team2023gemini,zhao2024ontology,xia2023molebert,zhao2023survey,jiang2024catching}. LLM agents emerge as a versatile tool across a wide range of domain-specific tasks~\citep{guo2024large,wang2024survey,xi2025rise,park2023generative,li2024personal,wu2024autogen}. However, content analysis tasks present unique challenges, requiring a fine-grained understanding of social science principles, human-like collaborative interaction, and rule-base iterative refinement, which limits the effectiveness of agent systems derived from other tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework to \underline{\textbf{S}}imulate \underline{\textbf{C}}ontent \underline{\textbf{A}}nalysis via \underline{\textbf{L}}LM ag\underline{\textbf{E}}nts (\methodName{}), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:illustration}. \methodName{} imitates key phases of content analysis, including text coding, collaborative discussions, and dynamic codebook evolution, while capturing the reflective depth and adaptive discussions of diverse human researchers, thereby reducing subjectivity and improving scalability. Moreover, by incorporating different human-AI collaboration modes inspired by social influence theories ~\citep{cialdini2007influence,french1959bases} and human-computer interaction theories ~\citep{suchman1987plans,sundar2020rise}, our framework extends multi-agent interactions with human expert intervention. This potentially mitigates algorithmic bias and strengthens contextual sensitivity, making it suitable for a wide range of social science content analysis tasks.

Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that \methodName{} is versatile across diverse social science contexts and has the ability to approximate human judgment in complex content analysis tasks. Developed in collaboration with social scientists, we demonstrate the potential of our framework to transform content analysis in the social sciences and humanities, inspiring the integration of AI into other domain-expert-dependent research methodologies. We summarize our contributions as follows.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=1.5pt]
    \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\star$}
    \item \textbf{Scalability Enabler.} By harnessing the generative power of LLM, our proposed \methodName{} significantly reduces the time, human resources, and costs traditionally required for content analysis tasks, enabling large-scale and high-quality annotation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst work to capture and simulate the rigorous and dynamic process of quantitative content analysis for social science via LLMs.
    \item \textbf{Praxis-Informed Design.} \methodName{}'s design incorporates the domain knowledge of social science through the deep involvement of social scientists. Its key phases---independent text coding, collaborative discussions, and dynamic codebook evolution---faithfully reflect the principles and standards of manual content analysis while being implemented within a computing framework.
    \item \textbf{Human Intervention.} Our framework provides a portal for domain experts to intervene with custom scopes (i.e., \textit{targeted} or \textit{extensive} intervention) and roles (i.e., \textit{collaborative} or \textit{directive} intervention). Incorporating expert input augments AI decision-making by mitigating LLM bias and aligning with expert oversight.
    \item \textbf{Extensive Validation.} \methodName{} demonstrates effectiveness across content analysis tasks involving diverse topics (e.g., analysis of emotion, perspective, and dialogue). Our comprehensive experimental evaluations and analyses by domain experts confirm that \methodName{} can closely mimic human judgment in content analysis, delivering automated, valid, and reliable results invaluable for large-scale social science research.
\end{itemize}


\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Content Analysis.} Content analysis has long been a foundational method in the social sciences and humanities, providing a structured approach to converting qualitative text into quantitative data ~\citep{krippendorff2018content,neuendorf2017content,riffe2023analyzing}. Recently, content analysis has significantly advanced the understanding of complex social issues, ranging from political polarization~\citep{conover2011political} to emotional contagion~\citep{kramer2014experimental} and group dynamics~\citep{holsti1969content}. These traditional methods rely on manual annotation by human coders, who use predefined rules in the codebook to categorize text, often iteratively refining their coding schemes in multiple rounds of discussions~\citep{riffe2023analyzing}. Although manual content analysis provides robust and theory-driven insights, it remains labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to subjectivity~\citep{hopkins2010method}. Furthermore, as the volume of digital text increases, scaling traditional methods to accommodate larger datasets has become increasingly challenging~\citep{zhao2024automated}. The advent of powerful AI and LLM offers an automated and more scalable solution~\citep{eloundou2023gpts,achiam2023gpt,li2024generation}.

\noindent\textbf{Multi-agent Systems for Social Science.} Multi-agent systems (MAS) have become increasingly prevalent in computational social science, modeling social phenomena through agent individuals or groups with predefined behaviors or decision-making rules~\citep{van2008multi,chen2021application,chmura2007extended,macal2016everything,lee2018generating,chen2018dynamic,dehkordi2023using,uhrmacher2018multi}. Recent MAS explore to simulate human-like deliberation for more nuanced decision-making such as data interpretation ~\citep{gurcan2024llm,turgut2023framework}. However, existing systems often lack dynamic revolution of decision rules, collaborative interactions, and a systematic comprehension of social science principles~\citep{gheyle2017content}, which cannot reflect the sophisticated and theory-informed process of content analysis.

\noindent\textbf{Human Intervention.} Human intervention remains essential for the reliable deployment of AI-driven systems~\citep{renner2020designing,shoshitaishvili2017rise}. As a general framework, Human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems allow experts to refine AI outputs, ensuring alignment with domain-specific knowledge and mitigating algorithmic bias~\citep{mosqueira2023human,ghai2022d,xu2023transitioning,jolfaei2022guest,wu2022survey,zanzotto2019human}. This is particularly important in social sciences and humanities, where interpretative depth and contextual sensitivity are critical~\citep{dautenhahn1998art,goodsell2013interpretive}. Recent approaches~\citep{arambepola2021human} integrate expert feedback to adjust categories or schemes iteratively. Our framework significantly extends this line of work by designing different modes of human-AI collaboration informed by social influence theories ~\citep{cialdini2007influence,french1959bases} and human-computer interaction theories ~\citep{suchman1987plans,sundar2020rise}.

\section{Traditional Content Analysis in Social Science: A Preliminary}
Social scientists conduct content analysis by manually annotating textual data to uncover potential patterns and insights. A group of (two or more) social scientists $\mathcal{S}$ first develop a codebook $\mathcal{C}$ that contains a set of coding rules grounded in relevant social science theories and contextualized within the given text corpus. Guided by the codebook, each social scientist then independently labels a small set (e.g., 10--20) of text entries $\mathcal{T}$: $\mathcal{Y}=\mathcal{S}_\text{code}(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{C})$, where $\mathcal{Y} \in \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$ are labels. Later, they meet to discuss and resolve inconsistencies $\mathcal{Y}^{(i+1)} = \mathcal{S}_\text{Discuss}(\mathcal{C}^{(i)},\mathcal{Y}^{(i)})$, where an updated codebook with well-refined and more specific coding rules may be proposed for better annotation: $\mathcal{C}^{(j+1)} = \mathcal{S}_\text{Refine}(\mathcal{C}^{(j)},\mathcal{Y}^{(j)})$. This whole process iterates for multiple (e.g., 3--5) rounds until the discussion converges. The finalized codebook is applied by each social scientist to code all text entries in the corpus $\mathcal{D}$. In general, content analysis in social science centers on two objectives: (I) precisely annotating all text entries and (II) crafting a well-honed codebook with distinct coding rules.


\section{The Proposed Framework: \methodName{}}
\subsection{Content Analysis Simulation}
We introduce \methodName{} as a framework that mirrors the key phases of real-world content analysis---text coding, collaborative discussions, and dynamic codebook evolution. The method unfolds in four primary steps summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:main}. A detailed version of illustration can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}.

\textbf{Coder Simulation.} Prior to the content analysis task, we set up both the LLM agents and the corresponding codebook. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:main}\red{a}, we begin by configuring $N$ LLM agents $\mathcal{A} = \{a_i\}_{i=1}^N$, each emulating a seasoned social scientist through a system prompt that incorporates $N$ distinct personas, $\mathcal{P} = \{p_i\}_{i=1}^N$. These personas---derived from real-world social scientists aside from their names---ensure authentic role-playing. Depending on the specific content analysis task (detailed in Section~\ref{sec:datasets_and_tasks}), we initialize a corresponding codebook $\mathcal{C}$ that either starts with $N'$ human-expert predefined rules (shown in \red{red}) $\mathcal{C} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^{N'}$ or as an empty set $\varnothing$ prompting agents to propose and iteratively refine the codebook from scratch. For simplicity, each rule is tailored to cover a single scenario, enabling the categorization of text into a discrete class. The personas for diverse social scientists are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:persona_prompt}

\textbf{Bot Annotation.} LLM agents convert text entries into numerical categories by applying theory-informed rules from the codebook. Figure~\ref{fig:main}\red{b} elaborates this process. Each agent is assigned an identical batch of $B$ text entries (highlighted in \blue{blue}) from the text dataset and works autonomously to classify each entry into a discrete category (marked in \purple{purple}). Mimicking the independent coding approach of human researchers, these LLM agents adhere strictly to the codebook guidelines, which is facilitated by a prompt (see Appendix~\ref{app:coding_prompt}).

\textbf{Agent Discussion.} In this phase, agents engage in collaborative discussions to resolve discrepancies in their coding outputs, as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:main}\red{c}. Due to the initial ambiguity of the evolving codebook and the distinct personas embodied by each agent, it is not uncommon for agents to generate differing annotations for the same text, which actually mirrors the subjective nature of real-world content analysis. Whenever an agent‚Äôs coding diverges from the consensus, the agents initiate a structured and up-to-$K$-round discussion. During each round, they update their annotations along with explanations based on peer opinions until they converge on a unanimous decision or reach the maximum number of discussion rounds. Once a text entry is finalized, the agents will move to the next entry. The prompt used for the discussion phase is detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:discussion_prompt}.

\input{table/main_dataset}

\textbf{Codebook Evolution.} In this stage, agents refine the codebook by incorporating insights from their discussions (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main}\red{d}). As noted earlier, the initial rules can be ambiguous, overlapping, or insufficiently detailed to cover all categories. To address these issues, we introduce an iterative codebook evolution process grounded in domain expertise. Specifically, the evolution approach offers two strategies: one enriches existing rules by adding clarifying examples and explanations, while the other allows for adding, removing, or modifying rules to dynamically adjust the set of categories. In practice, agents first propose an updated codebook, then engage in multiple rounds of discussion to refine it until consensus is reached (indicated in \orange{orange}). The finalized codebook subsequently guides the next task cycle. Importantly, agents may also retain the current codebook if no changes are warranted. The delicate prompt for the codebook evolution is listed in Appendix~\ref{app:codebook_update_evolution}.

\subsection{Human Intervention}
We further augment \methodName{} framework by integrating diverse human intervention modes that empower domain experts to provide targeted feedback and instructions, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main}\red{c}. Depending on the scope that human experts can control, human intervention can categorized as \textit{targeted} and \textit{extensive} intervention. Further, human intervention can be formulated as \textit{collaborative} or \textit{directive} intervention based on the role the human experts play. Different interventions are detailed as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=1.5pt]
    \item \textbf{Targeted intervention.} The scope of intervention is limited to the agent discussion phase. The process while with less human oversight.
    \item \textbf{Extensive intervention.} Human intervention can be applied to both discussion and codebook evaluation. It may slow automation and raise costs, but it ensures that AI discussion and workflow remain closely aligned with expert insights.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative intervention.} Human experts are involved as collaborators. LLM agents may either accept or reject feedback and suggestions from human experts, which fosters an interactive and cooperative discussion loop.
    \item \textbf{Directive intervention.} Under this mode, human experts serve as absolute authority. LLM agents must adhere to every instruction provided, thereby establishing a highly prescriptive and unequivocally top-down approach.
\end{itemize}

It is noted that, in practice, we can combine various scopes and roles of expert control to enable custom interventions (e.g., \textit{targeted-collaborative} and \textit{extensive-directive} intervention). Different human interventions are implemented by delicately crafted prompts elaborated in Appendix~\ref{app:human_intervention_prompt}.


\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Datasets and Tasks}
\label{sec:datasets_and_tasks}
Our experiments leverage five real-world datasets, each meticulously annotated and validated by social science experts. These datasets are organized into seven distinct tasks that encompass both multi-class and multi-label classification challenges. Table~\ref{table:dataset} summarizes their key characteristics, with further details provided in Appendix~\ref{app:dataset_details}.
 
\input{table/main_result}

\subsection{Experiment Settings \& Metrics}
\textbf{Experiment Settings.} Our multi-agent system is built on GPT-4O and GPT-4O-mini. While alternative backbones (e.g., Gemini, Claude) are available, our focus is on assessing whether LLM agents can simulate sophisticated social science tasks rather than comparing various models. For each backbone, we explore four prompting strategies: vanilla, chain-of-thought (COT)~\citep{wei2022chain}, tree-of-thought (TOT)~\citep{yao2024tree}, and self-consistency~\citep{wang2023selfconsistency} The prompts for CoT and ToT can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:cot_tot_prompt}. The identifiers for GPT-4O and GPT-4O-mini are \texttt{gpt-4o-2024-05-13} and \texttt{gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18}, separately.  We simulate a real-world scenario in content analysis by setting agent number $N = 2$, text batch size $B = 20$, and discussion rounds $K = 3$. We consider and discuss more hyper-parameters in Section~\ref{sec:parameter_sensitivity}.

\noindent\textbf{Metrics.} We define the following evaluation metrics for our content analysis tasks. For various classification tasks, we employ standard multi-class classification accuracy and define the multi-label classification accuracy as $\text{ACC} = 1 - \text{Hamming Loss}$. Furthermore, we use the agreement rate---defined as the proportion of text entries where all agents concur---to assess the level of consensus during discussions. All experiments were conducted over 10 independent runs, with the average results reported to ensure robustness. Further metric details are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:metric_settings}.

\subsection{Superior Performance of \methodName{}}
\subsubsection{Automatic Content Analysis}
We first assess the performance of automatic content analysis without human intervention. (I) As presented in Table~\ref{table:main_result}, \methodName{} achieves satisfactory results with an average accuracy of 0.701 across a diverse range of tasks and models. (II) Notably, different prompting techniques offer distinct benefits: compared to the vanilla model, self-consistency and tree-of-thought (TOT) prompts boost labeling accuracy by 2.31\% and 6.51\%, respectively. However, in certain cases (e.g., CN-NP), chain-of-thought (COT) prompts lead to a significant performance drop. We attribute this decline to the challenging nature of tasks with ambiguous coding rules that introduce greater subjectivity, where the step-by-step thinking induced by COT can inadvertently undermine performance. (III) Furthermore, GPT-4O outperforms its distilled version, GPT-4O-mini, by an average margin of 10.89\%, as expected. (VI) Additionally, we evaluate the impact of inter-agent discussion on coding accuracy. As detailed in Table~\ref{table:appendix_result} and Appendix~\ref{app:additional_automatic_content_analysis_results}, omitting the collaborative discussion phase results in a 14.3\% reduction in terms of average annotation accuracy. A comprehensive analysis of collaborative inter-agent discussion is elaborated in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsubsection{Human-Intervened Content Analysis}
Further, \methodName{} can be augmented with four types of human interventions, as detailed in Table~\ref{table:main_intervention_result}. (I) The labeling results with human intervention achieve an average accuracy of 0.872, demonstrating superior performance. When compared to automatic content analysis performance, the model with human intervention shows an average improvement of 12.6\%, validating the effectiveness of our proposed human intervention method. (II) Moreover, interventions in the \textit{directive} mode prove more effective than those in the \textit{collaborative} mode, leading to a 13.1\% increase in coding accuracy. Similarly, models with \textit{extensive} interventions generally outperform ones with \textit{targeted} interventions, yielding a 15\% average improvement. This aligns with intuition, as more domain knowledge from human experts can be involved by intervening in the large scope (i.e., \textit{extensive} intervention) of agent behaviors in a mandatory manner (i.e., \textit{directive} mode). (III) The benefits of human intervention also vary by task. For example, the CSE task sees a 20\% improvement, while the PIS task shows a 5.4\% relative gain---likely because the CSE task is more domain-specific and subjective, thus more responsive to expert insights. Additional results of \methodName{} framework before the agent discussion phase are provided in Table~\ref{table:appendix_intervention_result} and Appendix~\ref{app:additional_content_analysis_results_w_human_intervention}.

\subsubsection{Q1: What designs can promote content analysis performance of \textbf{\methodName{}}?}
\label{sec:parameter_sensitivity}
\begin{figure*}[th]

    }
    \caption{Parameter sensitivity. \methodName{} shows versatility under different parameter settings.}
    \label{fig:prameter_sensitivity}
    \vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure*}

To answer \textbf{Q1}, we analyze how \methodName{} enhances content analysis tasks by considering the number of texts, discussion rounds, and agents.

\textbf{Number of texts.} We first evaluate the influence of the number of texts $B$ (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prameter_sensitivity_a}). Our findings indicate that a moderate $B$ (e.g., 10 and 20) produces the best accuracy. When $B$ is small (e.g., 1), agents frequently refine the codebook, resulting in unstable coding outcomes. However, when $B$ is large (e.g., 40), results become more stable, but the overall performance decreases due to less frequent codebook evolution.

\textbf{Number of discussion rounds.} Next, we examine the effect of the number of discussion rounds $K$, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:prameter_sensitivity_b}. We observe that \methodName{} achieves better performance with higher rounds (e.g., 3, 4, or 5), as more rounds of discussion enhance the consensus between agents, thereby improving coding accuracy. Importantly, setting $K$ to 0 (i.e., no discussion phase) results in a significant drop in accuracy for several tasks (e.g., BCD-D and CN-NP in Appendx~\ref{app:appendix_prameter_sensitivity}), highlighting the importance of inter-agent discussions.

\textbf{Number of agents.} Finally, we assess the impact of the number of agents $N$, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:prameter_sensitivity_c}. Generally, increasing the number of agents improves coding accuracy, as more agents bring diverse perspectives, fostering more comprehensive discussions. When $N$ is set to 1, \methodName{} degrades as a single-agent system, where a single agent performs the coding task without collaboration. As expected, this setup yields the worst performance, verifying the effectiveness of multi-agent design in the proposed \methodName{} framework.

\subsubsection{Q2: How does the discussion between LLM agents impact coding results?}
\label{sec:discussion}
To answer \textbf{Q2}, we conducted a discussion analysis using both qualitative statistics and illustrative examples. Our findings reveal that inter-agent discussions substantially boost consensus---improving the average agreement rate by 41.1\% across all seven tasks and enhancing overall content analysis accuracy by 15.4\%, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:discussion_anlysis_a}. Similar trends were observed for GPT-4O-mini agents, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:additional_discussion_analysis} and Appendix~\ref{app:addtional_discussion_analysis}. 

A practice example of sentimental analysis (multi-class classification task) can be found in the PIS dataset: a tweet such as ``Hey @SamsungMobileUS, bf has a recalled \#GalaxyNote7. Can't find a replacement S7 Edge in Orlando, FL area. Any ideas or help please?"  initially resulted in conflicting sentiment annotations (neutral versus negative). After three rounds of collaborative discussion, both LLM agents agreed on a neutral sentiment---aligning with the ground truth. The complete example is showcased in Appendix~\ref{app:discussion_example_with_agreement}.

However, the benefits of discussion can be marginal when agents remain firmly entrenched in their views. In some datasets (e.g., FWPE and PIS), the increase in agreement was less than 3\%. For example, in one CES (multi-class classification) task, a Facebook comment (‚ÄúThis is so sad :( she was beautiful inside and out! Loved watching her perform <3‚Äù) sparked a debate: one agent rated the emotional support as moderate (i.e., category 2), while another deemed it high (i.e., category 3), and despite extended discussion, their judgments did not converge, as shown Appendix~\ref{app:discussion_example_with_disagreement}.

The aforementioned instances show that even with discussion, task performance gain can be limited when agents are entrenched in their stances, which might be an innate characteristic of LLMs and influenced by the customized agent persona and background. A moderate level of agent difference in terms of personas, compared to low or high levels, may be most productive in revealing diverse viewpoints and fostering discussion that more likely leads to the ``truth'' through meaningful exchanges instead of impasse or blind agreement.

\subsubsection{Q3: How reliable are the codebooks proposed by LLM social scientists?}
One of the key objectives of our method is to refine the codebook for annotating large-scale text. To answer \textbf{Q3}, we analyze the codebook evolution in \methodName{}. We observe that LLM agents can enhance codebooks in non-structural ways by adding clarifying details and examples. For example, during the PIS codebook update (shown in Appendix~\ref{app:codebook_example}), Agent \#1 proposed incorporating examples for each sentiment category (positive, neutral, negative) to ensure consistent interpretation, while Agent \#2 initially preferred the original version. After discussion, the final codebook merged Agent \#1‚Äôs detailed examples with Agent \#2‚Äôs simplicity, achieving a balance of clarity and reliability. This iterative process mirrors core content analysis practices by fostering convergence in agent judgments.

However, the agents were less adept at adjusting codebook categories. For example, in all rounds of FWPE (multi-label classification task) codebook evolutions, both agents maintained that the categorization of twelve discrete emotions (e.g., anger, sadness, and hope) was appropriate, diverging from human experts who ultimately dropped two categories due to overlapping semantic boundaries. This limitation might stem from the reliance on predefined rules and patterns in their training data. LLMs may lack additional domain knowledge apart from content analysis tasks to detect subtle conceptual overlaps (e.g., between anger and disappointment or between happiness and pride), leading to rigid adherence to existing category structures and conceptual boundaries. Human experts, on the other hand, can apply more domain knowledge (e.g., the appraisal theory) and theory-based, contextualized reasoning to recognize subtle distinctions between categories, identify overlap, and even add or drop new categories when necessary.

\subsubsection{Q4: To what extent can LLM agents simulate content analysis?}
To answer \textbf{Q4}, we examine the complete workflow of \methodName{} on the NES (multi-label classification) task. Here, two agents mimic social scientists to classify cancer narrative events into multiple categories (e.g., prevention, detection, treatment, survivorship), which is reported in Appendix~\ref{app:simulation_example}.

\textbf{Text coding.} Both agents independently applied the codebook rules to annotate the presence of one or more cancer narratives. For example, when annotating the text ‚ÄúWhen I hear that some women feel too afraid to go for a mammogram‚Ä¶‚Äù, both agents agreed on labeling it as detection. In contrast, for the text ‚Äú...After that I will have 25 days of radiation... But through it all, I have had great support from my family and friends,‚Äù Agent \#1 focused solely on treatment, while Agent \#2 identified both treatment and survivorship. Overall, the initial coding yielded a 66.7\% agreement rate.

\textbf{Collaborative discussion.} Following independent coding, the agents discussed their differing annotations. In the example, after three rounds of collaborative discussion, they converged on two narrative events---treatment (chemotherapy, radiation) and survivorship (support from family and friends). Across tasks, such discussions resolved 21.7\% of initial disagreements, underscoring the value of shared interpretation.

\textbf{Dynamic codebook evolution.} After each discussion round, agents reviewed and refined the codebook to enhance clarity. For instance, in the first round they enriched the ‚Äúsurvivorship‚Äù category by adding examples that distinguished post-treatment narratives from ongoing medical interventions. These refinements, which aligned with human expert updates, reduced ambiguity and improved subsequent coding accuracy.

This case study generally demonstrates that our algorithm not only mirrors the iterative and theory-driven process of traditional content analysis but also produces human-approximated performance.


\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \methodName{}, a novel multi-agent framework to simulate the rigorous practice of content analysis in social science via LLMs. Guided by domain knowledge and social science theory, \methodName{} is delicately crafted and augmented with human interventions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \methodName{} enables large-scale and high-quality annotations while producing rational codebooks, offering an innovative potential for future social science research. Future work will explore methods to inject domain knowledge into off-the-shelf LLM frameworks.


\section*{Limitations}
While \methodName{} demonstrates strong potential in automating content analysis, there are several limitations that present opportunities for future research.

\textbf{Algorithmic Bias and Fairness.} Despite incorporating human intervention, which may help to mitigate bias, LLMs remain prone to perpetuating biases present in the training data. This may compromise content analysis outcomes and raise ethical concerns in social science applications. Future work could explore advanced bias mitigation strategies---such as fairness-aware training or the integration of demographic and behavioral data---to potentially enhance model impartiality.

\textbf{Inter-agent Discussion Overhead.} The collaborative discussions among LLM agents, while effective in harmonizing divergent outputs, incur considerable computational overhead. This inefficiency becomes especially problematic when agents fail to reach consensus after the maximum number of discussion rounds. Streamlining the process by reducing the number of agents involved or limiting discussion rounds might alleviate the computational burden with the sacrifice of performance.

\textbf{Human Expertise Bottleneck.} Although diverse human interventions boost overall performance, reliance on human experts, particularly under \textit{extensive} intervention mode, creates a scalability bottleneck. A promising direction is to enable LLM agents to learn from human behavior and logic underlying the interventions, thereby reducing the dependency on expert input over time.


\section*{Ethical Statement}
Our research involves the use of large language models (LLMs) to simulate social scientist role-play. We are acutely aware of the ethical challenges inherent in AI systems, particularly regarding bias, data privacy, and transparency. To address these concerns, we have taken the following actions: (I) \textbf{Bias mitigation.} We acknowledge that LLMs can inadvertently reproduce or amplify biases present in their own training data. To counteract this, we incorporate structured inter-agent discussions and human oversight, ensuring that diverse expert perspectives inform the refinement of our outputs. (II) \textbf{Data privacy.} Demographic information used to create the role-playing personas was derived from real-world data but was fully anonymized. All personally identifiable details---including names, addresses, and workplace information---were removed or replaced to protect individual privacy. (III)\textbf{Transparency and accountability.} Our work adheres to established ethical guidelines, emphasizing the responsible use of AI. We ensure that all datasets are publicly available or de-identified, and we provide comprehensive documentation of our methods to facilitate critical review and replication.

We stress that this system is designed as an assistive tool intended to complement and help, not replace, traditional human-driven analysis. By implementing robust measures to mitigate bias and safeguard privacy, we aim to uphold the highest ethical standards in our research.


\section*{Use of Generative AI}
To enhance clarity and readability, we utilized OpenAI o1 exclusively as a language polishing tool. Its role was confined to proofreading, grammatical correction, and stylistic refinement---functions analogous to those provided by traditional grammar checkers and dictionaries. This tool did not contribute to the generation of new scientific content or ideas, and its usage is consistent with standard practices for manuscript preparation.

\section{Detailed Illustration of Proposed Framework}
\label{app:detailed_framework}

\begin{figure*}[th]
    % \vspace{-8mm}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figure/appendix_main.pdf}
    \vspace{-6mm}
    % \captionsetup{width=0.45\textwidth, margin={3pt,0pt}}
    \caption{Deatiled Illustration of Proposed \methodName{} framework.}
    \label{fig:appendix_main}
    \vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure*}

In the main section, we provide a brief version of the framework aiming to grasp the general pipeline and information flow. Here, we provide detailed examples of the narrative event sequence (NES) task.

\textbf{Coder simulation.} As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}\red{a}, one agent adopts the persona of Emily Carter, a social scientist with 20 years of qualitative research experience. For brevity, we omit detailed descriptions of other agents, such as Michael and Sarah, though they are also included in the setup. In this instance, the codebook comprises specific rules for classifying narrative events, effectively guiding the categorization of text into distinct events (essentially a multi-label classification task).

\textbf{Bot nnotation.} Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}\red{b} illustrates the process: Emily, a social scientist agent, is tasked with a text entry that captures the thoughts of a breast cancer survivor undergoing radiation (shown in \blue{blue}). Guided by the codebook‚Äôs rules (highlighted in \blue{red}), Emily classifies the narrative events as ‚Äú3-Treatment.‚Äù

\textbf{Agent Discussion.} It is clearly shown in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}\red{c} that Michael‚Äîanother experienced social scientist agent‚Äîdisagrees with Emily‚Äôs initial coding result and steadfastly maintains his original assessment (i.e., "Treatment" and "Survivorship") during the first round of discussion (as marked in \purple{purple}), thereby underscoring the diversity of analytical perspectives among our agents.

\textbf{Codebook Evolution.}
As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}\red{d}, Emily enhances the existing rules by incorporating detailed explanations and examples drawn from the discussion and coding sessions (stressed in \orange{orange}).

\textbf{Human Intervention.} An example of a human intervention is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_main}\red{c}, where a human expert supplements the agents' efforts by providing additional facts and detailed explanations that were previously overlooked in the \textit{collaborative} mode, thereby significantly enriching the overall analytic process. This enriched input can substantially influence the resulting codes (as indicated in \blue{blue}).


\section{Experiment \& Implementation Details}
\subsection{Dataset Details}
\label{app:dataset_details}
Here, we provide thorough descriptions of the dataset and tasks used in the experiment.

\textbf{Brand Consumer Dialogue (BCD).} This dataset features popular consumer brand communities on Facebook, containing a random sample of posts from these brands along with associated consumer comments and replies. It supports two classification tasks: identifying post topics (BCD-PT) and classifying different indicators of brand-consumer dialogue (BCD-D).

\textbf{Cancer Narratives (CN).} The dataset examines Facebook posts by major breast cancer non-profit organizations worldwide. The tasks include the identification of one or more cancer narrative event sequences (NES) e.g., prevention, detection, and treatment, and the narrator's perspective (NP).

\textbf{Cancer Emotional Support (CES).} This dataset comprises user comments on Facebook posts from major breast cancer non-profit organizations worldwide, providing a comprehensive basis for detecting and classifying emotional support into three distinct levels (i.e., low, moderate, and high).

\textbf{Flint Water Poisoning Emotion (FWPE).} This dataset includes tweets about Flint water poisoning, a public health crisis that started in 2014 after the drinking water for the city of Flint, Michigan was contaminated with lead. The task is to detect the presence of one or more of the following ten discrete emotions: anger, sadness, fear, worry, happiness, hope, gratitude, sympathy, surprise, and sarcasm.

\textbf{Product Incidents Sentiment (PIS).} This dataset consists of tweets related to various product recalls‚Äîsuch as the Samsung Galaxy explosion and the Volkswagen emissions scandal‚Äîand is designed to capture and detect user sentiment, classifying opinions as positive, neutral, or negative.

\subsection{Metric Settings}
\label{app:metric_settings}
In the main content, we introduce the agreement rate (AR). Formal, given the $B$ texts, we define $B_{\text{before}}$ as the number of texts that agents reach agreements with the same coding result before the discussion. After the discussions, agents reach an agreement on $B_{\text{after}}$ texts. We define the pre-discussion agreement rate as \text{PreAR} = $B_{\text{before}} / B$. Similarly, we define the post-discussion agreement rate as \text{PostAR} = $B_{\text{after}} / B$. The increase in the agreement rate is defined as $\Delta \text{AR} = \text{PostAR} - \text{PreAR}$.


\section{Additional Experimental Results \& Analysis}
\subsection{Additional Automatic Content Analysis Results}
\label{app:additional_automatic_content_analysis_results}
We also conducted experiments using GPT-4O and GPT-4O-mini across seven tasks, recording label accuracy before inter-agent discussions as detailed in Table~\ref{table:appendix_result}. Overall, GPT-4O consistently outperforms GPT-4O-mini on most tasks. For instance, GPT-4O attains an accuracy of 0.41 on the BCD-PT task, 0.79 on CN-NES, and 0.92 on FWPE, thereby underscoring its superior capability in managing complex content analysis challenges and emphasizing its stability in practical applications.

Additionally, both self-consistency and Tree-of-Thought prompt techniques yield significant performance improvements over the Chain-of-Thought approach. For example, in the GPT-4O model, the self-consistency technique achieves peak accuracies in tasks such as CES, with an accuracy of 0.63, and FWPE, with an accuracy of 0.92, while the Tree-of-Thought approach demonstrates notable strength in tasks like BCD-PT, reaching an accuracy of 0.41, and CN-NES, with an accuracy of 0.72. These findings suggest that these techniques more effectively stabilize and refine the coding process than the Chain-of-Thought method, particularly in tasks that demand deeper, nuanced reasoning.

Furthermore, when comparing the coding results after inter-agent discussions (as detailed in Table~\ref{table:main_result}), we observe significant improvements in labeling accuracy across different backbones and datasets. This underscores the pivotal role of inter-agent discussion in facilitating the content analysis process, as it allows agents to collaboratively adjust their coding decisions, leading to more reliable and accurate results.

\input{table/appendix_result}

\subsection{Additional Content Analysis Results w/ Human Intervention}
\label{app:additional_content_analysis_results_w_human_intervention}
We also explored the impact of different levels of human intervention on coding accuracy for content analysis tasks using the CES, CN-NES, CN-NP, and FWPE datasets, revealing notable performance variations. The results obtained prior to inter-agent discussions are reported in Table~\ref{table:appendix_intervention_result}. In comparison, performance generally drops significantly relative to the scenario after inter-agent discussions, as shown in Table~\ref{table:main_intervention_result}, thereby emphasizing the critical role of multi-round discussions in enhancing coding accuracy.

The table shows that a higher degree of human intervention (e.g., \textit{extensive-directive}) consistently improves coding accuracy across all tasks, with the highest performance observed for the FWPE task with an accuracy of 0.93. This pattern underscores the effectiveness of integrating human oversight, especially in complex tasks that require nuanced decision-making. However, without any intervention, the performance tends to degrade, demonstrating the limitations of automated systems when lacking human involvement. These findings indicate that, while multi-agent discussions are essential for improving outcomes, the integration of human intervention at varying levels provides additional value, particularly in tasks where domain expertise and context sensitivity are critical.

\input{table/appendix_intervention_result}

\subsection{Additional Parameter Sensitivity}
\label{app:appendix_prameter_sensitivity}
We also evaluate the parameter sensitivity across three different tasks by varying one parameter (i.e., number of texts, discussion rounds, and number of agents) while keeping the remaining parameters fixed, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix_prameter_sensitivity}. Notably, similar results and trends are observed in Figure~\ref{fig:prameter_sensitivity}.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Additional Discussion Analysis}
\label{app:addtional_discussion_analysis}

We visualize the coding performance of GPT-4O-mini across seven tasks, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:additional_discussion_analysis}. Notably, the post-discussion agreement rate (PostAR) increases to varying extents across datasets. For tasks requiring detailed illustration and explanation (e.g., CN-NES, CN-NP, and FWPE), PostAR shows a significant boost, whereas for more straightforward tasks (e.g., PIS), the improvement is only marginal.
