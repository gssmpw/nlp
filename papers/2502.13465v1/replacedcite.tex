\paragraph{RAG Methods}  
RAG was introduced by ____ to enhance language models' ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks by providing relevant context through retrieval. Research in RAG has focused on two main areas: (1) improving retrieval quality to set an upper bound for generation accuracy ____, and (2) optimizing the use of retrieved passages for relevance and accessibility during generation ____.  

The integration of RAG with LLMs has gained momentum, especially in knowledge-intensive applications ____. As a result, there is increasing demand for more generalized RAG systems capable of handling a wider range of tasks, including those beyond factoid queries ____. However, traditional RAG pipelines face challenges in addressing complex tasks with implicit information needs, often failing to provide sufficient context for accurate generation ____.  
Recent advances have aimed to expand RAGâ€™s applicability. For example, \textit{GraphRAG} ____ and \textit{HippoRAG} ____ introduce knowledge graphs to facilitate retrieval and enhance global awareness. Agent-based approaches, such as \textit{ActiveRAG} ____, plan information access and utilization via agents. 


\paragraph{RAG Benchmarking}  
As RAG systems are increasingly adopted, the need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks has become evident. Early benchmarks, such as KILT ____, primarily focused on task-specific aspects like single-hop and multi-hop reasoning, as well as factoid queries. Recently, new benchmarks have been developed to address specialized tasks and domains. For example, MultiHop-RAG evaluates multi-hop tasks ____, LegalBench-RAG focuses on the legal domain ____, CRAG offers a comprehensive evaluation framework for factoid question answering tasks, and RAGBench is designed to assess the explainability of RAG systems ____. While these benchmarks provide valuable insights into various facets of RAG performance, they lack a comprehensive framework to evaluate the resilience of RAG systems when faced with diverse information-seeking needs, particularly for stratified queries____.
