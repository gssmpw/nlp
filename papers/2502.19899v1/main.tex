\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Motor skill learning often requires experienced professionals who can provide personalized instruction. Unfortunately, the availability of high-quality training can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing. Several recent works have leveraged AI-assistance to improve instruction of tasks ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However, these works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process, and fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different individuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired by the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared autonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid with curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior improves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight which sub-skills might be most ``learnable'' for the student, or within their Zone of Proximal Development. We use this to design \texttt{Z-COACH}, a method for using shared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable task sub-skills. In a user study (n=50), where we teach high performance racing in a simulated environment of the Thunderhill Raceway Park with the CARLA Autonomous Driving simulator, we show that \texttt{Z-COACH} helps identify which skills each student should first practice, leading to an overall improvement in driving time, behavior, and smoothness. Our work shows that increasingly available semi-autonomous capabilities (e.g. in vehicles, robots) can not only assist human users, but also help \textit{teach} them.

\section{Limitations \& Conclusion}
We have shown that \texttt{Z-COACH} effectively applies shared autonomy to both improve student modeling \textit{and} provide skill-targeted coaching, leading to higher overall improvement in performance compared to self-practice. While we focused on high performance racing due to the availability of coaching data and simulation environment, as well as its novelty for participants, an important next step is to evaluate what properties of different motor control tasks may affect the ability of  \texttt{Z-COACH} to improve student learning. Furthermore, there exist many confounders (e.g. frame rate of simulator, lack of haptic feedback) that could affect results. Finally, while we intentionally chose simpler forms of shared autonomy to increase focus on our core task of motor learning, future work could explore more complex forms of shared autonomy, such as incorporating agent confidence. Our work can easily be integrated with other forms of teaching (e.g. with haptics, verbal feedback), where \texttt{Z-COACH} would be used to identify which skills the instruction should target. Overall, \texttt{Z-COACH} is a first step towards re-imagining the role of shared autonomy to not only assist humans in performing tasks, but to enable effective and specialized skill learning.
