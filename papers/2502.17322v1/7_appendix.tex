\section{HumanoidBench}
HumanoidBench \citep{sferrazza2024humanoidbench} is a comprehensive simulated humanoid robot benchmark designed to evaluate and advance research in whole-body locomotion and manipulation tasks. It aims to provide a standardized platform for testing and developing algorithms for humanoid robots, addressing the challenges of complex dynamics, sophisticated coordination, and long-horizon tasks.

\paragraph{A.1 Simulated Humanoid Robot:} HumanoidBench features a humanoid robot equipped with two dexterous hands, specifically the Unitree H1 robot with Shadow Hands. 
The robot is simulated using the MuJoCo physics engine, which provides fast and accurate physics simulation.
The environment supports both position control and torque control, with the action space normalized to $\left[-1,1\right]$ for 61 actuators (19 for the body and 21 for each hand).

\paragraph{A.2 Tasks}
HumanoidBench includes a diverse set of 31 tasks, divided into 14 locomotion tasks and 17 whole-body manipulation tasks. These tasks range from simple locomotion (e.g., walking, running) to complex manipulation (e.g., package unloading, tool usage, furniture assembly). Below is the specific list of tasks:

\textbf{Locomotion tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Walk}: The robot maintains a velocity of approximately 1 m/s, ensuring it does not fall to the ground.
    \item \texttt{Stand}: The robot maintains a standing pose.
    \item \texttt{Run}: The robot maintains a velocity of approximately 5 m/s, ensuring it does not fall to the ground.
    \item \texttt{Reach}: The robot's left hand reaches a randomly initialized 3D point.
    \item \texttt{Hurdle}: The robot maintains a velocity of approximately 5 m/s while clearing hurdles, ensuring it does not fall to the ground.
    \item \texttt{Crawl}: The robot traverses through a tunnel at a velocity of approximately 1 m/s.
    \item \texttt{Maze}: In a maze, the robot reaches its target location by making multiple turns at intersections.
    \item \texttt{Sit}: In $sit\_simple$, the robot sits on a chair located nearby behind it. The $sit\_hard$ task involves a movable chair, where the robot sits on a chair positioned at random directions and locations.
    \item \texttt{Balance}: The robot maintains its balance on an unstable board. In $balance\_simple$, the spherical pivot beneath the board remains stationary, whereas in $balance\_hard$, the pivot is mobile.
    \item \texttt{Stair}: The robot ascends and descends stairs at a velocity of 1 m/s.
    \item \texttt{Slide}: The robot slides upwards and downwards at a velocity of 1 m/s.
    \item \texttt{Pole}: The robot advances through a dense forest composed of high thin poles, without colliding with them.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Whole-Body Manipulation tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Push}: The robot moves a box to a randomly initialized 3D point on a table.
    \item \texttt{Cabinets}: The robot opens four different types of cabinet doors (such as hinged doors, sliding doors, drawers, and pull-up cabinets) and performs various pick-and-place manipulations inside the cabinets.
    \item \texttt{Highbar}: The robot maintains a grip with both hands on the high bar, swinging while maintaining its hold until it reaches a vertical, upside-down position.
    \item \texttt{Door}: The robot turns the doorknob to open the door, and walks through it while keeping the door open.
    \item \texttt{Truck}: The robot unloads packages from a truck onto a platform.
    \item \texttt{Cube}: The robot manipulates a cube with each hand, aligning both cubes with specific, randomly initialized target orientations.
    \item \texttt{Bookshelf}: The robot rearranges five objects on a bookshelf, which is equivalent to five designated sub-tasks, each involving the positioning of a different object to a target location. The sub-tasks must be completed in order. In $bookshelf\_simple$, the order of sub-tasks is always the same, whereas in $bookshelf\_hard$, the order is randomized.
    \item \texttt{Basketball}: The robot catches a ball coming from a random direction and throws it into the basket.
    \item \texttt{Window}: The robot, holding a window cleaning tool, maintains its tip parallel to the window while adhering to a specified vertical velocity.
    \item \texttt{Spoon}: The robot picks up a spoon located next to a pot and uses it to draw circles in the pot.
    \item \texttt{Kitchen}: The robot performs a series of actions in a kitchen environment, including opening the microwave door, moving a kettle, turning a burner, and switching on and off the lights.
    \item \texttt{Package}: The robot moves a box to a randomly initialized target location.
    \item \texttt{Powerlift}: The robot lifts a barbell of a designed mass.
    \item \texttt{Room}: The robot arranges a 5m by 5m room, minimizing the positional variance in the x and y axes by filling it with randomly dispersed objects.
    \item \texttt{Insert}: The robot inserts the ends of a rectangular block into two small pegs. $Insert\_small$ and $insert\_normal$ indicate different object sizes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{A.3 Observation and Action Space} The observation space for the robot state includes joint positions and velocities, totaling 151 dimensions (49 for the body and 51 for each hand). Additionally, the environment provides task-specific observations, such as object positions and velocities, to facilitate interaction with the environment.
The action space is normalized to $[-1,1]$ for 61 actuators, which includes 19 actuators for the humanoid body and 21 actuators for each hand. The action space is designed to be consistent across all tasks to minimize domain-specific tuning.

\section{Experimental Details}
We implemented our TDMPBC algorithm on the source code of TD-MPC2 in HumanoidBench \url{https://github.com/carlosferrazza/humanoid-bench}. 
The parameters used were the default parameters of HumanoidBench when running TD-MPC2. 
For the additional hyperparameter $\beta$ that we introduced, it was set to $\beta=1$ in all experiments.
