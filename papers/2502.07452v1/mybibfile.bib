--{\textgreater} A semantics is a function that takes as input a weighted bipolar graph and returns a weighting on arguments.
1- Anonymity (names do not matter)
2- Bi-variate Independence (does not matter if not linked)
3- Bi-variate directionality (Only depend on its incoming arrows)
4- Bi-variate equivalence (If there is a bijection between the attackers and the supporters, then they have the same final weight.
5- Stability (If an argument has no attackers and supporters, its intrinsic value does not change)
6- Neutrality (Arguments with an intrinsic value of 0 do not count)
7- Bi-variate Monotony (If a has less attackers than b and a has more supporters than b, then a has a better weight than b).
8- Bi-variate reinforcement
9- Resilience (If the intrinsic strength of an argument is between 0 and 1, it cannot go up to 1 or be reduced to 0)
10- Franklin (Attacks and supports of equal strengths eliminate each others)
11- Weakening (If more attackers and they are stronger then its strength is going down)
12- Strengthening (If more supporters and they are stronger then its strength is going up)
---{\textgreater} The 12 axioms are compatible
They study QuAD (first gradual semantics for weighted bipolar AFs) and they show that it violate some of the axioms and it has an irrational behavior.
They then study DF-QuAD --{\textgreater} Still violates some postulate but do not have the previous irrational behavior but suffer from the "big jump" problem.
~
---{\textgreater} They introduce a new semantics that can only be used for acyclic (no cycles composed of attacks and supports) non-maximal (there is no argument with a strength of 1) BAG.
Their Euler-based restricted semantics satisfy the 12 axioms and do not have the "big jump" problem nor the irrational behavior.

To do that they have two approaches:
-1) Reduce the number of extensions (filtration)
-2) A new inference policy (between sceptical and credulous)
~
In 1), they consider two ways of comparing extensions.
The first one is to make a pairwise comparison. They provide different tools:
- Counting the number of non attacked arguments by the other ext
- Counting the number of strongly defended arguments from the other ext
...
Once they have this pairwise comparison they use the copeland-base principle to reduce Dung's extensions.
The second one is to make a global evaluation of the extensions. they give scores to arguments (ex: Number of extensions an argument belongs to) and then they use aggregations functions such as Leximax/ Leximin / etc.. to sort the extensions
~
In 3) they define the support-based acceptance policy which is between credulous and skeptical acceptance. This new set of accepted argument is conflict-free.},

~
The language used is Existential rules with the DL vocabulary..
They recall the usual semantics: AR, CAR,IAR, ICAR, ICR.
They give 3 natural modfiers (functions that takes as input a set of set of facts):
~~~ - Expansion modifiers: Return the set of closure of each set of facts
~~~ - Splitting modifier: Return the set of repairs of the set of facts
~~~ - Selection modifier: select some some sets of facts that have a better cardinality
~
The natural modifiers can be combined into "composite modifier"
They show that there are 8 possible combination.
They introduce inference strategies:
~~~ - universal consequence
~~~ - sage consequence
~~~ - majority-base consequence
~~~ - existential consequence
~
They can combine a composite modifier with an inference strategy to get semantics ! They show that for instance
AR = composite1 + universal consequence etc...
They compare the different semantics (for each inference strategy) with respect to productivity !

CNO: We only consider the maximal (for cardinality) repairs and do the NO on them.

Complexity results:
The data complexity of the query evaluation problem of non-objection semantics is polynomial

- Expansions (we can add new args and new attacks): normal (we cannot add attacks between old args), strong and local

It was shown that you can decide equivalence via kernels, if two AFs A and B have the same kernel, then they are equivalent.

It is based on a dialog between an Explainee and an Explainer.

1. Subjective logic
For each proposition {\textbackslash}phi, we denote by w{\textasciicircum}A\_{\textbackslash}phi = (b,d,u,a), the binomial opinion of agent A about the truth of {\textbackslash}phi.
They define:
- the cumulative fusion of the opinion of two agents about a proposition {\textbackslash}phi.
- The conjunction of opinions of two opinions about different proposition for the same agent.
2. They use an argumentation framework defined by Amgoud\&Vesic in Rich preference-based argumentation framework.
Basically, they keep the attacks where an argument attacks a less preferred argument and reverse the attacks where an argument attacks a more preferred argument.
The arguments are tuples (H,h) with minimality. They have undercut attack and rebuttal !
They define the level of an argument based on the conjunction of the proposition in the hypothesis of that argument (this gives the preference relation).
For the acceptability of arguments, they use the skeptically accepted arguments of stable extensions.
The also provide a benchmark and they show that their operator performs at least as well in all scenarios, and significantly better in some.},

They define:
- Supporting argument (like aspic), arguments which conclusions are used by other arguments. (A2 supports A1)
- Active Arguments, arguments that premises are proved or supported by other active arguments
- They give a tree representation called Argumental Structure. (E1, E2, E3)
- Well-formed argumental Structure: good properties like consistency etc..
- They define a attack relation between argumental Structure (rebut)
- They have a preference relation between argumental Structure
- They have a defeat relation between argumental Structure
- They highlight the changes that can occur: Evidence Update/Erasure, Argument Expansion/Contraction, Conflict Expansion/Contraction

Rule-based argumentation systems are developed for reasoning about defeasible information. They take as input a theory made of a set of facts, a set of strict rules, which encode strict information, and a set of defeasible rules which describe general behavior with exceptional cases. They build arguments by chaining such rules, define attacks between them, use a semantics for evaluating the arguments, and finally identify the plausible conclusions that follow from the theory.

Undercutting is one of the main attack relations of such systems. It consists of blocking the application of defeasible rules when their exceptional cases hold. In this paper, we consider this relation for capturing all the different conflicts in a theory. We present the first argumentation system that uses only undercutting, and show that it satisfies the rationality postulates proposed in the literature. Finally, we fully characterize both its extensions and its plausible conclusions under various acceptability semantics. Indeed, we show full correspondences between extensions and sub-theories of the theory under which the argumentation system is built.},

Bipolarity at the argument level
Arguments are constructed for or against a conclusion.
The paper gives several examples of argumentation frameworks: explanatory argument {\textasciitilde} deductive argument / argumentation based decision (an argument A is {\textless}Support, Consequence, decision {\textgreater})
A bipolar AF.
They introduce an abstract bipolar argumentation framework {\textless}A, R\_def, R\_sup{\textgreater}
R\_def and R\_sup are sets of defeat and support relation.
--{\textgreater} Definition Direct defeater / Indirect defeater / Direct defender / Indirect defender / Direct Supporter / Indirect Supporter.
Valuation in bipolar AF
local valuation: the value of an argument is the aggregation of the direct defeaters / defender / supporters
global valuation: the value of argument is the aggregation of all the branches.
Bipolarity in the selection of acceptable arguments
Two kinds of bipolarity can be distinguished:
- The first one computes the acceptable arguments and induce the rejected/undecided arguments
- The second compute separately the class of acceptable/rejected and deduce the undecided arguments.
To illustrate the second method, they show the example of the intentions of an agent from its contradictory desires.

There are two types of controversy: Argumentative/voting.An argumentation framework is (Arg, Att).
From each argument a, we have the set of topics of this argument Top(a) and T denotes the set of all possible topics.
The set of topics of an attack (a,b) is Top(a) {\textbackslash}cup Top(b).
We can differentiate for an attack:
- Prominent topics (topics in the intersection of the two arguments)
- Relevant topics (in only one argument)
- Irrelevant topics (not in either argument)
~
For an agent i, we give a set of expertise exp(i) that is included in T.
A vote on an attack (a,b) is {\textless}(a,b), s, i{\textgreater}, where s in -1 or +1.
Of course, experts that vote on a attack that are in their expertise should count more. In this paper, they suppose independence of expertise, allow compensation among topics and disregard votes on irrelevant topics.
The impact of i on (a,b) is imp\_i(a,b) = 2* {\textbar}exp(i) {\textbackslash}cap prom(a,b){\textbar} + {\textbar}exp(i) {\textbackslash}cap rel(a,b){\textbar}.
The evaluation vector of an attack (a,b) is v(a,b) = {\textless}w(a,b), mw(a,b){\textgreater}.~This vector is initialize at {\textless}0,0{\textgreater} and updated after each vote using the impact described before.
A weighted argumentation system (WAS) is a triple (Arg, Att, v), where v is a function from Att -{\textgreater} (Z,N). It returns the evaluation vector of an attack. If for an attack (a,b), we have that w(a,b) {\textless} 0, then the attack does not hold.
A move of an agent is a set of vote on multiple (different) attacks.
The non weighted counterpart argumentation system is an AF (Arg,Att) where we remove attacks where w(a,b){\textless}0.
They use labels instead of extensions.
~
PHASE 1: Experts give their opinions -{\textgreater} WAS.
PHASE 2: Evaluation of the WAS.
They defined beyond any doubt attack/Strong attacks/weak attacks -{\textgreater} Stability of attacks.
They defined set of persistent/non-persistent arguments -{\textgreater} persistence of arguments.
PHASE 3: Asking the opinion of an expert i.
For an expert i, we ask her to make a move on strong and weak attacks. We will obtain a WAS~amongst the set of all possible WAS.
PHASE 4: Choose an expert.
In order to choose the expert, they compare the set of possible WAS attainable for this agent and use notion like Pareto (necessarily dominates/ possibly dominates, optimistically dominates/ pessimistically dominates).

In the previous work of Caminada, she defined restrictions on labeling called "complete labeling" so that the labeling corresponds to the complete extensions. She also used notions of set-inclusions to make labelings correspond to other admissibility semantics (preferred, etc.)

Here they introduce the "Complete fuzzy labeling":
- lab(a) = 1 - max\_\{b -{\textgreater} a \} lab(b)
- lab(a) = 1 if a not attacked.
~
And the "alpha-conversion" which gives out/undec/in depending on the value a the label. (if {\textbackslash}alpha is in [0,0.5[ )
lab(a) in [0, {\textbackslash}alpha] --{\textgreater} out
lab(a) in [{\textbackslash}alpha, 1 - {\textbackslash}alpha[ --{\textgreater} undec
lab(a) in [1 - {\textbackslash}alpha,1] --{\textgreater} in
~
They show that the alpha-conversion of a complete fuzzy labeling is a complete labeling and that:
- lab(a) = 1 for all argument in grounded ext. and lab(a)=0 for all arguments attacked by grounded ext. (obvious)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The second part of this paper is about unsupervised learning of fuzzy labels.
They show that~ given a initial label of arguments and the update step of the form:
lab(a){\textasciicircum}(k+1) = (1 - {\textbackslash}alpha)*lab(a){\textasciicircum}k + {\textbackslash}alpha(1 - max\_\{b-{\textgreater}a\}lab(b){\textasciicircum}k)
The labels "tend" (not proved) to converge.
Other results: The number of needed steps does not seems to depend on size of AF or the initialisation. It seems that the attack is the important factor.

There is a last dealing with fuzzy labels as certitude factors and the definition of a complete certitude labeling.

In the first part, he have properties like: ~
- If A attack B but B is included in C then (A attack C) or (C attack A).
Note that if often propagate the defeat relation upward. It means that for the previous property, there is something like:
- If A' is included in A and B' is included in B and A' attacks B' then (A attack B) or (B att A).
He also defines the notion of closure:~A set of arguments S is closed if he contains all its subarguments.
He showed that complete, preferred, stable and ground extensions are closed in this AF.

An emotional argumentation framework (EAF) is composed of
- an abstract AF
- a set of Emotional factors: fear(fire), friendliness(kelly)
- an activation stimuli function (gives the number after which an argument is activated)
- an Emotional stimuli function ES : effect that each internal factor has over the stimuli
- Emotional side Effect function: how the new activated arguments affect the emotional context.
- etc...
~
How it works:
There is a current emotional context and a argumentation framework.
Depending of the emotional context, some arguments are activated and some are not.
Then, an argument is selected from the set of contextually preferred arguments.
This argument is activated and the emotional side effect of this argument are triggered which induces a new emotional context.

- He makes links between extensions and labellings.

Other useful tips:
- stable is semi-stable which is preferred
- there is always a preferred extension (finite or not)
- a semi-stable extensions is an admissible extension that maximise the union of arguments of the set and the arguments it attacks.

In this paper, they explore the structural property of such graphs.
They define different notions ( empty graph, weakly connected, component, self-loop graph, rooted graph, tree, complete bipartite, rational graph)
They define the notion of logical argument system (KB, arg, att, Con) where KB is the knowledge base, Arg the set of arguments, Att the set of attacks and Con a constructor function that takes in input a KB and an argument "a" and return a graph s.t. a belongs to it.
There are two types of constructor: "trivial" if it constructs all the graph are "simple constructor" if it only constructs a component.
Con can be a recursive constructor, a rebuttal constructor.
They give example of logical argument systems (defeasible arguments, ...)
They give the notion of:
- a logical argument system constructively covers a graph type (for all graph G of that type, there is a KB and a in A s.t. Con(KB,a) = G)
- constructively covered (if for all KB, and for all a in A, Con(KB,a) = G and G is of that type)
- constructively complete (It means that the two previous notions are true)
~
Finally, there is the notion of "local" (meaning that it constructs a component by adding nodes and arcs incrementally starting from a single argument ) and "global" constructors.

Secondly, it introduces "Formal concepts".
- A formal context = (Object, Property, R) where R is a binary relation: Object x Property
It then gives the "Galois derivation" operator:
- G(X) = the set of property that is satisfied by all elements of X.~Similarly, the set of object that satisfy all property of Y is denoted G(Y)
- A formal concept is a pair (X,Y) such that G(X) = Y and G(Y) = X.
-Several other operator are given: meet, join, possibility, necessity, the dual of the "Galois derivation"..
~
Finally, It was shown that if we consider the relation "Does not attack" and Object = Property = Arguments, then several equivalence between argumentation and formal concepts can be drawn.
Finally, a structure of opposition using notions of abstract argumentation is given.

Selecting one extension over others using weight on attacks.



Why the state of art was not enough?The state of the art used the weight on attacks for relaxing extensions (when there is too few)This is done by accepting some inconsistencies when doing the extensions (with a budget)They give us different provenance for weight (explicit/ implicit and vote)We use them to select the best extensions (when there are too many). This is a big problem for skeptical inference.
What was the idea of the new results ?They use a "aggregation function" to aggregate the weights on attacks (sum / max / etc.)Then, there are two options:- Evaluate each extension and choose the best	They defined two notions: 		- most attacking extension		- least attacked extension	And they added the notion of "best defended extension"		- globally BDE that combines the previous 2 notions.		- locally BDE that is equal to the defence score of the least defended argument of E.- Compare extensions between them (Adversarial Extension Selection)	They defined how to compare extensions (E1 {\textgreater} E2 iff the attacks from E1 to E2 {\textgreater} E2 to E1)		From this, they defined 4 methods to select the best extension.How they validated their contribution?They provided an example. But, they do not explicitly tell which one is clearly better.},

Using Argumentation in Social Network. That is to say, having a abstract argumentation framework with positive and negatives votes on arguments.~ 



Why the state of art was not enough?The goals were to have:- Always a valuation of all arguments (in all cases).- Only one model for every possible debate.- A more flexible graduation than "accepted/rejected".- The semantic had to be smooth (not completely change if there is one more pos/neg vote)Several other works on semantics using weights:-Prakken and Sartor (1997): partial order on arguments to resolve conflicts but remain "accepted/rejected"-Bench-Capon (2003): Value-based abstract argumentation but also "accepted/rejected".-Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex (2005): Does not take into account the strength assigned to the arguments (ex: votes)- Matt and Tony (2008): Use game-theoretic notions.- Dunne et al. (2011): Weights on attacks.
What was the idea of the new results ?They defined a new semantic that can have several social models (valuation/mapping) that satisfies it.They defined (simple vote aggregation) and (Simple product semantics) and showed the following properties:- Simple product semantics -{\textgreater} well behaved- well behaved -{\textgreater} If a not attacked -{\textgreater} M(a) = aggregation of votes of a.- well behave -{\textgreater} at least one S-model- In certain cases, there is only one model.},

They define they graded defense and the neutrality functions as:

- neutrality function of X wrt to n: the set of arguments which have at most m-1 attackers in X

They get a partial order on graded defense function and some function may be incomparable !

Then, they generalise their approach to Dung's semantics.
They define: m-conflict-free, mn-admissible, mn-complete extension, etc..

What is the paper about ? - 5 lines 
This paper introduces the notion of preferences and how they can filter repairs into a set of preferred repairs. It develops three kind of preferred repairs (Globally optimal repairs, Pareto optimal repairs and Completion optimal re- pairs), study their mutual relationships, desirable properties and investigate their complexities in two problems (Repair checking and preferred consistent query). 
What is new in the paper w.r.t. state of the art ? - 5 lines 
Although repairs and consistent query answers in inconsistent database al- ready existed and were used in several works. This paper explores the conse- quences of adding preferences (in the form of acyclic priorities) in the case of denial constraints. The three families of preferred repairs introduced (GRep, PRep and C) each satisfy desirable propoerties (P1 - P4). 
Detail the contributions (application and theory) ? - 1 page 2 
The contributions of this paper are : 


{\textemdash} ~A formal framework of families of preferred repairs (GRep, PRep and C) and preferred consistent query answers for relational databases. 


{\textemdash} ~A list of desirable properties of families of preferred repairs. (P1 : non- emptiness, P2 : Monotonicity, P3 : Non-discrimination, P4 : Categoricity, P5 : Conservativeness). They showed that GRep, PRep and CRep satisfy P1 - P4. 
1 










{\textemdash} ~Three different families of preferred repairs based on different notions of optimal compliance with the user preference. An instance I' ? I is a globally optimal repair if X ? I', Y ? I/I' such that : 
?x ? X,?y ? Y,y {\textgreater} x. An instance I' ? I is a Pareto optimal repair if X ? I',Y ? I/I' such 
that : 
?x ? X,?y ? Y,y {\textgreater} x. 
Let an instance I, a set of denial constraints F and a priority {\textgreater}. An instance I' ? I is completion optimal if there exists {\textgreater}1 a total priority such that {\textgreater}?{\textgreater}1 and I' is globally optimal w.r.t {\textgreater}1 and F. 


{\textemdash} ~Repairing algorithm for every family of preferred repairs. The algorithms are both sound and complete. 


{\textemdash} ~Algorithm 1 gives a random repair of I w.r.t F 


{\textemdash} ~Algorithm 2 gives a globally optimal repair of I w.r.t F 


{\textemdash} ~Algorithm 3 gives a Pareto optimal repair of I w.r.t F (check if it{\textquoteright}s a Pareto optimal repair or gives a completion optimal repair). 


{\textemdash} ~Algorithm 4 gives a completion optimal repair of I w.r.t F 




{\textemdash} ~A thorough analysis of computational implications of preferences in the 
context of repairing and consistent query answers. 


{\textemdash} ~Globally preferred repair checking is in coNP and consistent query 
answering is $\Pi$p2 (upper bounds are tight). 


{\textemdash} ~Pareto preferred repair checking is in LOGSPACE and consistent 
query answering is coNP-complete. 


{\textemdash} ~Completion preferred repair checking is in PTIME and consistent query answering is coNP-complete.

In the present paper, the authors study a broader class, including contraction functions that may be less than maximal. Specifically, they investigate "partial meet contraction functions", which are defined to yield the intersection of some nonempty family of maximal subsets of the theory that fail to imply the proposition being eliminated. Basic properties of these functions are established: it is shown in particular that they satisfy the Gardenfors postulates, and moreover that they are sufficiently general to provide a representation theorem for those postulates. Some special classes of partial meet contraction functions, notably those that are "relational" and "transitively relational", are studied in detail, and their connections with certain "supplementary postulates" of Gardenfors investigated, with a further representation theorem established.]},

	abstract = {Arguments play two different roles in day life decisions, as well as in the discussion of more crucial issues. Namely, they help to select one or several alternatives, or to explain and justify an already adopted choice. This paper proposes the first general and abstract argument-based framework for decision making. This framework follows two main steps. At the first step, arguments for beliefs and arguments for options are built and evaluated using classical acceptability semantics. At the second step, pairs of options are compared using decision principles. Decision principles are based on the accepted arguments supporting the options. Three classes of decision principles are distinguished: unipolar, bipolar or non-polar principles depending on whether i) only arguments pros or only arguments cons, or ii) both types, or iii) an aggregation of them into a meta-argument are used. The abstract model is then instantiated by expressing formally the mental states (beliefs and preferences) of a decision maker. In the proposed framework, information is given in the form of a stratified set of beliefs. The bipolar nature of preferences is emphasized by making an explicit distinction between prioritized goals to be pursued, and prioritized rejections that are stumbling blocks to be avoided. A typology that identifies four types of argument is proposed. Indeed, each decision is supported by arguments emphasizing its positive consequences in terms of goals certainly satisfied and rejections certainly avoided. A decision can also be attacked by arguments emphasizing its negative consequences in terms of certainly missed goals, or rejections certainly led to by that decision. Finally, this paper articulates the optimistic and pessimistic decision criteria defined in qualitative decision making under uncertainty, in terms of an argumentation process. Similarly, different decision principles identified in multiple criteria decision making are restated in our argumentation-based framework.},

- Impact, this gives us how much each previous rating from the user impacted the recommendation from the system. This answers the question "What are the most important factors yielding this recommendation?"

Building on that work, we provide a more complete characterization of these frameworks, which includes the treatment of various semantics not considered in the original publication, a more fine-grained representation of all acceptability semantics using labellings, and two functions allowing the transition between extensions and labellings along with their properties. Moreover, we show that a variety of well-known results that apply to AAF can be migrated to the SETAF setting. To further associate the two frameworks, we provide a natural way to represent a SETAF as a Dung-style AAF, and show how the generated AAF behaves.},

- Match the trust repair strategy to the violation type~
- The context of a trust violation is important.

Their method is based on four metrics:
- Trustworthiness (the belief that the future actions of a person will lead to a good outcome)
- The expertise (knowledge of the topic, affinity between experts, etc..)
- Uncertainty (risk of transaction and can be based on historical interactions)
- Cost (how much it cost to invite this person as a recommender)
Using this four metrics, they formalized an utility function that they need to maximize.~
In this paper, they mainly focus on the 1-HOP recommender selection, i.e. the source can reach the target via one's direct neighbors.
They also introduce the concept of Quality of Recommenders (QoR) as a threshold for recommenders. The neighbors that do not satisfy this QoR are 'inactive' and 'active' otherwise.
They propose several meaningful methods for selecting a recommender set. One of them is the basicRATE which consists in keeping the best m qualified recommenders.
Once the best set of recommenders have been selected, they usually use aggregation functions (max or weighted average) in order to give a trust value to the target. They also propose the FluidTrust method consists in considering all agents as containers that are connected with pipes with specific lengths and widths. The source can then allow in or drop some fluids accordingly.
The extensions of this work are muti-hop and multi-target.
They designed an experiment where they used data from two datasets (Epinions and Advogato) and they compared 4 methods for choosing the set of recommenders:
1- Take all the qualified recommenders
2- Select a fixed number of qualified neighbors
3- Select a fixed proportion of qualified neighbors
4- Flexibly selecting some top m qualified neighbors
The results are:
- Sorting using QoR improves the accuracy
- The accuracy decreases when Max Length is increased
- Increasing the trust threshold decreases the accuracy.
- Using FluidTrust, the framework of RATE is able to outperform the other frameworks (SWTrust, MoleTrust and TidalTrust)

	abstract = {Food packaging plays a crucial part in the post-harvest environmental impact of fresh foods. Packaging is usually wrongly considered as additional economical and environmental costs. However, by minimizing food waste and losses, it could significantly contribute to decrease the overall environmental impact of the food itself. A good balance between environmental burden (resource consumption and additional waste management issues) and real benefit in usage condition (reduction of food losses) should be thus defined when dimensioning a packaging for a given application. Beyond food waste and environmental impact reduction, various kinds of considerations about packaging, sometimes conflicting, are generally expressed by the stakeholders (food and packaging industries, health authorities, consumers, waste management authority, etc.) related to safety, practicality, perceptions of the packaging material, etc. Therefore, to help the parties deciphering all these arguments, we designed an argumentation-based tool to take into account the conflicting preferences expressed. The requirements concerning packagings are modeled by several arguments provided by the stakeholders expressing their viewpoints and expertise. Based on a new attack relation, the argumentation tool computes sets of compatible arguments which are used to rank alternative packagings under debate. In this paper, we present a complete workflow implemented as a software prototype starting by defining a structured representation of experts arguments and poll results, and ending by a ranking of packaging solutions. We show and discuss the results obtained by the software on a use case study (fresh strawberries) to determine the justifiable choices between several packaging materials based on stakeholders' arguments.},

1- Improving ranking-based semantics using extensions-based semantics
2- Refining ranking-based semantics using justification status
3- Refining Propagation semantics using acceptance and justification status
4- Improving Extension-based using ranking-based semantics
5- Removing Attacks
~
~
1- In this part, they define how a ranking can be improved by another ranking using the lexicographical orer.
Then, they introduce the ranking corresponding to an argumentation semantics (sceptical {\textgreater} credulous {\textgreater} rejected)
And they show that we can use a ranking-based semantics to improve the previous ranking from argumentation semantics and that the new ranking possesses the good postulates of the ranking semantics
~
2- They introduce the justification status of an argument w.r.t. an argumentation semantics. Starting from an argumentation graph, one can compute the reinstatement labelling and then filter them to obtain the different labelling corresponding to the different argumentation semantics (stable, preferred, etc.). Then, using the set of labelling for an argumentation semantics, one can compute the justification of an argument (a set of label) corresponding to the possible labels that an argument can have (ex: \{in, out\})
Here, they extract a ranking on arguments from the justification status of the arguments (\{in\} {\textgreater} \{in, undec\}) and show that it can be refined using a ranking semantics just like in step 1.
~
3- In this part, they introduce the propagation semantics (it gives a score to each argument at each step depending on the length of the paths and the initial value).
They extract a ranking from the score columns (like BBS). As the ranking changes because of the initial value, they propose a function to give 4 different initial values to arguments:
~~~ - a : the arguments not attacked
~~~ - b : the arguments sceptical but attacked
~~~ - c : the arguments credulous but not sceptical
~~~ - d: the not credulous arguments
They show that this ranking satisfies lot of properties.
4- They want to select the best extensions using two methods. First, they use the ranking returned by the ranking semantics and use an aggregation function (like leximax, min) to return a ranking on extensions.
Second, they propose to use a pairwise comparison between extensions by counting the number of arguments that are strictly better. They then select the extension that beats the most other extensions.
5- In this section, they remark that when one removes the attacks from a weak argument to a strong argument, the resulting extensions are not necessarily conflict-free w.r.t. the original AF.
They propose to introduce a function CF that can return the conflict-free sets of a set of argument.
Using this, they refine the extensions of the AF with less attacks so that they are conflict-free with the original AF.

Unfortunately, this framework does not allow for joint attacks on arguments, which we argue must be required of any truly abstract argumentation framework. A few frameworks can be said to allow for such interactions among arguments, but for various reasons we believe that these are inadequate for modelling argumentation systems with joint attacks. In this paper we propose a generalization of the framework of Dung, which allows for sets of arguments to attack other arguments. We extend the semantics associated with the original framework to this generalization, and prove that all results in the paper by Dung have an equivalent in this more abstract framework.},

In this argumentation framework, they want to control the uncertain part of the argumentation framework such that the target (skeptical or credulous acceptance of a set of arguments is reached).

Formally, the framework is composed of:
- A fixed part (fixed arguments + fixed attacks on fixed and uncertain args)
- A uncertain part( uncertain arguments + uncertain attacks on fixed and uncertain args) --{\textgreater} Two types of uncertain attacks
- A control part (control args + control attacks on control/uncertain/fixed arguments).

A completion of CAF is an argumentation framework that contains:
- The fixed part, a subset of the uncertain arguments, the control arguments
- The attacks where we do not know the directionality are fixed, etc..

The goal is to find a subset of the control arguments and the corresponding attacks such that the completion of a given target (subset of the fixed arguments) is always reached.

- complete graphs.

They show in an experiment that:
- The number of informed nodes in the preferential attachment graph and the Orkut network are similar and much faster than random attachment/complete graphs

- The Twitter graph is not captured by the theoretical model

In the Mathematical Analysis:
- They show that in the preferential attachment graph on n nodes, there is a constant K such that the rumor spreading process spreads from a starting node to all nodes in K * log(n)/ log(log(n)) steps ~~~~ {\textless}- sublogarithmic time

The idea is that in complete graphs (or random attachment graphs), the degree are so large that the expected number of steps needed to propagate a rumor from two neighbors is almost 1/2 n{\textasciicircum}(1/3).

Then, a ranking semantics is applied which assigns an acceptability degree to each atom that is lower to the original internal strength. This results into a "global loss" undergone by each argument.
This paper focus on the contributions of each attack into the loss of the attacked argument.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ranking semantics must satisfy:
- Syntax Independence: Independent of the argument's identity
- Monotonicity: Attacks cannot be beneficial for arguments
~
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the existing Dung's semantics, they devise ranking semantics such that the score of an argument is:
-~ 1 if the argument is in (in all extensions)
- 0.5 if the argument is undecided (in an extension but not in all)
- 0.3 if the argument is rejected (in no extensions)
- 0 if the argument is rejected and is attacked by an in or undecided argument.
~
-{\textgreater} st, gr, co, pr, h satisfy the Styntax Independence and Monotonicity
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contribution measures are functions that give a contribution to each attackers to the loss of an argument (sum of all contribution = loss).
They give several axioms:
- Anonymity: Must not change depending on the outcome of a contribution measure
- Dummy: What is a dummy attack (contribution = 0)
- Symmetry: Symmetric attacks (have the same contribution) should be defined by comparing marginal contribution in all possible graphs where subsets of the target's attacks are removed.
- Dominance: The greater the marginal contribution of an attack, the greater its contribution (sort of pareto)
- Coherence: The contribution measure should be defined only on the loss measure.
Coherence -{\textgreater} Dummy
Coherence + Symmetry -{\textgreater} Anonymity + Dominance

The Shapley measure is the only contribution measure that satisfies Symmetry + Coherence.

Their model consists of a graph (directed or not) with weighted edges. Each node possesses an internal opinion (si) and an overall opinion (zi).
At each step, the opinion (zi) is updated by averaging the opinion of its neighbors.
This is the same as choosing zi to minimize a cost function.
It has been shown that this converge to the unique Nash equilibrium.
The problem is that this equilibrium does not correspond to the social optimum that minimizes the social cost:
~

~
They focus on the price of anarchy which is the ratio between the social cost of the Nash equilibrium and the social optimum.
Results:
- In undirected graphs, the price of anarchy is at most 9/8
- We can scale the weights of any graph to make its price of anarchy be 9/8
- In directed graphs, the price of anarchy can be unbounded in the general case.
- In Eulerian graphs, they have several results for the boundary of the PoA.
- Adding a edge to a graph G can improve the cost of the Nash equilibrium by a multiplicative factor of at most the PoA of G. However, finding the best set of edges to add from and to a specific node is NP-hard
- The optimal weight to add to an edge can be computed in polynomial time.

They also address the problem (Rounds of calls) where each round is composed of simultaneous calls and they want to spread the secret in the least number of rounds. They showed that the minimum number of rounds is log2(n) when n is even and log2(n)+1 when n is odd.
~
In the previous examples, it was supposed that there was a scheduler that coordinated the actions of the agents. In Knowledge-Based Gossip Protocols, these scheduling decisions can be made by the agents themselves.
The Lean New Secrets protocol: Choose an agent x who does not know all secrets and let x choose an agent y whose secret it does not know and let x call y.
Note that with this protocal, the number of calls can vary between 2n-4 and n(n-1)/2. Furthermore, we know for sure that an agent will never contact the same agent again.
~
Expected Information Growth: Choose an agent x, let x choose y such that x considers it possible that there is a secret that would be learnt in the call xy, and let x call y
~
Known Information Growth: Choose an agent x, let x choose y such that x knows that there is a secret that would be learnt in the call xy, and let x call y
~
The Expected Information Growth protocol can loop. A variation of the Known information Growth protocol exists, called "de re", where it is possible for an agent to call the same agent again.
~
They also talk about "Common knowledge". How many calls are needed to achieve general knowledge of general knowledge of the secrets (everyone knows that everyone knows all the secrets) ? It is clear that at least 3n-5 calls are needed.
~
Agents uncertainty about their secrets can be represented in a multi-agent Kripke model (nodes are like 011 meaning that 'A is false, B is true and C is true'). A phone call remove edges in the model.
~

~
Then they define the Outline of Gossip Logic and rewrite the Knowledge-based Protocols above in this language.

A model is presented which describes how the group might reach agreement on a common subjective probability distribution for the parameter by pooling their individual opinions. The process leading to the consensus is explicitly described and the common distribution that is reached is explicitly determined. The model can also be applied to problems of reaching a consensus when the opinion of each member of the group is represented simply as a point estimate of the parameter rather than as a probability distribution.},

Each agent i has a probability distribution Fi on M.
They propose a model that will generate coefficient p1, p2, ..., pk such that the sum of piFi will denote the opinion pool of the agents.
~
First step:
Each agent i is asked to assign a weight Pij to the distribution of the other individuals j.
Then, these weights Pij are regrouped into a matrix P.
Then, the probability distribution of each agent is changed to PF, where F is the column vector (F1, F2... FK)
~
Iteration:
This method is repeated until a consensus is found. That is to say, until P{\textasciicircum}(n-1)F = P(n)F.
~
- They give conditions for the convergence (ex: at least one column in P{\textasciicircum}n is positive)
- They show how to compute the consensus. We need to find a vector L = (L1, L2,Lk) such that LP = L. The result is then L1F1 + .... + LkFk.

When voting, there is not always a condorcet winner (an alternative that is preferred, pairwise, to all other alternatives by a majority).
A sufficient condition for having a condorcet winner is the single peakedness.
However, we cannot force the agents to have single peaked preferences ! (universality property)
~
Thus, they propose to use an argumentative deliberation for two steps:
- 1) Choosing the criterion that are relevant
- 2) The agents tell which criterion is satisfied or not for each alternative
- 3) The new and old preferences on alternatives is computed and the proximity to single peakedness is computed.

They work in the setting of TGDs (also called existential rules) and CDDs (contradiction-detecting dependencies) which are subsets of denial constraints (DCs). Note that CDDs are what we call "negative constraints".
This is a good paper for the state of the art of repairing KBs and user-guided data cleaning tools.
In order to define their updates, they give the following definitions:
- i-th position in a atom
- value at i-th position of an atom
- A fix is a position in an atom and the constant/existential variable that replaces the existing term.
- Application of a set of fixes on a set of facts.
- A valid set of fixes: cannot have two fixes that change the set term in a atom.
- diff function w.rt. a bijection: the set of fixes that are needed to go from a set of facts to another.
- consistent fixes: set of fixes that will get the KB consistent.
- repair fixes the minimal consistent fix
- pi-repairability: is it possible to find a repair fix considering a set of immutable positions pi
- question: set of fixes
- answer to a question: a fix in the question
- sound question: for every fix in the question, applying the fix will not make it not repairable.
- Inquiry: sequence of questions and answers.
~
Their framework is as follow:
1) The set of all conflicts is computed and pick one.
2) For the selected conflict, you generate a sound question
3) You ask the user and to pick one fix and you apply it
4) Recompute all the conflicts and go to step 1 (until there is a conflict)

They also give different questioning strategies for reducing the number of questions asked.

They also made an experiment that check the number of questions for each strategy.

In this setting, they have 2 integrity constraints classes:
- Denial integrity constraints (these constraints states how values should be compared)
- Tuple generating dependencies (these constraints states which tuples should be present)
~
They consider two repair operations: Addition of tuples or deletion of tuples.
The representation used is that of a database instance and its corresponding extra database (composed of sets that can be added using the repair operation).
~
They introduce some definitions for conflicting sets:
- a set of tuples is a d-conflict wrt a DC if it violates it / wrt a TDG if it satisfies the left side of the TGD but not the right side.
- guarantor of a d-conflict wrt a set of integrity constraints is a minimal set of tuples that restore consistency. Of course, the guarantor of a d-conflict wrt a DC is always empty. 
- i-conflict wrt a set of TGDs and another integrity constraint Y is a set of tuples sd U si such that the intersection of sd with si is empty, there is a guarantor of sd wrt the set of TGDs and si is a minimum set of tuples that is in d-conflict with a subset of the guarantor wrt Y.
~
A repair (S-repair) is a maximal consistent set of tuples composed of tuples that should be selected in the original database plus the set of added tuples from the extra DB.
~
They use the "priority" relation (it must be acyclic) between set of tuples and a tuple and they extend it to preferences between tuples. Then using this preference relation they introduce:
locally/semi-globally and globally optimal repairs.
~
Their argumentation framework is composed of:
- Arguments with a negative/positive support (set of tuples) and a conclusion (set of integrity constraint). if the negative support is empty then the positive support is consistent wrt to the conclusion otherwise, the positive and negative constraint are in conflict. They have the notion of inclusion (conservative) between arguments
- They have undercut / rebuttal. Counter arguments can be sound/strict. Note that strict counter arguments are sound. They use the notion of canonical counter-argument to represent a set of possibly infinite equivalent arguments (similar to cores)
------{\textgreater} Computing the set of canonical counter arguments is polynomial if the set of integrity constraints is acyclic.
~
Using the aforementioned definition, they make argumentation trees.
The notions: full/single strict argumentation tree, successful argumentation tree, etc...
~
~
They show that the argumentation framework can be used for checking the optimality of a repair.

The particularity of their databases is that every tuple comes with a weight that represent the cost of deleting/modifying this database.
Functional dependencies work as integrity constraints. And they focus on two problems:
- S-repair: obtained after a minimum of tuple deletions
- U-repair: obtained after a minimum of value (cell) updates.
The optimal S/U-repair are obtained after considering the cost of each tuples.
~
The contribution of this paper is:
- An dichotomy algorithm for the optimal S-repair problem that work in polynomial time on certain FDs and is APX-complete otherwise.
- They give insights as to how we could build an similar algorithm for U-repairs (2 theorem). The first one says that if there is an a-approximation for A=A1 U A2. Then there is an a-approximation for both A1 and A2. The second theorem says that removing the concensus FDs (FDs of the form {\textbackslash}emptyset {\textbackslash}rightarrow A) does not change the complexity of the problem.
- They provide reductions to and from subset repairing.},

When the user receive the answers from the repair semantics, he detects some wanted / unwanted answers. The system will try to make the wanted answer IAR and unwanted answer no brave.
Thus, the query-driven repairing problem (QRP) consists in finding a set of facts to remove and a set of facts to add (repair plan) such that we satisfy the wanted/unwanted answers. We say that we address all the defects.
As to avoid adding more errors, the system is validated by a user. He gives truth values so that we only add/remove assertions that are true/false. A repair plan is validatable iff every fact removed is false and every added fact is true.
However, a validatable repair plan does not always exists. That is why they find "optimal repair plan" instead.
In order to compare repair plan, first they add ways to compare them: Pareto principle, lexicopgraphical. Second, they add sets of preferred repair plans: globally and locally optimal.
They also give a complexity analysis of their methods and algorithms.
They also adress the problem of optimal deletion-only repair pans by giving an algorithm. A validatable deletion-only repair plan is optimal iff:
- It satisfies every unwanted such that its causes are false.
- It satisfies every wanted such that .....

Note that they have an implementation of their work and they benchmarked it on a previous set of KBs.

	abstract = {Knowledge bases are deductive databases where the machinery of logic is used to represent domain-specific and general-purpose knowledge over existing data. In the existential rules framework, a knowledge base is com- posed of two layers: the data layer which represents the factual knowledge, and the ontological layer that incorporates rules of deduction and negative constraints. The main reasoning service in such framework is answering queries over the data layer by means of the ontological layer. As in classi- cal logic, contradictions trivialize query answering since everything follows from a contradiction (ex falso quodlibet). Recently, inconsistency-tolerant approaches have been proposed to cope with such problem in the existential rules framework. They deploy repairing strategies on the knowledge base to restore consistency and overcome the problem of trivialization. However, these approaches are sometimes unintelligible and not straightforward for the end-user as they implement complex repairing strategies. This would jeopardize the trust relation between the user and the knowledge-based sys- tem. In this thesis we answer the research question: {\textquotedblleft}How do we make query answering intelligible to the end-user in presence of inconsistency?{\textquotedblright}. To answer the question we consider the general framework of argumentation and we propose three types of explanations: (1) One-shot Argument-based Explanations, (2) Meta-level Dialectical Explanations, and (3) Object-level Dialectical Explanations. The first one is a set of arguments in favor or against the query in question. The two others take the form of a dialogue between the user and the reasoner about the entailment of a given query. We study these explanations in the framework of logic-based argumentation and dialectics and we study their properties and their impact on users.},

	abstract = {This book presents a systematic overview of the interaction between logic programming and database systems. Merging these two technologies permits new types of systems which extend the frontiers of computer science and open up new applications, such as deductive databases, knowledge base management systems, and expert database systems. The book opens with an overview and an introductory review, then is divided into three parts devoted to - the coupling of Prolog with relational databases, - the precise definition of the Datalog language, and - the description of query optimization techniques and extensions of Datalog. A closing chapter reviews the main projects on the integration of logic programming and databases, including LDL, Nail! and the Fifth Generation Project. The presentation achieves a balance between theoretical and technological issues, by providing a careful introduction to the underlying paradigms and their theoretical foundations, and by stressing the problems involved in achieving efficiency when interfacing logic programming formalisms with large databases. The book is thus suited for members of both the database and logic programming communities. The authors use a tutorial style complete with examples and exercises to introduce students as well as researchers to this developing field.},

An agent called the "drama agent" manages several information sources (Cost KB, Treament KB, etc..) for the decision making.
Each argument is composed of a tuple (R,A,S,G,V) where R is the circumstances, A the action performed, S the resulting state, G the goal and V the value.
Note that the value V is determined using a set of values (cost/efficiency/safety/etc..)
When an argument is added, it can be criticized using "critical question". They consider 5 of them:
- "Are there alternative ways for same S"
- "Are there alternative ways for same G"
- "Are the assumptions true ?"
- "Performing A will demotes some other value ?"
- "Will the action have the effects desired ?"
After checking the critical questions, the agent will look into the different KBs and the patient information to see if it can build further arguments.
Once all the arguments are constructed, they add another argument representing "do nothing".
Then, they select a ranking on V such that there is a preferred argument in each cycles. This is done because they want a single preferred extension.
If the "do nothing" argument is in the resulting extension, they change the ranking on V or they try to find new arguments so that it does not happen anymore.

Note that they identify the following problem:
MIS(A,I): Given the hypergraph A and a set of maximal independent set I, find another MIS or prove that the set I is complete.
In previous papers, it was shown that MIS(A,I) where I is the emptyset was :
- NC if the hyperedges were bounded by 3
- RNC if the hyperedges were bounded by k{\textgreater}=4
RESULT 1: They extended this result for I not empty !!
RESULT 2: If the hyperedges are bounded, then the MIS(A,I) is NC-reductible (AC0 in fact) to MIS(A', emptyset) where A' is a induced partial hypergraph.
~
VOCABULARY:
NCi ACi NCi+1 NC P
Partial hypergraph: Choose only certain hyperedges
Induced partial hypergraph: Given a set U included in V, we restrict the chosen hyperedges to this set U.
Transversal: A set S such that the intersection of S with every hyperedge is not empty.
DUAL(A,B): Given an hypergraph A and a set of minimal transversal B, find another MT or prove that the set B is complete
DUAL(A,B) is equivalent to MIS(A,I)

	annote = {This work studies ranking-based semantics for bipolar argumentation graphs.
The significance of this paper deals with a formalization of a modular structure for ranking-based semantics. In this new structure, the ranking-based semantics is split into:
- An aggregation function that merges the attack/support structure of the graph with the acceptability degrees
- An influence function that merges the output of the aggregation function with initial weights from arguments.
~
In the paper, they represent argumentation graphs as a triple (A,G,w), where A is a set of arguments, G is a matrix composed of 1s,0s and -1s (for attacks) and w is the function that associates the initial weights to arguments.
1- They compare in Table 1, the different properties for ranking-based semantics defined in the literature.
~

2- They generalize some of the properties for their framework. For instance, a semantics satisfies neutrality in their framework iff all the degrees of the arguments are positive (note that the degrees are defined in the interval [-1,1])
3- They give multiple examples for the aggregation function "alpha" and the influence function "i"
4- They show sufficient conditions for semantics to converge based on the in-degree of the graph.
5- They show very simple examples of divergence. An interesting result is that all semantics based on the sum aggregation function will not converge for all WASA.

They develop a method for the reconstruction of argumentative discourse that takes into account all aspects that are relevant to a critical assessment. They also propose a practical code of behaviour for discussants who want to resolve their differences in a reasonable way. This is a major contribution to the study of argumentation and will be of particular value to professionals and graduate students in speech communication, informal logic, rhetoric, critical thinking, linguistics, and philosophy.},

Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability{\textemdash}an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive {\textquotedblleft}style.{\textquotedblright} The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences.

	abstract = {Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization (CCSAV) is a technical methodology that offers support for online collective deliberation over complex dilemmas. As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wikis and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content.},

	abstract = {Online learning has been widely adopted in higher education but there is a need to better understand the nature of student engagement with online courses. For example, there are questions about whether students engage with courses as educators intend and what features of online courses engage students to enhance learning. Bringing together student and educator perspectives, this article reports on a study that identified {\textquoteleft}pedagogical touchpoints{\textquoteright} {\textendash} opportunities within online courses for student engagement {\textendash} to ascertain whether a better understanding of these could improve online course design and student engagement. Data were collected across three undergraduate online courses. Data analysis produced three key findings: mapping pedagogical touchpoints against dimensions of engagement reveals patterns that may inform enhanced course design, students{\textquoteright} engagement with pedagogical touchpoints varies according to their learning needs and desires, and mapping pedagogical touchpoints can inform course design at both conceptual and practical levels. Discussion of the findings highlights that purposeful design of online courses, including strategic planning for pedagogical touchpoints, can maximise the potential for student engagement and consequent learning.},

	abstract = {An argumentation framework is a pair made of a graph and a semantics. The nodes and the edges of the graph represent respectively arguments and relations (e.g., attacks, supports) between arguments while the semantics evaluates the strength of each argument of the graph. This paper investigates gradual semantics dealing with weighted graphs, a family of graphs where each argument has an initial weight and may be attacked by other arguments. It contains four contributions. The first consists of laying the foundations of gradual semantics by proposing key principles on which evaluation of argument strength may be based. Foundations are important not only for a better understanding of the evaluation process in general, but also for clarifying the basic assumptions underlying semantics, for comparing different (families of) semantics, and for identifying families of semantics that have not been explored yet. The second contribution consists of providing a formal analysis and a comprehensive comparison of the semantics that have been defined in the literature for evaluating arguments in weighted graphs. As a third contribution, the paper proposes three novel semantics and shows which principles they satisfy. The last contribution is the implementation and empirical evaluation of the three novel semantics. We show that the three semantics are very efficient in that they compute the strengths of arguments in less than 20 iterations and in a very short time. This holds even for very large graphs, meaning that the three semantics scale very well.},

	abstract = {Studying at university continues to grow in popularity and the modern-day university has expanded considerably to meet this need. Invariably as such expansion occurs pressures arise on a range of quality enhancement processes. This may have serious implications for the continued delivery of high quality learning experiences that both meet the expectations of incoming students and are appropriate to their postgraduation aspirations. Ensuring students become active partners in their learning will encourage them to engage with a range of quality enhancement processes. The aim of the current work is to examine the various factors that motivate students to engage in such a fashion. Three focus groups were carried out in a stratified manner to ascertain student motivations and to triangulate an effective set of recommendations for subsequent practice. The participants consisted of engaged and non-engaged first year undergraduate students as well as student-facing staff who were asked to comment on their experiences as to why students would want to engage as a course representative. Nominal group technique was applied to the emerging thematic data in each group. Three key motivational themes emerged that overlapped across all focus groups i.e., a need for individual representation that makes a change, a desire to develop a professional skillset as well as a desire to gain a better understanding of their course of study. A university that aligns its student experience along these themes is likely to facilitate student representation. As is standard practice recommendations for future work are described alongside a discussion of the limitations.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss contrastive explanations for formal argumentation - the question why a certain argument (the fact) can be accepted, whilst another argument (the foil) cannot be accepted under various extension-based semantics. The recent work on explanations for argumentation-based conclusions has mostly focused on providing minimal explanations for the (non-)acceptance of arguments. What is still lacking, however, is a proper argumentation-based interpretation of contrastive explanations. We show under which conditions contrastive explanations in abstract and structured argumentation are meaningful, and how argumentation allows us to make implicit foils explicit.},
