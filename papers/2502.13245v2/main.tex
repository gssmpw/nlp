\section{Conclusion}

We present a set of algorithms for range retrieval on high-dimensional datasets using graph-based indices. To improve the performance of queries with no range results, we introduce an early stopping mechanism capable of significantly decreasing the time taken to terminate searches on such queries. We also introduce two extensions of beam search, greedy search and doubling search, for efficient range queries with hundreds to tens of thousands of results. Combined, our techniques achieved up to 100x speedup over a naive baseline, with 5-10x speedup in almost all cases. We introduce a benchmark of nine datasets, including datasets with up to 100 million points, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability for our algorithms on these datasets. 

Our results yield significant improvement over the naive baseline, and established a wide-ranging benchmark for performance. As we tackle a relatively unexplored problem, many areas for further improvement are still available. One natural extension would be to explore more sophisticated metrics for our early stopping algorithm, perhaps using machine learning methods, as better early termination of queries with few results has potential for significant impact on overall search times. Another would be to explore extensions of the range retrieval benchmark itself; for example, Szilvasy et al.~\cite{szilvasy2024vector} argue that the range search benchmark should differentiate between results which are very close to the query point and points which are close to the radius boundary, giving the former more weight. In preliminary experiments, we attempted to use a simple weighting mechanism based on a point's distance to the query point when calculating precision, but we were unable to find a weighting that changed the precision values significantly. However, future work identifying such mechanisms would be very practical and promising.
