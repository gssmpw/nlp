\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relwork}
Our system draws on many areas of prior work, including substructural type systems and reference
capabilities, but those were discussed earlier.
We focus this section not on an exhaustive explanation of the many sources of inspiration
for this work (largely covered by related work discussions of the previously-cited papers),
but instead on comparing our work against other approaches to ensuring that actors (or active objects) and
processes handle specific message sequences and send compatible message sequences to others.
%

A classic point of reference for this is Nierstrasz's work~\cite{nierstrasz1993regular} on \emph{regular types},
assigning finite-state-based specifications of object behaviour, as the sequence of messages accepted and the resultant
responses. His exposition explores the structure of these specifications and informally how they might apply
to objects, but provides no application of these types to a concrete programming language, and focuses on composing
applications by way of one object using another as its sole client.

This focus on the behaviour of the active object itself over time is also nearly dual to ours: regular types
for active objects describe the process behaviour summatively, while in our (source) type system, no
summative language-oriented description of an actor's accepted messages exists! Instead static knowledge
of an actor's accepted language can only be cobbled together from various capabilities.
Active objects, as nicely captured in De Koster et al.'s taxonomy of actor language variants~\cite{de201643},
do not permit changing the set of accepted messages over time. Support for such changes is an explicit goal of this work.
Lack of a global type is a trade-off. On one hand, there is no complete closed description of behaviour separate from the code itself.
On the other hand, actors can be specified and checked in isolation, without needing to know a priori how they fit into
a larger system.

Our calculus is pure, but as many popular actor frameworks are in languages with mutable state, and permit sharing
references across actors on the same machine~\cite{charousset2014caf,haller2012integration}
The introduction of direct mutable heaps raises classic issues of balancing safety and efficiency of sending messages. 
Deep copying of state is always sound, but highly inefficient, especially when the data being sent is either immutable
or the sender discards its own access to the mutable data after sending.
This has motivated a great deal of work on various flavors of uniqueness and mutation control,
including a great deal of work applying the reference capability notions discussed in the introduction 
to track forms of unique ownership transfer or object immutability~\cite{gordon2012uniqueness,gordon2014verifying,gordon2017verifying,CastegrenW16,CastegrenW17,clebsch2015deny,servetto2013balloon,giannini2019flexible}. Some of this work~\cite{gordon2012uniqueness,clebsch2015deny} has specifically been applied to actor systems.\footnote{Now that the relevant NDAs are long-expired, we can finally say in writing that the context for \cite{gordon2012uniqueness} was the Midori~\cite{duffyblog} derivative of Singularity~\cite{Fahndrich2006language,Hunt2007singularity}, where processes were essentially actors.}
However, incorporating two orthogonal flavors of capabilities --- the actor capabilities proposed here, 
along with the reference capabilities from existing work --- would distract from the main technical development.

An alternative approach to managing state sharing and exchange between actors is the introduction of
specially-shared capsules. De Koster et al.~\cite{de2012domains,de2015domains} introduce \emph{domains}, which
are shared-memory constructs which actors asynchronously request access to (akin to asynchronous mutex acquisition).
Similarly, Cheeseman et al.'s \emph{cowns}~\cite{cheeseman2023concurrency} (named for \emph{concurrent ownership})
are shared resources asked by asynchronously-spawned computations that run only when all required cowns are available at once.
The most closely related work to ours also falls into this group:
Caldwell et al.~\cite{caldwell2024programming} describe a specialized data exchange environment called a \emph{dataspace}, as well as an effect
system describing behaviour over time for actors and data --- effectively dual to our approach of restricting actor behaviours with
capabilities. Similar to Skalka et al.~\cite{skalka2008types,Skalka2008}, their effects give abstract summaries of actor behaviour,
which can then be used to model-check properties of the program (i.e., the effect types for both Skalka et al.'s work and Caldwell et al.'s work
give a model that is verified to soundly abstract the program code).

Session types~\cite{Honda2008,lagaillardie2020implementing}, choreographic programming~\cite{shen2023haschor,cruz2023formal,giallorenzo2024choral}, and multitier programming~\cite{weisenburger2020survey}
solve the issue of agreement between the messages accepted by a given process and message sent to it by others in the inverse way
of what we describe here. Instead of analyzing correctness of processes in isolation,
these approaches start with a single program describing all global behaviour, and a compiler generates
code (or in the case of session types, synchronization skeletons) for individual processes via a projection process.
These approaches are generally applied to \emph{synchronous} message passing, though 
Harvey et al.~\cite{harvey2021multiparty} and Neykova et al.~\cite{neykova2017multiparty} have adapted session types to actors (though
still using a global description of the full orchestration which is then projected for each of a fixed set of roles).

Originating around the same time as classic binary session types~\cite{honda1998language}, Nielson and Nielson~\cite{nielson1993cml} described one of
the earliest flow-sensitive effect systems, for ensuring Concurrent ML (CML) processes sent and recieved \emph{synchronous} messages in an expected order.
This early similarity turned out to be quite relevant, as session types can be recast as an effect system (and vice versa)~\cite{orchard2016effects}.
Thus the idea of applying effect systems --- or an equivalent formalism --- to ensure correct message request ordering is itself far from new.
And the idea of using capabilities to restrict effects is also not new, going back past recent formal connections~\cite{craig2018}
to many earlier expositions of effects~\cite{henglein2005effect,Marino2009} in an implicit form.

Two aspects of our approach distinguish it from this established body of work.
First, this is to the best of our knowledge the first use of flow sensitive \emph{capabilities} (a form of coeffect~\cite{choudhury2020recovering})
to achieve safe ordering. While the relationship to a putative effect system achieving the same ends has not been formally pursued, and this
likely carries some of the downside of capabilities (vs. effects) outlined in our prior work~\cite{gordon2020designing} (which applied only to
flow-insensitive effect systems), it also carries a unique advantage in system design not discussed in that paper.
While effect systems may obtain greater precision in reasoning about side effects~\cite{gordon2020designing},
they do so at the cost of needing to ``reconstruct'' behaviour and check compatibility after the fact.
In contrast, our capability formulataion of the problem inverts this checking, and places each actor (and its original allocation site)
in firm control of how other actors interact with it --- the protocols of the self-capabilities an actor sends to others
directly constrain those others' interactions a priori, localizing checks to a far greater extent than in CML or session types --- no direct global accounting of
behaviour is required to exist.

Second --- and a complementary factor in not requiring a global behavioural description to exist --- is our use of an effect system
to track capability \emph{creation}. This differs from most static capability work, which typically assumes all possible capabilities for something
exist upon its creation, and must be passed through the program. Instead we treat actors' retrieval of a new self-reference as a
\emph{dynamic} capability creation --- via effects. While it has long been recognized that both coeffects (e.g., capabilities) and effects are required
to reason about various combinations of independently-interesting static analyses and language semantics, ours is the first
non-trivial interaction we are aware of mixing coeffects and effects \emph{as part of a single solution to a single problem}.


Program logics have also been used for reasoning about correctness of actor messages.
Gordon~\cite{gordon2019modal} proposed modal assertions of the form $@_l(P)$ inspired by hybrid logic~\cite{areces2007hybrid},
indicating that $P$ was true of the state of the actor at $l$. Thus assertions true at the sending actor
could be packaged in this way, and communicated as part of message invariants; a rely-guarantee-style relation constraining
state evolution worked together with a restriction to only send assertions stable with respect to that relation
ensured the assertions about other actors were never invalidated, but limited what could be proved to assertions over
monotonically-evolving portions of state (though CRDTs have shown this can be made more flexible than it initially appears~\cite{shapiro2011conflict}).
More recently some program logics (instantiations of \textsc{Iris}~\cite{jung2018iris}) have tied together
ideas from session types and verification for simple actor languages~\cite{hinrichsen2019actris,hinrichsen2024multris}. This work handles protocols similar to binary (for Actris)
or multiparty (for Multris) session types, but each message has not only a value but a set of assertions that the recipient may
assume upon receipt of the corresponding value.
This is much more powerful and flexible than Gordon's approach, at the cost of complexity. Gordon's system was prototyped as a library for the automated verification tool Dafny, %
while the modern approaches rely on \textsc{Iris} embedded in an interactive proof assistant.
The key point of comparison to this work is that Actris and Multris do ensure the absence of unhandled messages,
but the specifications for doing so are traditional, essentially-CPS-style session types. Compatibility when delgating
use of a channel to another process is checked via an ad hoc simulation search procedure akin to Milit\~ao et al.'s~\cite{militao2016composing}.
In contrast, our use of shuffle uncovers a clean algebraic structure underlying most common uses of sharing and resharing
the addresses of other processes, though it is strictly-speaking less general than Actris and Multris, where the correct continuation
of a protocol may depend on the specific value sent.

\subsubsection{\ackname}
First and foremost, I owe a great deal of thanks to Gul Agha for his pivotal role in the development
and advocacy of the actor model, which forms the basis for much of my research career (via the work
I am most known for~\cite{gordon2012uniqueness} and some of the work I am most fond of~\cite{gordon2019modal});
as well as some of what I most enjoy teaching (using actors when teaching distributed computing).
Agha's work has been the source for a significant amount of my own learning to think about concurrent programs
and their implementation~\cite{karmani2009actor,agha1986actors}, and by chance
he has had a direct influence on individual people who have influenced me during time in industry and academia~\cite{miller2005concurrency}.
Thanks to Ivan Bestchastnikh, for asking me in 2012 how I could apply reference capabilities to distributed systems. It took 13 years, but I think I’ve finally articulated a good answer,
even if handling faults remains future work.
This work was supported by NSF Award \#CCF-2007582.
