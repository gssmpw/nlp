\section{Related works}
Among the large literature on Neural Operators and methods at the intersection between DL and ROM, the papers closest to our work are: \cite{knigge2024space} where the latent dynamics is described by an ODE, \cite{yin2023continuous} where the latent dynamics is required to respect the equivariant properties of the original PDE, \cite{vcnef-hagnberger:2024} where an architecture featuring Neural Fields and Transformers is used to solve PDEs for different initial conditions and PDE parameters and \cite{takamoto2023learning} where a general method for including the PDE parameter dependency into Neural Operators is proposed.
