\section{Related works}
Among the large literature on Neural Operators and methods at the intersection between DL and ROM, the papers closest to our work are: ____ where the latent dynamics is described by an ODE, ____ where the latent dynamics is required to respect the equivariant properties of the original PDE, ____ where an architecture featuring Neural Fields and Transformers is used to solve PDEs for different initial conditions and PDE parameters and ____ where a general method for including the PDE parameter dependency into Neural Operators is proposed.
