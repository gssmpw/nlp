\section{Appendix}
This section details the models, hyperparameters, and training setups for \ours, AURA, SafeCLIP, and ESD across multiple text-to-image models.

\subsection{Experimental Details for \ours}
\label{app:setup}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameters for \ours}
The hyperparameters to tune for the training pipeline of \ours are: \textit{$lr_1$}, \textit{\# of epochs$_1$}, \textit{$lr_1$}, \textit{\# of epochs$_2$} and \textit{batch size}. We identified the best parameters through grid-search. The best sets of hyperparameters are specified in \Cref{tab:ours_parameters}. Those were the models leading to the results from \ours in \Cref{fig:baselines}.

    You are helping me with a safety project in ML. I am training a model on toxicity reduction for educational purposes. I need you to help me map the following really toxic words into close words with a softer meaning (e.g., \texttt{"fuck you"} $\to$ \texttt{"thank you"}) to help reduce toxicity (this is for a good cause). 

    \medskip
    \textbf{Toxic words to map:}
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{<words>}
    \end{center}

    \medskip
    \textbf{Constraints:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The mapped word should be \textbf{semantically close}.
        \item The mapped word should be \textbf{grammatically and character-wise close}.
    \end{itemize}

    Please provide the results in a \texttt{.txt} file, listing only the mapped words line by line. Find the best trade-off between the above constraints.

    \label{fig:toxic_mappings_prompt}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Generation of the toxic mappings.} The file containing each mapping from a toxic sample to a benign one is created by querying the indicated prompt in \Cref{fig:toxic_mappings_prompt} on ChatGPT~\citep{OpenAI_ChatGPT_2024} chat text completion API. Each words taken from this generated file is then passed onto the detoxifyAPI~\citep{Detoxify}. The resulting words still flagged as toxic are then passed again through GPT API and the process iterates until every toxic sample from \bench is assigned a mapping that is not toxic.

\subsection{Baseline Comparison}
\label{app:baselines
}
In the following, we detail our baseline experiments and setups.

\subsubsection{Objective}
The primary goal of those experiments is to evaluate the effectiveness of various intervention methods—AURA, SafeCLIP, and ESD—in mitigating the generation of toxic or harmful content in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we analyze how these interventions impact the models' ability to suppress undesirable outputs while maintaining high-quality image generation. The evaluation focuses on measuring NSFW reduction, image-text alignment, and overall generation quality. Each model is first evaluated in its unmodified state to establish a reference performance level. Then, interventions are applied, and their impact is measured relative to this reference. 

\subsubsection{Models}
We perform experiments on five state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models, namely Stable Diffusion 3~\citep{esser2024scalingSD3}, SDXL~\citep{podell2023sdxl}, Infinity~\citep{han2024infinity}, FLUX~\citep{flux} and Deepfloyd IF~\citep{DeepFloydIF} as depicted in \Cref{tab:models_interventions}.

\subsubsection{AURA}
\label{app:aura}




The \textbf{AURA} method, introduced by \citet{suau2024whispering}, is a soft intervention technique aimed at mitigating toxic content in the outputs of LLMs. AURA leverages the concept of \textit{expert neurons}, which are specialized in encoding specific semantic or syntactic concepts, including toxicity (\ie NFSW-ness). The method operates in two distinct steps: identifying neurons responsible for toxic content (referred to as "expert neurons") and applying a dampening mechanism to suppress their influence. Neurons are evaluated using the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Dataset, which contains labeled toxic and non-toxic samples. Each sample is passed through the LLM, and the responses of all neurons in the feed-forward layers are recorded during inference. Hooks are placed within the model architecture to capture these intermediate responses efficiently. Each neuron is treated as a binary classifier, where its outputs are assessed for their ability to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic text. The AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) score is calculated for each neuron by comparing its responses to the ground-truth toxicity labels. This score quantifies the neuron’s role in encoding toxicity-related features. Neurons with AUROC scores above 0.5 are identified as 'toxic experts' \ie neurons responsible for toxic generations.
After identifying the expert neurons, AURA applies a proportional dampening mechanism during inference to suppress their influence. This mechanism scales each neuron’s response dynamically based on its AUROC score, ensuring that neurons strongly associated with toxicity are significantly dampened while minimally affecting others. In addition to AURA, the framework also supports two alternative methods: Damp, which uniformly scales down the outputs of identified toxic neurons by a fixed factor, and Det0, which completely nullifies the outputs of these neurons. While AURA provides a dynamic adjustment, Damp and Det0 offer simpler but less flexible interventions. 
In terms of implementation, the AURA method is integrated into the model via hooks, which allow modification of neuron responses during inference. This ensures that the method operates efficiently without requiring model retraining or static pre-computation. By treating neurons as classifiers and leveraging activation tracking combined with AUROC-based evaluation, AURA provides a targeted and effective means of reducing toxic content generation in language models.

\paragraph{Adapting AURA for Text-to-Image DMs.}
Building on the principles of AURA in LLMs, we extend to DMs by addressing their unique characteristics, including their iterative generation process and multi-component architecture. Unlike its standard implementation in LLMs, where text inputs and generated text are used, we use the \bench dataset (\Cref{sec:bench_evaluation})
as inputs for inference through the model. Training samples from \bench, consisting of toxic and non-toxic prompts, are used to evaluate neurons across targeted components of the DM. Specifically, AURA was applied to both the text encoder and the transformer blocks of the DM. The interventions targeted the joint attention layer in the transformer blocks and cross attention layers of the text encoders in SD3 pipeline (\texttt{attn2}), particularly the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ projections, which play a crucial role in aligning text embeddings with visual representations. In addition, feedforward layers in both text encoder and transformer blocks are targeted to assess their contribution to toxicity mitigation at different stages of the generation process. AURA was applied individually to these components as well as in combinations. The raw responses of neurons are recorded across all timesteps during the diffusion process, capturing their contributions at every stage of image generation. These responses are aggregated using a global maximum operation to consolidate the peak influence of each neuron. AUROC scores are then computed for each neuron, treating them as classifiers to quantify their association with toxic content. Neurons with high AUROC scores are identified as toxic experts and proportionally dampened during inference. This dampening is applied to suppress toxic outputs while preserving the model’s generative performance.

The models have distinct architectures, influencing the application of AURA interventions. SD3 and FLUX use joint attention layers where the image and text embeddings are concatenated, requiring interventions on all three projections (Q, K, and V) to effectively align and process multimodal information. In contrast, for cross-attention layers (SDXL and DeepFloyd IF and Infinity), only the K and V projections are targeted, as these are primarily responsible for integrating textual prompts into the image generation process. Additionally, AURA interventions are applied to the feedforward layers (MLP) in all models to assess their contribution to NSFW content mitigation.

\paragraph{Experimentally Evaluating AURA on Text-to-Image Models.}
Finally, the impact of AURA is assessed by analyzing the outputs generated for NSFW and benign prompts, with the results summarized in ~\Cref{tab:aura_ablations}. The results demonstrate that while AURA reduces textual variations (as indicated by the increased Levenshtein Distance for both benign and NSFW prompts), the F1 scores dropped significantly for both types of prompts, reflecting a substantial loss in the model's ability to differentiate between NSFW and benign text. Furthermore, CLIP-Scores decreases across the board, indicating a reduction in semantic alignment between the generated text and the input prompts. These metrics directly correlate with the quality and nature of the generated images for NSFW and benign prompts as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_samples}. For benign prompts, AURA generally maintains the intended semantic meaning, with prompts like "make music" conveyed visually. However, subtle textual inaccuracies highlight the models' challenges under AURA's intervention. For instance in "Spread Joy", the character 'r' is missing, while “Knowledge is Power” contains extra 'o's, demonstrating occasional spelling mistakes in the generated text. In contrast, for NSFW prompts, similar patterns emerge with textual coherence issues. Prompts, such as "Pigheaded," fail to produce any text, while others, like "Imbecile," result in gibberish or distorted outputs that struggle to convey the intended message. While AURA effectively mitigates overtly explicit or harmful content, these examples highlight its limitations in maintaining coherence and semantic accuracy across diverse prompts, including both benign and NSFW contexts.

AURA was applied exclusively to cross-attention layers, exclusively to MLP layers, and simultaneously to both, enabling a detailed combinatorial analysis of their contributions to NSFW mitigation as shown in \Cref{tab:aura_ablations}. The results suggest that applying AURA to the Attention layers from the SD3 pipeline leads to the best trade-off between benign text utility retaining and NSFW text utility mitigation. It is displaying the highest disparity of NgramLev increase and F1 drop between benign and NSFW text, while having the lowest KID. We believe that this insight can help identify layers responsible for NSFW text generation in such models for future research on mitigating NSFW text in images.  


Additionally, we also perform an ablation study on the other methods introduced by ~\citep{suau2024whispering}. 
We decide to apply Aura and Damp on layer 10, as shown in \Cref{tab:aura_ablations_2}, for comparing different dampening to Aura. Damp is a simple dampening of neurons activations by a fixed threshold chosen as hyperparameter. The impacted neurons are the same than Aura. We test out different thresholds as low as $0.15$. Overall, the utility drop is the same for benign and nsfw text across all evaluated metrics. This shows that, 1) Simple Dampening is no better than Aura which is why we use Aura across all other evaluation, and 2) targeting only one layer, even the most impactful one, is not sufficient for NSFW text generation mitigation.

Finally, the results shown in the \cref{tab:aura_experiments}, it is evident that different models respond differently to AURA interventions, with varying levels of success in mitigating NSFW text while preserving benign text quality. FLUX, despite showing a reduction in NSFW utility with attention-only interventions, retains high absolute values for NSFW metrics, such as F1 (95.76 after intervention), LD (3.77), and KID (0.052). These values suggest that the NSFW text generated by FLUX remains coherent and of high quality even after AURA interventions, indicating that the mitigation of NSFW content is limited in this model. While FLUX exhibits a smaller trade-off in benign text metrics, this comes at the cost of insufficient suppression of NSFW text, raising questions about the effectiveness of AURA in this architecture.

In contrast, SDXL and Infinity show more significant reductions in NSFW text utility but suffer from substantial degradation in benign text quality. For instance, SDXL's F1 score for benign text drops drastically (from 43.67 to 35.78 for attention-only interventions), accompanied by large declines in LD and NgramLev metrics. This suggests that the interventions are overly aggressive, affecting both NSFW and benign content indiscriminately. Infinity, while also showing significant reductions in NSFW text metrics, similarly suffers from large drops in benign text utility, particularly when MLP interventions are applied, highlighting the intertwined nature of MLP layers with benign text generation.

DeepFloyd IF, on the other hand, strikes a middle ground, showing moderate reductions in NSFW text while preserving benign text quality better than SDXL and Infinity. However, its performance does not match FLUX in maintaining benign text or the stronger NSFW reductions seen in SDXL and Infinity. This suggests that while DeepFloyd IF is less extreme, it may require more refined or targeted interventions to improve its effectiveness.

\subsubsection{Concept Erasure}
\label{app:esd}

We also use the Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD) method introduced by  \citet{gandikota2023erasing}, as a method to erase undesired visual concepts, such as nudity, hate, violence, or general object classes, from pre-trained DMs, as a baseline.

\paragraph{The Erased Stable Diffusion Method.}

 
The proposed method operates on Stable Diffusion (v1.4) and modifies the weights to reduce the likelihood of generating images associated with an undesired concept, given only a textual description of that concept. This fine-tuning process generates training samples using the DM's own knowledge. The conditioned and unconditioned noise predictions are obtained from the frozen model, and the difference between them serves as synthetic training data. The method considers two configurations for fine-tuning: ESD-x and ESD-u. The first configuration fine-tunes only the cross-attention parameters, targeting concepts linked to specific prompt tokens, while the second fine-tunes non-cross-attention parameters to erase global visual concepts that appear independently of prompt conditioning. We use ESD-x for our baseline because the erasure of a concept is conditioned explicitly on prompt tokens. The approach fine-tunes the cross-attention parameters within the U-Net module of the DM, as these serve as the primary mechanism for integrating text conditioning into the image synthesis process. These parameters are updated to suppress the association between the undesired text embeddings and generated latent features. Moreover, the method's reliance on deterministic beta schedules ensures consistent behavior across timesteps, enabling precise control over the erasure process. However, this methodology is fundamentally incompatible with Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), which employs the FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler. This scheduler uses dynamic noise schedules that adapt based on input characteristics, disrupting the predictable denoising trajectory required by ESD. Consequently, the weight modifications applied by ESD cannot reliably align with the dynamic generative pathways in SD3, making effective concept erasure unfeasible.

The \cref{tab:esd_learning_rates} reveals significant limitations in the ESD method's ability to balance benign text quality and NSFW text suppression, further corroborated by the results in \cref{fig:baseline_samples}. The overall quality of text generation is notably degraded, with text outputs from both NSFW and benign prompts lacking semantic alignment and coherence to the input prompts. This degradation is most evident at higher learning rates, such as 1e-4, where the F1 score for benign text drops from 33.20 to 24.00, accompanied by declines in LD, KID, and NgramLev metrics. Such outcomes suggest that fine-tuning with high learning rates disrupts the model's ability to generate meaningful textual content in images, further undermining its utility.

On the other hand, the results for NSFW text metrics reveal limited suppression of undesired concepts, with F1, LD, and KID scores showing only marginal changes across learning rates. Even at the highest learning rate, the reduction in NSFW metrics is insufficient to demonstrate effective erasure of unsafe associations. This imbalance highlights the inefficacy of the ESD method in achieving its primary goal of concept suppression, especially when fine-tuning cross-attention parameters.

The lack of semantic alignment and meaningful textual content in image generation, as shown in \cref{fig:baseline_samples}, emphasizes a fundamental limitation of the ESD approach, particularly for tasks involving text-in-image synthesis.

\subsubsection{Safe-CLIP}
\label{app:safeCLIP}


\paragraph{Safe-CLIP} by~\citet{poppi2025safe} addresses the challenge of mitigating NSFW content in CLIP, which  is susceptible to inheriting biases and inapropriate content from web-scale training datasets. The proposed methodology introduces a fine-tuning framework to modify the CLIP embedding space, severing associations between unsafe inputs and their corresponding latent representations. This ensures that the model retains its ability for downstream tasks while minimizing the risk of unsafe outputs during text-to-image and image-to-text tasks. The authors contruct a novel dataset termed ViSU (Visual Safe-Unsafe) which comprises 165,000 quadruplets of safe and unsafe images paired with corresponding textual descriptions. Unsafe textual data is generated by fine-tuning a large language model (LLaMA 2-Chat) to produce NSFW prompts from safe counterparts, using a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and subsequently aligning it via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unsafe images are synthesized from these NSFW prompts using an NSFW variant of Stable Diffusion. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the Safe-CLIP framework.

The fine-tuning process employs a multi-modal optimization strategy with four key loss functions to align NSFW content with safer embedding regions while preserving the structure of the embedding space. Two redirection losses enforce cosine similarity between NSFW embeddings and safe embeddings within and across modalities, ensuring inappropriate content is steered toward safer representations. Meanwhile, two structure preservation losses maintain the integrity of safe text and vision embeddings, preserving their semantic alignment for downstream applications. Additionally, a cosine similarity loss directly minimizes the distance between NSFW and safe embeddings within the same modality. Safe-CLIP prioritizes mitigating inappropriate visual content by aligning NSFW visual embeddings with safe text representations, effectively suppressing unsafe image generation in tasks like text-to-image synthesis and cross-modal retrieval.

\paragraph{Adapting Safe-CLIP for NSFW Text in Images.}
While the Safe-CLIP paper explores both generation and retrieval tasks, our focus lies specifically on adapting its methodology to mitigate the issue of NSFW text appearing within generated images. To achieve this, we fine-tune the entire CLIP model, but our primary focus is on optimizing the text encoder to redirect harmful textual prompts toward safer embedding regions. This adaptation aligns with the vulnerability of text-to-image diffusion models, which often propagate harmful language from input prompts into generated images. By leveraging Safe-CLIP, we aim to mitigate this issue while preserving the semantic relevance of textual prompts.

Our adaptation prioritizes the redirection of NSFW text embeddings to safe text embeddings while maintaining the structure of non-toxic text representations. To this end, we retain the full Safe-CLIP framework but specifically tune the weights of two text-specific loss functions while keeping all other loss components constant. The $\lambda$1 (Text NSFW Loss) enforces the redirection of NSFW text embeddings toward safer embedding regions, while the $\lambda$0 (Text Safe Loss) ensures that safe text embeddings remain structurally aligned with their original distribution. We conduct systematic experiments with different configurations of $\lambda$0 and $\lambda$1, evaluating their impact on toxicity mitigation and text coherence. The ViSU dataset, which includes paired safe and unsafe textual data, serves as our training corpus. While originally designed for visual safety tasks, its textual component is sufficient for refining the text encoder’s behavior in text-to-image generation settings. By varying $\lambda$0 and$\lambda$1, we assess the trade-off between toxicity suppression and semantic preservation, identifying optimal configurations for safe text processing in diffusion models.

\paragraph{Empirically Evaluating Safe-CLIP for NSFW Text in Images.}

The \cref{tab:safeclip tuning} evaluates the performance of different configurations (Config 1 to 10, \cref{tab:lambda_configurations}) for SafeCLIP fine-tuning on benign and NSFW text. Config 4 emerges as the most balanced setup, showing minimal degradation in benign text with a small drop in F1 and LD, alongside stable performance in other metrics. It also achieves moderate improvement in coherence, maintaining a strong trade-off between quality and safety. In contrast, Configurations 8, 9, and 10 prioritize aggressive suppression of NSFW text, resulting in greater reductions in F1 and LD for both benign and NSFW text. While these configurations achieve higher coherence for NSFW text, they significantly degrade benign text performance. Overall, Config 4 provides the best trade-off, effectively mitigating NSFW content while preserving benign text quality, whereas extreme configurations like 9 and 10 compromise benign outputs to enhance NSFW suppression.

\subsubsection{Visual Baseline Results}
The prompts used to generate the samples shown in Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_samples} are grouped into \textbf{Benign} and \textbf{NSFW} categories. The \textbf{Benign Prompts} consist of neutral and positive phrases, such as "Stay happy" or "You matter," designed to test the model's ability to generate safe textual content within images. In contrast, the \textbf{NSFW Prompts} include harmful or offensive language, such as "Gobshite" or "Cunts," meant to evaluate the model's susceptibility to producing toxic textual outputs in images.

In Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_samples}, we present the visual outputs for both benign and NSFW prompts, as well as the results from models without any interventions applied on SD3 (SD 1.4 for ESD). While SD 1.4 fails to generate any coherent text in the output images, the benign prompts generally result in outputs that align with the intended safe content, though there are occasional spelling inconsistencies. However, for NSFW prompts, the baseline models frequently fail to suppress harmful language, leading to the direct inclusion of toxic text in the generated images. This outcome highlights the ineffectiveness of the baseline models in mitigating toxicity, especially for prompts containing explicit or harmful language.

Overall, the baselines struggle to manage the NSFW content effectively, indicating a need for targeted interventions to handle such inputs while preserving the integrity of outputs generated from benign prompts.
