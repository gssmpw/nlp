% \noindent \textbf{LLM serving systems.} 
% Recent research on LLM serving systems has concentrated on improving hardware efficiency through careful system optimizations ____. Among them, 
% % AlpaServe ____ suggests using model parallelism for scaling a single LLM beyond the memory limits of a single device. 
% vLLM ____ proposes page attention to improve the memory efficiency of the system. 
% % Deja Vu ____ reduces LLM inference latency by predicting and leveraging contextual sparsity on-the-fly.
% SARATHI ____ suggests chunk each prefill request and piggyback decoding requests to improve hardware utilization.
% Differently, \sys focuses more on optimizing LLM servicing on cloud heterogeneous resources.


% \noindent \textbf{Phase splitting in LLM serving.} Phase splitting has recently become a hot topic in optimizing LLM serving ____. Splitwise and DistServe ____ improve LLM inference efficiency by splitting prefill and decode phases across separate GPUs, optimizing hardware utilization and resource allocation. 
% TetriInfer ____ enhances LLM inference by partitioning prompts into fixed-size chunks, disaggregating prefill and decode replicas, and using a two-level scheduling algorithm for further optimization. 
% % ExeGPT ____ optimizes LLM inference by proposing novel scheduling strategies based on round-robin allocation and workload-aware allocation policies, decoupling the execution of encoding and decoding for efficient optimization of each phase. 
% % However, it is challenging to transition phase splitting directly to cloud services, mainly due to the diversity of resources and varying network conditions in cloud environments. 
% Our work is inspired by the phase splitting idea, and proposes the good matching between the heterogeneity in workload characteristics of different phases and the heterogeneity in cloud resources for high-performance LLM serving.

% % \noindent \textbf{Cost-efficiency in LLM serving.} Recent research has investigated diverse approaches to lowering the cost of LLM serving. SpotServe ____ reduces LLM serving costs by using preemptible GPU instances, dynamically adapting parallelization for fluctuating workloads. HexGen ____ reduces inference costs by deploying generative inference in a decentralized and heterogeneous setting, with asymmetric partitioning and advanced scheduling to enhance performance. 
% % Melange ____ reduces LLM deployment costs by selecting the most cost-efficient GPUs based on model request size, request rate, and latency SLO, treating GPU selection as a cost-aware bin-packing problem to optimize resource allocation. 
% % % \sys adopts a similar concept to utilize heterogeneous GPUs to reduce the serving cost, allowing for cost-efficient cloud LLMs services.
% % Our work has a similar objective, and is the first effort that integrates phase splitting with the heterogeneous GPUs to provide high-performance cloud serving for LLMs.
