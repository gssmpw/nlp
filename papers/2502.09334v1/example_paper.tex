\begin{abstract}
Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable proficiency in a range of tasks. Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose \sys, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a \textit{novel scheduling algorithm}, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lightweight re-scheduling} mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that \sys delivers \jyhh{up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$} increase in throughput and achieves \jyhh{up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$} reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.
