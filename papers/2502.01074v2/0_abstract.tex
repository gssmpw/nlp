Building generalist models has recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scientific domains. Within the realm of molecular learning, several studies have explored unifying diverse tasks across diverse domains. However, negative conflicts and interference between molecules and knowledge from different domain may have a worse impact in threefold. First, conflicting molecular representations can lead to optimization difficulties for the models. Second, mixing and scaling up training data across diverse tasks is inherently challenging. Third, the computational cost of refined pretraining is prohibitively high. 
To address these limitations, this paper presents \textbf{\method}, a scalable and unified LLM-based framework for direct instruction tuning. \method builds on three key components to tackles conflicts: (1) a unified encoding mechanism for any task input; (2) an active-learning-driven data selection strategy that significantly reduces dataset size; (3) a novel design of the adaptive gradient stabilization module and anchor-and-reconcile MoE framework that ensures stable convergence. Experimentally, \method achieves state-of-the-art performance across most of the 15 molecular tasks, demonstrates the presence of scaling laws in the molecular domain, and is supported by extensive ablation studies and analyses validating the effectiveness of its design. 
The dataset, code and weights of the powerful AI-driven chemistry generalist are open-sourced.
