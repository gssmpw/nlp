\section{Conclusion} 
Long-context LLMs have the potential to tackle complex, information-dense tasks requiring deep reasoning and coherent long-form generation. To advance their development and benchmarking, we introduce \sysb, a synthetic long-context reasoning benchmark generated entirely by a software-based system with fine-grained control over complexity and information density. Through extensive evaluations on \sysb, we uncover key insights to inform future LLM training and inference improvements.
