abstract = {We propose a novel SAT-based approach to graph generation. Our approach utilizes the interaction between a CDCL SAT solver and a special symmetry propagator where the SAT solver runs on an encoding of the desired graph property. The symmetry propagator checks partially generated graphs for minimality with respect to a lexicographic ordering during the solving process. This approach has several advantages over a static symmetry breaking: (i) symmetries are detected early in the generation process, (ii) symmetry breaking is seamlessly integrated into the CDCL procedure, and (iii) the propagator performs a complete symmetry breaking without causing a prohibitively large initial encoding. We instantiate our approach by generating extremal graphs with certain restrictions in terms of forbidden subgraphs and diameter. In particular, we could confirm the Murty–Simon Conjecture (1979) on diameter-2-critical graphs for graphs up to 19 vertices and prove the exact number of Ramsey graphs (mathcal{R}(3,5,n)) and (mathcal{R}(4,4,n)) .},

All these problems ask for the existence of large homogeneous (monochromatic) configurations of a certain kind under the condition that the size of the underlying set is large. As it is quite common in Ramsey theory, most of our results are not sharp and almost all of them lead to new problems which seem to be difficult. The problems we treat are only loosely connected. So we will state and explain them section by section.}

Explicit computations include the values of R(3, 6) and R(3, 7) among others. Our computational techniques yield the upper bound R(x, y)≤cyx−1log log y/logy for x≥3.}

abstract = {Abstract The Ramsey number R(4, 5) is defined to be the least positive integer n such that every n-vertex graph contains either a clique of order 4 or an independent set of order 5. With the help of a long computation using novel techniques, we prove that R(4, 5) = 25. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},
