	\caption{\textbf{Part-based implicit representation.} \PSDF{} is a modular approach to representing composite 3D shapes for a variety of purposes thanks to the simplicity of our part decoder: (a) shape generation, optionally conditioned on part layouts, and \textit{part-based} (b) manipulation and (c) optimization. (c) The car body (in red) is optimized to reduce aerodynamic drag, without editing the wheels.}
%		 reconstruction from known parametrizations $(\bZ, \bP)$, point cloud with an encoder $h_\omega$, or generation with diffusion model $g_\phi$, (b) part-based manipulation, and (c) shape optimization. \NT{Redo to sell better part-based applications.}}
	% For a given shape category, the same pre-trained network can achieve all these tasks.
