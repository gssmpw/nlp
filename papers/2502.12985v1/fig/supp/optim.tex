	\caption{\textbf{Additional shape optimization.} The aerodynamic drag of the car is minimized with respect to the latent vector of the car's body, with fixed wheels. We show the initial car pre-optimization (\textit{top}) and the resutling car optimization (\textit{bottom}), colored by surface pressure from low to high pressure (blue to red). We also visualize the parts in the insert. We report the drag coefficient $C_d$ before and after the shape optimization, as computed by a physical simulator~\cite{OpenFoam}.}
