	\caption{\textbf{Layer arrangement in \PSDF{}.} (\textit{Top}) A convolutional layer $h_\text{conv}$ is put between each pair of fully-connected layers $h_\text{fc}$, with an added residual connection, and every layer is followed by a non-linearity $\sigma$. (\textit{Bottom}) For a given query position, the input tensor is of shape $P\times D$, with $P$ the number of parts and $D$ the feature size. $h_\text{fc}$ operates on the $D$ features for each part separately, while $h_\text{conv}$ (with kernels of size $1$) operates on the parts for each feature separately. The output is of shape $P\times D'$, with $D'$ the output feature size of the second $h_\text{fc}$ layer.}
