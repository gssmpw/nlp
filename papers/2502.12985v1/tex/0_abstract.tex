Accurate 3D shape representation is essential in engineering applications such as design, optimization, and simulation. In practice, engineering workflows require structured, part-aware representations, as objects are inherently designed as assemblies of distinct components. However, most existing methods either model shapes holistically or decompose them without predefined part structures, limiting their applicability in real-world design tasks. 
We propose \PSDF{}, a supervised implicit representation framework that explicitly models composite shapes with independent, controllable parts while maintaining shape consistency. Despite its simple single-decoder architecture, \PSDF{} outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in reconstruction and generation tasks. 
We further demonstrate its effectiveness as a structured shape prior for engineering applications, enabling precise control over individual components while preserving overall coherence.

The ability to represent 3D shapes is critical for applications such as shape generation, optimization, and design. To capture real-world complexity, particularly in engineering, composite shape representations—modeling shapes as assemblies of distinct sub-parts—are gaining importance. However, many existing methods either represent unified shapes or decompose shapes without structured part labels, leading to arbitrary segmentations.
%
We present \PSDF{}, a novel composite shape representation framework that balances expressive power with geometric consistency using Implicit Neural Representations. Unlike state-of-the-art methods relying on complex architectures, \PSDF{} achieves excellent results with a simple single decoder, enabling independent part outputs for precise control and constraints. 
%This simplicity also allows for disentangled pose and appearance, enhancing part adaptability for manipulation tasks.
%
We demonstrate its applicability to a wide range of application, outperforming supervised and unsupervised part-based baselines, and that \PSDF{} serves as a robust shape prior for engineering and design applications.

We present \PSDF{}, a novel composite shape representation framework that combines expressive power and geometric consistency, using Implicit Neural Representations. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on complex transformer architectures, \PSDF{} achieves excellent results with a much simpler single decoder. This simplicity enables independent part outputs, facilitating part-specific control and constraints. Additionally, \PSDF{} allows for disentangled pose and appearance, improving part adaptability for manipulation tasks.

We outperform supervised and unsupervised part-based baselines and show that our model can serve as a robust shape prior, well-suited for engineering and design applications.


3D shape representation is fundamental in applications ranging from shape generation to optimization and design. To address real-world complexity, particularly in engineering, composite shape representations—where shapes are modeled as assemblies of distinct sub-parts—are gaining importance. However, many current approaches either focus on representing a single, unified shape or decompose shapes without structured part labels, often leading to arbitrary segmentations. While some recent approaches address composite shapes with known part decompositions, they typically focus on pure generation rather than providing a robust shape prior for tasks like optimization and manipulation.
%
In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to encode composite shapes with a parameter space that includes both latent vectors and explicit part poses. Using a supervision robust to non-watertight parts, our model’s modularity supports a range of tasks such as shape reconstruction, generation, and optimization.
