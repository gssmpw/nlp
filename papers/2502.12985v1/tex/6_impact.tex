\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
sponsors that provided financial support.
