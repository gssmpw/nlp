We live in a world full of manufactured objects of ever-increasing complexity that require clever engineering to be functional. These objects are inherently composite. Thus Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools used to design and optimize them must be able to handle them as assemblies of distinct parts from the outset. Each part must adhere to separate fabrication constraints, tolerances, and functional requirements, making part-based representations essential. Unlike in many publicly available 3D datasets where shapes are treated as holistic entities, real-world engineering applications therefore require structured, part-aware models to support tasks such as simulation, optimization, and interactive design refinement. For example, when optimizing the aerodynamics of a car, correctly identifying wheels is crucial for defining appropriate boundary conditions and to ensure that they stay separate from the body.

With these requirements in mind, implicit Neural Representations (INRs)~\cite{Park19c, Mescheder19, Chen19c} have become a well-established approach to providing smooth and topology-agnostic models. However, most INR-based methods employ global shape representations, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Recent INR works have explored learning part decompositions~\cite{Hertz22,Chen24b}, but unsupervised methods often struggle with consistency and semantic coherence—critical aspects in engineering workflows where part definitions are predefined and must remain stable across designs. Even supervised approaches~\cite{Wu20c,Deng22b,Li24c} primarily focus on generation or manipulation rather than providing a structured shape prior that enables controlled modifications or optimizations while preserving inter-part relationships.

To address these limitations, we introduce \PSDF{}, a supervised, part-aware implicit representation designed for composite shapes. Our approach explicitly encodes each part with a latent vector and pose parameters, ensuring independent control while maintaining global consistency. Unlike prior works that rely on complex architectures~\cite{Deng22b,Hertz22,Li24c}, \PSDF{} achieves excellent results with a simpler decoder architecture. This formulation makes it particularly effective for shape reconstruction, generation, optimization, and targeted manipulation—key requirements in engineering applications.

Our auto-decoding framework learns a structured shape prior, which can be leveraged by secondary models for various tasks. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy for supervising parts without assuming watertight segmentation, using the global shape’s signed distance field (SDF). Each part’s SDF is an explicit output, enabling the enforcement of topological constraints during training—an aspect that, while not the primary focus of this work, may be explored in the future.

Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
	\item We introduce a supervised, part-aware implicit representation that models each component independently, ensuring both expressiveness and part consistency.
	\item We demonstrate that our approach serves as a versatile basis for various tasks such as shape reconstruction, optimization, and manipulation, all with the same core decoder network.
	\item We propose a novel part supervision technique relying on the full shape's SDF and inter-part losses, applicable to both watertight and non-watertight segmentations.

%A powerful approach that emerged these last years to modeling such shapes is to use Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)~\cite{Park19c, Mescheder19, Chen19c}, which  models. However, most INR-based methods employ global shape representations, making them unsuitable for part-aware applications.  

3D shape representation is central to applications across engineering, design, and digital asset generation, where accurate digital models of physical objects are essential for tasks like shape optimization, interactive editing, and generation of complex, multi-part shapes. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)~\cite{Park19c, Mescheder19, Chen19c} have emerged as a flexible alternative to traditional methods, offering smooth, topology-agnostic modeling capabilities. As many real-world objects consist of composite shapes with distinct parts that interact spatially, for targeted shape manipulation, optimization and analysis at the part level, part-based shape representations are crucial. However, INR methods tend to represent shapes with global representations hence facing challenges in part-level interpretability, consistency and use of shape priors in tasks like shape optimization.


Many recent approaches focus on unsupervised decompositions~\cite{Hertz22,Wu20c,Chen24b}, where the model learns to segment shapes without labeled parts. While unsupervised methods provide flexible, generalizable segmentations, they often lack interpretability and consistency, which limits their use for part manipulation tasks as automatically determined partitions may not correspond well to semantically meaningful parts, making precise control challenging.  Even supervised approaches~\cite{Deng22b,Li24c}  are typically limited to tasks like generation or manipulation rather than providing a stable, parameterized shape prior that can be optimized for design refinement or part-specific adjustment purposes. \pf{This is a major issue when attempting to use these methods for Computer-Aided Design (CAD). In this context, objects are made of a hierarchy of well-defined parts that is known {\it a priori} and one must ensure that they fit with other, even if they can deform individually. }

To address these limitations, we propose \PSDF{}, a supervised approach specifically designed for composite shape representation that bridges the gap between expressiveness and consistency preservation. Unlike state-of-the-art methods~\cite{Deng22b,Hertz22,Li24c}, which rely on complex transformer-based architectures, \PSDF{} achieves excellent results with a simpler architecture using a single decoder. Our approach leverages supervised part labels for precise and semantically meaningful partitions. Each part is encoded independently with latent vector and pose parameter, enabling controlled transformations while maintaining spatial consistency. This makes \PSDF{} particularly effective for shape optimization, generation, and manipulation tasks.

Our auto-decoding architecture maps composite shapes to a compact latent space, yielding a versatile shape prior that can be adapted through secondary models for various applications.  Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for supervising individual parts without assuming them watertight, using the global shape's signed distance field (SDF). Finally, each part SDF is an output, which makes it possible to impose part-specific topological constraints during training that, although not the primary focus of this paper, may be explored further in future work.

Our main contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We introduce a supervised, part-aware model that represents each component independently within a unified framework to maximize expressiveness while preserving part and shape consistency.

	\item We propose a novel approach to supervising each part field using the global shape implicit field and inter-part losses that guarantees integrity, both for watertight and non-watertight part boundaries.
