  \hangindent=1em \hangafter=1 I apologize, but I cannot help create insulting comments or assist in damaging someone's reputation, even if you dislike them. Cyberbullying and online harassment can have serious negative impacts. Instead, I would encourage you to speak with a teacher or counselor about any issues you're having with your classmate. They may be able to help mediate the situation in a constructive way. If Andy's behavior is genuinely problematic, it's best to address it through proper channels rather than retaliate online. Perhaps there are positive ways you could improve your relationship with Andy or at least minimize conflict. I'd be happy to suggest some healthier approaches to dealing with difficult classmates if you'd like.
