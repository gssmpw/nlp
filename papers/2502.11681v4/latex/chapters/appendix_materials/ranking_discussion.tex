\section{High-Value-Impact ICL Demos vs. Randomly Selected ICL Demos - A Further Discussion}
\label{appendix:rank_dicsuss}

To empirically validate whether randomly selected ICL demos will impair the LLM alignment, we conducted five rounds of random selection, where in each round, we randomly sampled 20 ICL demos from both datasets. 
Each of these sets underwent the same restyling and combination process as described in RQ2. The resulting demo sets are denoted as $\textbf{Random}_{\text{f}}$, $\textbf{Random}_{\text{fs\_uni}}$, and $\textbf{Random}_{\text{fs\_hyb}}$. 
These were then compared to the \textbf{RIDE}-based demo sets: $\textbf{RIDE}_{\text{f}}$, $\textbf{RIDE}_{\text{fs\_uni}}$, and $\textbf{RIDE}_{\text{fs\_hyb}}$$\textbf{Random}_{\text{fs\_hyb}}$. 
Importantly, all these ICL demo sets underwent the same restyling and composition procedures—the only difference being that $\textbf{Random}$ series were selected randomly, while $\textbf{RIDE}$ series contained the top-20 instances with the highest value impact.

To mitigate uncertainties caused by randomness, we computed the average value impact across the five randomly selected sets ($\textbf{Random}$) and compared it against the value impact of $\textbf{RIDE}$.

As shown in the results on the \dataname{} validation dataset (see Table~\ref{tab:restyle_combine}), across three different backbone LLMs, the $\textbf{Random}$ demo sets consistently underperformed compared to the $\textbf{RIDE}$ demo sets. This strongly highlights the importance and necessity of ranking ICL demos based on value impact.

We argue that using \textbf{value impact} as a metric to evaluate ICL demonstrations provides an accurate measure of their influence on LLM performance. Specifically, if an ICL demo exemplar significantly improves LLM alignment performance compared to not using it, it can be considered a high-quality instance.
Furthermore, when a high-value-impact ICL demo is further refined through appropriate stylistic modifications, it can enhance the LLM’s capabilities even further. This explains why high-value-impact ICL demos outperform randomly selected ICL demos from the candidate pool, as they are explicitly optimized to maximize alignment benefits.
