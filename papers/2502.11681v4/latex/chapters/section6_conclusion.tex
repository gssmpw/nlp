In this paper, we take the initial step by designing a metric to evaluate the effectiveness of ICL demonstration exemplars—value impact—which we use to analyze the characteristics of ICL demos that effectively enhance LLM alignment capabilities. We categorize these characteristics under the term "style" and, based on this insight, propose a "restyling" method to optimize ICL demos with high value impact.
We conduct experiments across three datasets, and the results demonstrate that our restyling approach effectively stimulates LLMs to generate informative and safe content while also enhancing their capabilities in logical reasoning, numerical computation, and other complex tasks.
