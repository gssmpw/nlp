\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a new class of translationally invariant position encodings (PEs) for Transformers, called STRING. STRING is the most general of all translation-invariant PE methods using matrix multiplications (under weak smoothness assumptions) and contains the prominent class of RoPE methods as its special instantiation. We proposed to apply STRING in robotics for 2D and 3D modeling and provided its extensive empirical verification over a range of tasks, from standard classification and retrieval, through object localization, to diffusion robotic policies conditioned on Vision Transformers. In all these experiments, we showed consistent gains over RoPE, as well as baselines applying regular absolute position encodings.
