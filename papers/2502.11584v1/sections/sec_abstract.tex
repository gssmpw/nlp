%  Runtime Enforcement (RE) is a lightweight method to formally ensure some specified properties on the systems executions. It has attracted more and more interest. Modern systems have real-time requirements - reactive systems. Traditional mechanisms of RE (such as blocking the execution, suppressing or delaying input actions) may not be suitable for such a system. 
% Instead, property enforcement must occur in real-time, allowing the system to continue operating without halting. 

% With this in mind, we propose runtime enforcement of properties defined in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for reactive systems. STL is a powerful temporal language that can effectively specify signal properties in dense time.
% In this work, we aim to construct a runtime enforcer for a given STL formula that takes a signal as input and outputs a minimally modified signal that satisfies the formula.
% To achieve this, the STL formula to be enforced is first translated into a timed transducer, while the signal to be corrected is encoded as a timed word. The enforcer / enforcement algorithm is then applied to ensure the property is enforced onto the signal. We give timed transducers for the temporal operators "until" and "release".
% Our approach enables effective enforcement of STL properties in reactive systems.


% Title: Runtime Enforcement of CPS using Signal Temporal Logic.

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), especially those involving autonomy, need guarantees of their safety. Runtime Enforcement (RE) is a lightweight method to formally ensure that some specified properties are satisfied over the executions of the system.  Hence, there is recent interest in the RE of CPS. However, existing methods are not designed to tackle specifications suitable for the hybrid dynamics of CPS. With this in mind, we develop runtime enforcement of CPS using properties defined in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).
 
In this work, we aim to construct a runtime enforcer for a given STL formula to minimally modify a signal to satisfy the formula. To achieve this, the STL formula to be enforced is first translated into a timed transducer, while the signal to be corrected is encoded as timed words. We provide timed transducers for the temporal operators \emph{until} and \emph{release} noting that other temporal operators can be expressed using these two. Our approach enables effective enforcement of STL properties for CPS. A case study is provided to illustrate the approach and generate empirical evidence of its suitability for CPS.
