\section{Main Results}
\label{sec:results}
We now state the soundness and completeness of the translation of the STL formulas into the transducers.

We propose here the equivalence of the Until and Release operator of STL and its transducer. %A similar proof is done for the Release operator of STL and its transducer.
%\hscomment{The notation we use should be align with that in \cref{sec: Transform STL into TA}. $\varphi_1\until_I\varphi_2$ should be $p_1\until p_2$.}

\begin{proposition}[Equivalence of Until operator of STL and its transducer]    
\label{propo1}
        Let $\signal$ be the signals. Let $\tword$ be its encoded timed word for the given STL formula $p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2$. %Let $\rho$ be the run of $\automaton_{p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2}$ over $\sigma$ from its initial state. 
        Let $\bm{\omega}_{\top}$ be the output timed word for the accepting run over $\tword$, where the output of all transition being $\top$. Then,

        
        %If the encoded timed word is accepted by the transducer of Until operator $\automaton_{p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2}$, and the output of  all the transitions for that accepting run,  is $\top$ then the corresponding signals  $\signal$  satisfy $ p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2$, i.e.,
        %\hscomment{We have not define the notion $\mathcal{L}(\automaton)$. Please refer to \cref{sec:Preliminaries and notations} for the notation of $\bm{\omega} = \llangle\automaton\rrangle(\tword)$ in line 240-244, I defined this notation specifically for writing the proposition.}
        % \begin{align*}
        %     %\sigma \in \mathcal{L}(\automaton_{p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2})  \land \forall \delta \in \rho, \lambda(\delta)=\top \implies \signal \models p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2
        %     \llangle\automaton_{p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2}\rrangle(\tword) \land \forall \delta \in \rho, \lambda(\delta)=\top \implies \signal \models p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2
        % \end{align*}
        % \hscomment{Is this version more clear?}
        % \saucomment{yes. only thing is that: we cant use $SignEncode$ because SignEncode gives timed event at time t and not the entire encoded-word for the $\signal$}
        % \hscomment{okay, this version is more suitable.}
        %Let \(\signal\) be the signal and \(\tword = \textsf{SignEncode}(p_1 \until_I p_2, \signal)\). Let $\bm{\omega}_{\top}$ denote the timed word where the action of all its events is $\top$. Then,
        \[
            \llangle\automaton_{\until}\rrangle(\tword) = \bm{\omega}_{\top} \iff \signal \models p_1 \until_{[t_1, t_2]} p_2
        \]

\begin{proposition}[Equivalence of Release operator of STL and its transducer]   
\label{propo2}
    Let $\signal$ be the signals. Let $\tword$ be its encoded timed word for the given STL formula $p_1\release_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2$. %Let $\rho$ be the run of $\automaton_{p_1\release_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2}$ over $\sigma$ from its initial state. 
    Let $\bm{\omega}_{\top}$ be the output timed word for the accepting run over $\tword$, where the output of all transitions being $\top$. Then,
        
        %If the encoded timed word is accepted by the transducer of Until operator $\automaton_{p_1\release_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2}$, and the output of  all the transitions for that accepting run,  is $\top$ then the corresponding signals  $\signal$  satisfy $ p_1\release_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2$, i.e.,

        \begin{align*}
        \llangle\automaton_{\release}\rrangle(\tword) = \bm{\omega}_{\top} \implies \signal \models p_1 \release_{[t_1, t_2]} p_2
        %\sigma \in \mathcal{L}(\automaton_{p_1\release_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2})  \land \forall \delta \in \rho, \lambda(\delta)=\top \implies \signal \models p_1\until_{[t_1,t_2]}p_2
        \end{align*}
