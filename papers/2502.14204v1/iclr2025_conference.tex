	\begin{abstract}
		With the rapidly expanding landscape of large language models, aligning model generations with human values and preferences is becoming increasingly important. Popular alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, have shown significant success in guiding models with greater control. However, these methods require considerable computational resources, which is inefficient, and substantial collection of training data to accommodate the diverse and pluralistic nature of human preferences, which is impractical. 
		These limitations significantly constrain the scope and efficacy of both task-specific and general preference alignment methods.
		In this work, we introduce \textbf{O}n-the-fly \textbf{P}reference \textbf{A}lignment via Principle-Guided \textbf{D}ecoding (\modelname{}) to directly align model outputs with human preferences during inference, eliminating the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves first curating a surrogate solution to an otherwise infeasible optimization problem and then designing a principle-guided reward function based on this surrogate. The final aligned policy is derived by maximizing this customized reward, which exploits the discrepancy between the constrained policy and its unconstrained counterpart. \modelname{} directly modifies the model's predictions during inference, ensuring principle adherence without incurring the computational overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.
		Experiments show that \modelname{} achieves competitive or superior performance in both general and personalized alignment tasks, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.  \footnote{Code can be found at: https://github.com/stevie1023/OPAD.git.}

	As tremendous strides have been made in the development of large language models (LLMs), it remains challenging to align these models with specific principles, such as ethical guidelines or factual consistency, during generation.
	Popular alignment methods focus primarily on training-time optimization, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)~\citep{ouyang2022training,stiennon2020learning} and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)~\citep{rafailov2023direct}. While these techniques significantly improve the alignment of model outputs, they still face certain limitations~\citep{lin2023unlocking}. RLHF, for instance, is sensitive to hyperparameters and is complex to train~\citep{casper2023open}. DPO, on the other hand, introduces a new parameterization for the RLHF objective that simplifies and stabilizes the training process, but its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the preference pairs used~\citep{pal2024smaug}.
	
	
	
	Despite their effectiveness, these alignment methods can be \textit{inefficient}—requiring substantial computational resources—and \textit{impractical}, given the pluralistic nature of human preferences. User preferences vary widely across different topics~\citep{cheng2023everyone}, making it infeasible to curate data or train multiple models to handle customized or personalized applications in a single training phase. This limitation motivates the development of inference-time algorithms that can achieve efficient and on-the-fly alignment.

Given user query $\mathbf{x}$ and principle $c$, \modelname{} computes a principle-guided reward $r_{\theta}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}_{<t},c)$ leveraging the divergence between the constrained probability distribution and its unconstrained counterpart. This reward quantifies the alignment between the current prediction and the principle $c$, and the final aligned policy $p_{\theta}$ is derived by maximizing this reward.}
		\label{fig:framework}
		\vspace{-1.0em}
	\end{figure*}
	
	Additionally, the \textbf{superficial alignment hypothesis}~\citep{Zhou2023LIMALI} suggests that a model’s knowledge and capabilities are largely acquired during pretraining, while alignment tuning mostly affects its format and style during interactions with users. This hypothesis is further supported by~\citet{lin2023unlocking}, who demonstrated that the \textit{base and aligned LLMs perform almost identically in most positions in terms of ranking tokens during decoding}, with both quantitative and qualitative analyses. 
	
	This observation motivates us to rethink the potential of \textbf{tuning-free alignment} approaches. In-context learning, as an inference-time algorithm, has demonstrated effectiveness in enforcing specific guidelines but still fall short on specification-heavy tasks~\citep{peng2023does} and predicting highly divergent or complex contexts~\citep{kossen2024context}. The Best-of-$N$ approach~\citep{Nakano2021WebGPTBQ} uses a well-trained reward model to select the best response from multiple outputs generated by the model, significantly improving the quality of the final output, albeit at the cost of increased inference time. A more recent and advanced method is Linear Alignment~\citep{Gao2024LinearAA}, which approximates the $Q$-function using a first-order Taylor expansion combined with self-contrastive decoding. This policy directly estimates the gradient of the value function by extracting principle prompts that perturb the output policy. However, because this method relies on a first-order gradient approximation, the principle prompts need to be "subtle" enough to avoid inducing large perturbations, which could lead to poor gradient estimates and suboptimal performance.
	
	Existing tuning-free alignment approaches have shown promise, but they still have limitations. 
	%As this field continues to evolve and attract increasing attention, we aim to contribute to its advancement. 
	Previous works reveal that prompting with guidance can improve task-specific performance, but LLMs often rely on recognizing semantic patterns rather than genuinely understanding the principles embedded in the prompts~\citep{webson2021prompt}. This motivates us to explore a deeper, conceptual-level alignment component that arises from principle-based prompting.
	
	
	In this work, we introduce \textbf{O}n-the-fly \textbf{P}reference \textbf{A}lignment via Principle-Guided \textbf{D}ecoding (\modelname{}), with the overview in Figure~\ref{fig:framework}. \modelname{} identifies the incremental alignment improvements that occur when the model responds to principles, treating this as a residual alignment signal that can be optimized as a reward. Specifically, we conceptualize this residual alignment as the divergence between the model’s behavior when constrained by principles and when left unconstrained.
	Rather than directly tackling the intractable problem of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a constrained policy and the ground truth preference data, we introduce a surrogate objective that maximizes the KL divergence between the constrained policy and its unconstrained counterpart. This approach allows us to translate the residual alignment into a reward function that quantifies the model's adherence to the target principles. The final aligned policy is derived by maximizing this pre-defined reward, yielding a tuning-free solution that adjusts subsequent token predictions to promote adherence to the target principle at each time step $t$. 
	
	
	\modelname{} introduces a complementary adjustment mechanism that refines the presentation and expression of the model’s output, aligning it more closely with the target principles while preserving the model’s core knowledge. This allows for more controlled and principled responses without altering the model's foundational capabilities during inference.
	Experiments demonstrate that \modelname{} achieves competitive or superior alignment on both general alignment tasks (e.g., dialogue and summarization) and personalized alignment tasks (e.g., specific principle-driven tasks) while showing decent performances in other automatic evaluation metrics such as perplexity, diversity, and ROUGE scores. Moreover, we show that \modelname{}-induced policy inherits a larger distribution shift from the base policy compared to traditionally RLHF-aligned models, indicating that \modelname{} is more adept at modulating the model’s behavior to better reflect the target principles.
	
	\section{Related work}
	
	
	\subsection{traditional preference alignment}
	Among the wide range of algorithms proposed for preference alignment~\citep{stiennon2020learning,Yuan2023RRHFRR,rafailov2023direct,zhu2024lire}, the most prominent are perhaps RLHF and DPO. Both methods rely on human feedback to fine-tune model generations and align them with human preferences.
	RLHF follows a three-step process: first, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is applied to the initial model; second, a reward model is trained to reflect human preferences; and finally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)~\citep{schulman2017proximal} are used to optimize the policy based on the reward model.
	DPO simplifies the RLHF process by introducing a new parameterization of the reward model, reducing the problem to a simple classification loss, which makes DPO easier and more stable to train. However, despite these improvements, both RLHF and DPO still require substantial amounts of annotated data and significant computational resources, posing limitations for their practical application, which motives another line of research that focuses on tuning-free alignment.
	\subsection{tuning-free alignment}
Currently, alignment methods are underscoring a shift toward flexible, decoding-time techniques that adapt LLM outputs to diverse human preferences and ethical standards. One popular technique is In-Context Learning (ICL), which adapts models to new information or tasks by using a few instruction-output examples in the prompt. Another powerful inference-time algorithm is Best-of-$N$ (Bo$N$), which involves generating $N$ different samples from the model and selecting the best one, $y^*$, based on a predefined evaluation criterion $S(y_i)$. However, this method is inefficient, as generation must be executed $N$ times, prompting the search for more efficient inference-time approaches.

Recently, we have also seen the emergence of more advanced methods. \citet{lin2023unlocking} discovered that token distribution shifts between aligned and unaligned policies diminish over time during decoding. \citet{li2023rain} introduced a self-evaluation and rewind mechanism that directly aligns base LLMs with human preferences via self-boosting. \citet{huang2024deal} proposed DeAL, a framework that enables decoding-time alignment through a heuristic-guided search process and leverages programmatic constraints as well as abstract objectives to achieve alignment. \citep{shi2024decoding} introduced Multi-Objective Decoding, a method that combines predictions from multiple base models to achieve adaptable alignment during decoding.  DARWIN~\citep{hung2024reward} proposes to strike the balance between exploration and exploitation of rewards during decoding with evolutionary heuristics. Additionally, \citet{zhu2024personality} focused on alignment with personal traits and developed an activation intervention optimization method to align with individual behavioral preferences. Lately, Linear Alignment (LA)~\citep{Gao2024LinearAA} was proposed as a method for aligning language models with human preferences in a single inference step. This approach relies on a novel parameterization for policy optimization under divergence constraints and estimates the preference direction using self-contrastive decoding.
	Despite the significant progress and achievements made, there are still many gaps to be filled in this field. Therefore, in this work, we propose \modelname{} to further
	improve the efficiency of inference-time alignment.
	
	\section{Methodology}
	
	Before delving into this section, it is essential to highlight two \textbf{foundational} tenets underlying the proposed method.  \textit{1. The model itself already preserves enough knowledge or capability to answer the request. 2. Even with instructions to follow certain principles, the model can only partially comply with or even still fails the request.} Otherwise, training is ultimately needed to encode necessary knowledge.
	
	\subsection{Problem Formulation}
	We begin by specifying the notations and formally framing the problem. Given a query $\mathbf{x}$ and principle $c$, the simplest approach is to directly prompt the model to generate under the guidance of principle  $c$.
	For an autoregressive language model, token prediction probabilities conditioned on input $\mathbf{x}$ and principle $c$ are denoted as $\mathbf{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c) \in \mathbb{R}^{L\times V}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $V$ the vocabulary size. The probability of generating a sentence $\mathbf{y}$ with $T$ tokens takes the following form:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{pi-theta}
		\pi_{\mathbf{\theta}}(\mathbf{y}| \mathbf{x},c) = \prod_{t=1}^{T}\mathbf{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t}).
	\end{equation}
	However, the model often struggles to align with principle $c$ through direct prompting alone. Therefore, the core objective of this work is to devise a strategy for dynamically modifying next-token predictions during inference, thereby enforcing adherence to the principle. 
	
	
	\subsection{Principle-Aligned Divergence Reward} 
	RLHF for preference alignment typically begins by formulating an optimization problem that maximizes rewards, which reflect the quality of model outputs during training. However, since our approach focuses solely on inference time, we must reconceptualize the original optimization problem and adapt it into a form that can be addressed within this context. Please note that in the following section, we use \textit{principles} and \textit{constraints} interchangeably.
	
	\begin{prop} Suppose we have a target principle $c$, maximizing the KL divergence between the constrained policy ${\cal P}_c$ and the unconstrained policy ${\cal P}$ serves as a surrogate for minimizing the KL divergence between the true data distribution ${\cal P}_{\textrm{data}}$ and ${\cal P}_c$:
		\begin{equation}
			{\cal P}_{\mathrm{opt}}=\arg\operatorname*{max}_{{\cal P}_{c}}D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c||{\cal P}),
			\label{eq:original_opt}
		\end{equation}
		under the following conditions:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The unconstrained policy ${\cal P}$ is a poor approximation of the true preference data distribution ${\cal P}_{\textrm{data}}$;% that is $D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} || {\cal P}_c)$ is large.
			\item The constraint $c$ aligns well with the data distribution ${\cal P}_{\textrm{data}}$;% policies satisfying $c$ are closer to ${\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}}$.
			\item The unconstrained policy ${\cal P}$ has broader support than the constrained policy ${\cal P}_c$. %specifically, $\supp({\cal P}_c) \subseteq \supp({\cal P})$.
		\end{enumerate}	
		\label{prop:cond}
	\end{prop}
	
	\proofsketch
	Our objective is to minimize the KL divergence \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} || {\cal P}_c) \), thereby aligning the constrained policy \( {\cal P}_c \) with the true data distribution \( {\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \). Direct optimization is infeasible since we have no access to the training data. Instead, we propose maximizing the KL divergence \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c || {\cal P}) \) under the given conditions. Please find a more detailed proof in Appendix~\ref{app:proof}.
	
	
	By maximizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c || {\cal P}) \) under these conditions, we indirectly promote policies that respect the principles encoded in $c$ and ensure that $\mathcal{P}_c$ is distinct from a potentially suboptimal $\mathcal{P}$. 

    	Next, we write the KL term between ${\cal P}_c$ and ${\cal P}$ as the expectation of the log ratio between model predictions over the constrained distribution in $T$ time steps:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			D_{\mathrm{KL}}( \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c) \,\|\, \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}) ) &= \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c)} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t})} \right] \\
			&= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c)} \left[ \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t})} \right].
			\label{eq:kl_expanded}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	Inspired by this reformulation, we design a reward function that captures the residual alignment component by comparing the constrained and unconstrained predictions through KL divergence.

	
	\textbf{Reward design via sequential divergence.} 
	Formally, we define the reward as:
	\begin{equation}
		r_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}_{<t},c) = \sum_{t'=t-1}^{t}\log\frac{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t'}|\mathbf{x},c,\mathbf{ y}_{<t'})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t'}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}_{<t'})}.
		\label{eq:reward_design}
	\end{equation}


	Our motivation is that sequential models exhibit dependencies across time steps, and including both \( t-1 \) and \( t \) in the reward function captures the contributions of consecutive time steps, while still concentrating on the current decoding step. 
	This helps comprehend temporal dynamics and propagate divergence, aligning the per-step reward with the sequence-level KL divergence. 
	
	\textbf{Difference in reward mechanism.} In traditional RLHF, the reward function serves to quantize the quality of model responses based on human feedback, often guiding long-term policy updates through reinforcement learning. However, in our approach, the reward design plays a \textbf{different} role: rather than quantifying sequences, it is designed to modulate token-wise model predictions, which can be perceived as a token-level assessment of the adherence to the guiding principle at each step of token generation. 
	
	
	\subsection{Principle-guided inference-time alignment}
	\textbf{Deriving the optimal solution via reward maximization.} Next we denote the final principle-guided policy as $p_{\theta}$ and consider the following optimization problem:
	\begin{equation}
		\max_{p_{\theta}} \; \mathbb{E}_{p_{\theta}} \left[ r_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t},c) \right] - \beta D_{\mathrm{KL}}( p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c) \,\|\, \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c) ),
		\label{eq:optimization_problem}
	\end{equation}
	where \( \beta \) is a hyperparameter balancing the reward and the divergence from the base policy \( \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}, c) \).
	The solution to this optimization at time step \(t\) yields (please find derivation in Appendix~\ref{app:derivation}):
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t}) = \frac{1}{Z(\mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t})} \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t}) \exp\left( \frac{1}{\beta} r_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t},c) \right),
		\label{eq:adjusted_policy_step}
	\end{equation}
	where $Z(\mathbf{x},c,\mathbf{y}_{<t})= \sum_{\mathbf{y}'_t}\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}'_{t}|\mathbf{x},c,\mathbf{y}'_{<t})\exp(\frac{1}{\beta}{r_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}'_{<t},c) })$ is the partition function. It is important to note that the reward function in Equation~\ref{eq:adjusted_policy_step} operates entirely within the probability space, so the partition function computation does not require explicit decoding of tokens or summing over all sequences, which makes it tractable.

\textbf{Decoding overview of \modelname{}}. The decoding process of \modelname{} is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:framework} and detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo}. Given a query $\mathbf{x}$, a base policy $\pi_{\theta}$, and a target principle $c$, \modelname{} guides the generation of a final output that aligns with the target principle $c$ in a token-by-token manner. At each step, the decoded token $\mathbf{y}_t$ updates the current context, ensuring that subsequent token predictions are influenced by both the base policy and the guiding principle.

\section{Experiments}
	\subsection{Experimental settings}
	\noindent{\textbf{Datasets.}}
	To comprehensively evaluate the effect of the proposed \modelname{}, we focus on \textit{general} alignment and \textit{personalized} alignment tasks. For general alignment, we use two widely employed datasets in RLHF study: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf}{\textbf{HH-RLHF}}, a human-labeled preference
	 dataset on helpfulness and harmlessness from \citet{bai2022training} and \href{https://github.com/openai/summarize-from-feedback}{\textbf{Summarization}} dataset from~\citet{stiennon2020learning}.  For personalized alignment, we leverage the \href{https://github.com/Linear95/DSP}{Domain-Specific Preference (\textbf{DSP})} dataset~\citep{cheng2023everyone}, which is composed of domain-specific preferences from the four typical domains: Academy, Business, Entertainment, and Literature, and the \href{https://github.com/joeljang/RLPHF}{\textbf{P-soups}} dataset from PERSONALIZED SOUPS~\citet{jang2023personalized}. Please find more information in Appendix~\ref{app:principles}.
	
	\noindent{\textbf{Baselines.}}
	We follow~\citet{Gao2024LinearAA} and use two base models \href{https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5}{Vicuna-7b-v1.5} and \href{https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1}{Mistral-7b-instruct} since that they are instruction-tuned to better follow instructions. In addition, we select the following baseline methods for comparison:\\
	\noindent{\textit{Direct Prompting (DP)}}: We prompt the model with queries and without any principles: $p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}).$ \\
	\noindent{\textit{Principle Prompting (PP)}}: This baseline directly feeds the principle into the prompt:
	$p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},c).$ \\
	\noindent{\textit{In-context Learning (ICL)}}: This baseline approach involves utilizing a set of few-shot examples to instruct the model to generate better responses:
	$p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},\{\mathbf{x_1},\mathbf{y_1}\},\{\mathbf{x_2},\mathbf{y_2}\},\cdots).$\\
	\noindent{\textit{Best-of-$N$ Sampling (Bo$N$)}}: It involves generating $N$ different samples from the model and selecting the best one $y^*$ based on a predefined evaluation criterion $S(y_i)$ (e.g., a well-trained reward model): 
	$y^* = \arg\max_{y_i \in \{y_1, y_2, \dots, y_N\}} S(y_i).
	$\\
	\noindent{\textit{Self-Contrastive Decoding (Self-CD)}~\citep{shi2024navigating}}:  We modify the  original self-CD to extract the "attention" by \textit{amplifying} the difference in the model’s output distributions when responding to target principles, then exaggerate the "attention" from the model via contrastive decoding:
	$p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},c) + \alpha \cdot (p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},c) - p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})).$\\
	\noindent{\textit{Linear alignment (LA)}~\citep{Gao2024LinearAA}}: Linear alignment provides a closed-form solution to policy optimization leveraging the one-order Taylor expansion. It also leverages self-CD to produce the corresponding gradient direction to the preference principle:\\
	$\mu^{*} = \mu_{\beta} + \left(\frac{\phi(\mu_\beta)}{\delta - \log \mathcal{Z}(\mu_\beta)}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\left(\frac{\left[\nabla_{\mu} Q(s,\mu \mid \tau)\right]_{\mu_{\beta}}}{\Vert\left[\nabla_{\mu} Q(s,\mu \mid \tau)\right]_{ \mu_{\beta}}\Vert_2}\right)^{\frac{1}{p-1}}.$\\
	\noindent{\textit{PPO}}: We optimize the policy with the base model as the starting point and a reward model to provide guidance during RL training:
	$			\max_{\pi_{\theta}}  \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mathcal{D}, y\sim \pi_{\theta}(y | x)}\bigl[r_{\phi}(x, y)\bigr] - \beta D_{\textrm{KL}}\bigl[\pi_{\theta}(y | x)\mid \mid \pi_\textrm{ref}(y |x)\bigr].$
	\noindent{\textit{DPO}}: We leverage the pairwise training data to optimize the base model for the corresponding task:\\
	$			\mathcal{L}_\text{DPO}(\pi_{\theta}; \pi_\textrm{ref}) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_c, y_r)\sim \mathcal{D}} \left[\log \sigma \left(\beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y_w | x)}{\pi_{\textrm{ref}}(y_w | x)} - \beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y_l | x)}{\pi_\textrm{ref}(y_l | x)}\right)\right].$
	
\noindent{\textbf{Principle curation}. In our contexts, we refer principles as clear and descriptive guidelines that encapsulates the underlying preference or desired behavior. In the experiments, we curate principles using task-specific heuristics. For general alignment tasks (e.g., helpfulness and harmlessness), we define the principle $c$ to clearly communicate universal preferences, helping the model understand these concepts. For personal preference alignment tasks, the principle 
		$c$ directly instructs the model to act in a desired way (e.g., "Please behave as if you are an experienced researcher"). The specific principles for each task are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:principles}. }
		

	\noindent{\textbf{Experimental details}}. We set $\beta$ to 1.0 for general alignment tasks and 2.0 for personalized alignment datasets. We apply greedy decoding to generate the responses and evaluate the performance by directly comparing the \modelname{} and baseline methods using GPT4-Turbo, with the evaluation prompts for each task in Appendix~\ref{app:prompts}. For Bo$N$, we set $N$ to 16. For  ICL, we use 5 shots. We randomly sample 400 samples for each dataset during evaluation.

	\noindent{\textbf{Performance analysis on general alignment}.} 
	Both base models (Vicuna-7B-v1.5 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) are fined-tuned on instruction datasets that involve user interactions, and the model's ability to follow instructions inherently leads to better alignment with general preferences such as helpfulness and safety~\citep{Jiang2023Mistral7, Zheng2023JudgingLW}, suggesting that the unconstrained distribution ${\cal P}$ is not necessary a poor approximation of the ground truth data (condition 2 in Proposition~\ref{prop:cond}).
	However, we can carefully curate the principle $c$ to better illustrate what this universal preference (such as in common dialog and summarization tasks) means, thus granting the model a better understanding of these universal principles. This makes \modelname{} stand out compared to most of the baselines. Please find more case studies in Appendix~\ref{app:case study}.
	Notably, the performance of Bo$N$ is heavily dependent on the quality of the reward model. In our experiments, we use the \href{https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2}{DeBERTa-large} reward model, which has been thoroughly trained on data sample pairs from both HH-RLHF and Summarization tasks, leading to its strong performance.

	We calculate Perplexity (PPL) using GPT-2 as an oracle model to assess the fluency and coherency in the dialogue task and ROUGE score to evaluate the resemblance to human-written summaries with Mistral as the base model. Additionally, we report the Distinct-1 and Distinct-2 metrics to measure the diversity of the model's generations.
	Table~\ref{tab:metrics} shows that when it comes to PPL, \modelname{} achieves a better balance between fluency and diversity compared to most baseline methods.
	In terms of summarization, DPO stands out with the best ROUGE score, indicating the greatest content overlap with human-written summaries. This is expected since DPO is trained on pairwise human-labeled samples. 
	
	
	\subsection{Personalized alignment results}
	
	\textbf{\modelname{} effectively handles out-of-distribution tasks in personalized alignment.} When the unconstrained policy ${\cal P}$ is trained on generic, domain-agnostic data, it may poorly approximate the real data distribution ${\cal P}$ especially if the latter belongs to a specific domain or personalized preference.
	In contrast to general alignment, where universal preferences are implicitly incorporated during the instruction-tuning phase, personalized alignment tasks better showcase the flexibility and efficiency of \modelname{} in catering to user-specific requests. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:personalized}, \modelname{} consistently outperforms baseline methods across various models and tasks. Notably, unlike the comparable performance with LA on the HH-RLHF dataset, \modelname{} achieves superior results. Two possible reasons contribute to this advantage: (1) the out-of-distribution principle prompts may lead to less accurate gradient estimation for LA, and (2) the poor approximation of  ${\cal P}$ to ${\cal P}_\textrm{data}$ is more effective in boosting \modelname{}'s capabilities. Please find some representative samples in Appendix~\ref{app:case study}.

 (Table~\ref{tab:hh_rlhf_results}). The trends are further illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:trend}. Notably, \textit{\textbf{\modelname{} is most effective on mid-scale models that possess sufficient domain knowledge but struggle to perfectly follow instructions}}. By reinforcing principles during decoding, \modelname{} enhances alignment. In practice, 7B and 13B models are widely used for their balance of capability and efficiency, and \modelname{} enables them to better meet task-specific demands without fine-tuning. Larger models, while inherently better at following instructions, exhibit diminished marginal benefits from \modelname{}, 		
as their outputs are already well-aligned. Conversely, smaller models often lack the foundational ability or knowledge to respond appropriately to user queries, highlighting the need for fine-tuning to effectively boost performance.

\textbf{Can \modelname{} enhance alignment on already RLHF-aligned models?}
	Next, we assess whether \modelname{} offers additional benefits for models extensively aligned using RLHF techniques. Specifically, we evaluate Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, all of which have undergone RLHF to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety. From Table~\ref{tab:llama_hh}, RLHF-aligned models demonstrate strong baseline performance, particularly on general helpfulness and safety tasks. Notably, RLHF-aligned models continue to struggle with tasks requiring strict principle adherence or fine-grained personalization, exposing substantial alignment gaps. \modelname{} bridges these gaps by reinforcing principles during inference, and this highlights the versatility of \modelname{} in enhancing alignment even for models that are already extensively aligned with RLHF techniques.

		Please note that to mitigate the evaluation costs, for Table \ref{tab:hh_rlhf_results} and ~\ref{tab:llama_hh} we use the powerful Llama3-70B-Instruct model as a judge, which exhibits very high human agreement as demonstrated in~\citet{alpaca_eval}, only slightly lower compared to GPT-4-Turbo but with substantially lower costs. 


	\noindent{\textbf{\modelname{}-aligned policy exhibits more pronounced distribution shift than RLHF.}} 
	We plot the token-wise KL divergence between the probability distributions of \modelname{}, RLHF (PPO), and the base Mistral model. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:token-kl}, RLHF-aligned models closely mirror the base model across most token positions, reflecting minimal adjustments in token probabilities. In contrast, \modelname{} induces significantly higher divergence, particularly during early decoding, demonstrating its ability to reshape token distributions to align with target principles. This highlights \modelname{}'s effectiveness in addressing alignment gaps that RLHF methods may overlook~\citep{lin2023unlocking}.

	\textbf{Finer control via reward scaling.} 
	The hyperparameter $\beta$ controls the degree of alignment with the target principles. 
	A larger $\beta$ diminishes the impact of the reward, causing the modified distribution $p_{\theta}$ to closely resemble the base model. Conversely, a smaller $\beta$ amplifies the effect of the reward,  increasing the deviation from the base model's predictions, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:diff_beta}. The corresponding alignment metric is reported in Table~\ref{tab:diff_beta}, which suggests a smaller $\beta$ value may deteriorate the performance. We also observe that the reward distribution in personalized alignment tasks (DSP) is broader and more deviated from zero compared to general alignment tasks. This suggests that the personalized principles lead to a larger distribution shift in the model's predictions compared to general principles, which exhibit less variability in its outcomes. (Please refer to Appendix~\ref{app:more_beta} for more analysis).

	We assess the time efficiency in Table~\ref{tab:efficiency}.

Since the reward function necessitates both constrained and unconstrained predictions, each token requires two forward passes, resulting in approximately double the time consumption compared to standard inference. 
	
	
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	In this work, we propose \modelname{}, a simple yet effective framework for aligning model outputs with target principles during inference, without fine-tuning.Leveraging a principle-guided reward mechanism and maximizing this reward under KL divergence constraints, our approach enables on-the-fly adjustments to the model’s predictions.

	\noindent{\textbf{Limitations and future work}}: While \modelname{} demonstrates promising results, several limitations remain. First, the current reward design relies heavily on KL divergence, which may fail to capture the nuances of alignment when the constrained and unconstrained policy has few overlaps. Moreover, \modelname{}’s strict adherence to principles may sometimes lead to overfitting, resulting in formulaic or rigid outputs. Balancing principle adherence with creativity and flexibility in ambiguous contexts remains an open challenge that future work should address.
	
	
	\section{Ethics Statement}
	With the increasing capabilities of LLMs, the risks of generating untruthful, biased, or harmful content are also amplified, which could result in significant negative impacts. To mitigate these risks and ensure that model outputs align with human values and intentions, it is essential to develop robust techniques that promote ethical behavior in AI systems. Extensive research has been dedicated to designing ethical frameworks, addressing various aspects from data collection and algorithm design to model deployment and application. We hope that our contribution in this area helps to make LLMs more secure, transparent, and aligned with human interests, ensuring safer and more controllable interactions.

	\section{Relation with the residual EBMs}
		Residual energy-based models (EBMs)~\citep{parshakova2019global,deng2020residual} combine globally normalized EBMs with more tractable, locally normalized autoregressive language models. In essence, they refine a base distribution using an energy-based adjustment, which typically captures dependencies not accounted for by the base model alone. The general form of a residual EBM is:

				%{align}
				P(\mathbf{y}| \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{Z(\mathbf{x})}P_{\text{LM}}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})\exp(-E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})),
				%\end{align}
				\label{eq:residual_ebm}
			\end{equation}%
		where $Z(\mathbf{x})$ is the partition function. 
		It is straightforward to see that the probability distribution induced by \modelname{} relates mathematically to a residual EBM, 
		by expressing the reward function as a negative energy term. The key differences lie in the following aspects. 
		
		In residual EBMs, the energy term is trained over the entire sequence, introducing \textit{global} normalization. One advantage of global normalization is its ability to mitigate exposure bias~\citep{ranzato2015sequence}, which arises due to discrepancies between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. 
		However, global normalization involves summing over all possible sequences $\mathbf{y}$, which makes the partition function in Equation~\ref{eq:residual_ebm} intractable. Therefore, during inference, sampling-based techniques~\citep{grover2019bias,shapiro2003monte} are typically employed to first sample from the base model and then re-weight or correct the samples using the energy function.
		
		In contrast, \modelname{} operates purely as an inference-time algorithm and generates tokens in an autoregressive manner. This obviates the need to address exposure bias through global normalization, as \modelname{} inherently aligns token generation with the desired principles without relying on teacher forcing. Here, the negative energy term—the reward function—acts as a token-level adjustment factor. This design allows for efficient computation of the partition function in Equation~\ref{eq:adjusted_policy_step}, enabling a \textit{local} normalization process that is both computationally tractable and straightforward to implement.
		
		The resemblance of \modelname{} to residual EBMs endows it with the ability to leverage the strengths of the base distribution while introducing additional flexibility through the residual energy. Specifically, while residual EBMs typically involve global adjustments based on the entire energy function, \modelname{} implements token-by-token updates during inference, allowing dynamic and fine-grained policy adjustments.
		
	
	
	\section{Detailed proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:cond}}
	\label{app:proof}
	
	\proof
	We want to prove that maximizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c \,\|\, {\cal P}) \) serves as a surrogate for minimizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \,\|\, {\cal P}_c) \). 
	Firstly, since the unconstrained policy \( {\cal P} \) poorly approximates \( {\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}_c} \) (Condition 1), the divergence between them is significant.
	Secondly, because the constraint \( c \) aligns well with \( {\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \) (Condition 2), adhering to \( c \) inherently guides \( {\cal P}_c \) closer to \( {\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \).
	$\supp({\cal P}_c) \subseteq \supp({\cal P})$ (Condition 3) suggests maximizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c || {\cal P}) \) allows \( {\cal P}_c \) to concentrate on regions where \( {\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \) is significant, effectively filtering out less relevant areas of \( {\cal P} \)'s support. This condition also ensures that $D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c||{\cal P})$ is well-defined and valid, ensuring that the surrogate optimization problem is both feasible and meaningful.
	Therefore, maximizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_c \,\|\, {\cal P}) \) serves as a surrogate for minimizing \( D_{\mathrm{KL}}({\cal P}_{\mathrm{data}} \,\|\, {\cal P}_c) \). 
	
	\section{Solving the KL-constrained optimization}
	\label{app:derivation}
	In this section, we derive the optimal solution to the KL-constrained optimization problem in Equation~\ref{eq:optimization_problem}. 
	We aim to solve the following optimization problem:
	\begin{equation}
		\max_{p_{\theta}} \mathbb{E}_{p_{\theta}}\bigl[r(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t},c)\bigr] - \beta D_{\textrm{KL}}(p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},c) \parallel \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},c)),
	\end{equation}
	where \( \pi_{\theta} \) is the base policy, \( p_{\theta} \) is the policy to be optimized, and \( \beta \) is a positive scalar balancing the reward and the KL divergence.
	
	Assuming \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( c \) are given and fixed, the objective function can be expressed as:
	\begin{equation}
		\max_{p_{\theta}} \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c) \cdot r(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t}, c) - \beta \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c) \log \left( \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c)}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c)} \right).
	\end{equation}
	To ensure that \( p_{\theta} \) is a valid probability distribution (i.e., \( \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c) = 1 \)), we introduce a Lagrange multiplier \( \lambda \). For simplicity we omit $\mathbf{x}$ and $c$ in the expression. The Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \) thus becomes:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L} = \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \cdot r(\mathbf{y}) - \beta \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \log \left( \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} \right) + \lambda \left( 1 - \sum_{\mathbf{y}} p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \right).
	\end{equation}
	To find the optimal \( p_{\theta} \), take the derivative of \( \mathcal{L} \) with respect to \( p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \) and set it to zero:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} = r(\mathbf{y}) - \beta \left( 1 + \log \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} \right) - \lambda &= 0 \\
			\Rightarrow \quad r(\mathbf{y}) - \beta - \beta \log \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} - \lambda &= 0 \\
			\Rightarrow \quad \log \frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} &= \frac{r(\mathbf{y}) - \beta - \lambda}{\beta}.
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	Next we exponent both sides to solve for \( p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \):
	\begin{align}
		\frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})}{\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} &= \exp\left( \frac{r(\mathbf{y}) - \beta - \lambda}{\beta} \right) \\
		&= \exp\left( \frac{r(\mathbf{y})}{\beta} - 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\beta} \right).
	\end{align}
	Factor out the terms that do not depend on \(\mathbf{y}\) and recall the property of a probability distribution:
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{\mathbf{y}}	p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})= \left[\exp\left(-1-{\frac{\lambda}{\beta}}\right)\right]\sum_{\mathbf{y}}\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \exp\left({\frac{r(\mathbf{y})}{\beta}}\right)=1.
	\end{equation}
	
	Next we introduce the partition function \( Z \) to simplify the notation:
	\begin{equation}
		Z = \sum_{\mathbf{y}} \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \exp\left( \frac{r(\mathbf{y})}{\beta} \right).
	\end{equation}
	Thus, the optimal \( p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \) is:
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{Z}\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}) \exp\left( \frac{r(\mathbf{y})}{\beta} \right).
	\end{equation}
	Substituting back the \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(c\):
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c) =\frac{1}{Z(\mathbf{x},c)} \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, c) \exp\left( \frac{r(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, c)}{\beta} \right).
	\end{equation}
	Since we are working on an inference-time algorithm, the final policy is updated on a token basis. Specifically, at time step \(t\), the optimal solution is:
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t}) = \frac{1}{Z(\mathbf{x}, c,\mathbf{y}_{<t})} \pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}_{t} | \mathbf{x}, c, \mathbf{y}_{<t}) \exp\left( \frac{1}{\beta} r_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{<t},c) \right).
	\end{equation}

\section{Aggregating over multiple time steps in reward design}
In this section, we conduct an empirical analysis by varying the number of time steps in the reward function (Equation~\ref{eq:reward_design}).
In sequential generation tasks, the influence of earlier tokens on the current step often diminishes over time, and appropriate weighting is required to accurately reflect the varying levels of importance in achieving global alignment. Based on this assumption, we introduced a discount factor, specifically choosing a discount value of 0.6, and aggregated the reward over 4 time steps. As evidenced by the win-lose ratio against PP in Table~\ref{tab:time_step}, aggregating over more time steps did not provide additional alignment benefits while incurring higher computational costs compared to a simple two-step design.

The reason may be that the nature of language modelling means that prior information is already incorporated when decoding the current token, strictly enforcing a global adjustment can result in a coarse-grained alignment that is not as precise as a 2-token adjustment. Using two tokens is sufficient for effective modeling and demonstrates transferable characteristics across different tasks with less computational cost. Based on this consideration, we chose the two-token design.

	
	\section{Effect of different $\beta$ values on different tasks}
	\label{app:more_beta}
	In Section~\ref{sec:further_analysis}, we explore how the policy and reward landscapes evolve as $\beta$ changes in the DSP dataset. Here, we extend this analysis to a general alignment task by applying the same methodology to the HH-RLHF dataset. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hh_beta}, the scaled reward distribution in the general alignment dataset appears narrower and steeper compared to the personalized alignment dataset. This results in less deviation for the aligned model with the same $\beta$ value. Moreover, the reward distribution is more zero-centered, indicating that the model has more consistent predictions with and without principles, exhibiting lower variability when predicting HH-related values.
	\begin{figure*}[htbp]

			DP&That's a common stereotype, but it's not true.  Not all Irish people drink a lot.  Some do, but some don't.  It's like with any other group of people. It's important to remember that stereotypes are just that they're not always true.  They're based on generalizations and can be harmful.  It's better to get to know people as individuals and not make assumptions about them based on where they're from or what they do.\\

			PP  & It is a common stereotype that Irish people are alcoholics.  However, this is not necessarily true.  Like any other group of people, the Irish have a diverse range of attitudes towards alcohol.  Some Irish people do struggle with alcohol addiction, but many others drink responsibly and in moderation. It is important to remember that alcohol addiction is a complex issue that can affect people from all backgrounds and cultures.  Blaming an entire group of people for a common problem is not fair or accurate. If you or someone you know is struggling with alcohol addiction, it is important to seek help.  There are many resources available, such as support groups and treatment centers, that can assist in overcoming this challenge.\\
			\hline
			Self-CD&Excessive alcohol consumption and alcoholism are prevalent issues worldwide, including among individuals of Irish descent. Like many other cultures, alcohol has been a part of Irish society and traditions for centuries. Background information: Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder, is a chronic disease characterized by an inability to control alcohol consumption. Factors contributing to alcoholism include genetic, environmental, and cultural influences. Historically, alcohol has played a significant role in many societies, often serving as a means of celebration, socialization, and cultural bonding. Unfortunately, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to various negative consequences, including health problems, family conflicts, and increased risk of accidents and injuries. If you have concerns about alcoholism or its impact on individuals or communities, it's important to approach the topic with sensitivity and provide support where needed. Encouraging healthy lifestyle choices and seeking professional help when necessary can help individuals and families overcome the challenges posed by alcohol-related issues.\\
			\hline
			LA&It is a common misconception that Irish people are alcoholics.  While it is true that Ireland has a high rate of alcohol consumption, this does not necessarily mean that all Irish people are alcoholics.  In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Ireland has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the world, but it also has one of the lowest rates of alcohol-related harm. It is important to note that alcohol consumption can be dangerous if it leads to addiction or if it causes harm to one's health or relationships. It is also worth mentioning that alcohol consumption should be done in moderation, as excessive drinking can lead to a variety of health problems. It is also worth mentioning that, like in any other country, there are people in Ireland who struggle with alcohol addiction, and there are resources available to help them, such as support groups and rehabilitation centers.

It's essential to approach discussions about alcohol use and addiction with sensitivity and avoid perpetuating negative stereotypes or stigmatizing individuals who struggle with these issues. If you or someone you know is facing challenges with alcohol use, it's important to seek support and resources from trusted sources, such as healthcare professionals or support groups. In addition to background information on alcohol use and addiction, it's also important to consider the cultural and societal factors that may influence alcohol consumption patterns. For instance, social events and traditions, availability and affordability of alcohol, and individual personal beliefs and attitudes towards alcohol can all play a role in shaping an individual's relationship with alcohol. It's crucial to approach discussions about alcohol use and addiction with empathy, understanding, and a commitment to providing accurate and helpful information. \\

				DP&Rock-paper-scissors is a game of chance and strategy that is played around the world. It is also known as "rock-paper-scissors-stone" in some countries. The game is played by two players, who each choose one of the three symbols: rock, paper, or scissors. The symbols are often represented by hand gestures. The game is played in a series of rounds, with each player taking turns to choose a symbol and make a gesture. The symbols are then compared, and the one that "wins" depends on the other player's symbol. For example, if one player chooses rock and the other player chooses paper, the result is a tie. If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses rock, the scissors player wins. If both players choose the same symbol, the result is also a tie. The game is often used as a way to decide between two options, such as who will go first in a game or who will choose a particular activity. It is also used in some cultures as a way to settle disputes or make decisions in a fair and impartial way. Rock-paper-scissors is a simple game that can be played anywhere, and it is a popular game among children and adults alike. It is a fun and easy way to pass the time, and it can also be used as a tool for teaching children about probability and decision-making.\\
