\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduced Mordal, an automated pretrained model selection framework designed to address the challenges of efficiently identifying the best vision-language model (VLM) for a given downstream task. Mordal reduces the complexity of candidate selection by minimizing both the number of VLM candidates and the evaluation time for each candidate. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Mordal achieves 8.9$\times$-11.6$\times$ reduction in search time compared to traditional grid search while achieving robust and near-optimal results.

% Our findings highlight the importance of systematic and automated approaches to pretrained model selection, paving the way for more accessible and resource-efficient deployment of multimodal AI systems across diverse applications.
