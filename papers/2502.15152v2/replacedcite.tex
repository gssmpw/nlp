\subsection{Pseudo-Labeling}
Pseudo-labeling is a key component in self-training for semi-supervised learning (SSL), where model predictions on unlabeled data become pseudo-labels for subsequent training____. Although effective, it is vulnerable to error propagation, where inaccurate pseudo-labels aggravate model biases and reduce performance____. To address this, teacher-student frameworks stabilize pseudo-labeling using an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student’s weights____. Methods such as____ refine the teacher iteratively, while____ reuses earlier teacher predictions to mitigate confirmation bias.

We address these issues by introducing a dynamic thresholding mechanism that adjusts to the model’s evolving confidence during training. Unlike____ and____, which use static thresholds, our adaptive threshold improves label quality by filtering low-confidence predictions as the model learns. Fixed thresholds may discard useful uncertain labels or allow noise to propagate. Additionally, our confidence decay strategy gradually reduces the effect of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling initial exploration and later focusing on reliable regions.

\subsection{Consistency Regularization}
Consistency regularization ensures predictions remain stable under input perturbations. Early methods like Temporal Ensembling____ and VAT____ promote this by comparing predictions on augmented inputs. Extensions such as T-VAT____ use adversarial perturbations in a teacher-student setup, while____ uses two student networks to refine pseudo-labels through feedback.

These methods often rely on complex augmentations or adversarial training, increasing computational cost. In contrast, we avoid explicit consistency loss. Instead, our confidence-weighting and decay, we inherently dampen the impact of unstable predictions and achieve similar robustness without adversarial training or augmentation-heavy designs.

\subsection{Boundary Refined Semantic Segmentation}
Boundary precision is a known weakness in semantic segmentation, especially under limited supervision. In weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), boundary-aware methods such as____ ____ refine coarse Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using spatial priors but often miss fine boundary details due to reliance on image-level labels, limiting their use in SSSS.

In SSSS, boundary-aware methods remain underexplored. The distinction between boundary refinement in WSSS and SSSS is significant. In WSSS, boundaries are inferred from global image-level cues, whereas SSSS requires refining noisy, pixel-level pseudo-labels that already carry structural uncertainty. This makes boundary refinement in SSSS more challenging, and addressing it requires methods like ours that explicitly target spatial inconsistencies in dense predictions. ____ learning class prototypes near edges by clustering features, which improves precision but introduces additional complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity.

We propose a simpler, more efficient alternative: Sobel-based boundary detection integrated into the loss function. Sobel filters ____ are fast, interpretable, and differentiable enough for training compared to other edge detectors like Canny. They offer a non-learned yet effective method to identify edges, especially valuable when pseudo-label quality is still evolving. We use them to extract edge information and generate binary boundary masks, enabling a boundary-aware loss, which guides the model to focus on spatial inconsistencies, significantly improving segmentation near edges.

The confidence-weighted loss and dynamic thresholding filter reliable predictions to train the student model. In Stage 2, a confidence decay strategy and boundary-aware module progressively improve segmentation accuracy near object boundaries.}
