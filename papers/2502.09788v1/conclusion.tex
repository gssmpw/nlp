We build \system, a highly accurate malicious domain detection system that has been operational since June 1st, 2022 to the present. We leverage the observation that attackers reuse hosting infrastructures to host their disposable domains to detect malicious domains based on a small set of known malicious domains. Our models detect, on average, 19K malicious domains per day, which is 5 times the number of newly observed malicious domains in VT. Since our PDNS crawler proactively identifies domains in the neighborhood of malicious seed domains, \system detects malicious domains way ahead of VirusTotal and GSB, often several weeks ahead. Our sanity checking reveals the concerning fact that VT and GSB have a blind spot for at least 20\% of the detected malicious domains even after multiple scanning. In order to improve the coverage of detection, our approach can be easily extended to incorporate other associations such as registration records, certificates, and redirection chains. An interesting future direction is to automatically identify attack campaigns.
