\label{Conclusion}
In this paper, we formulate a novel blind video inpainting task,
which aims to achieve video inpainting without any corrupted regions annotation.
For this purpose, we design an end-to-end blind video inpainting framework consisting of a mask prediction network and a video completion network, and a consistency loss is introduced to regularize the training parameters.
Furthermore, we customize a dataset suitable for blind video inpainting, which can effectively facilitate subsequent researches.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the our method.
