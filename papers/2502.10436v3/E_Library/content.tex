\label{app:mergenetic}
Each experiment was run using a library developed specifically for this paper, which will be released as open-source software, called \textit{Mergenetic}. This library allows for defining a merging problem as either a single-objective or multi-objective optimization problem, where one only needs to specify the merging method,a fitness function, and select the hyperparameters for a chosen evolutionary algorithm. 

The implementation relies on \textit{Mergekit }  \cite{goddard2025arceesmergekittoolkitmerging} for merging the models, \textit{Pymoo } \cite{Blank_2020} for optimizing the objective function through evolutionary algorithms, and  \textit{Lm-Evaluation-Harness
 } \cite{eval-harness} for implementing some of the fitness functions. In \cref{tab:merge_methods} we outline the supported merging methods, while in \cref{tab:algorithms} we outline the currently available evolutionary algorithms.

We believe this library is a significant contribution as it facilitates evolutionary model merging and aligns well with the paper's approach, which aims to reduce computational burden. It can be a valuable tool for the community and for users interested in cross-lingual transfer or creating multilingual models for target low-resource languages.
