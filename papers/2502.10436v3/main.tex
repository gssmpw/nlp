\begin{abstract}
    Evolutionary model merging enables the creation of high-performing multi-task models but remains computationally prohibitive for consumer hardware.
    We introduce \approachns, an efficient framework that makes evolutionary merging feasible on a single GPU by reducing fitness computation costs 50× while preserving performance. \approachns{} achieves this by \textbf{E}xtracting a reduced dataset for evaluation, \textbf{E}stimating model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and \textbf{E}volving optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators. Our method enables state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual merging, transferring knowledge across languages with significantly lower computational overhead.
    We provide theoretical guarantees and an open-source library\footnote{\href{https://github.com/tommasomncttn/merge3}{github.com/tommasomncttn/merge3}}, democratizing high-quality model merging.
