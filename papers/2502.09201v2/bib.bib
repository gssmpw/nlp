abstract="We describe a protocol for quantum oblivious transfer, utilizing faint pulses of polarized light, by which one of two mutually distrustful parties (``Alice'') transmits two one-bit messages in such a way that the other party (``Bob'') can choose which message he gets but cannot obtain information about both messages (he will learn his chosen bit's value with exponentially small error

	abstract = {Individuals’ privacy and legal regulations demand genomic data be handled and studied with highly secure privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we propose a feasible Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) system assisted with quantum cryptographic protocols that is designed to compute a phylogenetic tree from a set of private genome sequences. This system significantly improves the privacy and security of the computation thanks to three quantum cryptographic protocols that provide enhanced security against quantum computer attacks. This system adapts several distance-based methods (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean, Neighbour-Joining, Fitch-Margoliash) into a private setting where the sequences owned by each party are not disclosed to the other members present in the protocol. We theoretically evaluate the performance and privacy guarantees of the system through a complexity analysis and security proof and give an extensive explanation about the implementation details and cryptographic protocols. We also implement a quantum-assisted secure phylogenetic tree computation based on the Libscapi implementation of the Yao, the PHYLIP library and simulated keys of two quantum systems: Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution and Quantum Key Distribution. This demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality. We benchmark this implementation against a classical-only solution and we conclude that both approaches render similar execution times, the only difference being the time overhead taken by the oblivious key management system of the quantum-assisted approach.},

}probability and may gain at most exponentially little information about the value of the other bit), and Alice will be entirely ignorant of which bit he received. Neither party can cheat (ie deviate from the protocol while appearing to follow it) in such a way as to obtain more information than what is given by the description of the protocol. Our protocol is easy to modify in order to implement the All-or-Nothing Disclosure of one out of two string messages, and it can be used to implement bit commitment and oblivious circuit evaluation without complexity-theoretic assumptions, in a way that remains secure even against cheaters that have unlimited computing power. Moreover, this protocol is practical in that it can be realized with available optoelectronic apparatus while being immune to any technologically feasible attack for the foreseeable future.",
