Text classification has been extensively studied, with models like BERT ____ setting new performance benchmarks. Ensemble methods ____ and multi-model architectures ____ have been employed to enhance classification accuracy. However, these approaches often involve static model combinations without dynamic interaction mechanisms.

Multi-agent systems have shown promise in various domains ____, enabling specialized agents to collaborate on complex tasks. Frameworks like CAMEL ____ and multi-agent debate strategies ____ demonstrate the benefits of role-based agent collaboration for reasoning and decision-making. Further, multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction ____. 

Our work distinguishes itself by integrating a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically tailored for text classification, leveraging BERT as the primary model and introducing specialized agents to handle low-confidence predictions dynamically. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability and robustness, addressing gaps in existing literature.
