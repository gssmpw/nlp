\section{Conclusion}

We show that RSM optimizations are difficult to maintain in a dynamically changing environment, especially in the presence of faulty replicas and potentially manipulated measurements.
\sysname's sensors and monitors allow to collect local measurements and perform non-deterministic computations, and to present and process this information consistently. 
\sysname allows to select candidates for special roles and hold faulty replicas accountable to the reported measurements.
We showcase how \optitree leverages \sysname to find more performant configurations and to stay optimized despite failures. 
Especially, the estimate on actual faults in the system, provided by \sysname, allows \optitree to balance performance and robustness.
