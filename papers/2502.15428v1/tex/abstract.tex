Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols play a pivotal role in blockchain technology.
As the deployment of such systems extends to wide-area networks, the scalability of BFT protocols becomes a critical concern.
Optimizations that assign specific roles to individual replicas can significantly improve the performance of BFT systems.
However, such role assignment is highly sensitive to faults, potentially undermining the optimizations' effectiveness.
To address these challenges, we present \sysname, a logging framework for collecting and analyzing metrics that help to assign roles in globally distributed systems, despite the presence of faults.
\sysname presents local measurements in global data structures, to enable consistent decisions and hold replicas accountable if they do not perform according to their reported measurements.
We apply \sysname to Kauri, an optimization using randomly composed tree overlays.
\sysname finds robust and low-latency tree configurations under adverse conditions.
