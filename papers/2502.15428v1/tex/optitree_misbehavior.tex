\subsubsection{Misbehavior Monitoring in Trees}

We augment misbehavior monitoring for trees with an additional rule for invalid vote aggregation.
In a tree configuration, intermediate nodes are responsible for aggregating votes from their children and forwarding them to the root.
However, if an intermediate node does not receive a vote from a child node, the aggregate vote must include a suspicion for the missing vote.
That is, the aggregate must include $\bn + 1$ votes or suspicions.
Failure to meet this requirement allows the root to use the aggregation vote as \textit{proof-of-misbehavior} against the intermediate node.
