\begin{definition}\label{def:score}
  For a tree $\tree$, the $\score(\kn, \tree)$ is the minimum latency required to collect votes from $\kn$ nodes.

  This score is computed using the link latencies in the tree, derived from $\lm$, taking into account that intermediate nodes first collect votes from their children before forwarding them to the root.

  The \textit{aggregation latency} $\agt{\nin}$, for intermediate node $\nin$, is the maximum latency from $\nin$ to any of its children, \Ch{\nin}:
  \[
    \agt{\nin} = \max_{\nv \in \Ch{\nin}} \lme{\nin}{\nv}
  \]
  Let $\Intermediate_k$ represent subsets of all intermediate nodes such that the subtrees rooted at these nodes contain a total of at least $k$ nodes:
  \[
    \Intermediate_k = \{M \subset \Intermediate \mid \sum_{\nin \in M} |\Ch{\nin}| + 1 \geq k \}
  \]
  Thus, the time to collect $\kn$ votes is the minimum time to collect aggregates from subtrees in a set from $\Intermediate_{\kn-1}$, since the root $\nr$'s vote is added separately.
  \[
    \score(\kn, \tree) = \min_{M \in \Intermediate_{\kn-1}} \left( \max_{\nin \in M} \left( \agt{\nin} + \lme{\nin}{\nr} \right) \right)
  \]
\end{definition}
