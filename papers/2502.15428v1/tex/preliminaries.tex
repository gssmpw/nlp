\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

We consider an \ac{RSM} that accepts client commands as input and produces output to clients.
The RSM may record certain events in an append-only log.
We assume an RSM with $\n\ge3\f+1$ replicas, where up to $\f$ can be Byzantine faulty, meaning they may exhibit arbitrary, potentially adversarial behavior.
Replicas that faithfully follow the protocol and do not crash are considered \textit{correct}, while others are deemed \textit{faulty}.
In every view, at least a quorum of $\q=\n-\f$ correct replicas is assumed to be available.

We assume a \textit{partially synchronous} network~\cite{partialsynchronous}, where periods of instability may cause unpredictable delays.
However, after a \ac{GST}, latencies become predictable.
We also assume there exists a known parameter $\delta$ and an \textit{actual} latency $\lat[a]{\na}{\nb}$ between correct replicas $\na$ and $\nb$, such that after GST, the round-trip time of any message between $\na$ and $\nb$ is in the interval $[\lat[a]{\na}{\nb}, \delta\cdot\lat[a]{\na}{\nb}]$.

Note that the partial synchrony assumption only pertains to liveness; the RSM's safety is always preserved.
A faulty replica may attempt to disrupt the RSM's performance by recording incorrect measurements in the log.
However, an adversary cannot delay messages, including measurements, between correct replicas.
Thus, faulty replicas cannot interfere with measurement exchanges between correct replicas.

Let $\C{}$ denote the set of $\n$ replicas constituting the RSM's full \textit{configuration}.
A configuration also encodes topology information, e.g., a tree configuration.
While describing the position of the replica in a tree/graph, it may also be referred as \textit{node}.
An RSM may \textit{reconfigure} from one configuration to another, e.g., to activate a better configuration or recover from a faulty configuration.
