% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) have been enormously successful in solving a wide variety
of structured and unstructured generative tasks,
but they struggle to generate procedural geometry in Computer Aided Design (CAD). These difficulties
arise from an inability to do spatial reasoning and the necessity to guide a model through complex,
long range planning to generate complex geometry. We enable generative CAD Design with LLMs
through the introduction of a solver-aided, hierarchical domain specific language (DSL) called AIDL, which offloads the spatial reasoning requirements to a geometric constraint solver. Additionally, we show that in the few-shot regime, AIDL outperforms even a language with in-training data (OpenSCAD), both in terms of generating visual results closer to the prompt and creating objects that are easier to post-process and reason about.

Our system interactively prompts the LLM to build up a CAD program in our DSL, using feedback from executing and solving the intermediate programs to guide the generation process. The constraint system is solved by a novel hierarchical constraint solver, and we fabricate the resulting designs using a laser cutter.}
