\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we introduce a novel sampling method named \HighDiv, designed to generate a highly diverse set of solutions for \SMTLIA formulas. This method primarily utilizes local search techniques, supplemented by a stochastic version of the CDCL(T) technology. Extensive experiments conducted on the SMT-LIB benchmarks for LIA demonstrate that \HighDiv achieves higher coverage than its most advanced competitors, namely MeGASampler and SMTSampler(Int). These results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the \HighDiv method. Notably, compared to existing advanced technologies, \HighDiv is able to achieve higher coverage with smaller solution sets. Furthermore, \HighDiv can generate solution sets with higher coverage in less time compared to MeGASampler and SMTSampler(Int).
