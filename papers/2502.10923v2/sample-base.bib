abstract = {NUMA systems are characterized by Non-Uniform Memory Access times, where accessing data in a remote node takes longer than a local access. NUMA hardware has been built since the late 80's, and the operating systems designed for it were optimized for access locality. They co-located memory pages with the threads that accessed them, so as to avoid the cost of remote accesses. Contrary to older systems, modern NUMA hardware has much smaller remote wire delays, and so remote access costs per se are not the main concern for performance, as we discovered in this work. Instead, congestion on memory controllers and interconnects, caused by memory traffic from data-intensive applications, hurts performance a lot more. Because of that, memory placement algorithms must be redesigned to target traffic congestion. This requires an arsenal of techniques that go beyond optimizing locality. In this paper we describe Carrefour, an algorithm that addresses this goal. We implemented Carrefour in Linux and obtained performance improvements of up to 3.6 relative to the default kernel, as well as significant improvements compared to NUMA-aware patchsets available for Linux. Carrefour never hurts performance by more than 4% when memory placement cannot be improved. We present the design of Carrefour, the challenges of implementing it on modern hardware, and draw insights about hardware support that would help optimize system software on future NUMA systems.},

abstract = {The recent advancements in storage technologies have popularized the use of tiered storage systems in data-intensive compute clusters. The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), for example, now supports storing data in memory, SSDs, and HDDs, while OctopusFS and hatS offer fine-grained storage tiering solutions. However, the task schedulers of big data platforms (such as Hadoop and Spark) will assign tasks to available resources only based on data locality information, and completely ignore the fact that local data is now stored on a variety of storage media with different performance characteristics. This paper presents Trident, a principled task scheduling approach that is designed to make optimal task assignment decisions based on both locality and storage tier information. Trident formulates task scheduling as a minimum cost maximum matching problem in a bipartite graph and uses a standard solver for finding the optimal solution. In addition, Trident utilizes two novel pruning algorithms for bounding the size of the graph, while still guaranteeing optimality. Trident is implemented in both Spark and Hadoop, and evaluated extensively using a realistic workload derived from Facebook traces as well as an industry-validated benchmark, demonstrating significant benefits in terms of application performance and cluster efficiency.},
