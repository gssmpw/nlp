\section{Conclusion}

The integration of AI-driven recommendations with user-driven customization presents a promising direction toward authoring more semantically aligned charts and text. This work introduces \pluto, a tool that incorporates a semantic and interactive framework that is informed by a nuanced understanding of the interplay between text and visuals. The system's recommendations, ranging from text generation to annotation and title suggestions, demonstrate the viability of a mixed-initiative approach to support richer chart-and-text authoring. 
A preliminary evaluation of the system revealed several key takeaways: participants highly valued the ability to use multimodal input for generating text, found text generation recommendations particularly useful for initiating the authoring process, and appreciated the system's ability to suggest annotations and chart design modifications based on the entered description. These findings underscore the potential of systems like \pluto~to facilitate the creation of more semantically coherent and integrated text and chart content. We envision a continued exploration of this research space, extending \pluto's capabilities to accommodate a broader array of visualization types and narrative styles, wherein text and visuals are not mere complements but coequals in data-driven communication.
