%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include

%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the

%% If you are preparing content for an event

%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting

  \Description[Three examples of text and chart suggestions in Pluto.]{The first example shows a case where the system generates a title and description for a multi-series line chart. The second example shows how the system can complete a sentence in the description when users click on a mark in the chart. The third example illustrates the system's ability to suggest chart design changes, in this case, to short and annotate a chart based on text in the description.}
