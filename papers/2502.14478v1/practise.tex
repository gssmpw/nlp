% \subsection{RQ4: Practical Use of the Synthesised Predicates}
% \label{sec:practical}

% Are the predicates synthesised by \tool useful?
% %
% To answer this question, we used \tool's results to enable \emph{new}
% applications of an existing SL-based state-of-the-art deductive
% synthesiser \suslik~\cite{polikarpova2019structuring}.
% %
% Given definitions of SL predicates and a Hoare-style program
% \emph{specification} (\ie, its parameters, pre- and post-condition
% written in Separation Logic), \suslik produces a C program that
% \emph{provably} satisfies that specification, as well as a formal
% proof of that fact in one of several SL implementations on top of Coq
% proof assistant~\cite{Appel:ESOP11, KrebbersTB17,Nanevski-al:POPL10},
% providing the ultimate correctness guarantees for synthesis
% results~\cite{WatanabeGPPS21}.
% %
% The main downside of \suslik is that it requires the user to provide
% SL predicates---a non-negligeable price to pay, which is, however,
% amortised across multiple synthesis tasks involving the same data
% types.
% %
% With \tool, we can, therefore, enhance the expressivity of \suslik by
% allowing the user to provide memory graphs
% instead of the formal SL predicate definitions.

% Following the informally described translation procedure in
% \autoref{sec:bst}, we implement an automated conversion of the
% synthesised \prolog-style SL predicates  into \suslik's specification
% language, and take the predicates as the specifications
% to synthesise a number of
% easy-to-specify programs as shown in \autoref{tab:results}.
% % \footnote{We found that negative number is not well-supported. In our balanced tree predicate, we use -1 to represent the empty tree's height. However, \suslik synthesis only work when we manually modify it to 0.}
% For example, a program fully deallocating a sorted doubly-linked
% list (DLL) can be specified by the following Hoare triple, which makes
% use of the newly synthesised predicate for a sorted DLL
% (\code{srt_dll}) in the precondition and the empty heap assertion
% \code{emp} in the postcondition:
% %
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   { srt_dll(x, a, s) } void free(loc x) { emp }
% \end{lstlisting}
% %

% Non-trivial synthesised programs performing data structure
% transformations such as {sorting} and {flattening} are listed in in
% \autoref{tab:results}'s {Transform} category.
% %
% As a specific example, a specification describing a function that
% flattens a BST into a sorted DLL is defined as follows:
% %
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   { r :-> 0 * bst(x, s) } void bst_to_srt_dll(loc x, loc r) { r :-> y * srt_dll(y, a, s) }
% \end{lstlisting}
% %

% The columns in the table in \autoref{tab:results} also show the ratio
% of AST nodes between the the synthesised programs and \suslik
% specifications, demonstrating the gain in expressivity.
% %
% Finally, the table shows the time it took to synthesise the programs.
% %
% Synthesis efficiency for some of those case studies in \suslik can be
% improved by explicitly providing search parameters such as number of
% considered predicate unfoldings to the synthesiser.
% %
% All programs in the table were automatically synthesised by \suslik,
% along with their SL proofs embedded into Coq via VST
% framework~\cite{Appel:ESOP11}, from the predicates obtained via \tool
% in the scope of the experiments in \autoref{sec:done}. An example of
% the synthesised C program that transforms a sorted DLL into a singly
% linked list is given in \autoref{fig:transform}.

% The outcome of this experiment hints a new way to synthesise
% \emph{provably-correct} heap-manipulating programs via memory graphs
% describing the properties of the input and output, instead of
% providing the formal SL predicates as in deductive synthesis
% \cite{polikarpova2019structuring}, or providing the concrete input
% memory graphs before the program execution and the
% \emph{corresponding} output memory graphs, as in inductive synthesis
% \cite{roy2013concrete, SinghS11}.
