\begin{abstract}
Scientific experimentation, a cornerstone of human progress, demands rigor in reliability, methodical control, and interpretability to yield meaningful results. Despite the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating different aspects of the scientific process, automating rigorous experimentation remains a significant challenge.
To address this gap, we propose \sys, an AI agent framework designed to embed rigor into the experimentation process through three key components: an intra-agent rigor module to enhance reliability, an inter-agent rigor module to maintain methodical control, and an experiment knowledge module to enhance interpretability. 
To evaluate \sys, we design a novel experimental benchmark composed of 46 questions across four computer science domains, derived from influential research papers, and widely adopted open-source projects. 
% Compared to the strongest agent framework baseline, the evaluation results show that \sys achieves 1.2$\times$ improvement in experiment design correctness, 2.4$\times$ improvement in execution reproducibility and 3.4$\times$ improvement in conclusion accuracy. 
% Compared to the strongest agent baseline, we achieve a 3.4$\times$ improvement in correctly answering experimental questions.
Compared to the strongest baseline tested, we achieve a 3.4$\times$ improvement in correctly answering experimental questions.
\sys is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie}.

% Scientific research is the foundation of human progress, and its importance has spurred a plethora of solutions leveraging the power of LLMs to automate aspects of the scientific process. 
% Yet, experimentation—a fundamental pillar of research—has been largely overlooked, often relegated to simplistic, prompt-based approaches. This neglect undermines the precision, reproducibility, and systematic control that collectively define experimental rigor—the bedrock of scientific experimentation.

Scientific experimentation is important, and hence many papers are starting to work on it. However they lack rigor, which is X. To address this, we propose Curie, a AI agent framework designed to provide rigor; through 3 main components, an intra-agent rigor that ensures, an inter-agent that ensures control, and an interface to make sure progress is X. To evaluate Curie, we design an experimental benchmark derived from X, Our results show that Curie XYZ. 

% Scientific experimentation, a critical component of scientific research 
Scientific research drives innovation and discovery, yet the experimentation process remains complex, resource-intensive, and prone to errors.
Recent advancements in AI agents offer promising opportunities to automate scientific research, but ensuring rigor and reproducibility remains an unresolved challenge.

We propose \sys, an AI agent framework designed to fully automate the experimentation process while systematically ensuring rigor and reproducibility. 
Beyond automating basic workflows, Curie incorporates a dedicated Rigor Module that enforces correctness at both intra-agent and inter-agent levels, ensuring consistency throughout experiment design, execution, and result analysis.


To evaluate Curie, we introduce an experimentation benchmark derived from real-world research papers and widely adopted open-source projects. 
The benchmark consists of tasks designed to evaluate whether a framework can reproduce, extend, or even challenge insights from established works across three key topics: LLM reasoning, vector indexing, cloud computing and ML training.
Our results demonstrate that Curie consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior rigor, reproducibility, and overall performance, paving the way for AI-driven automation of complex scientific workflows.
