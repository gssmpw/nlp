\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Code LLMs, have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation. Current research primarily focuses on the correctness of generated code, while efficiency remains less explored. Recent works have focused on modifying the initial version of the code to improve its efficiency. However, such refinements are limited by the algorithmic design and overall logic of the initial code, resulting in only incremental improvements. In contrast, when human developers write high-quality code, they typically begin by designing several potential solutions at the logical level, evaluating various algorithms and their complexities, and then proceeding to implement and optimize the solution. In this study, we introduce \tool: \uline{L}arge \uline{L}anguage \uline{M}odel for Code \uline{Effi}ciency, a novel framework that enables LLMs to generate code that balances both efficiency and correctness. Specifically, \tool divides the efficiency optimization process into two domains: algorithmic exploration in the logic domain and implementation optimization in the code domain. The correctness of the code is then guaranteed through a synthetic test case refinement process. This approach, which prioritizes efficiency before ensuring correctness, offers a new paradigm for efficient code generation. Experiments demonstrate that \tool consistently improves both efficiency and correctness, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in code efficiency benchmarks across various LLM backbones.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \tool, a novel framework designed to generate both efficient and correct code. By separating efficiency optimization into the logic and code domains and adopting an "efficiency-first, correctness-later" approach, \tool enables the exploration of a broader range of algorithmic solutions while maintaining functional correctness. Experimental results demonstrate \toolâ€™s robust performance, with consistent improvements in both efficiency and correctness across different LLM backbones.


\section*{Limitation}
Although \tool excels at generating both efficient and correct code, it also has some limitations. One major challenge is the trade-off between efficiency and maintainability. In some cases, the generated efficient code may become more complex and harder to read. Achieving the right balance between efficiency and maintainability is not always straightforward, and in certain cases, highly efficient code may sacrifice readability and ease of future modifications. Future work will focus on optimizing the \tool to improve its scalability and extend its applicability to more complex software engineering tasks.
