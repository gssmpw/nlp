The original Logit Lens concept demonstrated that meaningful token predictions could be extracted from intermediate transformer layers ____. Subsequent improvements introduced the Tuned Lens ____, which applies learned transformations to intermediate activations for clearer interpretation. Parallel work developed complementary techniques like Patchscopes ____ and gradient projection methods ____, creating a rich ecosystem of transformer analysis tools.\\

Recent applications have revealed fundamental insights about LLM internals. Wu____ used Logit Lens to identify cross-lingual semantic hubs, while Jia____ employed it to study prediction refinement dynamics. Safety researchers ____ and alignment investigators ____ have leveraged these techniques to localize critical model behaviors. However, all such studies remain constrained by the limited model support of existing implementations.
