\section{Experimental Results}


To investigate the performance of \Chain, our experiments focus on the following three research questions:


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{RQ-1 Comparable Study on Time Range Query.} {\em How does the performance of ~\Chain compare with the baselines on Time Range Query?}


\item \textbf{RQ-2 Comparable Study on Fuzzy Query.} {\em How does the performance of ~\Chain compare with the baselines on Fuzzy Query?}

\item \textbf{RQ-3 Gas Efficiency and Scalability Analysis.} {\em How does \Chain perform in terms of gas consumption and scalability compared to the baselines?}
\end{itemize}

% \noindent \textbf{Simple Query.} \emph{MulChain$_V$ is 22.67X slower than MulChain$_O$.} 
% As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Simple Query Performance}, during the initial phase (block numbers 16 to 256), the BTC dataset exhibits a higher insertion overhead than ETH.
% That is due to Bitcoin's sparser timestamps, which leads to lower utilization of common prefixes in the trie, resulting in increased insertion overhead. 
% In the later phase (block numbers > 256), the ETH dataset experiences slower insertions due to hash node saturation and increased hash collisions. 
% Moreover, the query latency of MulChain$_V$ is 22.67X higher than MulChain$_O$ on average since 95.7\% of the query time is spent on retrieving data from off-chain storage. 
% The VO size for the ETH workload is 21.82\% higher than that of BTC, with both following consistent trends. 
% This difference is expected due to the distinct distributions of the two datasets.
