\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent In this paper, we propose \Chain, the first work to enable advanced cross-modal queries on hybrid-storage blockchains. 
To achieve that, two indexing structures integrating a verifiable gas-efficient BHashTree and a high-performance trie are proposed. 
BHashTree supports transitions between a B\(+\)Tree and a hashtable based on workload type. 
Our system seamlessly integrates with existing blockchains and off-chain storage solutions. 
Experimental results show that \Chain achieves up to 78.12X speedup in query performance and reduces the VO size by 99.49\% in comparison with the state-of-the-art vChain+.
Several interesting problems merit further investigation, such as supporting more complex cross-modal queries and optimizing the performance of our methods.
