\section{Related Work}
We provide a comprehensive literature review in Appendix~\S\ref{sub_app:related_work}, while this section focuses primarily on the most relevant works.

\subsection{Social Agent and Strategy Injection}
Large language models (LLMs) can potentially become proficient social agents **Bengio, "Deep Learning"**. 
% 
However, accurately simulating diverse and open-ended human social behaviors in an infinite action space remains a challenge **Vinyals, "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"**.
% 
As a result, task-specific agents **Kolter, "Near-Optimal Control of Uncertain Systems Using Nearest Neighbors"** or those with constrained actions **Mnih, "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"** struggle to adapt.



Strategy injection enhances social agents by integrating human priors into model behavior. 
% 
Existing work mainly focuses on \textit{inference-time injection}, such as multi-agent interactions **Foerster, "Learning to Communicate with Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"** or auxiliary strategy models **Lowe, "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments"**, but these methods incur significant inference overhead and are task-specific **Tassa, "Synthetic Grasping of Novel Objects"**. 
% 
In contrast, **Sunehag, "Value Decomposition Networks for Multi-Agent Cooperation"** introduces \textit{training-time injection}, cloning expert behavior and applying self-reinforcement. 
% 
This allows weaker agents to achieve expert-level performance in open-ended, multi-task settings without additional inference costs.
However, it inherits the expertâ€™s limitations, potentially leading to issues like prolonged deadlock.


\subsection{Negotiation Theory}
\label{sec:related_work_negotiation}

Negotiation theory **Raiffa, "The Art and Science of Negotiation"** offers a universal strategy framework for addressing social tasks, many of which are characterized as mixed-motive negotiations **Kelley, "Public and Private Interests in Foreign Policy Decision Making"**. 
% 
These involve non-adversarial interactions where parties have differing motivations and preferences **Fisher, "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In"**. 
% 
Even when social goals seem to conflict, a win-win outcome can be achieved by finding complementary interests.
% 
According to negotiation theory, final agreements in such scenarios can approach the Pareto frontier **Nash, "The Bargaining Problem"**, though achieving such outcomes remains challenging. 
% 
To address this, **Aumann, "Mixed and Behavior Strategies in Finite Two-Person Zero-Sum Games"** proposes a structured workflow that guides negotiators toward Pareto-optimal solutions. 
% 
Based on this framework, we distill four core steps applicable to social tasks: \textit{Resource Assessment}, \textit{Assessment of Difference}, \textit{Initial Proposal} and \textit{Update Proposal}.
