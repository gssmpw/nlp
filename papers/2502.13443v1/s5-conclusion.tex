\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce a variant of the online 3D bin packing problem that incorporates intrinsic box properties beyond dimensions, to more closely resemble real-world scenarios. To address this new challenge, we propose an online action masking model learning method, which completely eliminates the need for heuristic methods, offering a more general approach. Simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior performance compared to other approaches. In the future, we may explore even more realistic scenarios, such as handling friction between boxes and assuming the pallet may experience sudden shaking. %which simulates the acceleration and deceleration phases encountered during real-world transportation.
