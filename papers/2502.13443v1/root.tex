\begin{abstract}
The efficient planning of stacking boxes, especially in the online setting where the sequence of item arrivals is unpredictable, remains a critical challenge in modern warehouse and logistics management.
%
Existing solutions often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world applications.
%
We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by employing action space masking to direct the RL policy toward valid actions.
%
Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for manual heuristic design.
%
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our learned task planner in a real-world robotic palletizer, validating its practical applicability in operational settings. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/tianqi-zh/palletization}.

    \caption{The whole framework of our proposed method. The entire framework can be divided into three parts. The first part is feature extraction. At each timestep t, given the state $s_t = \{C_t, d_t\}$, we process the pallet configuration $C_t$ using a 3D CNN and the properties of the boxes $d_t$ in the buffer using an MLP. These two components are then concatenated to form the observation feature. The second part is interaction. The latter half of the policy network outputs an action based on the observation feature. We use a 3D-UNet \cite{cciccek20163d} as the action masking model. However, we have added a convolutional layer at the end to transform the multi-channel 3D array input into a single-channel 2D map. It generates an action space mask that filters out unstable box placement points, by using the selected box’s properties and the current pallet configuration. The action is then executed in the environment, and the result is obtained. The third part is the training of the action masking model. Unlike the first two parts, which are executed at each timestep, this part only occurs when the policy is updated. First, multiple parallel simulators are used to generate the corresponding feasible annotations for the data selected during the rollout. These data points and their annotations are then appended to the feasible dataset, which is subsequently used to train the action masking model over several epochs.}
