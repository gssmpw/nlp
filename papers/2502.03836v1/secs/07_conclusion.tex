\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a diffusion-based framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and image observations for accurate human mesh recovery. By aligning pose and text within a shared latent space, we incorporate text-pose prior knowledge from VLMs. Using the diffusion model's guidance mechanism, our approach balances image observations and model assumptions through multi-modal feedback, ultimately producing body poses with precise image-model alignment and accurate joint positions after denoising.
