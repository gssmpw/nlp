    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the AgenticLU pipeline}: The model iteratively refines its understanding of long-context inputs through an agentic workflow. At each step, it raises self-clarifications, retrieves relevant context via the pointback mechanism, and updates its reasoning trace. The framework integrates CoC Path Construction to generate diverse reasoning paths, followed by two-stage fine-tuning (SFT and DPO) to enhance long-context understanding.}
