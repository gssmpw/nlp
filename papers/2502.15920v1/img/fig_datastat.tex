    \caption{\textbf{Most questions can be answered with up to three rounds of clarifications.} 
    A single round of clarification suffices for the majority of questions (92\%), with a smaller fraction requiring two or three additional clarifications. 
    We cap inference-time clarifications at three rounds to strike a balance between coverage (solving 97.4\% of questions) and computational cost.}
