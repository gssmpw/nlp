    \caption{\textbf{An overview of the agentic workflow for tackling long-context tasks.} The model first raises or identifies a clarifying question (1), locates relevant context (2), clarifies its own reasoning (3), and finally provides an answer (4). The reasoning process can be multi-round depending on the complexity of the tasks at hand.
