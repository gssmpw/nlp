abstract = {Cross-area evaluation poses a significant challenge for ground-to-aerial geo-localization, in which the training and testing data are captured from entirely distinct areas. However, current methods struggle in cross-area evaluation due to their emphasis solely on learning global information from single-scale features. Some efforts alleviate this problem but rely on complex and specific technologies like pre-processing and hard sample mining. To this end, we propose a pure end-to-end solution, free from task-specific techniques, termed the Multi-scale Feature Representation Generalization Network (MFRGN) to improve generalization. Specifically, we introduce multi-scale features and explicitly utilize them by an novel global-local information representation structure with two flows, to bolster feature representations. In the global flow, we present a lightweight Self and Cross Attention Module (SCAM) to efficiently learn global embeddings. In the local flow, we develop a Global-Prompt Attention Block (GPAB) to capture discriminative features under the global embeddings as prompts. As a result, our approach generates robust descriptors representing multi-scale global and local information, thereby enhancing the model's invariance to scene variations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show our MFRGN achieves competitive performance in same-area evaluation and improves cross-area generalization by a significant margin compared to SOTA methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ytao-wang/MFRGN.},

ABSTRACT = {Within research on the cross-view geolocation of UAVs, differences in image sources and interference from similar scenes pose huge challenges. Inspired by multimodal machine learning, in this paper, we design a single-stream pyramid transformer network (SSPT). The backbone of the model uses the self-attention mechanism to enrich its own internal features in the early stage and uses the cross-attention mechanism in the later stage to refine and interact with different features to eliminate irrelevant interference. In addition, in the post-processing part of the model, a header module is designed for upsampling to generate heat maps, and a Gaussian weight window is designed to assign label weights to make the model converge better. Together, these methods improve the positioning accuracy of UAV images in satellite images. Finally, we also use style transfer technology to simulate various environmental changes in order to expand the experimental data, further proving the environmental adaptability and robustness of the method. The final experimental results show that our method yields significant performance improvement: The relative distance score (RDS) of the SSPT-384 model on the benchmark UL14 dataset is significantly improved from 76.25% to 84.40%, while the meter-level accuracy (MA) of 3 m, 5 m, and 20 m is increased by 12%, 12%, and 10%, respectively. For the SSPT-256 model, the RDS has been increased to 82.21%, and the meter-level accuracy (MA) of 3 m, 5 m, and 20 m has increased by 5%, 5%, and 7%, respectively. It still shows strong robustness on the extended thermal infrared (TIR), nighttime, and rainy day datasets.},
