abstract = {Summary
This study systematically reviewed the application of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, analyzing 550 selected studies from a vast literature search. LLMs like ChatGPT transformed healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, medical writing, education, and project management. They assisted in drafting medical documents, creating training simulations, and streamlining research processes. Despite their growing utility in assisted diagnosis and improving doctor-patient communication, challenges persisted, including limitations in contextual understanding and the risk of over-reliance. The surge in LLM-related research indicated a focus on medical writing, diagnostics, and patient communication, but highlighted the need for careful integration, considering validation, ethical concerns, and the balance with traditional medical practice. Future research directions suggested a focus on multimodal LLMs, deeper algorithmic understanding, and ensuring responsible, effective use in healthcare.}

  abstract  = "Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among
               both men and women. Radiation therapy is one of the main
               approaches to lung cancer treatment, and its planning is crucial
               for the therapy outcome. However, the current practice that
               uniformly delivers the dose does not take into account the
               patient-specific tumour features that may affect treatment
               success. Since radiation therapy is by its very nature a
               sequential procedure, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a
               well-suited methodology to overcome this limitation. In this
               respect, in this work we present a DRL controller optimizing the
               daily dose fraction delivered to the patient on the basis of CT
               scans collected over time during the therapy, offering a
               personalized treatment not only for volume adaptation, as
               currently intended, but also for daily fractionation.
               Furthermore, this contribution introduces a virtual radiotherapy
               environment based on a set of ordinary differential equations
               modelling the tissue radiosensitivity by combining both the
               effect of the radiotherapy treatment and cell growth. Their
               parameters are estimated from CT scans routinely collected using
               the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This permits the DRL
               to learn the optimal behaviour through an iterative trial and
               error process with the environment. We performed several
               experiments considering three rewards functions modelling
               treatment strategies with different tissue aggressiveness and
               two exploration strategies for the exploration-exploitation
               dilemma. The results show that our DRL approach can adapt to
               radiation therapy treatment, optimizing its behaviour according
               to the different reward functions and outperforming the current
               clinical practice.",
