  abstract  = "Each year, approximately 18 million new cancer cases are
               diagnosed worldwide, and about half must be treated with
               radiotherapy. A successful treatment requires treatment planning
               with the customization of penetrating radiation beams to
               sterilize cancerous cells without harming nearby normal organs
               and tissues. This process currently involves extensive manual
               tuning of parameters by an expert planner, making it a
               time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with quality and
               immediacy of critical care dependent on the planner's expertise.
               To improve the speed, quality, and availability of this highly
               specialized care, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
               developed and applied advanced optimization tools to this
               problem (e.g., using hierarchical constrained optimization,
               convex approximations, and Lagrangian methods). This resulted in
               both a greatly improved radiotherapy treatment planning process
               and the generation of reliable and consistent high-quality plans
               that reflect clinical priorities. These improved techniques have
               been the foundation of high-quality treatments and have
               positively impacted over 4,000 patients to date, including
               numerous patients in severe pain and in urgent need of treatment
               who might have otherwise required longer hospital stays or
               undergone unnecessary surgery to control the progression of
               their disease. We expect that the wide distribution of the
               system we developed will ultimately impact patient care more
               broadly, including in resource-constrained countries.",

  abstract  = "Cervical cancer represents a significant portion of the global
               cancer burden for women, with low- and middle-income countries
               carrying the bulk of this burden. Additionally, underserved
               populations in countries with sufficient resources may have a
               higher incidence of cervical cancer and poorer outcomes.
               Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard-of-care treatment
               for locally advanced cervical cancer, which includes patients
               with stage IB3 to IVA disease, and it is effective for many
               patients; however, cervical cancer-related mortality remains
               high. The critical nature of cervical cancer treatment is
               underscored by the recent launch of the World Health
               Organization global initiative to accelerate the elimination of
               cervical cancer using a triple-intervention strategy of
               increased vaccination, screening, and treatment. The initiative
               calls for 90\% of all patients diagnosed with cervical cancer to
               receive the appropriate treatment, but to reach this global goal
               there are significant barriers related to radiotherapy that must
               be addressed. We discuss and review evidence of the lack of
               adherence to guideline-recommended treatment, brachytherapy
               underutilization, limited access to radiotherapy in low- and
               middle-income countries, as well as regional limitations within
               high-income countries, as the major barriers to radiotherapy
               treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. We further
               review ways these barriers are currently being addressed and, in
               some cases, make additional recommendations to address these
               issues. Finally, despite receiving recommended treatments, many
               patients with locally advanced cervical cancer have a poor
               prognosis. With effective administration of current standards of
               care, the global community will be able to shift focus to
               advancing treatment efficacy for these patients. We review
               several types of therapies under clinical investigation that are
               additions to concurrent chemoradiotherapy, including immune
               checkpoint inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, DNA repair
               inhibitors, human papillomavirus vaccines, and radiosensitizing

  abstract  = "Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among
               both men and women. Radiation therapy is one of the main
               approaches to lung cancer treatment, and its planning is crucial
               for the therapy outcome. However, the current practice that
               uniformly delivers the dose does not take into account the
               patient-specific tumour features that may affect treatment
               success. Since radiation therapy is by its very nature a
               sequential procedure, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a
               well-suited methodology to overcome this limitation. In this
               respect, in this work we present a DRL controller optimizing the
               daily dose fraction delivered to the patient on the basis of CT
               scans collected over time during the therapy, offering a
               personalized treatment not only for volume adaptation, as
               currently intended, but also for daily fractionation.
               Furthermore, this contribution introduces a virtual radiotherapy
               environment based on a set of ordinary differential equations
               modelling the tissue radiosensitivity by combining both the
               effect of the radiotherapy treatment and cell growth. Their
               parameters are estimated from CT scans routinely collected using
               the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This permits the DRL
               to learn the optimal behaviour through an iterative trial and
               error process with the environment. We performed several
               experiments considering three rewards functions modelling
               treatment strategies with different tissue aggressiveness and
               two exploration strategies for the exploration-exploitation
               dilemma. The results show that our DRL approach can adapt to
               radiation therapy treatment, optimizing its behaviour according
               to the different reward functions and outperforming the current
               clinical practice.",

This study systematically reviewed the application of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, analyzing 550 selected studies from a vast literature search. LLMs like ChatGPT transformed healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, medical writing, education, and project management. They assisted in drafting medical documents, creating training simulations, and streamlining research processes. Despite their growing utility in assisted diagnosis and improving doctor-patient communication, challenges persisted, including limitations in contextual understanding and the risk of over-reliance. The surge in LLM-related research indicated a focus on medical writing, diagnostics, and patient communication, but highlighted the need for careful integration, considering validation, ethical concerns, and the balance with traditional medical practice. Future research directions suggested a focus on multimodal LLMs, deeper algorithmic understanding, and ensuring responsible, effective use in healthcare.}
