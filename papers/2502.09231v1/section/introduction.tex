\section{Introduction}
Answer Set Programming (ASP)~\cite{MT1999} has emerged as a promising paradigm in knowledge representation and automated reasoning owing to its ability to model hard combinatorial problems from diverse domains in a natural way~\cite{brik2015diagnosing}. Building on advances in propositional SAT solving, the past two decades have witnessed the emergence of well-engineered systems for solving the answer set satisfiability problem, i.e., finding models or answer sets for a given answer set program. In recent years, there has been growing interest in problems beyond satisfiability, such as model counting, in the context of ASP. In this work, we focus on the model counting problem in the context of ASP, known as {\em answer set counting} problem. There has been growing interest in answer set counting, motivated by applications in probabilistic reasoning and network reliability~\cite{KM2023, ACMS2015,HJK2022}
