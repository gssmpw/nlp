\section{Open issues and expected achievements}
Model counting, an intractable problem, is classified as \#P for normal programs and \#co-NP
\cite{FHMW2017} for disjunctive logic programs, presenting significant challenges in developing scalable answer set counters. Our observations indicate that while our engineered counters effectively scale for certain problem types, they underperform for others. The diverse applications of model counting in real-world scenarios further complicate the creation of application-specific ASP counters. Moreover, we have identified instances where existing systems outperform our SharpASP counter. Integrating strengths from these existing counters into SharpASP to enhance its scalability remains a formidable challenge.
