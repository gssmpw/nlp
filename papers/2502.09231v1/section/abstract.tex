We have focused on Answer Set Programming (ASP), more specifically, answer set counting, exploring both exact and approximate methodologies. We developed an exact ASP counter, sharpASP, which utilizes a compact encoding for propositional formulas, significantly enhancing efficiency compared to existing methods that often struggle with inefficient encodings. Our evaluations indicate that sharpASP outperforms current ASP counters on several benchmarks. In addition, we proposed an approximate ASP counter, named ApproxASP, a hashing-based counter integrating Gauss-Jordan elimination within the ASP solver, clingo. As a practical application, we employed ApproxASP for network reliability estimation, demonstrating superior performance over both traditional reliability estimators and \#SAT-based methods.
