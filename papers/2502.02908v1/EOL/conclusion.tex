\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \name, an ensemble of small language models, and evaluate its instantiation on the fault localisation task, \cosmosfl. We first examine the orthogonal behaviour of SLMs by adopting an LLM-based FL technique to evaluate the feasibility of our approach. Then, by implementing two versions of \cosmosfl -- equal weighting and DE-optimised weighting -- we further assess its performance and cost compared to single-model repetitions. Our results show that \cosmosfl has the potential to outperform a single SLM under cost constraints. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of \cosmosfl, including the issues of the SLM serving platform, and outline future directions, such as improving the performance via routing or more robust optimisation strategy and developing a ranking scheme for explanations.
