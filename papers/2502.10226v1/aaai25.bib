of agents, and we call it Sequential Characteristic-Function Game (SCFG). We define
the solution of such a game as a corresponding sequence of coalition structures that
must be related by a given feasibility relation, so no coalition structure can be
evaluated in isolation. A sequence satisfying this condition is called Feasible Coalition-Structure
Sequence (FCSS). Such games can be a useful abstraction for modelling various scenarios,
in particular those for real-world disaster management that we consider in this paper.
We give an algorithm for computing an FCSS and evaluate it experimentally. Our results
show that an SCFG can represent various classical variations of characteristic-function
games, and our algorithm solves instances with a reasonable number of agents.},

In this paper, we study the lifelong variant of MAPF, where agents are constantly engaged with new goal locations, such as in large-scale automated warehouses. We propose a new framework Rolling-Horizon Collision Resolution (RHCR) for solving lifelong MAPF by decomposing the problem into a sequence of Windowed MAPF instances, where a Windowed MAPF solver resolves collisions among the paths of the agents only within a bounded time horizon and ignores collisions beyond it. RHCR is particularly well suited to generating pliable plans that adapt to continually arriving new goal locations. We empirically evaluate RHCR with a variety of MAPF solvers and show that it can produce high-quality solutions for up to 1,000 agents (= 38.9\% of the empty cells on the map) for simulated warehouse instances, significantly outperforming existing work.}, number={13}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Li, Jiaoyang and Tinka, Andrew and Kiesel, Scott and Durham, Joseph W. and Kumar, T.

Our results encompass three formulations of the discrete multi-robot path planning problem, including a variant that allows synchronous rotations of robots along fully occupied, disjoint cycles on the graph. Allowing rotation of robots provides a more natural model for multi-robot path planning because robots can communicate.&lt;br /&gt;Our optimality objectives are to minimize the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), and the total distance. On the structure side, we show that, in general, these objectives demonstrate a pairwise Pareto optimal structure and cannot be simultaneously optimized. On the computational complexity side, we extend previous work and show that, regardless of the underlying multi-robot path planning problem, these objectives are all intractable to compute. In particular, our NP-hardness proof for the time optimal versions, based on a minimal and direct reduction from the 3-satisfiability problem, shows that these problems remain NP-hard even when there are only two groups of robots (i.e. robots within each group are interchangeable).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Yu, Jingjin and LaValle, Steven}, year={2013}, month={Jun.}, pages={1443-1449} }

However, performance of CBS approaches degrade rapidly in highly-contended graphs with many agents. One of the reasons this occurs is that CBS does not detect independent subproblems; i.e. it can re-solve the same conflicts between the same pairs of agents up to exponentially many times, each time along a different branch. Constraint programming approaches with nogood learning avoid this kind of duplication of effort by storing nogoods that record the reasons for conflicts. This can exponentially reduce search in constraint programming. In this work, we present Lazy CBS, a new approach to multi-agent pathfinding which replaces the high-level solver of CBS with a lazily constructed constraint programming model with nogoods. We use core-guided depth-first search to explore the space of conflicts and we detect along each branch reusable nogoods which help to quickly identify feasible solutions. Our experiments show that Lazy CBS can significantly improve on the state-of-the-art for optimal MAPF problems under the sumof-costs metric, especially in cases where there exists significant contention.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling}, author={Gange, Graeme and Harabor, Daniel and Stuckey, Peter J.}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={155-162} }

The second, &lt;em&gt;target symmetry&lt;/em&gt;, arises when the shortest path of one agent passes through the target location of a second agent after the second agent has already arrived at it. These symmetries can produce an exponential explosion in the space of possible collision resolutions, leading to unacceptable runtimes even for state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS). We propose to &lt;em&gt;break these symmetries&lt;/em&gt; using new reasoning techniques that: (1) detect each class of symmetry and (2) resolve them by introducing specialized constraints.
