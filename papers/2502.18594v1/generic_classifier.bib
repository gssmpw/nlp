This also impacts the time required to train a classiﬁer for a brain–computer interface (BCI).

This usually prevents BCI classiﬁers from generalizing among different experimental protocols.

	abstract = {Objective: A major diﬃculty of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is dealing with the noise of EEG and its signal variations. Previous works studied time-dependent non-stationarities for BCIs in which the user’s mental task was independent of the device operation (e.g., the mental task was motor imagery and the operational task was a speller). However, there are some BCIs, such as those based on error-related potentials, where the mental and operational tasks are dependent (e.g., the mental task is to assess the device action and the operational task is the device action itself). The dependency between the mental task and the device operation introduces a new source of signal variations when the operational task changes, which has not been studied yet. The aim of this study is to determine the existence of task-dependent signal variations when using EEG error-related potentials. Approach: The work analyzes the signal variations on the three design steps of BCIs: an electrophysiology study to characterize the existence of these variations; a feature distributions analysis; and a single-trial classiﬁcation analysis to measure the impact on the ﬁnal BCI performance. Results and signiﬁcance: The results demonstrate that a change in the operational task produces variations in the potentials, even when EEG activity exclusively originated in brain areas related to error processing is considered. Consequently, the extracted features from the signals vary, and a classiﬁer trained with one operational task presents a signiﬁcant loss of performance for other tasks, requiring calibration or adaptation for each new task. In addition, a new calibration for each of the studied tasks rapidly outperforms adaptive techniques designed in the literature to mitigate the EEG time-dependent non-stationarities.},

              Objective.
              Error-related potential (ErrP) is a potential elicited in the brain when humans perceive an error. ErrPs have been researched in a variety of contexts, such as to increase the reliability of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), increase the naturalness of human–machine interaction systems, teach systems, as well as study clinical conditions. Still, there is a significant challenge in detecting ErrP from a single trial, which may hamper its effective use. The literature presents ErrP detection accuracies quite variable across studies, which raises the question of whether this variability depends more on classification pipelines or on the quality of elicited ErrPs (mostly directly related to the underlying paradigms).
              Approach.
              With this purpose, 11 datasets have been used to compare several classification pipelines which were selected according to the studies that reported online performance above 75\%. We also analyze the effects of different steps of the pipelines, such as resampling, window selection, augmentation, feature extraction, and classification.
              Main results.
              From our analysis, we have found that shrinkage-regularized linear discriminant analysis is the most robust method for classification, and for feature extraction, using Fisher criterion beamformer spatial features and overlapped window averages result in better classification performance. The overall experimental results suggest that classification accuracy is highly dependent on user tasks in BCI experiments and on signal quality (in terms of ErrP morphology, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and discrimination).
              Significance.
              This study contributes to the BCI research field by responding to the need for a guideline that can direct researchers in designing ErrP-based BCI tasks by accelerating the design steps.},

Our results show that such a generalized model can decode ErrPs with an acceptable accuracy of (72.73 ± 5.27)\% and that supervised adaptation can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of the generalized model. Unsupervised adaptation did only prove useful for some subjects with high initial model accuracy and requires more sophisticated methods to be practical for a broader range of subjects.

This phase is necessary due to the high non-stationarity of the EEG, since it changes between sessions and users. The calibration process limits the BCI systems to scenarios where the outputs are very controlled, and makes these systems non-friendly and exhausting for the users. Although it has been studied how to reduce calibration time for asynchronous signals, it is still an open issue for event-related potentials. Here, we propose the minimization of the calibration time on singletrial error potentials by using classiﬁers based on inter-subject information. The results show that it is possible to have a classiﬁer with a high performance from the beginning of the experiment, and which is able to adapt itself making the calibration phase shorter and transparent to the user.},

	abstract = {Reliable detection of error from electroencephalography (EEG) signals as feedback while performing a discrete target selection task across sessions and subjects has a huge scope in real-time rehabilitative application of Brain-computer Interfacing (BCI). Error Related Potentials (ErrP) are EEG signals which occur when the participant observes an erroneous feedback from the system. ErrP holds signiﬁcance in such closed-loop system, as BCI is prone to error and we need an effective method of systematic error detection as feedback for correction. In this paper, we have proposed a novel scheme for online detection of error feedback directly from the EEG signal in a transferable environment (i.e., across sessions and across subjects). For this purpose, we have used a P300-speller dataset available on a BCI competition website. The task involves the subject to select a letter of a word which is followed by a feedback period. The feedback period displays the letter selected and, if the selection is wrong, the subject perceives it by the generation of ErrP signal. Our proposed system is designed to detect ErrP present in the EEG from new independent datasets, not involved in its training. Thus, the decoder is trained using EEG features of 16 subjects for single-trial classiﬁcation and tested on 10 independent subjects. The decoder designed for this task is an ensemble of linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression classiﬁer. The performance of the decoder is evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve metric and the results obtained is 73.97, 83.53, and 73.18\%, respectively.},

In this study, we start to investigate different methods to visualise the regions of interest of classiﬁers based on windowed means and on common spatial patterns. Speciﬁcally, we take individually reconstructed source spaces and transform the classiﬁer ﬁlter weights into relevance weights indicating the relative contribution of each source to the classiﬁer.

	abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) are advantageous for investigating cognitive development. However, their application in infants/children is challenging given children’s difficulty in sitting through the multiple trials required in an ERP task. Thus, a large problem in developmental ERP research is high subject exclusion due to too few analyzable trials. Common analytic approaches (that involve averaging trials within subjects and excluding subjects with too few trials, as in ANOVA and linear regression) work around this problem, but do not mitigate it. Moreover, these practices can lead to inaccuracies in measuring neural signals. The greater the subject exclusion, the more problematic inaccuracies can be. We review recent developmental ERP studies to illustrate the prevalence of these issues. Critically, we demonstrate an alternative approach to ERP analysis—­ linear mixed effects (LME) modeling—which offers unique utility in developmental ERP research. We demonstrate with simulated and real ERP data from preschool children that commonly employed ANOVAs yield biased results that become more biased as subject exclusion increases. In contrast, LME models yield accurate, unbiased results even when subjects have low trial-counts, and are better able to detect real condition differences. We include tutorials and example code to facilitate LME analyses in future ERP research.},

	abstract = {Establishing conclusive cortical activity dynamics from neuroimages and high dimensional neuronal data post-processing, such as scalp-EEG/ERP or its localized source data, is always challenging. For addressing this, we introduce LEDA, localized-EEG dynamics analyzer, offering our novel techniques, namely (1)the localized source activity to duration (LSAD) ratio that elegantly combines voxel activation with temporal information enabling a spatiotemporal condition comparison, (2)cortical region’s activation-duration summary generation, (3)anatomical dominance calculator, and (4)voxel activations’ GIF animation extraction feature. They effectively explore and quantify physiological spatiotemporal dynamics and provide insights more intuitive than EEG/ERP biomarkers. To demonstrate, we chose to study sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia for which the P50 wave biomarker is widely discussed. EEG response (64 channels@1 kHz) to auditory paired-click paradigm from 9 patients and 9 controls was processed to ERP. Source localization was achieved by using sLORETA, a widely-used source reconstruction algorithm. LSAD ratio of patients significantly differed from that of controls for the auditory cortical regions (p value {\textless} 0.05). It revealed that inhibitory alpha activity pattern was prominent in parietal, temporal and occipital lobe for controls and not patients. Conversely, the frontal lobe, specifically the middle frontal gyrus, was temporally the most active analogously across all subjects. LEDA also extracted that swift alpha activity exists between 100 and 300 ms time period. These derived results match with existing fMRI studies, speak beyond P50 wave suppression biomarker and emphasize that our methods successfully uncovered meaningful brain mechanisms at high spatiotemporal resolution. They are provided as an open-source MATLAB based toolbox for applicability to other neuronal pathological investigations.},

            Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning (DL) based neural decoders have significantly improved decoding capabilities using scalp electroencephalography (EEG). However, the interpretability of DL models remains an under-explored area. In this study, we compared multiple model explanation methods to identify the most suitable method for EEG and understand when some of these approaches might fail. A simulation framework was developed to evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of twelve back-propagation-based visualization methods by comparing to ground truth features. Multiple methods tested here showed reliability issues after randomizing either model weights or labels: e.g., the saliency approach, which is the most used visualization technique in EEG, was not class or model-specific. We found that DeepLift was consistently accurate as well as robust to detect the three key attributes tested here (temporal, spatial, and spectral precision). Overall, this study provides a review of model explanation methods for DL-based neural decoders and recommendations to understand when some of these methods fail and what they can capture in EEG.},

EEG data acquired from different populations require different cleaning strategies due to the inherent differences in the data quality, the artifacts’ nature, and the employed experimental paradigm. To deal with such differences, we propose a robust EEG bad channel detection method based on the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm. Unlike most existing bad channel detection algorithms that look for the global distribution of channels, LOF identiﬁes bad channels relative to the local cluster of channels, which makes it adaptable to any kind of EEG. To test the performance and versatility of the proposed algorithm, we validated it on EEG acquired from three populations (newborns, infants, and adults) and using two experimental paradigms (event-related and frequency-tagging). We found that LOF can be applied to all kinds of EEG data after calibrating its main hyperparameter: the LOF threshold. We benchmarked the performance of our approach with the existing state-of-the-art (SoA) bad channel detection methods. We found that LOF outperforms all of them by improving the F1 Score, our chosen performance metric, by about 40\% for newborns and infants and 87.5\% for adults.},

	abstract = {The use of electroencephalography (EEG) continuously expanded during the last century leading this recording technique to be the standard in various domains. Considering its poor spatial resolution, many researchers have developed methods to reconstruct cortical source activations from scalp signals, but the lack of ground truth brain activity makes the reconstruction algorithms difficult to validate. To deal with this issue, simulated EEG data can be used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstructed sources. In the literature, benchmark frameworks are proposed to evaluate the reconstruction on fixed pseudo-EEG and other tools allow the user to generate custom data. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the available pipelines proposes a uniform way to validate a reconstruction method from custom pseudo-data. We therefore present our versatile validation framework for EEG-based source localization. This new tool is an all-in-one validation pipeline aiming to evaluate source localization from pseudo-EEG data as close as possible to the experimental environment of the researcher. This paper presents the 5-step framework from the configuration to the evaluation and template data that can be used for benchmarking purposes. By using our uniform region-based evaluation method, researchers will be able to compare their reconstruction method on different configurations that fit their own experimental data.

Several methods solve this problem by imposing different priors on the solution. Machine learning could allow to learn the inverse function directly from the data and thus make the choice of one of the multiple solutions of the inverse problem more reliable. This work is based on simulations of electrophysiologic data containing single or multiple extended sources, using the SEREEGA simulation toolbox [1]. These data are used to train a one-dimensional convolutional network (1DCNN) and to compare the results of this learning approach to those obtained by a recurrent long short term memory (LSTM) network from the literature, and by minimum norm energy [2] (MNE) and standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography [3] (sLORETA) methods. These results on simulated data are encouraging about the potential contribution of learningbased methods to the problem of spatio-temporal EEG source imaging.

	abstract = {Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular method to monitor brain activity, but it is diﬃcult to evaluate EEG-based analysis methods because no groundtruth brain activity is available for comparison. Therefore, in order to test and evaluate such methods, researchers often use simulated EEG data instead of actual EEG recordings. Simulated data can be used, among other things, to assess or compare signal processing and machine learning algorithms, to model EEG variabilities, and to design source reconstruction methods. New method: We present SEREEGA, Simulating Event-Related EEG Activity. SEREEGA is a free and open-source MATLAB-based toolbox dedicated to the generation of simulated epochs of EEG data. It is modular and extensible, at initial release supporting ﬁve diﬀerent publicly available head models and capable of simulating multiple diﬀerent types of signals mimicking brain activity. This paper presents the architecture and general workﬂow of this toolbox, as well as a simulated data set demonstrating some of its functions. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/lrkrol/SEREEGA. Results: The simulated data allows established analysis pipelines and classiﬁcation methods to be applied and is capable of producing realistic results. Comparison with existing methods: Most simulated EEG is coded from scratch. The few open-source methods in existence focus on speciﬁc applications or signal types, such as connectivity. SEREEGA uniﬁes the majority of past simulation methods reported in the literature into one toolbox. Conclusion: SEREEGA is a general-purpose toolbox to simulate ground-truth EEG data.},

	abstract = {The motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography (EEG) has been receiving attention from neural engineering researchers and is being applied to various rehabilitation applications. However, the performance degradation caused by motor imagery EEG with very low single-to-noise ratio faces several application issues with the use of a BCI system. In this paper, we propose a novel motor imagery classiﬁcation scheme based on the continuous wavelet transform and the convolutional neural network. Continuous wavelet transform with three mother wavelets is used to capture a highly informative EEG image by combining time-frequency and electrode location. A convolutional neural network is then designed to both classify motor imagery tasks and reduce computation complexity. The proposed method was validated using two public BCI datasets, BCI competition IV dataset 2b and BCI competition II dataset III. The proposed methods were found to achieve improved classiﬁcation performance compared with the existing methods, thus showcasing the feasibility of motor imagery BCI.},

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in both these processes in the decision-making and action monitoring literatures. Here, we aimed to distinguish between these putative functions with a variant of the Eriksen flanker task that manipulated response requirements (i.e. one or two finger responses). We found that two event-related potentials originating from the dACC (error-related negativity (ERN) and anterior N2) only reflected the representation of the incorrect response: these waveforms were larger when the incorrect response involved two fingers rather than one finger. The increase in ERN magnitude was also accompanied by a reduction in spontaneous error corrections. These results argue that activity in the dACC reflects a process involved in disengaging from an ongoing incorrect action, clearing the way for the correct response.},

This paper, that builds upon previous studies on EEG error-related signals, presents a hybrid approach for human computer interaction that uses human gestures to send commands to a computer and exploits brain activity to provide implicit feedback about the recognition of such commands. Using a simple computer game as a case study, we show that EEG activity evoked by erroneous gesture recognition can be classiﬁed in single trials above random levels. Automatic artifact rejection techniques are used, taking into account that subjects are allowed to move during the experiment. Moreover, we present a simple adaptation mechanism that uses the EEG signal to label newly acquired samples and can be used to re-calibrate the gesture recognition system in a supervised manner. Ofﬂine analysis show that, although the achieved EEG decoding accuracy is far from being perfect, these signals convey sufﬁcient information to signiﬁcantly improve the overall system performance.},

	abstract = {Communication with a robot using brain activity from a human collaborator could provide a direct and fast feedback loop that is easy and natural for the human, thereby enabling a wide variety of intuitive interaction tasks. This paper explores the application of EEG-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to closed-loop robotic control. ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are naturally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classiﬁcation performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for realtime closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as ofﬂine analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened. This work thereby demonstrates the potential for EEG-based feedback methods to facilitate seamless robotic control, and moves closer towards the goal of real-time intuitive interaction.},

	abstract = {Brain computer interfacing is a new paradigm to provide an alternative path of communication for those, who have lost their sensory, motor and autonomous function limb movement from spinal cord injury or other neuronal disorder. To increase living standard of them, a thought controlled robot or robotic arm can be of great importance for their better communication to external world. This paper proposes a novel approach towards electroencephalogram based random order control of a robot manipulator. Here steady state visual evoked potential has been used to select the desired robot link and motor imagery signal has been used to control the motion of robot link. Left and Right hand motor imagery signal has been used in this purpose. Event related error potential is used for feedback purpose and to correct the positional error of link created by motor imagery. The robot link here is realigned by experimental offset. Power spectral density, common spatial pattern and moving average, have been used as feature extractor and support vector machine with linear kernel function has been used as the classifier. At first, the subject has been trained in offline experiment and then online session performance has been evaluated.},

	abstract = {The paper introduces an electroencephalography (EEG) driven online position control scheme for a robot arm by utilizing motor imagery to activate and error related potential (ErrP) to stop the movement of the individual links, following a ﬁxed (pre-deﬁned) order of link selection. The right (left) hand motor imagery is used to turn a link clockwise (counterclockwise) and foot imagery is used to move a link forward. The occurrence of ErrP here indicates that the link under motion crosses the visually ﬁxed target position, which usually is a plane/line/point depending on the desired transition of the link across 3D planes/around 2D lines/along 2D lines respectively. The imagined task about individual link’s movement is decoded by a classiﬁer into three possible class labels: clockwise, counterclockwise and no movement in case of rotational movements and forward, backward and no movement in case of translational movements. One additional classiﬁer is required to detect the occurrence of the ErrP signal, elicited due to visually inspired positional link error with reference to a geometrically selected target position. Wavelet coefﬁcients and adaptive autoregressive parameters are extracted as features for motor imagery and ErrP signals respectively. Support vector machine classiﬁers are used to decode motor imagination and ErrP with high classiﬁcation accuracy above 80 \%. The average time taken by the proposed scheme to decode and execute control intentions for the complete movement of three links of a robot is approximately 33 seconds. The steady-state error and peak overshoot of the proposed controller are experimentally obtained as 1.1 \% and 4.6 \% respectively.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can make mistakes in recognizing user intention. It has been wellestablished that for reactive and motor imagery (MI) BCIs, an error-related potential (ErrP) occurs subsequent to such mistakes, and can be used to improve BCI performance. However, the presence of ErrPs in active BCIs based on non-MI cognitive tasks has not been conﬁrmed. In this study, we attempted to elicit ErrPs in a BCI based on non-MI mental tasks. Twelve typically developed young adults participated in two sessions each. Participants performed multiple iterations of ﬁve different mental tasks (mental arithmetic, counting, word generation, ﬁgure rotation and idle state) to ‘knock down’ one of 4 targets on a graphical interface (each mental task was associated with a different target). To simulate errors, a random subset of 20\% of the trials were followed by incorrect feedback (i.e., the wrong target fell). Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed the presence of an interaction ErrP, with a negative peak at ∼180 ms, followed by two positive peaks, respectively, at ∼400 and ∼630 ms post-feedback onset. The classiﬁcation of mental tasks and error versus non-error trials were both performed using a pseudoonline paradigm where the last quarter of trials were used for testing. For binary (task and idle) and ternary (2 tasks and idle) classiﬁcation, across-participant average accuracies of 76\%±12 and 63\% ±12, respectively, were attained. An average area under curve (AUC) of 0.83 was reached across participants for the detection of ErrPs. After applying ErrP-based error correction, the average binary and ternary classiﬁcation accuracies of mental tasks improved by 9\% and 14\%, respectively. Our ﬁndings support the addition of ErrP detection and ErrP-informed correction to maximize the accuracy of BCIs based on cognitive tasks.},

In this study we investigated if ErrPs can be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during continuous feedback and if ErrPs can be classiﬁed. We recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two diﬀerent types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). ErrPs could be measured in the EEG for both types of errors and we were able to classify both types of errors using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).},

	abstract = {Objective: This work aimed to ﬁnd and evaluate a new method for detecting errors in continuous brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. Instead of classifying errors on a single-trial basis, the new method was based on multiple events (MEs) analysis to increase the accuracy of error detection. Methods: In a BCI-driven car game, based on motor imagery (MI), discrete events were triggered whenever subjects collided with coins and/or barriers. Coins counted as correct events, whereas barriers were errors. This new method, termed ME method, combined and averaged the classiﬁcation results of single events (SEs) and determined the correctness of MI trials, which consisted of event sequences instead of SEs. The beneﬁt of this method was evaluated in an ofﬂine simulation. In an online experiment, the new method was used to detect erroneous MI trials. Such MI trials were discarded and could be repeated by the users. Results: We found that, even with low SE error potential (ErrP) detection rates, feasible accuracies can be achieved when combining MEs to distinguish erroneous from correct MI trials. Online, all subjects reached higher scores with error detection than without, at the cost of longer times needed for completing the game. Conclusion: Findings suggest that ErrP detection may become a reliable tool for monitoring continuous states in BCI applications when combining MEs. Signiﬁcance: This paper demonstrates a novel technique for detecting errors in online continuous BCI applications, which yields promising results even with low single-trial detection rates.},

In this approach, single trial detection of error-related electroencephalography (EEG) potentials is used to infer the optimal agent behavior by decreasing the probability of agent decisions that elicited such potentials. Contrasting with traditional approaches, the user acts as a critic of an external autonomous system instead of continuously generating control commands. This sets a cognitive monitoring loop where the human directly provides information about the overall system performance that, in turn, can be used for its improvement. We show that it is possible to recognize erroneous and correct agent decisions from EEG (average recognition rates of 75.8\% and 63.2\%, respectively), and that the elicited signals are stable over long periods of time (from 50 to 600 days). Moreover, these performances allow to infer the optimal behavior of a simple agent in a brain–computer interaction paradigm after a few trials.},

Several studies show the presence of ErrP in typical choice reaction tasks. However, in the context of a BCI, the central question is: “Are ErrP also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition of the subject’s intent?” We have thus explored whether ErrP also follow a feedback indicating incorrect responses of the simulated BCI interface. Five healthy volunteer subjects participated in a new human–robot interaction experiment, which seem to conﬁrm the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. However, in order to exploit these ErrP, we need to detect them in each single trial using a short window following the feedback associated to the response of the BCI.

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces, as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.g., muscular activity, speech and gestures), are prone to errors in the recognition of subject’s intent. In this paper we exploit a unique feature of the “brain channel”, namely that it carries information about cognitive states that are crucial for a purposeful interaction. One of these states is the awareness of erroneous responses. Different physiological studies have shown the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after people get aware they have made an error. However, for human-computer interaction, the central question is whether ErrP are also elicited when the error is made by the interface during the recognition of the subject’s intent and no longer by errors of the subject himself. In this paper we report experimental results with three volunteer subjects during a simple human-robot interaction (i.e., bringing the robot to either the left or right side of a room) that seem to reveal a new kind of ErrP, which is satisfactorily recognized in single trials. These recognition rates signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the brain interface.},

An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists of a veriﬁcation procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Two healthy volunteer subjects with little prior BCI experience participated in a real-time human-robot interaction experiment where they were asked to mentally move a cursor towards a target that can be reached within a few steps using motor imagery. These experiments conﬁrm the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. These “Interaction ErrP” exhibit a ﬁrst sharp negative peak followed by a positive peak and a second broader negative peak (∼270, ∼330 and ∼430 ms after the feedback, respectively). The objective of the present study was to simultaneously detect erroneous responses of the interface and classifying motor imagery at the level of single trials in a real-time system. We have achieved online an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 84.7\% and 78.8\%, respectively. The oﬀ-line post-analysis showed that the BCI error rate without the integration of ErrP detection is around 30\% for both subjects. However, when integrating ErrP detection, the average online error rate drops to 7\%, multiplying the bit rate by more than 3. These results show that it’s possible to simultaneously extract in real-time useful information for mental control to operate a brain-actuated device as well as correlates of cognitive states such as error-related potentials to improve the quality of the brain-computer interaction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The differences between erroneous actions that are consciously perceived as errors and those that go unnoticed have recently become an issue in the field of performance monitoring. In EEG studies, error awareness has been suggested to influence the error positivity (Pe) of the response-locked event-related brain potential, a positive voltage deflection prominent approximately 300 msec after error commission, whereas the preceding error-related negativity (ERN) seemed to be unaffected by error awareness. Erroneous actions, in general, have been shown to promote several changes in ongoing autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, yet such investigations have only rarely taken into account the question of subjective error awareness. In the first part of this study, heart rate, pupillometry, and EEG were recorded during an antisaccade task to measure autonomic arousal and activity of the CNS separately for perceived and unperceived errors. Contrary to our expectations, we observed differences in both Pe and ERN with respect to subjective error awareness. This was replicated in a second experiment, using a modified version of the same task. In line with our predictions, only perceived errors provoke the previously established post-error heart rate deceleration. Also, pupil size yields a more prominent dilatory effect after an erroneous saccade, which is also significantly larger for perceived than unperceived errors. On the basis of the ERP and ANS results as well as brain–behavior correlations, we suggest a novel interpretation of the implementation and emergence of error awareness in the brain. In our framework, several systems generate input signals (e.g., ERN, sensory input, proprioception) that influence the emergence of error awareness, which is then accumulated and presumably reflected in later potentials, such as the Pe.},

	abstract = {One of the main problems of EEG-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) is their low information rate, thus for complex tasks the user needs large amounts of time to solve the task. In an attempt to reduce this time and improve the application robustness, recent works have explored sharedcontrol strategies where the device does not only execute the decoded commands, but it is also involved in executing the task. This work proposes a shared-control BCI using error potentials for a 2D reaching task with discrete actions and states. The proposed system has several interesting properties: the system is scalable without increasing the complexity of the user’s mental task; the interaction is natural for the user, as the mental task is to monitor the device performance to promote its task learning (in this context the reaching task); and the system has the potential to be combined with additional brain signals to recover or learn from interaction errors. Online control experiments were performed with four subjects, showing that it was possible to reach a goal location from any starting point within a 5x5 grid in around 23 actions (about 19 seconds of EEG signal), both with ﬁxed goals and goals freely chosen by the users.},

In this approach, single trial detection of error-related electroencephalography (EEG) potentials is used to infer the optimal agent behavior by decreasing the probability of agent decisions that elicited such potentials. Contrasting with traditional approaches, the user acts as a critic of an external autonomous system instead of continuously generating control commands. This sets a cognitive monitoring loop where the human directly provides information about the overall system performance that, in turn, can be used for its improvement. We show that it is possible to recognize erroneous and correct agent decisions from EEG (average recognition rates of 75.8\% and 63.2\%, respectively), and that the elicited signals are stable over long periods of time (from 50 to 600 days). Moreover, these performances allow to infer the optimal behavior of a simple agent in a brain–computer interaction paradigm after a few trials.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied in robotics to learn how to solve tasks based on reward signals obtained during task execution. These reward signals are usually modeled by the programmer or provided by supervision. However, there are situations in which this reward is hard to encode, and so would require a supervised approach of reinforcement learning, where a user directly types the reward on each trial. This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an EEG-based BCI system as reward signals. The idea is to obtain the reward from the activity generated while observing the robot solving the task. This process does not require an explicit model of the reward signal. Moreover, it is possible to capture subjective aspects which are speciﬁc to each user. To achieve this, we designed a new protocol to use brain activity related to the correct or wrong execution of the task. We showed that it is possible to detect and classify different levels of error in single trials. We also showed that it is possible to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to learn new similar tasks using the rewards obtained from brain activity.},

They provide a way to recognize misinterpreted commands in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, this has been evaluated online in only a couple of studies and mostly with very few subjects. In this study, we implemented a P300-based BCI, including not only online error detection but also, for the first time, automatic correction. We evaluated it in 16 healthy volunteers. Whenever an error was detected, a new decision was made based on the second best guess of a probabilistic classifier. At the group level, correction did neither improve nor deteriorate spelling accuracy. However, automatic correction yielded a higher bit rate than a respelling strategy. Furthermore, the fine examination of interindividual differences in the efficiency of error correction and spelling clearly distinguished between two groups who differed according to individual specificity in ErrP detection. The high specificity group had larger evoked responses and made fewer errors which were corrected more efficiently, yielding a 4\% improvement in spelling accuracy and a higher bit rate. Altogether, our results suggest that the more the subject is engaged into the task, the more useful and well accepted the automatic error correction.},

In this paper we report experimental results with three volunteer subjects during a simple human-robot interaction (i.e., bringing the robot to either the left or right side of a room) that seem to reveal a new kind of ErrP, which is satisfactorily recognized in single trials.

	abstract = {Background: EEG-based communication could be a valuable new augmentative communication technology for those with severe motor disabilities. Like all communication methods, it faces the problem of errors in transmission. In the Wadsworth EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system, subjects learn to use mu or beta rhythm amplitude to move a cursor to targets on a computer screen. While cursor movement is highly accurate in trained subjects, it is not perfect.
Methods: In an effort to develop a method for detecting errors, this study compared the EEG immediately after correct target selection to that after incorrect selection.
Results: The data showed that a mistake is followed by a positive potential centered at the vertex that peaks about 180 ms after the incorrect selection.
Conclusion: The results suggest that this error potential might provide a method for detecting and voiding errors that requires no additional time and could thereby improve the speed and accuracy of EEG-based communication. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective. Making mistakes is inevitable, but identifying them allows us to correct or adapt our behavior to improve future performance. Current brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) make errors that need to be explicitly corrected by the user, thereby consuming time and thus hindering performance. We hypothesized that neural correlates of the user perceiving the mistake could be used by the BMI to automatically correct errors. However, it was unknown whether intracortical outcome error signals were present in the premotor and primary motor cortices, brain regions successfully used for intracortical BMIs. Approach. We report here for the first time a putative outcome error signal in spiking activity within these cortices when rhesus macaques performed an intracortical BMI computer cursor task. Main results. We decoded BMI trial outcomes shortly after and even before a trial ended with 96\% and 84\% accuracy, respectively. This led us to develop and implement in real-time a first-of-its-kind intracortical BMI error ‘detect-and-act’ system that attempts to automatically ‘undo’ or ‘prevent’ mistakes. The detect-and-act system works independently and in parallel to a kinematic BMI decoder. In a challenging task that resulted in substantial errors, this approach improved the performance of a BMI employing two variants of the ubiquitous Kalman velocity filter, including a state-of-theart decoder (ReFIT-KF). Significance. Detecting errors in real-time from the same brain regions that are commonly used to control BMIs should improve the clinical viability of BMIs aimed at restoring motor function to people with paralysis.},

	volume = {63},
	abstract = {Objective: This work aimed to ﬁnd and evaluate a new method for detecting errors in continuous brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. Instead of classifying errors on a single-trial basis, the new method was based on multiple events (MEs) analysis to increase the accuracy of error detection. Methods: In a BCI-driven car game, based on motor imagery (MI), discrete events were triggered whenever subjects collided with coins and/or barriers. Coins counted as correct events, whereas barriers were errors. This new method, termed ME method, combined and averaged the classiﬁcation results of single events (SEs) and determined the correctness of MI trials, which consisted of event sequences instead of SEs. The beneﬁt of this method was evaluated in an ofﬂine simulation. In an online experiment, the new method was used to detect erroneous MI trials. Such MI trials were discarded and could be repeated by the users. Results: We found that, even with low SE error potential (ErrP) detection rates, feasible accuracies can be achieved when combining MEs to distinguish erroneous from correct MI trials. Online, all subjects reached higher scores with error detection than without, at the cost of longer times needed for completing the game. Conclusion: Findings suggest that ErrP detection may become a reliable tool for monitoring continuous states in BCI applications when combining MEs. Signiﬁcance: This paper demonstrates a novel technique for detecting errors in online continuous BCI applications, which yields promising results even with low single-trial detection rates.},

	abstract = {Objective: Error-related potentials (ErrP) have been proposed as an intuitive feedback signal decoded from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) of a human observer for improving human-robot interaction (HRI). While recent demonstrations of this approach have successfully studied the use of ErrPs as a teaching signal for robot skill learning, so far, no eﬀorts have been made towards HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required. These are collaborative or social interactive scenarios without predeﬁned dominancy of the human partner and robots being perceived as intentional agents. Here we explore the usability of ErrPs as a feedback signal from the human for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction. Approach: We experimentally demonstrate ErrPs-based mediation of co-adaptation in a human-robot interaction study where successful interaction depended on co-adaptive convergence to a consensus between them. While subjects adapted to the robot by reﬂecting upon its behavior, the robot adapted its behavior based on ErrPs decoded online from the human partner’s ongoing EEG. Main results: ErrPs were decoded online in single trial with an avg. accuracy of 81.8±8.0\% across 13 subjects, which was suﬃcient for eﬀective adaptation of robot behavior. Successful co-adaptation was demonstrated by signiﬁcant improvements in humanrobot interaction eﬃcacy and eﬃciency, and by the robot behavior that emerged during co-adaptation. These results indicate the potential of ErrPs as a useful feedback signal for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction as demonstrated in a practical example. Signiﬁcance: As robots become more autonomous and widely embedded in society, methods for aligning them to human expectations and conventions will become increasingly important in the future. In this quest, ErrPs may constitute a promising complementary feedback signal for guiding adaptations towards human preferences. In this paper we extended previous research to less constrained HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can make mistakes in recognizing user intention. It has been wellestablished that for reactive and motor imagery (MI) BCIs, an error-related potential (ErrP) occurs subsequent to such mistakes, and can be used to improve BCI performance. However, the presence of ErrPs in active BCIs based on non-MI cognitive tasks has not been conﬁrmed. In this study, we attempted to elicit ErrPs in a BCI based on non-MI mental tasks. Twelve typically developed young adults participated in two sessions each. Participants performed multiple iterations of ﬁve different mental tasks (mental arithmetic, counting, word generation, ﬁgure rotation and idle state) to ‘knock down’ one of 4 targets on a graphical interface (each mental task was associated with a different target). To simulate errors, a random subset of 20\% of the trials were followed by incorrect feedback (i.e., the wrong target fell). Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed the presence of an interaction ErrP, with a negative peak at ∼180 ms, followed by two positive peaks, respectively, at ∼400 and ∼630 ms post-feedback onset. The classiﬁcation of mental tasks and error versus non-error trials were both performed using a pseudoonline paradigm where the last quarter of trials were used for testing. For binary (task and idle) and ternary (2 tasks and idle) classiﬁcation, across-participant average accuracies of 76\%±12 and 63\% ±12, respectively, were attained. An average area under curve (AUC) of 0.83 was reached across participants for the detection of ErrPs. After applying ErrP-based error correction, the average binary and ternary classiﬁcation accuracies of mental tasks improved by 9\% and 14\%, respectively. Our ﬁndings support the addition of ErrP detection and ErrP-informed correction to maximize the accuracy of BCIs based on cognitive tasks.},

	abstract = {Objective: Brain computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classiﬁers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that speciﬁc signal. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classiﬁcation, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from diﬀerent BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible (deﬁned as the number of parameters in the model). Approach: In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-speciﬁc model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classiﬁcation, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Results: We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available. We also show that EEGNet eﬀectively generalizes to both ERP and oscillatory-based BCIs. In addition, we demonstrate three diﬀerent approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Signiﬁcance: Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks, suggesting that the observed performances were not due to artifact or noise sources in the data.

Most BMI systems are designed exclusively to control devices using lowlevel commands, or high-level commands when devices with pre-programmed functionalities are available. In this paper, we build on our previous work on BMI-based Learning System in which we presented a different approach for designing BMI systems that incorporate learning capabilities that relieve the user from tedious low-level control. In this work, we extend the capabilities of our framework to allow a user to be able to teach and evaluate a robotic system by using a BMI. We provide general system architecture and demonstrate its applicability in new domains such as teaching a humanoid robot object manipulation skills and evaluating its performance. Our approach consists of 1) tele-operating robot’s actions while robot’s camera collects object’s visual properties, 2) learning manipulation skills (i.e. push-left, lift-up, etc.) by approximating a posterior probability of commonly performed actions when observing similar properties, and 3) evaluating robot’s performance by considering brain-based error perception of the human while he/she passively observes the robot performing the learned skill. This technique consists of monitoring EEG signals to detect a brain potential called error related negativity (ERN) that spontaneously occurs when the user perceives an error made by the robot. By using human error perception, we demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate robot actions and provide feedback to improve its learning performance. We present results from ﬁve human subjects who successfully used our framework to teach a humanoid robot how to manipulate diverse objects, and evaluate robot skills by visual observation.},

In our previous study, we proposed an intrinsic interactive reinforcement learning approach for human-robot interaction, in which a robot learns his/her action strategy based on intrinsic human feedback that is generated in the human’s brain as neural signature of the human’s implicit evaluation of the robot’s actions. Our approach has an inherent property that allows robots to adapt their behavior depending on online changes of the human’s current intents. Such ﬂexible adaptation is possible, since robot learning is updated in real time by human’s online feedback. In this paper, the adaptivity of robot learning is tested on eight subjects who change their current control strategy by adding a new gesture to the previous used gestures. This paper evaluates the learning progress by analyzing learning phases (before and after adding a new gesture for control). The results show that the robot can adapt the previously learned policy depending on online changes of the user’s intents. Especially, learning progress is interrelated with the classiﬁcation performance of electroencephalograms (EEGs), which are used to measure the human’s implicit evaluation of the robot’s actions.},

However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this setting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good at assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous works have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal, measurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the task being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to accelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns the task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded and decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior policy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL learning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a simple robotic navigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or fails to advance to the goal.},

            Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are the neural signature of error processing. Therefore, the detection of ErrPs is an intuitive approach to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The incorporation of ErrPs in discrete BCIs is well established but the study of asynchronous detection of ErrPs is still in its early stages. Here we show the feasibility of asynchronously decoding ErrPs in an online scenario. For that, we measured EEG in 15 participants while they controlled a robotic arm towards a target using their right hand. In 30\% of the trials, the control of the robotic arm was halted at an unexpected moment (error onset) in order to trigger error-related potentials. When an ErrP was detected after the error onset, participants regained the control of the robot and could finish the trial. Regarding the asynchronous classification in the online scenario, we obtained an average true positive rate (TPR) of 70\% and an average true negative rate (TNR) of 86.8\%. These results indicate that the online asynchronous decoding of ErrPs was, on average, reliable, showing the feasibility of the asynchronous decoding of ErrPs in an online scenario.},

This also impacts the time required to train a classiﬁer for a brain–computer interface (BCI). This issue is mainly due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the large ﬂuctuations of the EEG caused by several sources of variability. One of these sources is directly related to the experimental protocol or application designed, and may affect the amplitude or latency of ERPs. This usually prevents BCI classiﬁers from generalizing among different experimental protocols. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the amplitude and the latency variations among different experimental protocols based on the same type of ERP. Approach. We present a method to analyze and compensate for the latency variations in BCI applications. The algorithm has been tested on two widely used ERPs (P300 and observation error potentials), in three experimental protocols in each case. We report the ERP analysis and single-trial classiﬁcation.

This paper proposes an application oriented approach to minimize the calibration time by transferring a classiﬁer between different types of error related potentials (ErrPs). A classiﬁer trained to detect a certain brain pattern is used to later detect a brain pattern which is expected to be similar to the ﬁrst one. In the here presented approach, two different tasks (interaction task/observation task) are performed within one scenario which is developed to generate two types of ErrPs: interaction ErrPs and observation ErrPs. Since almost twice as much training data can be generated while performing the observation task compared to the interaction task within the same calibration time, we use the classiﬁer trained on the data containing observation ErrPs to evaluate it’s performance on the data containing the interaction ErrPs. Presented results support our approach. We show that a single trial detection of interaction ErrPs using the classiﬁer trained on observation ErrPs is possible and results on average in a high detection performance of 0.77 balanced accuracy [(TPR+TNR)/2], i.e., an average of recognition rate of correct and erroneous trials of 77\%. Without such classiﬁer transfer, the classiﬁcation performance of observation and interaction ErrPs is on average slightly higher (0.80 and 0.81 balanced accuracy, respectively). Our results suggest that classiﬁer transfer is feasible and reduces calibration time. This is a relevant result from the perspective of applying an ErrP-based brain-computer interface in a realistic scenario in robotics.},

            Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are the neural signature of error processing. Therefore, the detection of ErrPs is an intuitive approach to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The incorporation of ErrPs in discrete BCIs is well established but the study of asynchronous detection of ErrPs is still in its early stages. Here we show the feasibility of asynchronously decoding ErrPs in an online scenario. For that, we measured EEG in 15 participants while they controlled a robotic arm towards a target using their right hand. In 30\% of the trials, the control of the robotic arm was halted at an unexpected moment (error onset) in order to trigger error-related potentials. When an ErrP was detected after the error onset, participants regained the control of the robot and could finish the trial. Regarding the asynchronous classification in the online scenario, we obtained an average true positive rate (TPR) of 70\% and an average true negative rate (TNR) of 86.8\%. These results indicate that the online asynchronous decoding of ErrPs was, on average, reliable, showing the feasibility of the asynchronous decoding of ErrPs in an online scenario.},

Here, we investigated the eﬀect of ErrPguided error correction in a three-class, active BCI based on cognitive rather than motor imagery tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). Ten able-bodied adults participated in three sessions of data collection. For each participant, a ternary BCI diﬀerentiated among idle state and two personally selected cognitive tasks (e.g. mental arithmetic, counting, word generation, and ﬁgure rotation). Real-time feedback of the BCI decision was displayed to the participant following each task. EEG data after feedback onset were used to detect ErrPs and correct the BCI’s output in the case of detected errors. ErrP-based error correction modestly but signiﬁcantly improved the average online task classiﬁcation accuracy (+7\%) as well as the information transfer rate (+0.9 bits/min) of the ternary BCI across participants.

To overcome the limitations, this study introduced the electroencephalography (EEG)-measured errorrelated potentials (ErrPs) to train a robotic RL system based on a brain-computer interface (BCI). We decoded ErrP signals by selecting human preferences in real-time to train robotic behavior by deep RL during a binary object selection task. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the ErrP experiments, in which they were asked to select and adjust self-favored behavior after a machine’s random selections. The decoded ErrP signals classiﬁed by a convolutional neural network (CNN)architecture to achieve an average classiﬁcation accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 67.49\% and 0.639, respectively. By using the well-trained ErrP signals classiﬁer to train the deep RL system, our ﬁnal results for training robotic behavior through ErrP-based preferences showed an average of 15.21\% improvement in efﬁciency while obtaining acceptable rewards in RL. Thus, the work used brain signals instead of pressing or clicking buttons as the rewards of RL, and constructed a real-time and free from interaction interference intuitive RL system.},

	abstract = {In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, the non-stationarity of brain signals is known to be a challenge for training robust classifiers as other brain processes produce signals that coincide with those resulting from the desired brain activity. One source of interference is the user's cognitive response to the provided BCI feedback. In the case of motor imagery paradigms, this feedback can for instance be a cursor moving on the screen. The response to such feedback has been shown in general to be a source of noise that can add to the non-stationarity of the brain signal; however, in this work, we show that the user’s brain response to this feedback can be used to improve the BCI performance. We first show in a motor imagery task that the user’s brain responds to the direction of cursor movement, which is different for the cursor moving towards or away from the target (i.e. BCI feedback), and this feedback-related information is present in frequency bands similar to those used in motor imagery. Next, we propose a classifier that combines the user response to feedback together with the motor imagery signal itself, and show that this combined classifier can significantly outperform a conventional motor imagery classifier. Our results show an average of 11\% and up to 22\% improvement in classification accuracy across 10 participants.},

First, we present a mechanism for obtaining P300-conﬁdence using a realtime Bayesian dynamic stopping framework that makes novel use of additional stimuli that occur due to epoch and ﬁlter delays.

Automatic correction increased selection accuracy by 13.67\% and utility grew by a factor of 4.48.

Whenever an error was detected, a new decision was made based on the second best guess of a probabilistic classifier. At the group level, correction did neither improve nor deteriorate spelling accuracy. However, automatic correction yielded a higher bit rate than a respelling strategy. Furthermore, the fine examination of interindividual differences in the efficiency of error correction and spelling clearly distinguished between two groups who differed according to individual specificity in ErrP detection. The high specificity group had larger evoked responses and made fewer errors which were corrected more efficiently, yielding a 4\% improvement in spelling accuracy and a higher bit rate.

	abstract = {The brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is a new human-machine interaction technology that realizes people to control external devices directly by thinking (i.e. electroencephalogram, EEG). However, because of the weakness and randomness of EEG signal, it is very complicated and difficult to process and identify the EEG signal recorded by the non-invasive BCI, and the decoding error often occurs. In view of the brain electrical signal decoding error, an experimental paradigm for simultaneous acquisition of spontaneous EEG and evoked EEG was designed, where the subjects generated the error-related potentials (ErrP) based on the decoded feedback of motor imagery EEG. We analyzed the EEG signal two times. The motor imagery EEG, which was the component of the EEG signal, was analyzed at the first time analysis. We classified the motor imagery EEG signal of left and right hand, then analyzed the classification method quantitatively using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Although the EEG signal were influenced greatly by the individual difference, the AUC values can still reach more than 0.7. Meanwhile, the frequency domain characteristics were analyzed. The activation brain regions of the left-right hand motor imagery are mainly concentrated in the area of the perceptual motor cortex where is responsible for hand motion, but they will also be influenced by the artifacts of the surrounding channels. In the second time analysis, the ErrP was extracted and discussed. Its latency, waveform and amplitude characteristics were studied in the time domain and then a suitable classifier is selected by comparing a variety of classifiers, which classification accuracy is up to 90\%. Therefore, the research based on the ErrP signal played a theoretical foundation for applying to the lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot in the future, and ensured the feasibility of applying the command confirmation unit based on ErrP signal to the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot.},

In an attempt to reduce this time and improve the application robustness, recent works have explored sharedcontrol strategies where the device does not only execute the decoded commands, but it is also involved in executing the task. This work proposes a shared-control BCI using error potentials for a 2D reaching task with discrete actions and states. The proposed system has several interesting properties: the system is scalable without increasing the complexity of the user’s mental task; the interaction is natural for the user, as the mental task is to monitor the device performance to promote its task learning (in this context the reaching task); and the system has the potential to be combined with additional brain signals to recover or learn from interaction errors. Online control experiments were performed with four subjects, showing that it was possible to reach a goal location from any starting point within a 5x5 grid in around 23 actions (about 19 seconds of EEG signal), both with ﬁxed goals and goals freely chosen by the users.},

We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classiﬁcation performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for realtime closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as ofﬂine analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened. This work thereby demonstrates the potential for EEG-based feedback methods to facilitate seamless robotic control, and moves closer towards the goal of real-time intuitive interaction.},

To increase living standard of them, a thought controlled robot or robotic arm can be of great importance for their better communication to external world. This paper proposes a novel approach towards electroencephalogram based random order control of a robot manipulator. Here steady state visual evoked potential has been used to select the desired robot link and motor imagery signal has been used to control the motion of robot link. Left and Right hand motor imagery signal has been used in this purpose. Event related error potential is used for feedback purpose and to correct the positional error of link created by motor imagery. The robot link here is realigned by experimental offset. Power spectral density, common spatial pattern and moving average, have been used as feature extractor and support vector machine with linear kernel function has been used as the classifier. At first, the subject has been trained in offline experiment and then online session performance has been evaluated.},

	abstract = {The paper introduces an electroencephalography (EEG) driven online position control scheme for a robot arm by utilizing motor imagery to activate and error related potential (ErrP) to stop the movement of the individual links, following a ﬁxed (pre-deﬁned) order of link selection. The right (left) hand motor imagery is used to turn a link clockwise (counterclockwise) and foot imagery is used to move a link forward. The occurrence of ErrP here indicates that the link under motion crosses the visually ﬁxed target position, which usually is a plane/line/point depending on the desired transition of the link across 3D planes/around 2D lines/along 2D lines respectively. The imagined task about individual link’s movement is decoded by a classiﬁer into three possible class labels: clockwise, counterclockwise and no movement in case of rotational movements and forward, backward and no movement in case of translational movements. One additional classiﬁer is required to detect the occurrence of the ErrP signal, elicited due to visually inspired positional link error with reference to a geometrically selected target position. Wavelet coefﬁcients and adaptive autoregressive parameters are extracted as features for motor imagery and ErrP signals respectively. Support vector machine classiﬁers are used to decode motor imagination and ErrP with high classiﬁcation accuracy above 80 \%. The average time taken by the proposed scheme to decode and execute control intentions for the complete movement of three links of a robot is approximately 33 seconds. The steady-state error and peak overshoot of the proposed controller are experimentally obtained as 1.1 \% and 4.6 \% respectively.},

Most work has considered reinforcement learning frameworks were human feedback, provided through multiple modalities (speech, graphical interfaces, gestures) is converted into a reward. This paper explores a different communication channel: cognitive EEG brain signals related to the perception of errors by humans. In particular, we consider error potentials (ErrP), voltage deﬂections appearing when a user perceives an error, either committed by herself or by an external machine, thus encoding binary information about how a robot is performing a task. Based on this potential, we propose an algorithm based on policy matching for inverse reinforcement learning to infer the user goal from brain signals. We present two cases of study involving a target reaching task in a grid world and using a real mobile robot, respectively. For discrete worlds, the results show that the robot is able to infer and reach the target using only error potentials as feedback elicited from human observation. Finally, promising preliminary results were obtained for continuous states and actions in real scenarios.},

In this context, Error-related potentials (ErrPs), temporal deﬂections in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals when humans perceive erroneous actions, have been exploited to teach correct policies to agents. However, previous works have shared same objective criteria to evaluate actions of agents across humans. Therefore, it is yet an open question whether ErrPs are elicited when humans assess actions based on individual subjective criteria, and if such neuronal activities can be exploited in BCIs to enhance personalized human computer interactions. In this work, we evaluate whether ErrPs are elicited while humans assess actions based on individual subjective criteria. For this purpose, we analyze EEG signals while humans evaluate trajectories performed by the robot to avoid an obstacle. We show that the ErrP can be generated even while the human evaluates the action based on his/her subjective criteria, and that such neuronal activity reveals subjective aspects when assessing the appropriateness of the action. These ﬁndings open the door to the exploitation of neural correlates for the personalized human computer interactions, and thus to building adaptable, individualized neuroprosthetic devices.},

The idea to automatically detect error-related potentials (ErrPs) in order to veto erroneous decisions of a BCI has been existing for more than one decade, but this approach was so far little investigated in online mode.
Methods: In our study with eleven participants, an ErrP detection mechanism was implemented in an electroencephalography (EEG) based gaze-independent visual speller.
Results: Single-trial ErrPs were detected with a mean accuracy of 89.1\% (AUC 0.90). The spelling speed was increased on average by 49.0\% using ErrP detection. The improvement in spelling speed due to error detection was largest for participants with low spelling accuracy.
Conclusion: The performance of BCIs can be increased by using an automatic error detection mechanism. The benefit for patients with motor disorders is potentially high since they often have rather low spelling accuracies compared to healthy people.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as any other interaction modality based on physiological signals and body channels (e.g., muscular activity, speech and gestures), are prone to errors in the recognition of subject’s intent. An elegant approach to improve the accuracy of BCIs consists of a veriﬁcation procedure directly based on the presence of error-related potentials (ErrP) in the EEG recorded right after the occurrence of an error. Two healthy volunteer subjects with little prior BCI experience participated in a real-time human-robot interaction experiment where they were asked to mentally move a cursor towards a target that can be reached within a few steps using motor imagery. These experiments conﬁrm the previously reported presence of a new kind of ErrP. These “Interaction ErrP” exhibit a ﬁrst sharp negative peak followed by a positive peak and a second broader negative peak (∼270, ∼330 and ∼430 ms after the feedback, respectively). The objective of the present study was to simultaneously detect erroneous responses of the interface and classifying motor imagery at the level of single trials in a real-time system. We have achieved online an average recognition rate of correct and erroneous single trials of 84.7\% and 78.8\%, respectively. The oﬀ-line post-analysis showed that the BCI error rate without the integration of ErrP detection is around 30\% for both subjects. However, when integrating ErrP detection, the average online error rate drops to 7\%, multiplying the bit rate by more than 3. These results show that it’s possible to simultaneously extract in real-time useful information for mental control to operate a brain-actuated device as well as correlates of cognitive states such as error-related potentials to improve the quality of the brain-computer interaction.},

In this context, electrophysiological measures of error detection, directly measured from a person’s brain activity as Error-related Potentials (ErrPs), can be exploited to provide passive adaptation of an external semi-autonomous system to the human. This concept was implemented in an online robot learning task, where user’s evaluation of the robot’s actions, in terms of detected ErrP, was exploited to update a reward function in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Results from both simulated and experimental studies show that the introduction of human evaluation in the robot learning loop allows for: (1) the acceleration of optimal policy learning in a target reaching task, (2) the introduction of a further degree of control in robot learning, namely identiﬁcation of one among multiple targets, according to the user’s will.

Many applications have been developed to assist motor-impaired people in their rehabilitation and among these are robots, spellers, gesture recognition systems, and braincontrolled wheelchairs. In this paper, we present a review of various ErrP based BCI that can potentially aid motor-disabled people in their rehabilitation and execution of their daily activities. First, we describe the ErrP phenomenon and its characteristics followed by a comprehensive application-driven discussion on ErrP based rehabilitation and assistive strategies for motor-impaired people, including studies conducted since the inception of ErrP to the current state-of-the-art applications.
