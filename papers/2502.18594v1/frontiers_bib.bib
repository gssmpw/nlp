              Objective
              . Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems read and interpret brain activity directly from the brain. They can provide a means of communication or locomotion for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. However, non-stationarity of brain activity limits the reliable transfer of the algorithms that were trained during a calibration session to real-time BCI control. One source of non-stationarity is the user’s brain response to the BCI output (feedback), for instance, whether the BCI feedback is perceived as an error by the user or not. By taking such sources of non-stationarity into account, the reliability of the BCI can be improved.
              Approach
              . In this work, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of a hybrid motor imagery BCI combining the information from the motor imagery signal and the error-related brain activity simultaneously so as to gain benefit from both sources.
              Main results
              . We show significantly improved performance in real-time BCI control across 12 participants, compared to a conventional motor imagery BCI. The significant improvement is in terms of classification accuracy, target hit rate, subjective perception of control and information-transfer rate. Moreover, our offline analyses of the recorded EEG data show that the error-related brain activity provides a more reliable source of information than the motor imagery signal.
              Significance
              . This work shows, for the first time, that the error-related brain activity classifier compared to the motor imagery classifier is more consistent when trained on calibration data and tested during online control. This likely explains why the proposed hybrid BCI allows for a more reliable means of communication or rehabilitation for patients in need.},

Error potentials generated in response to an error made by the translation algorithm can be used to improve the performance of a BCI, as a feedback extracted from the user and fed into the BCI system. The present study addresses the inclusion of error potentials in a BCI system based on the decoding of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) associated to the speed of a task. First, we theoretically quantiﬁed the improvement in accuracy of a BCI system when using error potentials for correcting the output decision, in the general case of multiclass BCI. The derived theoretical expressions can be used during the design phase of any BCI system. They were applied to experimentally estimated accuracies in decoding MRCPs and error potentials. Second we studied in simulation the performance of the closed-loop system in order to evaluate its ability to adapt to the changes in the mental states of the user. By setting the parameters of the simulator to experimentally determined values, we showed that updating the learning set with the examples estimated as correct based on the decoding of error potentials leads to convergence to the optimal solution.},

However, BCI systems are cumbersome in the training phase, and command recognition is subject to error. Error-related potentials (ErrPs) have been incorporated in BCI systems to enhance system performance. To this end, this paper proposes an online neurofeedback (NF) closed-loop system to verify the utility of ErrPs in a visual-motor imagery-based BCI system that continuously optimizes the classifier through the detection of ErrPs and improves the classification accuracy of the system. Our proposed channel-weighted common spatial pattern (CWCSP) novel algorithm is combined with the ErrPs detection mechanism to realize a system that can be used with small training samples and optimize the classifier while automatically expanding the training samples as the experiment proceeds. We analyzed the accuracy enhancement of the adaptive classification system and investigated the neural mechanism behind ErrPs. ErrP detection is used to correct decoding results so that the experimental data and the corrected labels are incorporated into the training set, and is then used to expand the training samples to optimize the classifier, showing good adaptive performance. This indicates that the system can effectively expand training samples and improve the decoding ability of a BCI system with a small number of training samples as the experiment progresses.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using Electroencephalography (EEG) have drawn attention to providing alternative control pathways for users with motor disabilities or even the general public in real-world environments due to their robustness, relatively low cost, and high portability. However, EEG still suffers from large variability between subjects or between sessions of an individual subject. To obtain optimal performance, a BCI usually requires a user to go through a calibration process to ﬁne-tune the model. This calibration process is usually long and could hinder the practicality of a BCI. In this study, we propose a closed-loop framework that monitors the user EEG responses to the action of a BCI. If an Error-related Potential (ErrP) is detected in the response, it is indicated that the BCI is making a wrong prediction. By using the information from this ErrP detector, we can include online testing trials into the training pool and further ﬁne-tune the model over the time the BCI is used. Results suggest that the proposed framework can reach better results with a few additional trials when compared to the model pretrained from some existing data. Also, the performance of the proposed model can gradually converge to a fully calibrated model, which suggests that the conventional calibration process could be replaced by online training.},

	abstract = {Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are brain signals known to be generated as a reaction to erroneous events. Several works have shown that not only self-made errors but also mistakes generated by external agents can elicit such event-related potentials. The possibility of reliably measuring ErrPs through non-invasive techniques has increased the interest in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community in using such signals to improve performance, for example, by performing error correction. Extensive calibration sessions are typically necessary to gather sufficient trials for training subject-specific ErrP classifiers. This procedure is not only time-consuming but also boresome for participants. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of ErrPs in closed-loop systems, emphasizing their dependency on precise single-trial classification. To guarantee the presence of an ErrPs signal in the data we employ and to ensure that the parameters defining ErrPs are systematically varied, we utilize the open-source toolbox SEREEGA for data simulation. We generated training instances and evaluated the performance of the generic classifier on both simulated and real-world datasets, proposing a promising alternative to conventional calibration techniques. Results show that a generic support vector machine classifier reaches balanced accuracies of 72.9\%, 62.7\%, 71.0\%, and 70.8\% on each validation dataset. While performing similarly to a leave-one-subject-out approach for error class detection, the proposed classifier shows promising generalization across different datasets and subjects without further adaptation. Moreover, by utilizing SEREEGA, we can systematically adjust parameters to accommodate the variability in the ErrP, facilitating the systematic validation of closed-loop setups. Furthermore, our objective is to develop a universal ErrP classifier that captures the signal's variability, enabling it to determine the presence or absence of an ErrP in real EEG data.},

	abstract = {Objective. Motor imagery (MI) is a process of autonomously modulating the motor area to rehearse action mentally without actual execution. Based on the neuroplasticity of the cerebral cortex, MI can promote the functional rehabilitation of the injured cerebral cortex motor area. However, it usually takes several days to a few months to train individuals to acquire the necessary MI ability to control rehabilitation equipment in current studies, which greatly limits the clinical application of rehabilitation training systems based on the MI brain–computer interface (BCI). Approach. A novel MI training paradigm combined with the error related potential (ErrP) is proposed, and online adaptive training of the MI classifier was performed using ErrP. ErrP is used to correct the output of the MI classification to obtain a higher accuracy of kinesthetic feedback based on the imagination intention of subjects while generating simulated labels for MI online adaptive training. In this way, we improved the MI training efficiency. Thirteen subjects were randomly divided into an experimental group using the proposed paradigm and a control group using the traditional MI training paradigm to participate in six MI training experiments. Main results. The proposed paradigm enabled the experimental group to obtain a higher event-related desynchronization modulation level in the contralateral brain region compared with the control group and 69.76\% online classification accuracy of MI after three MI training experiments. The online classification accuracy reached 72.76\% and the whole system recognized the MI intention of the subjects with an online accuracy of 82.61\% after six experiments. Significance. Compared with the conventional unimodal MI training strategy, the proposed approach enables subjects to use the MI-BCI based system directly and achieve a better performance after only three training experiments with training left and right hands simultaneously. This greatly improves the usability of the MI-BCI-based rehabilitation system and makes it more convenient for clinical use.},

However, the performance degradation caused by motor imagery EEG with very low single-to-noise ratio faces several application issues with the use of a BCI system. In this paper, we propose a novel motor imagery classiﬁcation scheme based on the continuous wavelet transform and the convolutional neural network. Continuous wavelet transform with three mother wavelets is used to capture a highly informative EEG image by combining time-frequency and electrode location. A convolutional neural network is then designed to both classify motor imagery tasks and reduce computation complexity. The proposed method was validated using two public BCI datasets, BCI competition IV dataset 2b and BCI competition II dataset III. The proposed methods were found to achieve improved classiﬁcation performance compared with the existing methods, thus showcasing the feasibility of motor imagery BCI.},

	abstract = {We study the stochastic contextual bandit problem, where the reward is generated from an unknown function with additive noise. No assumption is made about the reward function other than boundedness. We propose a new algorithm, NeuralUCB, which leverages the representation power of deep neural networks and uses a neural network-based random feature mapping to construct an upper confidence bound (UCB) of reward for efficient exploration. We prove that, under standard assumptions, NeuralUCB achieves {\textbackslash}tilde O({\textbackslash}sqrtT) regret, where T is the number of rounds. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first neural network-based contextual bandit algorithm with a near-optimal regret guarantee. We also show the algorithm is empirically competitive against representative baselines in a number of benchmarks.},
