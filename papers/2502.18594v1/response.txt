    Adaptive BCIs using ErrPs have previously been proposed.

    Pfurtscheller et al. later applied the same approach to MI data recorded with EEG. 
    McFarland et al. introduced a new strategy by directly combining the ErrP frequency-domain information and the MI-related modulations to improve the classification of MI trials. They used common spatial patterns (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of ErrPs and MI, combining the results with a logistic regression and observed significant improvements in performance with the proposed framework. This approach was further validated in an online follow-up studyMcFarland et al.. 
    
    The ErrP information have often been used to validate the output of the BCI classifier.

    Pfurtscheller et al. considered the classification of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) into different motor tasks (e.g., slow vs. fast arm flexion). They also used the ErrP information to label trials before adding them to a the training dataset for an SVM classifier.
    McFarland et al. used the same approach in a two-class MI task, using regularized common spatial patterns (R-CSP) for feature extraction and the combination of Fisher's discriminant analysis (FDA) and SVM for classification. Lastly, for the classification of MI data using k-NN, Pfurtscheller et al. also used the trials labeled based on the ErrP to create a dataset and, after applying cross-validation to evaluate MI classification improvement, they expanded the training dataset with the new trials. 
    Wolpaw et al. used a similar approach to show the benefits of including the ErrP feedback information in the the adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and McFarland et al. for MI classification. However, as these studies used three- and four-class problems, respectively, the training dataset only included trials that did not elicit ErrPs. 
    All these studies reported improved performance when using the ErrP-based adaptation.
