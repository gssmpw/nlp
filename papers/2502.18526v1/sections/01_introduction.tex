\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

%In the global transition to sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly vital in energy management systems \cite{kempton2005vehicle}, particularly in smart buildings.
The concept of vehicle-to-building (V2B)  charging \cite{kempton2005vehicle, lund2008integration} leverages the ability of battery electric vehicles (EVs) to operate as both energy consumers and temporary storage units \cite{tomic2007using}. V2B systems are particularly relevant in large office buildings, where EVs can be aggregated to optimize energy consumption and reduce peak power demand. By strategically controlling the charging and discharging cycles of EVs, these systems ensure that vehicles meet users' expected state-of-charge (SoC) requirements while minimizing the energy bought during peak time-of-use (ToU) periods  \cite{tse2014use, zhao2023research} and reducing the building's peak power demand over a billing cycle.
Implementing this optimization process in practice becomes complex due to the heterogeneity of charging infrastructures \cite{park2024exact}, the uncertainty of EV arrival and departure times, and the need for a careful balance between energy cost savings and ensuring that the expected final state of charge (SoC) is kept close to user expectation.  Additionally, aligning V2B frameworks with complex electricity pricing policies, including both energy and demand charges, adds to the challenge \cite{zhang2018optimal, 8274175}. While prior work has largely modeled this problem as a single-shot mixed-integer linear program~\cite{AORC2013, 5986769, 9409126, MJG2015}, such approaches fail to capture the intricacies of real-time decision-making in dynamic environments.

This sequential decision process can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP); however, solving the MDP presents several difficulties, including delayed and sparse rewards, a continuous action space, and the need for effective long-term decision-making under uncertainty. 
% Traditional optimization methods, such as offline Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic-based strategies ~\cite{oconnell2010integration, AORC2013, 5986769, 9409126, MJG2015}, struggle to handle real-time decision-making in dynamic environments.
% Online search methods such as MCTS also are difficult to implement because of the large action space. In contrast, reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches  have been explored in similar contexts~\cite{MMN2019, SNDJ2020, ZJS2022}, and perform better. However, they often limit the size of the state and action spaces or overlook long-term rewards \cite{NNM2024, 9409126}, i.e., the monthly billing period and demand charge. 
To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with two key enhancements: action masking and policy guidance through a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The DDPG algorithm allows us to optimize continuous action spaces while accounting for uncertainties in EV arrival times, SoC requirements, and fluctuating building energy demands. By leveraging action masking, we adjust neural network actions during training using domain-specific knowledge, limiting exploration and guiding the RL agent toward more efficient and feasible policies.  The MILP component provides policy guidance during training, steering the RL agent toward near-optimal solutions and enhancing convergence in complex environments. 
% A critical contribution of our work is the introduction of a set of criteria to proactively detect when RL models are unlikely to generalize to unseen conditions, particularly in the presence of out-of-distribution data. This ability to anticipate performance issues enables proactive adaptation of the model, ensuring robustness in real-world scenarios. 
Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse conditions and offers a scalable solution for V2B energy management.
Our team includes a major EV manufacturer with access to a smart building that has 15 heterogeneous chargers (~\Cref{fig: EV chargers} shows some of them). We use real-world charging and energy data to validate our approach, showing its effectiveness in reducing energy costs over nine months (May 2023 â€“ Jan 2024). The summary of our contributions is as follows:

% In the context of the global transition to sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as pivotal components in energy management systems \cite{kempton2005vehicle}. This transition necessitates comprehensive management of EV energy dynamics within smart building infrastructures, exemplified by the concept of vehicle-to-building (V2B) charging \cite{lund2008integration}.
% V2B charging harnesses EVs' ability to charge at varying rates and support bidirectional charging, enabling them to function as temporary energy storage units \cite{tomic2007using}. This facilitates the implementation of energy resilience and demand-response strategies in smart buildings \cite{richardson2011electric}. For instance, EVs can charge during low-cost periods and supply energy back during high-cost periods, thereby optimizing energy usage and promoting savings through strategic charging schedules \cite{tse2014use, zhao2023research}.

% Practical implementation of V2B systems presents several complexities \cite{nguyen2012optimal}. While incentivizing EV owners with lower charging costs is straightforward, ensuring a minimum charge level is crucial to prevent inconvenience. Managing numerous EVs in large buildings, each with unique charging requirements, and varied charger types complicates the optimization process \cite{he2022optimal}. Additionally, aligning V2B frameworks with complex electricity pricing policies, including both energy and demand charges, adds to the challenge \cite{alizadeh2014demand}.

% This paper focuses on the V2B scenario, aiming to develop an online policy for controlling charger charging powers by charging or discharging EVs to reduce the long-term electricity bill. The goal is to minimize both energy costs for smart building powers and EV charging under Time-of-Use (ToU) rate policies, while also reducing demand charges over a monthly period, all while meeting the charging requirements (SoC) of EV users. Given that our V2B scenario involves real-time online decision-making and uncertainty from unpredictable EV arrivals, varying SoC requirements, and fluctuating building powers, traditional solutions such as offline MILP optimization, scheduling approaches, and meta-heuristics~\cite{oconnell2010integration, AORC2013, 5986769, 9409126, MJG2015} struggle to provide real-time decisions or may fall short of optimal solutions. Recent RL-based approaches have been explored for similar problems~\cite{MMN2019, 9409126, SNDJ2020, NNM2024, ZJS2022}  , but they are often limited by the scale of the state and action spaces. Existing work tends to focus on simpler scenarios without accounting for long-term billing periods or demand charges, and often only considers limited decision spaces, such as discrete charge charging powers or decentralized training for individual chargers, missing opportunities for cooperation among chargers to optimize costs.  
% In collaboration with \nissan{}, we develop an RL-based approach to address practical V2B challenges in a smart building by optimizing charging power for diverse EV chargers (including bi-directional and unidirectional)
% , shown in~\Cref{fig: EV chargers},
% at each time interval. The objective is to minimize overall costs, including energy bills and demand charges, while ensuring EVs reach their required State of Charge (SoC) before departure, all within real-world energy pricing constraints.

Furthermore, many focus on discrete charging rates or decentralized control for individual chargers, missing opportunities for cost optimization through charger coordination.

% Our solution addresses real-world application challenges, allowing continuous control of up to 15 heterogeneous chargers (unidirectional and bidirectional) to optimize costs. To enhance robustness, we integrate policy guidance into the RL training process, leveraging an efficient MILP solution to generate optimal actions that steer the policy in a favorable direction. Furthermore, we introduce action masking, which aims to limit the action exploration space and improve policy performance by utilizing domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach using real-world data, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing monthly energy bills over 9 months (May 2023 - Jan 2024).
