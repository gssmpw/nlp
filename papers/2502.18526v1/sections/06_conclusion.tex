\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose an RL-based approach to address V2B challenges in smart buildings by optimizing charging power for heterogeneous (mixed-mode) EV chargers. The goal is to minimize overall costs, including energy bills and demand charges, while ensuring EVs reach their required SoC. Our solution addresses key challenges such as multi-agent decision-making, centralized control of up to 15 chargers, and continuous charging power adjustments, all aimed at minimizing the total energy bill over a month.
We evaluate our approach against heuristic algorithms in simulated V2B scenarios with real-world data from an EV manufacturer. Results show that our trained models effectively manage online EV charging, reducing monthly total bills while meeting SoC requirements. % Recognizing that offline-trained RL may struggle to adapt to dynamic, real-world environments with limited data and unpredictable events, we plan to explore integrating RL with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for more responsive and adaptive charging control in the face of real-world uncertainties.
