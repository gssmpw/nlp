\section{Related Work}
\label{relatedwork}


In \cite{abburu2020cognitive}, the authors apply a Cognitive Digital Twin to a real-world problem concerning predictive control in a steel-processing industry. Somers, Oltramari, and Lebiere \citep{somerscognitive, somers2020cognitive} use a Cognitive Architecture to build a Cognitive Twin as a personal assistant that learns user behavior from past data on a user's social network. Then, as a proof-of-concept case, it uses this knowledge to select attendees to a party. 

\cite{eirinakis2020enhancing} present the concept of Enhanced Cognitive Twin, in which they use Data Analytics and Machine Learning to provide them with a tool to solve environmental challenges, like decision-making capabilities, autonomous detection of anomalies and opportunities, and long-term optimization of and reasoning.

\cite{rozanec2020towards} use Cognitive Digital Twins in a manufacturing scenario to improve Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) by detecting possible anomalies and predicting their impact on production and by planning some aspects of production itself, like rescheduling existing plans.

In the Symbiotic Autonomous Systems White Paper II \citep{initiative2018symbiotic}, the authors put Cognitive Digital Twins as an almost essential asset to manage the knowledge gap, which would greatly impact future education.


%Alguns trabalhos sobre estrategias evolutivas e arquiteturas cognitivas
 About using bio-inspired Evolutionary methods, \cite{zhang2020affective} applied a Classifier System in the context of Cognitive Robotics, building an emotional model for a robot. \cite{bellas2010multilevel} showed us a Cognitive Architecture that uses an evolutionary approach to provide an agent - hence a robot - with lifelong learning capabilities. That Architecture, the Multilevel Darwinist Brain, was also applied as a control method on two physical robots, Sony AIBO and Pioneer 2 \citep{bellas2006adaptive}.

To the best of our knowledge, we found no prior work on Cognitive Architectures and Evolution Strategy.
