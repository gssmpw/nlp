\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their capabilities in multilingual natural language processing, while studies on risks associated with cross biases are limited to immediate context preferences. Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis.  
This study is the first to address this gap. 
We test LLM's applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation.
We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. 
We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns. 
Our findings reveal that local language bias is prevalent across different tasks, with GPT-4 and Sonnet reducing bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but failing to achieve robust multilingual alignment, highlighting broader implications for multilingual AI agents and applications such as education.

\section{Introduction}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) task execution: understanding, generation, and translation across diverse languages~\cite{shi2022language, blasi-etal-2022-systematic}. Beyond these conventional applications, due to their rising reasoning ability, LLMs are increasingly utilized as inquiry agents, serving a diverse global user base~\cite{armstrong2024silicon,zheng2024dissecting}. LLMs are widely used for providing personalized advice on real-world topics such as travel planning and career development across multiple languages. Despite substantial research attention to the immediate context preferences of LLMs, significant gaps remain in the literature~\cite{gallegos-etal-2024-bias}. 
Hence, research on the extent to which LLMs exhibit biases in complex decision-making tasks across languages remains a substantial lacuna in the NLP field.

Tsinghua University is assigned significantly higher scores in Chinese (10/10) than English (7/10), and its disadvantages are dismissed in the reasoning.}
    \label{fig:intro}
\end{figure}

This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the multilingual nationality biases of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, which role as widely used intelligent assistants, in reasoning-based decision-making processes. Rather than focusing on biased immediate context detection, we investigate how these models behave when tasked with heavy reasoning tasks of offering advice in real-world scenarios. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:intro}, when queried about university application recommendations across various countries, ChatGPT demonstrates notable inconsistencies between different languages concerning Tsinghua University. The response in Chinese predominantly emphasizes the advantages of Tsinghua University, assigning it a higher rating (10/10, full score) compared to the English response (7/10). Recommendations and judgments provided by LLMs in different languages reveal evidence of nationality bias, wherein LLMs tend to favor or disadvantage certain groups based on their nationality. The absorption and dissemination of such biases by these models may perpetuate stereotypes, marginalize specific groups, and result in inequitable treatment~\cite{ferrara2023should}. To investigate this phenomenon, we examine three distinct and culturally sensitive tasks where LLMs are expected to act as universal advisory agents: university application recommendations, travel destination recommendations, and city relocation suggestions. We aim to investigate the patterns of bias in LLM-generated recommendations when making decisions on national issues. Specifically, we examine how these recommendations vary across different languages, yielding multilingual nationality bias. 

 To quantify the presence of bias, we reformulate the agent's potential nationality bias as a comprehensive assessment problem. Specifically, we evaluate how the agent rates the same entity (e.g., a university or city) across different language contexts, hypothesizing that various bias dimensions inherent in LLMs may influence these ratings. Drawing inspiration from psychophysics and decision-making studies, we revisit Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment~\cite{thurstone1927law}, which provides a framework for quantifying subjective preferences through pairwise comparisons. 
 Our methodology involves compiling lists of top universities, economically leading cities, and travel destinations,from various countries, forming triplets of options for each task (e.g., the University of Tokyo, Peking University, and Stanford University). We then prompt SOTA LLMs to assign numerical scores to each candidate within the triplet, reflecting their recommendation preferences. This process is repeated for hundreds of triplets across multiple languages, enabling us to observe patterns of bias in the agent's scores towards the candidates.

Two primary research questions are addressed here to guide our investigation:

\textbf{RQ1: How do LLMs exhibit varying bias when acting as agents in providing advice on national issues across different languages?} 

In this study, we observe the overall pattern of score distribution varies markedly across languages. LLMs display local language biases across different tasks, especially in scenarios such as university application recommendations. Edge-cutting models like GPT-4 showcase lower bias when operating in English. However, they show significant bias in non-English languages, which impacts the fairness and consistency of the agent's recommendations.



\textbf{RQ2: What role do user demographics and reasoning strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, play in influencing the bias patterns of LLMs when they act as agents on national issues across different languages?}

Our results highlight that user demographics (gender, language group) and CoT play crucial roles in shaping LLM bias patterns on national issues. CoT does not always mitigate bias, it can amplify disparities, especially in non-English languages. Furthermore, bias dynamics vary based on demographic factors, such as gendered speech patterns in different cultures. These findings underscore the need for multilingual bias mitigation strategies that account for both demographic variation and the impact of reasoning strategies like CoT.


Explicating these inquiries provides us with a unique perspective in studying the nationality biases present in multilingual LLMs when performing complex reasoning-based decision-making tasks. This empirical exploration not only highlights the importance of understanding these biases, but also underscores the need for further research to enhance the personalization and inclusiveness of AI-driven applications across linguistic, educational, and demographic boundaries.


\section{Related Works}

\paragraph{Bias in Multilingual LLMs} 
Bias in MLLMs presents us with a quandary. It has emerged as a critical challenge to the fairness of MLLMs and thus significantly restricts real-world deployment~\cite{xu-etal-2023-language-representation}.
Numerous studies have been conducted to measure language bias, which refers to the unidentical performance of MLLMs across different languages in terms of race, religion, nationality, gender, and other factors~\cite{zhao2024gender, mihaylov-shtedritski-2024-elegant, mukherjee-etal-2023-global, neplenbroek2024mbbq, li-etal-2024-land, vashishtha-etal-2023-evaluating, naous-etal-2024-beer,hofmann2024ai}. Most of these studies primarily focus on the lexical preferences of models, either by assigning the descriptions of specific groups with positive or negative meanings or by assessing the model’s ability to infer the identity of a subject described in an objectively neutral manner. Among the most relevant studies in this line of research, \citet{narayanan-venkit-etal-2023-nationality} examine whether the use of adjectives by language models defined by nationalities in English are positive or negative. \citet{zhu-etal-2024-quite} further extend this analysis to a Chinese context. Additionally, \citet{kamruzzaman-etal-2024-investigating}, \citet{nie-etal-2024-multilingual} and \citet{parrish-etal-2022-bbq} constructed multiple-choice selection evaluations in English. Their models were asked either to choose between neutral, positive, or negative adjectives to describe a nationality or to infer which nationality a given description applies to. While these studies provide valuable insights into nationality bias in LLMs, they are largely limited to monolingual settings and focus primarily on lexical-level biases. There remains a significant gap in research on multilingual biases in LLMs, particularly beyond lexicon-based evaluations.

\paragraph{Bias in LLMs Reasoning Agents} 
Recent studies have extended bias research beyond immediate context preference to examine complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. Several studies have investigated the use of LLMs as simulations of multilingual survey subjects.
\citet{jin2024language} examined LLM performance in moral reasoning tasks, particularly in responding to variations of the Trolley Problem. \citet{durmus2023towards} explored the subjective global opinions of LLMs by prompting models to answer binary-choice questions under explicit persona settings in a multilingual context. \citet{kwok2024evaluating} further advanced this approach by developing the Simulation of Synthetic Personas, and designing questionnaires based on real-world news to assess biases in model-generated responses. 
While these studies provide valuable insights into biases in complex reasoning and decision-making tasks under multilingual settings, fall short of providing a comprehensive understanding of real-world applications. 
Other studies addressed tasks such as hiring screening agents~\cite{armstrong2024silicon} and university application agents~\cite{zheng2024dissecting} in English. Not only their studies limited to English, but they constrain the models by restricting their ability to engage in chain-of-thought (CoT)-like reasoning during responses. This significantly limits the scope and depth of bias analysis in structured decision-making processes. 




\section{Methodology}

We begin by formalizing our decision-making tasks as comprehensive evaluation problems, where the goal is to assign overall ratings to entities—such as universities, cities, or travel destinations. This formulation acknowledges that complex advisory tasks are susceptible to multiple sources of bias, including but not limited to linguistic and gender biases. Our framework is designed to systematically detect how these different bias dimensions influence the final ratings provided by LLMs.

To empirically evaluate these effects, we simulate real-life advisory scenarios across three domains: (1) an academic career planning advisor assisting with university application decisions,  (2) a career planning advisor supporting city relocation suggestions, and (3) a travel planner offering destination recommendations. For each scenario, we generate triplets consisting of three diverse candidate options (e.g., universities or cities) and prompt LLMs to provide a recommendation along with an analysis and rating that reflects its underlying preferences.

By repeating this process across hundreds of triplets in multiple languages, we collect statistical data that allows us to uncover patterns of bias in the model's recommendations. This approach not only highlights the influence of the primary language environment on decision-making but also enables us to assess the impact of additional bias dimensions, such as gender, on the model's evaluations.


\subsection{Triplet Collection Process}

To evaluate the multilingual bias of LLMs, we first identified suitable options for each of the three tasks: university applications, travel destinations, and city relocations. The options were selected from reputable and current sources to ensure relevance and diversity. 

We rely on well-known rankings for option selection. For university recommendations, we used the \href{https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/2024}{``Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings 2024''} (QS2024). For city relocation recommendations, we used the data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the year 2022, sourced from the \href{https://www.citypopulation.de/}{``City Population''}.  Travel destination options were selected based on the \href{https://www.euromonitor.com/press/press-releases/dec-2023/euromonitor-internationals-report-reveals-worlds-top-100-city-destinations-for-2023}{``World's Top 100 City Destinations for 2023''} report by Euromonitor International. Further details could be found in Appendices~\ref{sec:option}.


We organized the selected options into two sets: the \textbf{target option} set, which contains the primary options for final analysis, and the \textbf{comparison option} set, which provides additional options for forming triplets. To ensure diversity in the comparison, we paired each option from the comparison set such that one was from an English-speaking country and the other from a non-English-speaking country or a country where English is not the only official language. This pairing strategy helps capture the cultural diversity of the options.

For each pair, we used a blank placeholder and randomized the order of the options to create a triplet template. Then, we replaced the placeholder with each option from the target option set, resulting in a consistent comparison structure. This approach ensures that for each target option, the comparison triplet remains identical, enabling fair evaluation of the LLM's responses.

\label{fig:prompt1}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Prompt Design}



In designing prompts for this study, we structured each prompt to simulate a real-world inquiry scenario, guiding the LLM to act as an advisory agent. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt1} and Appendices~\ref{sec:prompt}, each prompt begins with a detailed description of the agent’s persona. For example, The agent is introduced as an experienced academic career planning advisor with a strong reputation in the field of undergraduate education. This setting aims to establish the model's role and ensure consistency in the advice provided across different languages. Next, the prompt includes information about the hypothetical user client seeking advice. For instance, the student’s need for guidance in applying to three specific universities is described. This setup helps frame the context of the inquiry, making the scenario more realistic and relatable for the model.
We then provide clear instructions on the nature of the advice to be given. The model is asked to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each university comprehensively and to assign a rating score out of 10, along with explanations for each score. To ensure that the output aligns with the desired format, the prompt includes rules about how the response should be structured. Specifically, it emphasizes that the model should not simply replicate the template but should treat it as a formal response, providing analyses for each university and a final summary with scores.The prompt ends with the three options including the target option for evaluation, ensuring that the comparison triplet is presented clearly. 

For each language used in the study, we translated the prompt while preserving this structure, verifying that no semantic meaning was altered during translation. The model is expected to output both a rating score for each option and a rationale for each rating, reflecting a thoughtful evaluation that aligns with the agent persona and task requirements.



\subsection{Experimental Settings}

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of multilingual biases, we selected a diverse set of countries and languages for our experiments. 
The selection criteria focused on including countries with at least three universities ranked within the QS World University Rankings 2024 Top 100, ensuring that the model would have sufficient knowledge about the candidates being ranked.
The selection of these languages also helps to maintain a balance between global representation and linguistic diversity in the study.

\paragraph{English-speaking countries:} The study includes countries where English is the primary language of instruction, such as the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada (CA), and Australia (AU). These countries are included because they have a high number of institutions in the QS Top 100, providing a strong baseline for comparison.

\paragraph{Single-major language countries:} This category includes countries where a single language is predominant in education and public life, such as China (CH, Mandarin), Japan (JP, Japanese), France (FR, French), Germany (DE, German), and South Korea (KR, Korean). These countries are included for their significant academic presence and the linguistic uniqueness they bring to the study.

  \paragraph{Multiple-major language countries:} In this category, countries like Hong Kong (HK), Singapore (SG), and Switzerland (CH) are included. These countries have multilingual educational environments, which pose unique challenges and opportunities for the models in terms of processing and understanding diverse linguistic inputs. They also possess universities within the QS Top 100, providing a comparative context with countries that use a single major language.
  
\paragraph{“Global South” representation:} This category focuses on countries that belong to regions often considered underrepresented in global academic rankings but still have notable academic institutions. Specifically, we selected one representative from each of the following regions: Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Central America. To broaden the representation of this study, we adopted more inclusive ranking criteria solely in this category. For example, in the university application scenario, we expanded the target option set to include institutions ranked within the QS Top 200. 

        This ensures that our study incorporates perspectives from regions that are often underrepresented in AI research but are important for global diversity. 

The official languages of the first three categories of selected countries—English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, and German—were used as the target languages for the study. By analyzing the models’ responses in these languages, we aimed to capture linguistic nuances and biases in a multilingual context.

For the experiments, to promise the models' ability to instruction following and reasoning, we employed three state-of-the-art language models, GPT-3.5\footnote{gpt-3.5-turbo-0125}, GPT-4\footnote{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09} and Claude-Sonnet\footnote{anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0}. This allows us to compare their performance and observe differences in bias expression across languages, providing insights into advancements in multilingual capabilities between versions.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Distributions of Scores}
\label{sec:score}

To research how the models score suggestions across different languages, we conducted the following evaluation. This allowed us to quantify potential differences in score distributions and gain an initial insight into each model’s bias. 
Figure \ref{fig:dist} presents the overall distribution of model suggestions across six languages for three distinct tasks: university application recommendations, relocation advice, and travel suggestions. The distribution patterns vary significantly across languages, indicating the presence of nationality bias in the model’s responses. 
modify this part
It is essential to highlight the differences among the selected models. For example, GPT-4 tends to cluster tightly around higher scores in the travel category across multiple languages. In contrast, GPT-3.5 exhibits broader variability in university application recommendations: some languages show a wide spread from 5 to almost 10. Meanwhile, the Sonnet model displays relatively uniform distributions in certain tasks, though distinctions remain, that some languages consistently receive higher median scores than others.

\begin{figure*}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/dist.png} % Change "example.pdf" to your actual file
    \caption{Violin plots illustrating the overall distribution of scores assigned by GPT‐3.5, GPT‐4, and Sonnet across six languages (en, fr, ja, zh, de, ko) for three tasks: university application, relocation, and travel. The x‐axis denotes language, and the y‐axis shows the numerical scores ranging from 5 to 10.}
    \label{fig:dist}
\end{figure*}
 
The bias for each language within each LLM is calculated here. The Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JSD) score is applied to provide a more detailed analysis of linguistic disparities in suggestion tendencies, the divergence between a language-specific distribution and the global distribution serves as our bias score. Higher values indicate greater dissimilarity, signaling a stronger potential bias.

Formally, let \( P \) denote the global score distribution and \( Q \) the score distribution for a particular language. The JSD between \( P \) and \( Q \) is defined as:
\[
\operatorname{JSD}(P \parallel Q) = \frac{1}{2} \, \operatorname{KL}\left(P \parallel M\right) + \frac{1}{2} \, \operatorname{KL}\left(Q \parallel M\right),
\]
This enables a more detailed analysis of linguistic disparities in suggestion tendencies, whereas higher values suggest greater dissimilarity and hence a stronger signal of potential bias.

A key finding is that more powerful models (i.e., GPT-4) show the lowest English bias. GPT-4 consistently has a lower JSD score for English than weaker models. However, it does not always achieve a lower overall JSD. In the relocate task, its bias score is higher than other models. This suggests that alignment technologies help English but lack coverage for multilingual scenarios.
For GPT-3.5, JSD values can be relatively high in specific cases, such as the score of French (0.58) in the university application task. This indicates a substantial deviation from the global distribution for that language.
In contrast, GPT-4 generally shows moderate JSD values but with a distinct spike for German in the relocate task, suggesting a pronounced bias in that context. 
For Sonnet, JSD scores often lie between those of GPT‑3.5 and GPT‑4.
Collectively, JSD values by tasks and languages not only provide a quantitative assessment of how model responses differ across languages and tasks, but they offer a qualitative and systematic measure of potential biases embedded in the output distributions.

\subsection{Analysis of Multilingual Nationality Bias}

\begin{figure*}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figs/bias2.png} % Change "example.pdf" to your actual file
    \caption{Violin plots illustrating how each language group (English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Korean) scores different countries after subtracting each group’s mean. Positive values (above zero) indicate higher‐than‐average scores, and negative values (below zero) indicate lower‐than‐average scores. Gray dots mark individual language‐group deviations for each country, while red dots highlight local‐language assessments (e.g., how Chinese speakers rate China). Wider violin shapes reflect greater variability in assigned scores. Three sets of plots compare GPT‐3.5, GPT‐4, and Sonnet across three tasks: university application, relocation, and travel.}
    \label{fig:standard}
\end{figure*}

To assess the external validity of the score distribution across languages in Section \ref{sec:score}, we examine whether inherent biases affect the comparability of scores assigned by different language groups.
To ensure a fair analysis of multilingual nationality bias, we first apply normalization to the scores generated by each language. 
Then, we measure the degree of deviation by subtracting the mean score of each language group from individual scores, capturing how much a group's evaluation of a nation/region differs from its overall scoring. 

The violin plots in Figure \ref{fig:standard} use the same language-nation groups as those in Figure \ref{fig:standard}: English (en), Japanese (ja), Chinese (zh), French (fr), German (de), and Korean (ko). The tasks and models remain the same.
The x-axis represents language-nation pairs. The y-axis shows scores normalized by language average, with a range spanning from $-2.0$ to $2.0$.  
Positive values indicate that a language group assigned a higher-than-average score to a given country, suggesting a more favorable evaluation. Conversely, negative values indicate a lower-than-average score, reflecting a less favorable assessment by that language group.
Red dots highlight scores assigned by a nation's local language group, representing self-assessment. Gray dots represent how different language groups evaluate a language-nation pair relative to the overall average, reflecting external perceptions. 
For example, a red dot for "US" represents the score assigned by the English language group to the United States. In contrast, gray dots correspond to scores given by other language groups, such as Chinese, Japanese, and German.
Certain countries, such as the UK and Australia, show narrower distributions across language groups, suggesting relatively consistent perceptions. In contrast, others, like China and Germany, exhibit greater variability. Some language groups also have wider violins overall, indicating more within-group variation in country assessments. It is worth noting task variations, that travel scores vary more across languages than relocation scores. This shows greater diversity in travel preferences.
Key observations from Figure \ref{fig:standard} reveal two significant findings:
Local language bias is prevalent across different tasks. 
Non-English, single-language countries show strong local language bias in university applications, while East Asian countries exhibit similar biases in travel and relocation tasks.
Red dots (representing local language scores) are predominantly clustered in the positive region, indicating that LLMs tend to assign higher scores to countries where their language is spoken. For instance, red dots for "CN" suggest that models consistently assign higher scores to China when assessed in Chinese. 
This trend appears across multiple nations, highlighting a systematic preference for home countries and reinforcing the strong presence of local language bias.
GPT-4 and Sonnet, as more powerful models, reduce bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but fail to achieve robust multilingual alignment. 
This is particularly evident in the university application task, where GPT-4 and Sonnet display significantly less bias for English-speaking countries but continue to show substantial bias for China (CN), Japan (JP), Germany (DE), and South Korea (KR). These findings highlight the limitations of current alignment methodologies in multilingual settings, revealing that while English alignment has improved, non-English biases persist, suggesting that further refinements in multilingual alignment strategies are necessary. 
Across all tasks, consistent inter-model trends emerge. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Sonnet preserve similar rankings of countries, though the magnitude of bias varies.

    \caption{Mean Divergence (MD) scores across languages for different tasks and models. The MD Score is calculated as the gap between the mean score difference of global and local language groups, rather than full distributional divergence. We isolate systematic local language bias while avoiding confounding factors introduced by cross-country distributional differences.}

\subsection{Robustness Checks}
\subsubsection{With or Without Chain-of-Thought Bias}
Since Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting encourages step-by-step explanations, it has the potential to both mitigate inconsistencies and reinforce biases present in pre-training data. To disentangle the effects of explicit reasoning from the model’s inherent biases, we compare model outputs with and without CoT prompting. This serves as a robustness check by assessing whether biases persist independently of reasoning structure or if they are exacerbated by the CoT framework. 

We focus solely on the mean score difference rather than full distributional divergence. Further details for the distribution could be found in Appendices~\ref{sec:dist}. Cross-country comparisons of JSD scores are problematic due to inherent variations in natural score distributions. Different countries may have distinct baseline distributions, making direct JSD comparisons across nations unreliable. Specifically, we compute local bias as Mean Divergence (MD) Score using this formula: $\text{Mean Divergence Score} = \mu_{\text{local}} - \mu_{\text{global}}$, where \(\mu_{\text{local}}\) is the mean score assigned by the local language group for a given country. And \(\mu_{\text{global}}\) is the mean score assigned by all language groups for that country. We examine models' factor importance rankings (e.g., Reputation, Program) detailed in Appendices~\ref{sec:rank} and find consistency across languages, indicating that differences arise from implicit nationality bias rather than varying factor valuations.

In Table~\ref{tab:md_scores}, GPT-4 exhibits the lowest scores overall, suggesting it maintains more stable and consistent multilingual alignment than GPT-3.5 and Sonnet. First, CoT has a stronger influence on bias in English-speaking countries. Under CoT prompting, GPT-4's MD scores are very low or even negative in English-speaking countries (e.g., US: 0.01, UK: -0.03). 
However, without CoT, the MD scores in these regions drop further into negative values (e.g., US: -0.22, UK: -0.24). This suggests that CoT changes GPT-4’s decision-making process in English-speaking contexts more than in non-English ones.
Second, in non-English countries, CoT does not reduce bias as effectively—the MD scores remain relatively high (e.g., CN: 0.52, KR: 0.33). 
We find out that in GPT-3.5 and Sonnet, CoT prompting increases bias. In GPT-3.5, CoT generally results in much higher MD scores than without CoT, particularly for China (0.68 vs. 0.19), France (0.49 vs. 0.15), and Korea (0.51 vs. 0.38). Sonnet also experiences higher MD in CoT, especially in China (0.47), Japan (0.52), and Korea (0.48), indicating that structured reasoning does not necessarily mitigate nationality biases. 

English-speaking countries do not show the same bias amplification. CoT may be more aligned with Western fairness norms, while it reinforces cultural specificity in non-English languages. This shows an imbalance in multilingual fairness mechanisms, where bias mitigation efforts may be disproportionately developed for English-speaking cultures, leaving non-Western biases more embedded. Establishing a bias baseline without CoT can allow us to evaluate whether structured reasoning frameworks introduce additional bias artifacts, raising concerns about fairness in multilingual AI systems.

\subsubsection{Gender Bias}

We examine gender bias as a robustness check alongside the linguistic and cultural diversity of the selected countries: how LLMs may perpetuate or mitigate biases in different academic and societal contexts. We focus on assessing whether the persona-driven responses maintain robustness or exhibit vulnerability when subjected to cross-lingual tasks and the impact of language-specific cultural nuances on bias amplification. Further details for the distribution could be found in Appendices~\ref{sec:dist}.

Our analysis reveals model-specific trends in gender bias. GPT-4 exhibits stronger female bias in most non-English languages. This means that female-associated outputs introduce greater linguistic or cultural variability in these languages. Conversely, GPT-3.5 shows pronounced female bias in certain regions, particularly in Korea (0.65 vs. 0.30) and Japan (0.19 vs. 0.12). And Sonnet displays relatively weaker gender-based divergence. Hence, Sonnet exhibits less gender-sensitive variability compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. These findings highlight the interaction between language, gender, and model architecture, suggesting that biases are not only model-dependent but also sensitive to linguistic and cultural contexts.

\section{Conclusion}
This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of multilingual nationality bias in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Models (LLMs) across reasoning-based decision-making tasks. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit lower bias in English, significant disparities emerge in non-English languages. This bias impacts the fairness and consistency of choices and the structure of reasoning. The bias patterns observed are influenced not only by language differences but also by user demographics and reasoning strategies. For example, in non-English contexts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often exacerbates rather than mitigates bias, and female-based decisions usually introduce higher bias than male-based ones. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates that different models prioritize decision-making criteria differently. Future research should explore bias mitigation techniques tailored for multilingual settings, considering both linguistic and cultural factors to enhance fairness and inclusivity in AI-driven decision-making applications.

\section{Limitations}

While our study provides novel insights into multilingual bias in large language models (LLMs), several limitations should be acknowledged. First, due to the requirement of multilingual instruction-following abilities, our experiments were restricted to English-centric commercial models and languages with relatively rich data. The commercial models used in this study are proprietary, with undisclosed training data and fine-tuning processes. This lack of transparency limits our ability to diagnose the root causes of the observed biases and hinders reproducibility and further analysis by the broader research community. This limitation may affect the generalizability of our findings, as biases in under-resourced or non-commercial languages might follow different patterns.

Second, our investigation specifically focused on nationality bias within the context of three decision-making scenarios (university applications, travel, and relocation). Although this case study offers important insights, it does not capture the full spectrum of cross-lingual biases that could be present in other domains or decision-making contexts. Future work should examine additional types of biases to build a more comprehensive understanding of cross-language disparities.

\section{Triplet Collection}
\label{sec:option}
First, for university recommendations, we used the \href{https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/2024}{``Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings 2024''} (QS2024), which provides a globally recognized assessment of top academic institutions. Similarly, the selection of travel destinations and city relocations follows the same logic, unaffected by timing or specific ranking sources. Second, travel destination options were selected based on the \href{https://www.euromonitor.com/press/press-releases/dec-2023/euromonitor-internationals-report-reveals-worlds-top-100-city-destinations-for-2023}{``World's Top 100 City Destinations for 2023''} report by Euromonitor International, which highlights cities with high tourist appeal. This ensures that the destinations chosen are globally recognized and favored by travelers. Third, for city relocation recommendations, we used the data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the year 2022, sourced from the \href{https://www.citypopulation.de/}{``City Population''} website, collected from national statistical offices around the globe. By selecting the city with the highest GDP within each agglomeration, metropolitan area, or conglomeration, we ensure consistency and represent economically strong cities across different regions.

\section{Prompt Design}
\label{sec:prompt}
We provide a comprehensive overview of the prompts used for our experiments to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The detailed prompts are designed to guide the model in generating responses under controlled conditions. Each prompt follows a structured format, incorporating an introduction that establishes the model's persona, a description of the user's request, specific instructions on the expected output, and an output template to standardize responses. By presenting these prompts in full, we enable further analysis of how linguistic and cultural variations influence model behavior, facilitating comparative studies and future improvements in multilingual alignment.

\section{Detailed Distribution of Robustness Checks}
\label{sec:dist}

Figure~\ref{fig:woreason} presents violin plots depicting how different language groups (English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Korean) rate various countries after normalizing by each group's mean. Positive values indicate higher-than-average scores, while negative values denote lower-than-average assessments. Gray dots represent individual deviations, with red dots highlighting local-language assessments. The width of each violin reflects score variability. Three sets of plots compare GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Sonnet on the university application task under the non-CoT setting, examining whether biases persist independently of reasoning structure.

Figure~\ref{fig:gender} follows the same format but contrasts model outputs for male and female applicant personas. This analysis assesses gender bias alongside linguistic and cultural diversity, investigating how LLMs perpetuate or mitigate biases across languages and societal contexts. It evaluates the robustness of persona-driven responses in cross-lingual tasks and the influence of language-specific cultural factors on bias amplification.

\section{Ranking the Factors}
\label{sec:rank}
Despite the general similarity in factors considered across languages, bias still persists, indicating that different languages internalize these evaluation criteria differently. To assess how models weigh various factors, we employ a two-step evaluation: first, the model assigns scores, and then we prompt it to justify its rankings based on ten key criteria. The five most mentioned factors include Academic Reputation \& Rankings, Program Curriculum \& Faculty, Location \& Environment, Career Opportunities, Alumni Network \& Post-Graduation Visa, and Cost of Education \& Living. Notably, Sonnet places significant emphasis on Diversity, whereas GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 exhibit little concern for this factor.
