\section{Conclusions}
We present a fully-geometric attention algorithm to achieve accurate point cloud registration through coarse-to-fine matching.
We fuse information from coordinates and features at the super-point level between point clouds, an unaddressed problem in the literature primarily because it must guarantee rotation and translation invariance as point clouds reside in different and independent reference frames.
Cross-attention can identify overlap areas and accurately match coarse features.
Instead, self-attention produces more distinctive local features for fine matching.
The results showed that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large benchmark, including 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI, and 3DCSR datasets.

\noindent \textbf{Limitations.}
The time complexity of computing the pairwise distance mapping is relatively high. However, this operation acts on superpoints, making it more manageable. 
Addressing the issue of dealing with source and target point clouds of different densities, especially since different sensors capture them, remains a challenge.
