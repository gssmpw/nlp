abstract = {In this paper, we present a Modality-Agnostic Transformer based Self-Supervised Learning (MATS2L) for emotion recognition using physiological signals. The proposed approach consists of two stages: a) Pretext stage, where the transformer model is pre-trained with unlabeled physiological signal data using masked signal prediction as pre-training task and form contextualized signal representations. b) Downstream stage, where self-supervised learning (SSL) representations extracted from a pre-trained model are utilized for emotion recognition tasks. Modality-agnostic approach allows the transformer model to focus on exploring mutual features among different physiological signals and learning more meaningful embeddings to estimate emotions effectively. We conduct several experiments on a public dataset WESAD and perform comparisons with fully supervised and other competitive SSL approaches. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach is capable of learning meaningful features and superior to other competitive SSL approaches. Moreover, a transformer model trained on SSL features outperforms fully supervised transformer model. We also present detailed ablation studies to prove the robustness of our approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In the modern world, wearable smart devices are continuously used to monitor people’s health. This study aims to develop an automatic mental stress detection system for researchers based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from smart T-shirts using machine learning classifiers. We used 20 subjects, including 10 from mental stress (after twelve hours of continuous work in the laboratory) and 10 from normal (after completing the sleep or without any work). We also applied three scoring techniques: Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), Specific Fatigue Scale (SFS), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), to confirm the mental stress. The total duration of ECG recording was 1800 min, including 1200 min during mental stress and 600 min during normal. We calculated two types of features, such as demographic and extracted by ECG signal. In addition, we used Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) to classify the intra-subject (mental stress and normal) and inter-subject classification. The DT leave-one-out model has better performance in terms of recall (93.30%), specificity (96.70%), precision (94.40%), accuracy (93.30%), and F1 (93.50%) in the intra-subject classification. Additionally, The classification accuracy of the system in classifying inter-subjects is 94.10% when using a DT classifier. However, our findings suggest that the wearable smart T-shirt based on the DT classifier may be used in big data applications and health monitoring. Mental stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and various health problems. Therefore, real-time ECG signals help assess cardiovascular and related risk factors in the initial stage based on machine learning techniques.},

abstract="Stress acts as a triggering and aggravating factor for many diseases and health conditions. This has prompted the development of wearable devices capable of continuously and unobtrusively tracking physiological signals associated with stress levels. Moreover, data mining methods have been devised to extract valuable information from these signals, to detect and monitor stress more effectively. We argue that it is possible to accurately detect and differentiate physiological changes occurring at the early onset of stress, i.e., the anticipation stage, from those occurring in no-stress, stress, and post-stress conditions. To investigate it, we analyze biomarker data (blood volume pulse, skin conductance, skin temperature, and acceleration) collected from wrist sensors in two publicly available datasets, where psychosocial stress is induced under controlled laboratory conditions. We train and evaluate person-specific classification algorithms by using established learning approaches. We have discovered that the random forest classifier yields promising results in both detecting stress anticipation and distinguishing between the four considered classes. The results of this study suggest that wearable systems, incorporating sensors and stress monitoring algorithms like the ones introduced here, can become integral components of intervention systems aimed at addressing stress-related issues.",

abstract="Background: There are a wide range of potential adverse health effects, ranging from headaches to cardiovascular disease, associated with long-term negative emotions and chronic stress. Because many indicators of stress are imperceptible to observers, the early detection of stress remains a pressing medical need, as it can enable early intervention. Physiological signals offer a noninvasive method for monitoring affective states and are recorded by a growing number of commercially available wearables. Objective: We aim to study the differences between personalized and generalized machine learning models for 3-class emotion classification (neutral, stress, and amusement) using wearable biosignal data. Methods: We developed a neural network for the 3-class emotion classification problem using data from the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) data set, a multimodal data set with physiological signals from 15 participants. We compared the results between a participant-exclusive generalized, a participant-inclusive generalized, and a personalized deep learning model. Results: For the 3-class classification problem, our personalized model achieved an average accuracy of 95.06{\%} and an F1-score of 91.71{\%}; our participant-inclusive generalized model achieved an average accuracy of 66.95{\%} and an F1-score of 42.50{\%}; and our participant-exclusive generalized model achieved an average accuracy of 67.65{\%} and an F1-score of 43.05{\%}. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the need for increased research in personalized emotion recognition models given that they outperform generalized models in certain contexts. We also demonstrate that personalized machine learning models for emotion classification are viable and can achieve high performance. ",
