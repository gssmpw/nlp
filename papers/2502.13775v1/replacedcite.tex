\section{Background and Related Work}
\paragraph{LLM Alignment.} Alignment techniques have been fundamental to the success of LLMs ____. Initial alignment methods involved reward models informed by human preferences and feedback ____. Subsequent research has introduced several enhancements to these methods ____. However, such techniques are prone to aligning with average human preferences. 

\paragraph{Pluralistic Alignment.} Recognising the diversity of human values and preferences, ____ proposed a framework for pluralistic alignment to address these limitations. They defined three modes of pluralism in AI systems. \reffig{fig:vital-alignment-overview} illustrates these modes: \overton should encompass all diverse values and perspectives; \steerable should represent a specific value or attribute as defined in a user query; \distributional focused on matching underlying real-world population distributions (see \refapp{app:plural-alignment-modes} for more details). Later work by ____ introduced, \modplural, a multi-LLM collaboration technique between \textit{main} and \textit{community} LLMs. While this demonstrated overall improvements, its performance in the health domain remains unexamined. Although some studies evaluate pluralistic alignment in various contexts ____ or within specific alignment modes ____, none holistically assess all three pluralistic modes for healthcare. Prior research suggests that LLMs require domain-specific solutions ____. With the growing use of LLMs in healthcare ____, it is critical to benchmark and evaluate LLMs for pluralistic alignment in this domain.

\paragraph{Existing Datasets.} For such evaluations, a suitable dataset is necessary for benchmarking. \reftab{table:dataset-lit-review}, provides a non-exhaustive overview of existing alignment datasets, revealing a scarcity of pluralistic datasets with none focused solely on health. To address this gap, we introduce \ourdataset, a health-focused pluralistic alignment  dataset.
