High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. 
To address these challenges, we propose \ours: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. 
Unlike prior work, \ours is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. 
Instead, a new \ours instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. 
We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that \ours datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities.
