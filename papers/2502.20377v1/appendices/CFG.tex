\section{Question template generation}
\label{app:cfg}

\subsection{Context-Free Grammar}
\label{app:question_cfg}

We use the following CFG to generate question templates:
\begin{verbatim}  
    S -> Who is R? | What is A ? | How many RN_p does R_c have ?
    R -> the RN of R_c | the person whose AN is AV
    R_c -> R | N
    A -> the AN of R
    RN -> <relation>
    RN_p -> <relation_plural>
    AN -> <attribute_name>
    AV -> <attribute_value>
    N -> <name>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{CFG-generated question templates}
\label{app:question_templates}

Our CFG produces the following 50 question templates at recursion depth $d = 20$.
Note how the recursive production rule \verb+R_c -> R | N+ leads to chained productions.
