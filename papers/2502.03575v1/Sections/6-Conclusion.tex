\section{Conclusion}

\rv{
Our work contributes a computational model \name that simulates the eye movements on charts when humans solve visual analytical tasks.
The model benefits greatly from its hierarchical gaze control architecture wherein the high-level cognitive controller performs reasoning using memory while the low-level oculomotor controller directs the gaze within visual constraints.  
By following the principle of computational rationality, we are able to train the model in a controlled environment instead of relying on human eye tracking data. This circumvents the costly and time-consuming process of gathering such data. 
The results indicate that the model is better than baselines at generating human-like eye movements during analytical tasks. The predicted scanpaths closely match the spatial positions and temporal order of human scanpaths. While there are limitations to its generalizability and accuracy in question answering, it paves the way for further advances in modeling-based approaches.
