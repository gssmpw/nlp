\begin{abstract}
Legal case documents play a critical role in judicial proceedings.
As the number of cases continues to rise, the reliance on manual drafting of legal case documents is facing increasing pressure and challenges.
The development of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution for automating document generation. 
However, existing benchmarks fail to fully capture the complexities involved in drafting legal case documents in real-world scenarios.
To address this gap, we introduce CaseGen, the benchmark for multi-stage legal case documents generation in the Chinese legal domain.
CaseGen is based on 500 real case samples annotated by legal experts and covers seven essential case sections. It supports four key tasks: drafting defense statements, writing trial facts, composing legal reasoning, and generating judgment results.
To the best of our knowledge, CaseGen is the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in the context of legal case document generation.
To ensure an accurate and comprehensive evaluation, we design the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework and validate its effectiveness through human annotations.
We evaluate several widely used general-domain LLMs and legal-specific LLMs, highlighting their limitations in case document generation and pinpointing areas for potential improvement.
This work marks a step toward a more effective framework for automating legal case documents drafting, paving the way for the reliable application of AI in the legal field.
The dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/CaseGen}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:dis}
In this section, we provide a detailed discussion on the limitations of CaseGen, its broader impact, licensing, and ethical considerations.


\subsection{Limitation}
While CaseGen advances the evaluation of LLMs in the legal domain, several limitations still require further refinement.
First, CaseGen is built on Chinese legal cases, which means it may not capture the diversity and complexity of legal systems worldwide.
Different countries and regions have distinct legal frameworks, litigation procedures, and document formats.
CaseGen is currently unable to evaluate document generation across all legal environments.
Additionally, while our automated evaluation framework has been validated by legal experts, it cannot fully replace the nuanced professional judgment.
The evaluation results generated by the LLM may be influenced by the LLM's inherent limitations, especially in complex legal reasoning tasks. Furthermore, LLM judges are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, potentially compromising the stability and reliability of the evaluations.
In future work, we will expand the dataset to include legal case documents from more countries and regions, enhancing the applicability and comprehensiveness of the research. Additionally, we will further explore combining LLM judges with traditional metrics to improve the robustness of the evaluations.


\subsection{Broader Impact}

The research on CaseGen has significant implications for the digital transformation of the legal field. 
From a professional perspective, it enhances the efficiency of drafting legal documents. By reducing repetitive tasks, legal professionals can focus more on high-value analytical work, improving both the quality and efficiency of legal services.
Additionally, the multi-stage generation framework advances AI application in law. From a technical perspective, it provides concrete methods and pathways for evaluating legal AI systems, filling the gap in current evaluation benchmarks within legal AI. It not only helps legal professionals better understand and assess the quality of LLM-generated documents but also lays the groundwork for evaluating similar technologies in the future.

To ensure fairness and transparency, CaseGen undergo strict ethical review and broad oversight.
However, we urge caution against over-relying on AI-generated content. The goal of CaseGen is to enhance the efficiency of legal professionals, not to replace human legal expertise. The unique complexity of legal judgment still requires human insight, with AI serving as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional analysis. The technologies and evaluations related to CaseGen are for reference, and real-world legal applications still require human judgment.

In summary, CaseGen strongly supports the digital transformation of the legal domain by driving the automation of legal case document generation and enhancing judicial transparency and efficiency. However, we emphasize that AI must be applied responsibly and carefully to ensure it upholds fairness and reliability in the judicial process.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
The development and release of CaseGen have always followed strict ethical standards, ensuring compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines. 
During preprocessing, we implemented strong measures to safeguard personal privacy, anonymizing any data that could identify individuals. All data has been thoroughly reviewed to ensure compliance with privacy protection laws, data security regulations, and ethical research guidelines.
Legal experts have also reviewed the dataset to ensure it is free from harmful, offensive, or discriminatory material. We are committed to preventing any content that could harm individuals or groups and have taken steps to filter out discriminatory, violent, explicit, or offensive content.


\section{More Task details}
\label{sec:more task}
Tables~\ref{table:defense} to~\ref{table:judgement} present the prompts used for different tasks. For each task, the input information includes all the relevant content required to complete the task,
All input information is based on ground truth, not LLM-generated content. This ensures that LLMs can generate or reason based on accurate information.
Additionally, we emphasize the writing requirements corresponding to each task in the prompts to ensure that LLMs generate context that are both accurate and logically consistent.






\section{More Evaluation details}
\label{sec:more evaluation}

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
In CaseGen, each task is evaluated using distinct criteria, as shown in Table \label{table: criteria}. These criteria are carefully developed through discussions with legal experts to reflect the unique emphasis of each section within legal case documents.

\subsection{Instruction}
In Table~\ref{table:llm judges}, we present a prompt template that uses LLMs-as judges for evaluation. This prompt includes the evaluation criteria, chain-of-thought reasoning step, scoring stardards, and output format requirements. 





\section{More Implementation details}
\label{sec:exper}

In our experiments, the versions used for Claude-sonnet/GPT-3.5/GPT-4o-mini are claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022/gpt-3.5-turbo-1106/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, respectively. Lexilaw uses the LexiLaw\_Finetune version, while Chatlaw uses the Chatlaw-13B version.

During the evaluation process, we also report both ROUGE-L and BERTScore. Since CaseGen is a Chinese legal dataset, BERTScore was initialized using chinese-bert-wwm~\footnote{https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-bert-wwm}. All experiments presented in this paper are conducted on 8 NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs.


\section{Guidelines for Expert-Annotation}
\label{sec:guid}
To ensure the quality, consistency, and reliability of the CaseGen, we implement a strict verification and annotation process based on the following principles and standards. We have hired legal experts to ensure that all annotations meet the highest standards of legal accuracy and relevance.

Document Structure Extraction Check: Annotators first check the accuracy of the Fact, Reasoning, and Judgment sections structure extraction. If any errors are found, annotators must re-extract the relevant content from the full document.

Evidence Content Annotation:
We provide annotators with a list of the evidence mentioned in the legal case document. Annotators must first verify the authenticity of the evidence. Then, they annotate the evidence content according to the facts presented in the Fact section. Special attention must be paid to ensure that the evidence content strictly matches the Fact section, such as contract signing dates, specific clauses, and other details. Once the evidence annotation is complete, annotators need to check if the evidence covers all the facts in the Fact section. In other words, they must verify whether all relevant facts can be deduced from the available evidence. If certain facts cannot be deduced from the existing evidence, annotators should supplement the missing evidence based on their professional knowledge.
To ensure the quality of evidence annotation, annotators must also mark the corresponding Event for each piece of evidence, ensuring that all components of the fact are clearly outlined. Annotators must ensure that the relationship between Fact and Evidence is clear and accurate. Each piece of evidence must support a specific event, and this connection should be clearly presented in the legal case document. If any evidence fails to support the relevant events, annotators must note the reason and re-annotate the evidence.

Prosecution and Defense Annotation: Annotators must extract and revise the complaint and defense sections from the document, ensuring that these parts conform to the formal legal document format and language requirements.

Handling Uncertainties and Doubts: If annotators encounter uncertainties during the annotation process, they should take the following steps: (1) Consult Legal Experts: Annotators should consult authoritative legal documents, terminology glossaries, or directly seek advice from legal experts to resolve any unclear points. (2) Transparent Documentation: All decisions made during the annotation process must be clearly recorded, especially those made after consulting experts, to ensure transparency and consistency.

Feedback Mechanism: Annotators are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback, suggest improvements to the annotation process, or highlight challenges encountered during annotation. Based on annotator feedback, the annotation guidelines will be regularly reviewed and updated to meet the evolving needs of the CaseGen and improve annotation quality.

Review and Correction Mechanism: Once the annotations are complete, they undergo at least two rounds of independent review. (1) Evidence Integrity Check: In the first round of review, we use the Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct to check the completeness of the evidence. Specifically, the LLM first verifies if the evidence list and content cover all the facts mentioned in the Fact section. Then, the LLM checks each piece of evidence to ensure it aligns with the event. These two checks are discriminative and well-suited for LLMs, ensuring high accuracy. 
(2) Legality and Multi-Angle Validation: The second round of review is conducted by legal experts, who perform multi-angle validation to ensure that the annotations align with actual legal standards and the specifics of the case. Experts will also review the legal validity of the annotations to ensure they comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any issues or disputes during the annotation process should be discussed in expert meetings to reach a unified standard and decision, ensuring both accuracy and legal compliance.
Annotators must revise based on the review results and submit the updated annotations for a second round of review.

Final Data Quality Assurance: Before the final submission of the dataset, all annotations undergo a final check by a quality assurance team. This check includes verifying the completeness, accuracy, consistency, and legal relevance of the annotations. Only when the dataset fully meets the quality standards will it proceed to the next stage of processing.

Please objectively evaluate the defense statement written by the AI assistant in the role of a fair and rigorous judge. When evaluating, you should score based on the following four key dimensions:\\ \{Task-Oriented Criteria\}\\ \\ We will provide the following materials: The prosecution, a high-quality reference defense statement, and the defense statement written by the AI assistant.When starting your evaluation, youneed to follow the reasoning steps below:\\ 1. Compare the AI assistant’s defense statement with the reference answer, pointing out the shortcomings of the AI assistant’s answer and explaining them in detail.\\ 2. Evaluate the AI assistant’s defense statement according to the dimensions mentioned above, giving a score from 1 to 10 for each dimension.\\ 3. Based on the scores for each dimension, calculate the overall score for the AI defense statement (1-10 points).\\ 4. Your scoring should be as strict as possible, and you must follow the scoring rules below: The higher the quality of the response, the higher the score.\\ \\ Scoring Stardards:\\ If the defense statement includes irrelevant content, contains obvious factual or legal relationship errors, or generates harmful content with a large amount of unverified or false facts, the overall score should be 1-2 points.\\If the defense statement does not contain serious errors but has issues with the characterization of legal relationships or fails to adequately address key points in the complaint, failing to meet basic defense requirements, the overall score should be 3-4 points.\\If the defense statement generally meets defense requirements, with accurate facts and legal relationships but is average in terms of logical consistency and completeness, the overall score should be 5-6 points.\\If the defense statement is close to the reference answer in quality, performing well in each evaluation dimension with no obvious flaws, the overall score should be 7-8 points.\\If the defense statement is significantly better than the reference answer, fully responding to the claims, and performing almost perfectly across all evaluation dimensions, it should receive a score of 9-10 points.\\ \\ As an example, the reference answer could receive an overall score of 8 points. \\Please provide detailed evaluation comments during scoring. After each dimension score, make sure to provide an explanation. All scores should be integers. Finally, return the evaluation results in the following dictionary format:\\ \{\{``Factuality'': score, ``Legal Accuracy'': score, ``Logical Coherence'': score, ``Completeness'': score, ``Overall Score'': total score\}\}\\ \\ {[}Start of Prosecution{]}\\ \{Prosecution Content\}\\ {[}End of Prosecution{]}\\ \\ {[}Start of Reference Defense Statement{]}\\ \{Reference Defense Statement Content\}\\ {[}End of Reference Defense Statement{]}\\ \\ {[}Start of AI Assistant’s Defense Statement{]}\\ \{AI Assistant’s Defense Statement Content\}\\ {[}End of AI Assistant’s Defense Statement{]}\\ \\ Please begin the evaluation:\end{tabular}} \\ \hline
