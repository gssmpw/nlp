\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we revisit the optimization objective of MLLMs through the lens of information theory. Existing MLLMs, shaped by the autoregressive paradigm of LLMs, prioritize text generation at the expense of effectively leveraging visual information. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach, VDEP, which directly incorporates image reconstruction into the optimization objective of MLLMs. Our proposed VDEP framework seamlessly integrates image reconstruction into standard models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments conducted on 13 benchmark datasets demonstrate VDEP's ability to address these challenges and significantly improve visual content comprehension.
