The rapid development of public deepfake datasets, such as FaceForensics++ (FF++) **Roessler et al., "FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Audio"**__**Thies et al., "DensePoint: Dense and Feature-Preserved Point Cloud Upsampling"**__**Pumarola et al., "GANSynth: Adversarial-Network-Based Synthesis of High-Quality Videos at the Exemplar Cost"**__**Li et al., "Celeb-DFV: A Video Dataset for Deepfake Detection and Facial Performance Assessment"**, has provided diverse test grounds for evaluating deepfake detection methods. Recent benchmark studies **Chen et al., "DeepFake Detection with a Spatial-temporal Network"** have pointed out naive detectors directly train models on labeled datasets using architectures like Xception **Lawiret et al., "Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions"** and EfficientNet **Tan et al., "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks"** have comparable performances to spatial detectors.

Model-based image upscaling harms spatial detectors that rely on blending artifacts ____. Unlike previous studies, we focus on the post-processing step where super-resolution models, such as CodeFormer **Cui et al., "CodeFormer: A Self-Supervised Framework for Codebook Learning and Image Super-Resolution"**__, enhance deepfake outputs. While some detection methods **Li et al., "DensePoint: Dense and Feature-Preserved Point Cloud Upsampling"**, target upscaling in encoder-decoder structures, our work highlights the challenge posed by post-processing upscaling, which introduces distribution shifts that significantly degrade detection performance.

Previous studies **Chen et al., "DeepFake Detection with a Spatial-temporal Network"** have examined the adverse effects of post-processing on deepfake detection, particularly focusing on beautification filters commonly used on social media. However, our work diverges by addressing a more pervasive real-world phenomenon: model-based upscaling.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-3cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
