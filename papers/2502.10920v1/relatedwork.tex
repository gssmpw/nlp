\section{Related work}
The rapid development of public deepfake datasets, such as FaceForensics++ (FF++) \cite{rossler2019faceforensics++}, CelebDF \cite{li2020celeb}, DFD \cite{deepfake-detection-challenge}, and DFDC \cite{DFDC2020}, has provided diverse test grounds for evaluating deepfake detection methods. Recent benchmark studies \cite{yan2023deepfakebench, li2023continual} have pointed out naive detectors directly train models on labeled datasets using architectures like Xception \cite{chollet2017xception} and EfficientNet \cite{tan2019efficientnet, shiohara2022detecting} have comparable performances to spatial detectors.

Model-based image upscaling harms spatial detectors that rely on blending artifacts \cite{li2020face, nguyen2024laa, shiohara2022detecting, li2018exposing}. Unlike previous studies, we focus on the post-processing step where super-resolution models, such as CodeFormer \cite{zhou2022towards}, enhance deepfake outputs. While some detection methods \cite{liu2021spatial, tan2024rethinking} target upscaling in encoder-decoder structures, our work highlights the challenge posed by post-processing upscaling, which introduces distribution shifts that significantly degrade detection performance.

Previous studies \cite{libourel2024case} have examined the adverse effects of post-processing on deepfake detection, particularly focusing on beautification filters commonly used on social media. However, our work diverges by addressing a more pervasive real-world phenomenon: model-based upscaling.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-3cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
