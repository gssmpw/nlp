The rapid development of public deepfake datasets, such as FaceForensics++ (FF++) ____, CelebDF ____, DFD ____, and DFDC ____, has provided diverse test grounds for evaluating deepfake detection methods. Recent benchmark studies ____ have pointed out naive detectors directly train models on labeled datasets using architectures like Xception ____ and EfficientNet ____ have comparable performances to spatial detectors.

Model-based image upscaling harms spatial detectors that rely on blending artifacts ____. Unlike previous studies, we focus on the post-processing step where super-resolution models, such as CodeFormer ____, enhance deepfake outputs. While some detection methods ____ target upscaling in encoder-decoder structures, our work highlights the challenge posed by post-processing upscaling, which introduces distribution shifts that significantly degrade detection performance.

Previous studies ____ have examined the adverse effects of post-processing on deepfake detection, particularly focusing on beautification filters commonly used on social media. However, our work diverges by addressing a more pervasive real-world phenomenon: model-based upscaling.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-3cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths

                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.

                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
