\subsection{Interview questions}
Interview questions adapted from Ruddle et al \cite{ruddle2023tasks}: 

\begin{itemize}
\item What was your job/role during the pandemic?
\item Aim
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Where do you feel that the Dashboard/Visualization best provides a benefit in your work?
    \item What was the dashboard designed to let users do? Who were the users? How else was it used?
    \end{itemize}
\item Constraints: What time-scales, etc. did you have to work within?
\item Data: What data was involved? Where did it come from?
\item Dashboard development
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Get link to dashboard (or image)?
    \item[b.] How long did it take to develop?
    \item[c.] Who developed it?
    \item[d.] Was it changed?
    \item[e.] How many versions?
    \end{itemize}
\item Issues
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Bottlenecks? Pain points? Challenges?
    \item[b.] What assumptions/simplifications were you forced to make?
    \item[c.] Let yourself dream. What might have solved (or reduce) any of those difficulties, and what would the benefit have been to you?
    \end{itemize}
\item Could you do anything you could not do before with this tool?
\item Are they worth the effort of learning?
\item Current work: Do you still use dashboards? What for?
\item Future Works: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[a] Do you see other potential use from your work where approaches like these would be applicable, how/why?
    \item[b] How do you think the current tools should be improved?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{The Visualization Developers' Viewpoint}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Get link to dashboard (or image)?

    \item[c.] Who developed it?
    \item[d.] Was it changed?
    \item[e.] How many versions?
\end{itemize}

Add the developer's viewpoint also for the exemplary dashboards mentioned in the interviews.
