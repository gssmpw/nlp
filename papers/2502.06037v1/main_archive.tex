\begin{abstract} 
Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
This work was partially supported by the NSF (awards 2406231 and 2427948), NIH (awards R01NS124642 and R01DK131586), DARPA (HR00112420329), and the US Army (W911NF-20-D0002).

\section*{Impact Statement}
This study investigates whether time series models can perform implicit reasoning during zero-shot inference by synthesizing learned concepts to generalize to more complex data patterns. Our findings reveal that certain models can generalize effectively in well-designed OOD scenarios, highlighting reasoning abilities that go beyond basic pattern memorization. As this work is exploratory and not tied to specific applications, we do not foresee any negative societal impacts. In contrast, our insights could aid in the development of more data- and computationally-efficient deep learning architectures. Additionally, our results can help identify the limitations of time series models, ensuring that they are not used in scenarios where poor generalization is likely.

\section*{Reproducibility Statement}

The models were implemented using the \texttt{Neuralforecast} library~\citep{olivares2022library_neuralforecast}. The open-source code for generating critical difference diagrams is available at \url{https://github.com/hfawaz/cd-diagram}. All datasets used in this study are publicly accessible and can be downloaded by following the instructions at \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/gift-eval}. Model training and evaluation were conducted on a computing cluster equipped with 128 AMD EPYC 7502 CPUs, 503 GB of RAM, and 8 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs, each with 49 GiB of RAM. To ensure reproducibility, the model implementations, training framework, and datasets are open-source, supporting future research on model reasoning.
