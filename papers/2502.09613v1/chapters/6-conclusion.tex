\section{Conclusion }
This paper introduces the Latent Radiance Field (LRF), which to our knowledge, is the first work to construct radiance field representations directly in the 2D latent space for 3D reconstruction. We present a novel framework for incorporating 3D awareness into 2D representation learning, featuring a correspondence-aware autoencoding method and a VAE-Radiance Field (VAE-RF) alignment strategy to bridge the domain gap between the 2D latent space and the natural 3D space, thereby significantly enhancing the visual quality of our LRF.
Future work will focus on incorporating our method with more compact 3D representations, efficient NVS, few-shot NVS in latent space, as well as exploring its application with potential 3D latent diffusion models.
