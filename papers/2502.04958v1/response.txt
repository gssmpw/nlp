\subsection{PEFT}
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) **Brown, et al., "AdaFactor: A First-order Optimal Practivally-convergent Stochastic Gradient Method"** ____ aims to reduce the computational and storage costs associated with fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By tuning only a small subset of additional parameters while freezing the majority of pretrained model parameters, PEFT effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting issue often encountered in full fine-tuning. Moreover, PEFT outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods in low-data environments, demonstrating superior generalization capability. This technique is not limited to natural language processing tasks but extends to computer vision and audio domains, significantly enhancing the model's flexibility and adaptability. LoRA, as one of the most widely adopted PEFT techniques, adjusts specific pretrained model weights by introducing low-rank matrices, rather than updating all parameters, making it well-suited to downstream tasks. LoRA has shown exceptional adaptability and efficiency in large language models, allowing them to swiftly adapt to new tasks while preserving most of their original structure. The success of LoRA has sparked numerous further studies in the field.

AdaLoRA **Bafriou et al., "Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation"**____, for instance, introduces orthogonal regularization to ensure that the low-rank projection matrices comply with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), thus avoiding the reliance on incremental updates, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. QLoRA **Chen et al., "Quantization-aware LoRA"** ____ improves computational efficiency and reduces resource consumption through dynamic quantization and advanced strategies, though it may potentially impact model accuracy. DoRA **Kaplan et al., "Dynamic Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation"** ____ decomposes pretrained weights into magnitude and direction components, utilizing LoRA for directional updates, reducing trainable parameters and enhancing fine-tuning performance, though its complexity and dependence on data quality may limit its effectiveness. Vera **Rajbhandari et al., "Vera: Efficient Fine-Tuning with Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation"**____, on the other hand, reduces parameter overhead by sharing low-rank matrices and learning small-scale vectors, while maintaining performance, though the model's complexity and hyperparameter tuning requirements might hinder overall effectiveness.

\subsection{State Space Model}
State Space Model (SSM) are mathematical models used to describe dynamic systems, comprising an input sequence \( x(t) \), a latent state representation, and an output sequence \( y(t) \). The primary objective of an SSM is to predict future states based on the current input and previous states. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in applying SSMs to neural network architectures. Compared to traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), SSM-based models are capable of resolving the issue of sequential processing bottlenecks, thus significantly improving training efficiency. Models based on SSMs, such as HIPPO (**Chen et al., "Hierarchy of Integrators with Projection and Partial Orthogonalization"**) ____ have been shown to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. S4 (**Zhu et al., "Structured State Space Sequence Model"**) ____ leveraged SSM architecture to outperform transformers and other architectures in handling ultra-long sequences. Mamba **Zhu et al., "Mamba: Modifiable Adaptive Neural Architecture for Efficient Sequence Processing"**____, an extension of SSM, introduced a selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts the model based on input, thereby improving adaptability. However, despite these advantages, the generalization capabilities of SSMs across various domains remain to be fully validated. To address this, we propose incorporating SSM into fine-tuning methodologies. By improving the existing LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique, we aim to enhance fine-tuning performance on specific tasks while preserving the Transformer architecture. This leads to our proposed method, SSMLoRA, which combines modified SSM equations with LoRA. Compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, SSMLoRA strengthens the connections between inserted low-rank matrices, improving data matching capabilities and achieving comparable or superior performance across most datasets.

\subsection{Sparsification Methods}
Sparsification methods aim to reduce computational complexity and memory requirements by decreasing the number of model parameters while maintaining performance as much as possible. These techniques include weight pruning, structured sparsity, dynamic sparse training, and sparse regularization. **Han et al., "Structured Sparsity Learning"** ____ proposed Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL), a technique capable of learning efficient and compact structures from large deep neural networks, significantly enhancing model speed and performance. **Yu et al., "Optimizing Deep Neural Networks through Structural Pruning"** ____ optimized convolutional neural networks through structured pruning, effectively reducing overall memory demand. **Li et al., "Interleaved Graph Convolutional Network with Structured Sparsity"** ____ proposed IGCV2, which applied interleaved structured sparsity to convolutional layers. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of employing sparser structures. In our work, we aim to improve the parameter utilization of low-rank matrices while significantly reducing memory requirements and improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. This provides vital support for subsequent model optimization and deployment.
