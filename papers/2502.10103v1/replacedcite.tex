For additional background on inverse semigroups, we refer to the standard books ____ and the many references therein.


While membership problems in infinite semigroups recently have also gained a lot of attention (see ____ for a few examples), let us in the following give an overview on related work on the membership problem with the input models we use in the present work.



\mysubparagraph{Membership Problem (Cayley table model).}

The membership problem has been studied for many algebraic structures.
Indeed ____ shows that the membership problem for magmas (\ie\ having a binary operation with no additional axioms) is \Ptime-complete in the Cayley table model.
In contrast, by ____ for quasigroups (magma with ``inverses'', a.k.a.\ latin squares) it is in \NPOLYLOGTIME using similar techniques as  we apply for the first part of \cref{thm:main-CT}. 

The membership problems for semigroups in the Cayley table model has been introduced by Jones, Lien, and Laaser ____.
Further studies by Barrington, Kadau, and Lange ____ showed that it can be solved in $\mathsf{FOLL}$ for nilpotent groups of constant class.
This result has been further improved by Collins, Grochow, Levet, and \ifAnonimous Weiß\else the last author\fi____ showing that the problem can be solved in $\mathsf{FOLL}$ for all nilpotent groups (\ie of arbitrary class) and served as a catalyst for \ifAnonimous Fleischer\else the first author\fi's work ____ giving \NPOLYLOGTIME algorithms for Clifford semigroups, on which we build in the present work.

\mysubparagraph{Membership Problem (Transformation/Partial Bijection Model).}

The membership problem for semigroups in the transformation model has been shown to be $\PSPACE$-complete by Kozen____.
Beaudry ____ showed that the membership problem in commutative semigroups is \NP-complete in the transformation model.
This was later extended in ____ to classify the complexity of the membership problem in aperiodic monoids as outlined above.

Based on Sims' work ____, Furst, Hopcroft, and Luks ____ showed that the membership problem for permutation groups is solvable in polynomial time, which after several partial results ____ was improved to \NC by Babai, Luks, and Seress ____.
Interestingly, the problem of rational subset membership is \NP-complete due to Luks ____ (see also ____).

Turning our attention to the partial bijection model, it was observed by Jack____ that the membership problem for \emph{inverse semigroups} given by partial bijections is \PSPACE-complete.
This follows from an earlier result by by Birget, Margolis, Meakin, and Weil____ showing that the intersection non-emptiness problem for \emph{inverse automata} is \PSPACE-complete.

\mysubparagraph{Subpower Membership Problem.}
While there is no obvious generalization of the partial bijection or transformation semigroup model to non-associative structure such as magmas, the subpower membership problem still can be posed in this case.
Indeed, the subpower membership problem initially has been studied within the context of universal algebra, see \eg ____, and has turned out to be $\mathsf{EXPTIME}$-complete ____ in general.
For arbitrary semi\-groups the subpower membership problem has been shown to be $\PSPACE$-complete by Bulatov, Kozik, Mayr, and Steindl ____.

Further results on the subpower membership problem in semigroups are due to Steindl giving a \Ptime vs.\ \NP-completeness dichotomy for the special case of bands ____ and a \Ptime vs.\ \NP-complete vs.\ \PSPACE-complete trichotomy for combinatorial Rees matrix semigroups with adjoined identity
____. 
Here it is interesting to note that by our results the \NP-completeness case does not exists for inverse semigroups.

We now turn our attention to the intimately related intersection non-emptiness problem.

\mysubparagraph{Intersection Non-Emptiness Problem.}
The DFA intersection non-emptiness problem has been introduced and shown to be $\PSPACE$-complete by Kozen____.
Further work studying the complexity (including parametrized and fine-grained complexity) of the DFA intersection non-emptiness problem can be found in ____.
Two special cases are that the DFA intersection non-emptiness problem is \NP-complete for DFA accepting finite languages ____ and for DFA over a unary alphabet ____ (see also ____).

Another important special case are permutation automata____ (a.k.a.\ group DFAs). 
This is closely linked to the membership problem in groups, which is in \NC ____. 
Thus, it comes rather as a surprise that the intersection non-emptiness problem is \NP-complete as Brondin, Krebs, and McKenzie ____ showed; however, when restricting to permutation automata with a single accepting state it, indeed, is in \NC ____.
Even more, intersection non-emptiness for permutation automata plus one context-free language is \PSPACE-complete ____.

Note that every permutation automaton is an inverse automaton as studied in the present work and \eg by Birget, Margolis, Meakin, and Weil ____.
Furthermore, inverse automata are a special case of \emph{reversible} automata (or injective automata as they are called in ____), which were studied \eg by Pin ____ and Radionova and Okhotin ____.

In particular, the case of groups has attracted a lot of attention after Goldmann and Russell ____ showed that deciding satisfiability of a system of equations is \NP-complete for every fixed non-abelian group and in \Ptime for abelian groups. 
For more recent conditional lower bounds and algorithms for deciding satisfiability of (single) equations, see \eg ____.

The case of semigroups has attracted much less attention.
While here the closely related problem of checking identities has been investigated thoroughly, ____, there is relatively little work on deciding whether a (system of) equation(s) has a solution.

In ____ the problem of deciding whether a (single) equation in finite monoids is satisfiable has been investigated.
Among other results it has been shown that in the Brandt monoid $B_2^1$, which also plays an important role in our work, this problem is \NP-complete.
Furthermore, in ____ systems of equations in semigroups were studied.
