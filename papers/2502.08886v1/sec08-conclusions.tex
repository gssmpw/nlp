In conclusion, current GenAI implementations address IoT security improvements.
LLMs have been used in various ways, such as finding vulnerabilities and creating cyber exercise scenarios, to improve cyber security and directly improve IoT security.
Although these implementations are robust, there are inherent limitations, such as the lack of a publicly available repository for LLM security issues.
However, this does not prevent LLMs from being further research to address identified gaps, potentially securing the IoT ecosystem, its network, and its human aspect.
The 33 state-of-the-art works serve as starting points for further research. 
Accompanied with three case studies, this survey paper inspires the application of GenAI to secure IoT systems, be it hardware, software, or network security.
