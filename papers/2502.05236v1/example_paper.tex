\begin{abstract}
While autoregressive speech token generation models produce speech with remarkable variety and naturalness, their inherent lack of controllability often results in issues such as hallucinations and undesired vocalizations that do not conform to conditioning inputs. 
We introduce Koel-TTS, a suite of enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer TTS models that address these challenges by incorporating preference alignment techniques guided by automatic speech recognition and speaker verification models. 
Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech. 
Notably, Koel-TTS directly maps text and context audio to acoustic tokens, and on the aforementioned metrics, outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models, despite being trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Audio samples and demos are available on our website~\footnote{\url{https://koeltts.github.io/}}.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
