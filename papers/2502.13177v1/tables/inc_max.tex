\texttt{I'm sorry to hear that! Have you thought about trying a new diet? A friend of mine says the raw food diet has helped her problems a lot. Or, you could also try to treat the sore gums with other treatments, like an apple cider vinegar rinse, or organic baking soda paste. Or, you could also just try eating soft foods, like salads, for a while. It might help you heal faster.}

\caption{A qualitative example in Antropic-HH~\cite{bai2022training} where the implicit reward margin is maximized among the pairs with monotonically increasing logits. In this case, $\beta$-DPO and \method{} share the same decision on adaptive control; both try to increase $\beta$ for this preference pair.}
