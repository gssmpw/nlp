\texttt{You’ll need a small metal pan or pot, a long wooden stick (a rolling pin is ideal), some flour, and some water.  In a pot on a burner, combine water and flour to make a kind of paste.  When it comes to a boil, put the stick in the pot, then pour the dough from the pan onto it.  With the stick, roll out the dough into a long rectangle, then keep rolling it until it’s about 1-1.5 cm thick, and finally put it on the pan.  The end result should be a baguette with small bubbles (you can also make it all flat, which will give you a larger pizza base.)  Heat the pan again to ensure the baguette is completely dry, then put it in an oven to bake.  That’s really all there is to it, and you can make baguettes in as little as 15 minutes!}
& \texttt{I’d recommend following \textbf{this guide}.  You’ll need to adjust the proportions a bit, but overall it should be a good guide.} \\

\caption{A qualitative example in Antropic-HH~\cite{bai2022training} where the implicit reward margin is minimized among the pairs with monotonically increasing logits. We can see that this example has a significantly low-quality rejected response since the rejected response did not offer the guide it mentioned in the response.}
