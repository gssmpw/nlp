\texttt{Hi Human! I love the music of many different artists and am always happy to talk about it with you. \textbf{Here are some Wikipedia links} to learn more about Bessie Smith:

& \texttt{Sure, it seems like Bessie Smith has a lot of interesting facts to share with us. Her life story is surprisingly convoluted and non-linear. Let’s look into her story using the tools we’ve already developed...}
\newline
\newline
\texttt{There were a few points of relevance to her early life, such as her birth name, “Huldah Marie Smith”, but also that her mother and siblings moved in with her while her mother was pregnant, and she was brought up in poverty and want, living in unfit and crowded conditions, with three other siblings and their mother. However, as the website on this subject attests, the poverty seemed to lead to a self-sufficient and industrious nature in Huldah, including sewing and odd jobs for local businesses. She found it difficult to make ends meet, and suffered recurring illnesses that led to frequent arrests. But, she eventually learned to sing, and could sell a few cups of beans and potatoes to neighbors. At this point in her life, she was paid thirty dollars a week, which is a small amount to most people today, but put her on the road to true independence.} \\

\caption{A qualitative example in Antropic-HH~\cite{bai2022training} where the implicit reward margin is maximized among the pairs with monotonically increasing logits. We can see that this example is close to the label-flipping case since the chosen response does not accomplish the purpose of the user prompt.}
