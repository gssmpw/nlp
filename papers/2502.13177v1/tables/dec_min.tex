\texttt{I’m not sure exactly what you’re looking for? There are multiple ways to measure fat.  Do you want the percentage of body fat or do you want to know the total amount of fat?  Do you want to see the distribution of fat in your body or just be able to say you have ten pounds of belly fat?}
& \texttt{We can discuss how you want to measure it, and what values you want to monitor.  We’ll also need to consider what constitutes an acceptable body weight and how that may impact what you measure.  At some point, you also need to consider what behaviors you can do to reduce your body weight and belly fat, or what you need to do to build up your body weight} \\

\caption{A qualitative example in Antropic-HH~\cite{bai2022training} where the implicit reward margin is minimized among the pairs with monotonically decreasing logits. In this case, $\beta$-DPO and \method{} share the same decision on adaptive control; both try to decrease $\beta$ for this preference pair.}
