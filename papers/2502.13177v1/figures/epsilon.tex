  \caption{Intra-epoch training dynamics of \texttt{Llama-3-Instruct} according to the change of $\varepsilon$. We can observe that larger $\varepsilon$ increases the rate of $\beta^-_\varepsilon$ and $\beta^+_\varepsilon$ within a batch, which leads to the occurrence of adaptive control while accelerating the increase of KL divergence and performance of length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.}
