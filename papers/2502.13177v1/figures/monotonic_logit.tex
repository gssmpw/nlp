  \caption{\method{} adaptively controls $\beta$ corresponding to the KL penalty strength for each preference pair by checking whether the log-likelihood ratio of the chosen response and the rejected response changes monotonically with the perturbation of $\beta$ used during training. It is equivalent to checking the monotonicity of the logits as a preference model induced by the DPO and estimating the advantage of the change in $\beta$ by the change of train-time inverse temperature to the preference confidence under the same test-time temperature.}
