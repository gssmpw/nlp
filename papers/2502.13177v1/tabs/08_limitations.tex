\section*{Limitations}

\method{} requires the reference policy because it has a KL penalty from the reference policy, like DPO in default. It leads to the limitation that it requires additional memory consumption and computation for reference policy compared to other direct alignment algorithms that do not perform regularization through the reference policy~\cite{zhao2023slic, xu2024contrastive, hong2024orpo, meng2024simpo}. However, theoretically, \method{} can save memory consumption by pre-computing the logits of the responses from the reference policy, similar to DPO. Meanwhile, \method{} is a general purposes approach not specially tailored for safety alignment, so additional safety considerations may be required to control inappropriate responses in real usages.
