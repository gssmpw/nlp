While previous research has hinted at the inadequacy of differential privacy in protecting databases with correlated entries, our analysis using pointwise maximal leakage offers a quantitative evaluation of the potential weaknesses in DP's guarantees. Our investigation illuminates the vulnerabilities arising from DP's distribution-agnostic definition, even in its strongest form, i.e., pure DP, which could foster a false sense of privacy if applied indiscriminately. In contrast, PML's ability to adjust to diverse scenarios due to its distribution-dependent nature provides a more nuanced approach to privacy preservation. In this way, our work highlights the necessity for further research aimed at developing a wide array of PML mechanisms tailored to specific contexts.
