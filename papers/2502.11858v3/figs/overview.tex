    \caption{Overview of the adversarial perturbation crafting in the adversarial training process. Given an audio-visual data, we randomly segment it into different parts (\textcolor{green}{green} and \textcolor{yellow}{yellow}) and sample frames from each of the segments with ratio $\alpha$ (\textcolor{red}{red}). Then, we diversify each sampled frame by $N_{\hat{T}}$ copies and employ TIA and MMA to craft the adversarial perturbation. Finally, we map the generated adversarial perturbation to corresponding segments, creating adversarial examples for adversarial training.}
