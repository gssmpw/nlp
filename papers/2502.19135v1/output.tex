\begin{abstract}
    % Please provide an abstract of max 250. The abstract should not contain any undefined abbreviations or unspecified references. The abstract serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications. Authors are advised to check the author instructions for the journal they are submitting to for word limits and if structural elements like subheadings, citations, or equations are permitted.

  This paper presents a novel framework, called \frameworkname (PLanning with Natural language for Task-Oriented Robots), that integrates Large Language
  Models (LLMs) with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning
  for multi-robot tasks. The system employs a two-phase generation of
  a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and
  compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure
  that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and
  parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The
  final plan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in
  ROS2. We tested the framework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a
  block world and an arch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that
  LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human
  feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and
  explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM
  integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible,
  scalable, and human-understandable planning.

% \item Introduces \textbf{\frameworkname}(PLanning with Natural language for Task-Oriented Robots), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Prolog-based knowledge management and planning for multi-robot systems.
% \item Employs a \emph{two-phase knowledge base generation} process using LLMs to create a structured Prolog knowledge base, ensuring \textit{reusability} and \emph{compositional reasoning}.
% \item Implements a \emph{three-step planning procedure} that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming, generating executable \emph{behavior trees}.
% \item Demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in \emph{multi-robot assembly tasks}, showing that LLM-generated knowledge bases, with modest human feedback, can support scalable planning.
