We now introduce a running example, which will be used throughout this work to expose the interplay between the different components of the framework. 
This scenario is taken from the blocks-world domain~\cite{blocksworld}, which is frequently used in task planning. In particular, in this scenario we consider a table, blocks, which may either be directly on the table or stack on top of each other, and robotics arms, which move the blocks around. Each block is also associated with a position in the 2D space. 
In this particular example, we start from a situation in which we have two blocks, \verb|b1| and \verb|b2|, which are sat on the table in position (1,1) and (3,1) respectively. The goal is to move \verb|b1| in position (2,2) and then put \verb|b2| on top of it. An iconography of the example can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:running-example}.

While this is a trivial example, it highlights very well the
capability of the knowledge management system to generate complex
predicates that can be used for planning and it also shows the
cooperative abilities of the framework. Indeed, while using a single
robotic arm generates a straight-forward plan solution, coordinating
two robotics arms to do the same task reduces the completion time at the price
of a higher planning complexity.
