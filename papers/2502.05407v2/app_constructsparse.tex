\section{Feature learning with feedbacks: Constructing sparse activations}
\akash{I think this can be taken off}\akash{if adding them add appendix as well}
In this appendix, we provide the proof of \thmref{thm: constructsparse}.

Idea is there exist a sparse set of activations as shown in \cite{kumar2024learningsmoothdistancefunctions} which can be used here.

Let $U_{ext}$ consist of $p(p+1)/2$ unit vectors in $\reals^p$, as follows:
$$ U_{ext} = \{e_i: 1 \leq i \leq p\} \cup \{(e_i + e_j)/\sqrt{2}: 1 \leq i < j \leq p \} .$$
Here $e_i$ is the $i$th standard basis vector.
