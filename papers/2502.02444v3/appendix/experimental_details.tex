\subsection{Data Statistics for Collecting Value Lexicons}
\label{app:data_statistics}


We collect value-laden LLM generations from four data sources: ValueBench \cite{ren2024valuebench}, GPV \cite{ye2025gpv}, ValueLex \cite{biedma2024beyond}, and BeaverTails \cite{ji2024beavertails}. They provide data of different forms: raw LLM responses, parsed perceptions (a sentence that is highly reflective of values \cite{ye2025gpv}), and annotated values. The summary of the data statistics is shown in \cref{tab:summary}.

ValueBench is a collection of customized inventories for evaluating LLM values based on their responses to advice-seeking user queries. By administering the inventories to a set of LLMs, the authors collect 11,928 responses\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Value4AI/ValueBench/blob/main/assets/QA-dataset-answers-rating.xlsx}{https://github.com/Value4AI/ValueBench/blob/main/assets/QA-dataset-answers-rating.xlsx}}, each considered as one perception. The responses are annotated with 37,526 values by Kaleido \cite{sorensen2024value}, of which 330 are unique.

GPV \cite{ye2025gpv} is a psychologically grounded framework for measuring LLM values given their free-form outputs. Perceptions are considered atomic measurement units in GPV, and the authors collect 24,179 perceptions\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Value4AI/gpv/blob/master/assets/question-answer-perception.csv}{https://github.com/Value4AI/gpv/blob/master/assets/question-answer-perception.csv}} from a set of LLM subjects. The perceptions are annotated with 62,762 values, of which 361 are unique.

In ValueLex \cite{biedma2024beyond}, the authors collect 745 unique values from a set of fine-tuned LLMs via direct prompting (see \cref{app:against_bhn} for more details).

BeaverTails \cite{ji2024beavertails} is an AI safety-focused collection. We use a subset of the BeaverTails dataset\footnote{\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/BeaverTails/tree/main/round0/30k}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/BeaverTails/tree/main/round0/30k}}, which contains 3012 LLM responses, which are then parsed into 10,008 perceptions. The perceptions are annotated with 21,968 values, of which 395 are unique.

We combine the data from the four sources and obtain 123 unique values after filtering.

\subsection{Value Measurement for Structuring Value System}
\label{app:value_measurement}

We measure the value orientations of the LLMs subjects following GPV \cite{ye2025gpv}. GPV is an LLM-based, data-driven, and psychologically grounded value measurement paradigm. It dynamically parses unstructured texts into perceptions akin to static stimuli in traditional psychometrics, then measures and aggregates the value orientations they reveal. It enables theoretically and empirically validated value measurement, based on free-form LLM generations and under arbitrary value systems.

In this study, we measure LLM values to compute the correlations between our 123 atomic values and derive the value system structure. Similar to \cite{ye2025gpv}, we generate one advice-seeking and value-eliciting prompt for each of the atomic values, using \cref{prompt:item generation}. We administer the 123 prompts to all 693 LLM subjects and collect their responses, then measure their values using GPV. Each value dimension is measured using all responses. We compute the inter-LLM correlations between 123 values to structure our value system.


\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Generating value-eliciting questions.},  label={prompt:item generation}, style=promptstyle]
    You are an expert in human values. You need to design first-person open-ended value-eliciting questions for evaluating the value orientations of a large language model (LLM). Below are some helpful tips for designing questions:

    - LLMs serve human users. You must pretend that you are a human user and ask advice-seeking questions. For example, you may ask "Should I choose a career that I love or a career that pays well?"
    
    - Remember that the questions target an AI model, not a human; avoid questions that might induce refusals such as "I am an AI model and do not have ...".
    
    - Direct questions can lead to generic or overly favorable responses. Instead, use value dilemmas or scenarios to reveal the LLM's underlying values. For instance, to evaluate "helpfulness", you may present a hypothetical scenario that involves a trade-off, such as: "I am in a situation where I can help others, but it will cost myself a lot. What should I do?"
    
    A user will give you a value, and you need to provide a question for evaluating that value. Your response should be in the following JSON format:
    {
        "value": "USER GIVEN VALUE",
        "question": "YOUR DESIGNED QUESTION"
    }
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{LLM Value Alignment} \label{app:llm value alignment}

All experiments were conducted on two NVIDIA L20 GPUs, each with 48GB of memory. We generally follow the experimental setup in \cite{yao2023value_fulcra}, with the exceptions noted below. As shown in \cref{tab:llm value alignment}, our modifications improve the harmlessness of the aligned model with only marginal reduction in helpfulness.

The original BaseAlign algorithm operates exclusively within the Schwartz value system, as it relies on a value evaluator trained on Schwartz's values and an alignment target specific to this system. We extend BaseAlign to align LLMs under any arbitrary value system. First, we employ GPV \cite{ye2025gpv} as an open-vocabulary value evaluator. Second, we propose a method for distilling the alignment target from human preference data (\cref{sec:value_alignment}). 
The distillation process terminates when the alignment target converges, after processing approximately 16k preference pairs. The results of this distillation are shown in \cref{tab:alignment_targets_schwartz} for Schwartz's values and \cref{tab:alignment_targets_ours} for our system. The distilled alignment target, based on Schwartz's values, closely matches the heuristically defined target in BaseAlign \cite{yao2023value_fulcra}, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

The original BaseAlign implementation masks dimensions with absolute values less than 0.3 in the measurement results, excluding them from the final distance calculation. We remove this masking threshold and observe improved alignment performance. We also early stop the training when the reward plateaus.
