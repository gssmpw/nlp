\section*{Limitations}
Despite \method{} demonstrating its effectiveness on the TQA and TFV tasks, there are several limitations. First, HIPPO relies on multi-modal table representations, which require additional input tokens compared to unimodal representations. Furthermore, it may necessitate an additional table-to-text process compared to models that only use image-based representations. Although we have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of both text-based and image-based table representations in table reasoning tasks, further analysis is needed to better understand how MLLMs conduct reasoning based on table inputs of different modalities.
