\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes \method{} to optimize the ability of MLLMs to effectively leverage the semantics from multi-modal table representations for more accurate table understanding. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of \method{} in enabling MLLMs to learn richer semantics across table representations of different modalities.


%thereby enhancing table understanding through multi-modal representations.

%During DPO training, \method{} samples negative responses from table representations of hybrid modalities and designs the modality-consist sampling method for optimization.
