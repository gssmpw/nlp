\begin{abstract}
Deep latent variable models learn condensed representations of data that, hopefully, reflect the inner workings of the studied phenomena. Unfortunately, these latent representations are not statistically identifiable, meaning they cannot be uniquely determined. Domain experts, therefore, need to tread carefully when interpreting these. Current solutions limit the lack of identifiability through additional constraints on the latent variable model, e.g.\@ by requiring labeled training data, or by restricting the expressivity of the model. We change the goal: instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify \emph{relationships} between them such as meaningful distances, angles, and volumes. We prove this is feasible under very mild model conditions and without additional labeled data. We empirically demonstrate that our theory results in more reliable latent distances, offering a principled path forward in extracting trustworthy conclusions from deep latent variable models.

%which gives practitioners a way forward.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Latent variable models express the density of observational data through a set of latent, i.e.\@ unobserved, variables that ideally capture the driving mechanisms of the data-generating phenomena. For example, the latent variables of a variational autoencoder \citep{VAE, rezende2014stochastic} trained on protein data, can reveal the underlying protein evolution which can help domain experts understand a problem of study \citep{riesselman2018deep, ding2019deciphering, Detlefsen_2022}. % Similarly, when aiming to explain how a neural network functions, we want to reason about its (latent) weights.

Unfortunately, latent variables are rarely identifiable, i.e.\@ they cannot be uniquely estimated from data. This lack of uniqueness prevents reliable analysis of the learned latent variables as the analysis becomes subject to the arbitrariness of model training. Fig.~\ref{fig:transcriptomic} exemplifies the issue, where two independently trained latent representations are estimated from transcriptomic data \citep{tasic2018shared}. While clusters are similarly estimated across models, the \emph{relationships} between clusters vary significantly, preventing us from extracting intra-cluster information from the plots. This fundamental issue has sparked the development of training heuristics to limit the issue \citep{thearttsne}, and the practice of analyzing latent variables has been both disputed \citep{chari2023specious} and defended \citep{lause2024art}. This entire discussion could have been avoided if only distances between latent variables had been identifiable.\looseness=-1

The latent variables are not identifiable and change between training runs. Pairwise Euclidean distances (bottom row, averaged across cell types) also change significantly between runs. This lack of identifiability prevents us from reliably using the latent representations to understand the underlying biology.}

Providing identifiability guarantees has been heavily investigated. We survey key results in Secs.~\ref{sec:background} and \ref{sec:related_work}, but the executive summary is that current approaches require significant model restrictions (e.g.\@ linearity assumptions), labeled data, or a combination of both. These solutions are underwhelming to practitioners who often lack a labeling mechanism and are keen to leverage contemporary generative models.


\textbf{In this paper}, we change the identifiability question to arrive at working tools that do not require data labels and only impose minimal restrictions on the used models. Instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify the \emph{relationship between latent variables}. For example, instead of identifying the coordinates of the latent variables we identify pairwise distances. In our experience, this matches the needs of domain experts who rarely assign meaning to the coordinates of latent variables. Using differential geometry, we prove strong identifiability guarantees on pairwise distances, angles, and more. We empirically validate our theory on two variational autoencoders. % and release the code.



%\point{Within the general class of deep latent variable models, can we achieve strongly identifiable latent metric spaces in the latent space of the model without compromising its flexibility?}

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Introduce the reader to what identifiability means in this context and why it is important. 
%    \item Briefly explain the differences between strong and weak identifiability
%    \item briefly mention work so far and why it is, honestly, a disappointment
%    \item Lead the reader from the hopeless "nothing can ever be identifiable, we are doomed" to the pragmatic "we can still do a lot if we could establish identifiability of the structure"
%    \item state point 1 from the above as the main question. 
%    \item When introducing the approach, highlight that we are joining two lines of work (bloem-reddy and diffgeom). We are framing strong identifiability of distances as reparametrization invariance in differential geometry. Mention that this approach is scalable, feasible and has various degrees of "purity" but evidence for its efficacy in any case. 
%    \item End with a teaser like "Is diffgeom the answer to identifiability concerns? We will make such an argument"
%\end{itemize}
%While our main result concerns establishing strongly identifiable distances in the latent space, along the way towards the goal, we establish the following facts:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item each decoder in $f\in \mathcal{F}$ gives rise to an embedded submanifold of the observation space $\mathcal{D}$. A fact that is frequently alluded to in the literature, whereas we provide the first (to our knowledge) proof of the fact
%    \item the indeterminacy transformations $\mathbf{A}(M)$ for the model defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:StatModLvm} are reparametrizations of the same manifold equivalent to the concept of charts that is well-studied in differential geometry
