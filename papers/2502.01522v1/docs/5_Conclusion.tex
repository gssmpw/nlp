\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose BD-Diff, a generative-diffusion-based model for image deblurring on unknown domains with blur-decoupled learning. By joint training on a supervised deblurring task, an unsupervised blur pattern learning task, and a reconstruction task, BD-Diff generalizes well to handle images from unknown domains that lack paired data. Experiments on widely-used real-world datasets demonstrate that BD-Diff outperforms existing SOTA methods in blur removal and structural preservation, showcasing its potential for application in diverse and challenging environments.
