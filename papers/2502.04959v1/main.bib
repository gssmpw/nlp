The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible, and are provided in the earth observation program Copernicus. We present a novel dataset, based on these images that covers 13 spectral bands and is comprised of ten classes with a total of 27 000 labeled and geo-referenced images. Benchmarks are provided for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. An overall classification accuracy of 98.57\% was achieved with the proposed novel dataset. The resulting classification system opens a gate toward a number of earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes, and how it can assist in improving geographical maps.

State-of-the-art approaches achieve remarkable performance when training data is plentiful, but they are typically tied to ﬂat, 2D representations that model objects as a collection of unconnected views, limiting their ability to generalize across viewpoints. In this paper, we therefore lift two state-of-the-art 2D object representations to 3D, on the level of both local feature appearance and location. In extensive experiments on existing and newly proposed datasets, we show our 3D object representations outperform their state-of-the-art 2D counterparts for ﬁne-grained categorization and demonstrate their efﬁcacy for estimating 3D geometry from images via ultrawide baseline matching and 3D reconstruction.},

	abstract = {The “German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark” is a multi-category classification competition held at IJCNN 2011. Automatic recognition of traffic signs is required in advanced driver assistance systems and constitutes a challenging real-world computer vision and pattern recognition problem. A comprehensive, lifelike dataset of more than 50,000 traffic sign images has been collected. It reflects the strong variations in visual appearance of signs due to distance, illumination, weather conditions, partial occlusions, and rotations. The images are complemented by several precomputed feature sets to allow for applying machine learning algorithms without background knowledge in image processing. The dataset comprises 43 classes with unbalanced class frequencies. Participants have to classify two test sets of more than 12,500 images each. Here, the results on the first of these sets, which was used in the first evaluation stage of the two-fold challenge, are reported. The methods employed by the participants who achieved the best results are briefly described and compared to human traffic sign recognition performance and baseline results.},
