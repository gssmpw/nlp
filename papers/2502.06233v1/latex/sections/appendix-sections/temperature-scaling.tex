\section{Temperature Scaling Results}
\label{sec:appendix-temperature}

As discussed in \S\ref{sec:temperature}, a single optimal temperature, $T^\star$, was determined for each model and confidence extraction method by using a 10\% held-out set, aggregated across all datasets. Fitting is done using grid search on values between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{4}$. The temperatures for each configuration are presented in Figure \ref{fig:temperatures-map}. As can be seen, each of the confidence extraction method work with a different temperature magnitude because it produce confidence values on a different scale.

    \caption{The best temperatures values for each model / confidence-method combination. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:temperature}, we fit a single temperature hyper-parameter across 10\% of all datasets together. As can be seen, each of the confidence extraction method work with a different temperature magnitude. We also see variability between models using the same confidence extraction method.
