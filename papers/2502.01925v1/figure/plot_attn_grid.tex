    \caption{\textbf{Illustration of how the attention map is divided into smaller partitions based on segments of a 4-shot MSJ prompt.} $N_1, \dotsc, N_5$ denote the token indices that segments the input prompt based on demonstrations, and $N_5$ marks the start of the target prompt. These indices divide the input prompt into segments. Attention scores in the red rectangular partitions represent how tokens \textit{from different segments} attend to each other, while those from the blue triangular partitions captures how tokens \textit{within the same segments} attend to each other.}
