\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we introduce PANDAS, a hybrid method for improving jailbreaking effectiveness in the long-context setting. PANDAS modifies malicious demonstrations using positive affirmation phrases, negative demonstrations, and adaptive sampling based on the topic of the target prompt. We demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on the latest open-source LLMs and conduct an attention analysis to better understand the mechanisms behind its improvement.

\textbf{Limitations and future directions:} PANDAS relies on a dataset of malicious demonstrations, which can be challenging to generate without access to uncensored, helpful-only models. A promising future direction is to improve jailbreak effectiveness with a limited number of demonstrations. Additionally, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:attn_analysis}, a noticeable decline in attention scores occurs around the 27th demonstration. Investigating whether this drop negatively impacts jailbreak success and developing a demonstration selection strategy to mitigate such effects could further improve performance.
