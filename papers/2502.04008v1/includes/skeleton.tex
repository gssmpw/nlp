\section{Current obstacles in automating in-vehicle API server testing}

Will contain a description of the testing team's current process, where (and why) they take manual steps. My team is working together with the API server testing team, so we can sketch this process together.

\section{Inducting LLMs to completely automate in-vehicle API server testing}

Previous section would have identified manual steps, so we will show here how LLMs automate those steps. We will also write about how we evaluate LLM interventions, which will be our deliberate fuzzing of the information context (Ziwei's experiments), equivalence between human written and LLM written test cases (Arjun's experiments), and one more experiment on verifying the test case quality.
