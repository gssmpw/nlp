\section{Conclusion}
Automated API testing is a critical process in software engineering, essential for ensuring the reliability and functionality of software systems. Despite its importance, API testing is often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. In practical applications, API testing involves retrieving and organizing relevant documents, and writing test cases based on the organized information. Due to the fuzzy matching of information across documents, manual intervention is required, hindering the automation of the entire testing process.

In this paper, we introduced SPAPI-Tester, the first system designed for the automated testing of automotive APIs. We decomposed the API testing process into a series of steps, identifying the obstacles to automation at each stage. By leveraging LLMs, we addressed these challenges, enabling full automation of the testing workflow. The results from real-world industrial API testing demonstrate that SPAPI-Tester achieves high detection accuracy. Our comprehensive experiments show that our system is highly robust and effective.

Our system offers valuable insights for other automated API testing tasks and can be extended to web server API testing. The findings underscore the potential of LLMs to transform API testing by reducing manual effort and improving efficiency, paving the way for broader adoption and implementation in various testing environments.
