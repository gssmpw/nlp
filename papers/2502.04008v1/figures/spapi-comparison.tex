    \caption{A comparative illustration of the SPAPI architecture -- (1) a web server in the classic three-tier architecture, (2) SPAPI in a real in-vehicle embedded system, and (3) SPAPI in a test rig with vehicle state mocked by a Virtual Vehicle (VV) system. Compared to traditional API testing, vehicle API testing requires not only verifying the API's responses but also checking the vehicle's status.}
