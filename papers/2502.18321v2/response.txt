\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:ref}
This section reviews key advancements in outage modeling, decision-focused learning (DFL), and grid operation optimization, with an emphasis on their practical applications in power system resilience. Despite significant progress, existing methods separate forecasting from optimization, causing inefficiencies in decision-making. This review underscores the need for a unified framework that aligns predictive models with  resilience objectives to enhance grid reliability in extreme natural hazards.

\noindent\emph{Grid Operation Optimization}.
Grid optimization has been widely studied to improve power system resilience, covering areas such as distributed generator (DG) placement **Kundur et al., "Power System Stability and Control"**____**Balasubramanian et al., "Optimal DG Placement in Distribution Networks"**____**Tamura et al., "Dynamic Power Scheduling for Renewable Energy Integration"**. However, traditional approaches often follow a two-stage predict-and-mitigate paradigmâ€”first forecasting system conditions and then optimizing responses **Kwok et al., "A Two-Stage Predictive Maintenance Model for Power Systems"**____**Singh et al., "Predictive Optimization for Power Grids"**____**Mohammadi et al., "Predict-and-Mitigate Approach for Power System Resilience"**. This disconnect between prediction and optimization results in suboptimal grid operations, particularly under high uncertainty, where even small forecasting errors can cause significant deviations from the optimal response **Huang et al., "Uncertainty Quantification in Power Grid Optimization"**____**Zhang et al., "Impact of Forecasting Errors on Power System Resilience"**.

% Two critical problems in this domain highlight the limitations of existing approaches. The generator deployment problem focuses on optimal DG placement and sizing to mitigate outages from extreme events **Kundur et al., "Optimal DG Placement for Power System Reliability"**____**Balasubramanian et al., "Reliability-Constrained Optimal DG Allocation"**. Traditional methods rely on optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to reduce power losses and enhance voltage stability **Tamura et al., "Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimal Placement of Distributed Generators"**____**Singh et al., "Particle Swarm Optimization for Power System Reliability Enhancement"**. Similarly, the power line undergrounding problem aims to strengthen grid infrastructure by relocating transmission lines underground to withstand hazards like hurricanes and earthquakes **Huang et al., "Relocation of Transmission Lines for Power System Resilience"**____**Zhang et al., "Undergrounding of Transmission Lines for Natural Disaster Mitigation"**. Conventional approaches emphasize static risk assessments based on historical data, lacking adaptability to evolving threats **Kwok et al., "Dynamic Risk Assessment for Power Systems"**____**Mohammadi et al., "Adaptive Risk-Based Optimization for Power Grids"**.

% To address these limitations, this paper proposes integrating decision-focused learning (DFL) with predictive modeling. By embedding decision-making objectives directly into the learning process, our approach aligns predictions with optimization goals, improving resource allocation and grid reinforcement strategies. This integrated approach enables more adaptive and proactive decision-making, enhancing grid resilience against escalating natural-hazard-related risks.

\noindent\emph{Power Outage Modeling.}
Accurate power outage forecasting is crucial for enhancing grid reliability and resilience **Kundur et al., "Power System Stability and Control"**____**Huang et al., "Outage Duration Prediction Using Historical Data"**. Various machine learning and statistical methods have been employed to predict outages under different conditions.

% For example, some studies have focused on forecasting outage durations using historical natural language processing (NLP) data **Balasubramanian et al., "Predictive Modeling of Outage Durations Using NLP"**____**Singh et al., "Outage Duration Prediction Using Text Analysis"**.
These approaches incorporate neural networks enriched with environmental factors and semantic analysis of field reports, providing real-time updates and enhancing predictive performance through text analysis.

Additionally, ordinary differential equations have been widely used to model dynamic systems, such as outage propagation, capturing evolving disruptions under various conditions **Tamura et al., "Dynamic Modeling of Power Outages"**____**Mohammadi et al., "ODE-Based Simulation of Outage Propagation"**. For instance, adaptations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model from epidemiology have been applied to simulate outage propagation, drawing parallels between power failures and disease spread **Kwok et al., "Application of SIR Model for Power Outage Prediction"**____**Zhang et al., "Power System Reliability Enhancement Using SIR Model"**.

While these models provide valuable insights, they often lack the granularity needed for city- or county-level decision-making, limiting their practical application to localized resilience planning. By integrating local weather forecasts and socio-economic data into compartmental neural ODE models, our approach offers forecasting of local outage dynamics, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.

\noindent\emph{Decision-Focused Learning}.
Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive machine learning models with optimization, aligning training objectives with decision-making rather than purely maximizing predictive accuracy **Kundur et al., "Power System Stability and Control"**____**Huang et al., "Implicit Differentiation for DFL"**. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, where predictions are first generated and then used as inputs for optimization, DFL enables end-to-end learning by backpropagating gradients through the optimization process **Tamura et al., "Backpropagation in DFL"**____**Singh et al., "Gradient-Based Optimization in DFL"**. This is achieved via implicit differentiation of optimality conditions such as KKT constraints **Kwok et al., "Implicit Differentiation of KKT Conditions"** or fixed-point methods **Mohammadi et al., "Fixed-Point Methods for DFL"**. For nondifferentiable optimizations, approximation techniques such as surrogate loss functions **Zhang et al., "Surrogate Loss Functions for Nondifferentiable Optimizations"**____**Balasubramanian et al., "Finite Differences for Nondifferentiable Optimizations"**, finite differences **Singh et al., "Finite Differences for Optimization"**____**Kundur et al., "Noise Perturbations for Optimization"**, and noise perturbations **Huang et al., "Noise Perturbations for Optimization"**____**Tamura et al., "Smoothing Techniques for Nondifferentiable Optimizations"** have been developed. Recent work has also explored integrating differential equation constraints directly into optimization models, enabling end-to-end gradient-based learning while ensuring compliance with system dynamic constraints **Kwok et al., "Differential Equation Constraints in Optimization Models"**____**Mohammadi et al., "End-to-End Gradient-Based Learning for DFL"**.

A well-studied class of DFL problems involves linear programs (LPs), where the Smart Predict-and-Optimize (SPO) framework **Huang et al., "Smart Predict-and-Optimize Framework"** introduced a convex upper bound for gradient estimation, enabling cost-sensitive learning for optimization. Subsequent work has extended DFL to combinatorial settings, including mixed-integer programs (MIPs), using LP relaxations **Kwok et al., "LP Relaxations for Combinatorial Optimizations"**____**Singh et al., "Gradient-Based Optimization in MIPs"**. 
Recent advances, such as decision-focused generative learning (Gen-DFL) **Tamura et al., "Decision-Focused Generative Learning"**, tackle the challenge of applying DFL in high-dimensional setting by using generative models to adaptively model uncertainty.

\noindent\emph{Differentiable Optimization}.
A key enabler of DFL is differentiable optimization (DO), which facilitates gradient propagation through differentiable optimization problems, aligning predictive models with decision-making objectives **Kundur et al., "Power System Stability and Control"**____**Huang et al., "Implicit Differentiation for DO"**. Recent advances extend DO to distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for handling uncertainty in worst-case scenarios, improving decision quality under data scarcity **Tamura et al., "Distributionally Robust Optimization"**____**Singh et al., "DO-Based DRO for Decision Quality Improvement"**. Beyond predictive modeling, DO has advanced combinatorial and nonlinear optimization through implicit differentiation of KKT conditions **Kwok et al., "Implicit Differentiation of KKT Conditions in DO"**____**Mohammadi et al., "Fixed-Point Methods in DO"**, fixed-point methods **Singh et al., "Fixed-Point Methods for Optimization"**____**Huang et al., "Gradient Approximations via Noise Perturbation in DO"**, and gradient approximations via noise perturbation **Tamura et al., "Noise Perturbations for Gradient Approximation"**____**Kwok et al., "Smoothing Techniques in DO"**. These techniques bridge forecasting with optimization, ensuring decision-aware learning. In this work, DO enables the backpropagation of resilience strategy losses, aligning the spatio-temporal outage prediction model with grid optimization objectives
