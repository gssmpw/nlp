abstract = {Motivated by the need for uninterrupted service provision in the telecommunications industry, this paper presents a novel problem concerning the transportation of diesel generators during an unplanned power outage. Given a set of base stations, each equipped with a capacitated back-up battery pack, the problem consists in finding an optimal delivery and pick-up schedule that minimises corresponding costs. The problem is significantly complicated by the fact that the delivery quantity is a decision variable, and the pick-up times depend on the delivery time, delivery quantity and constraints related to battery-charging requirements. To address the issue, we develop problem-specific pick-up time functions that can be effectively incorporated into the proposed algorithm. The problem is formulated as an arc-based model and a set-packing model. To solve it to optimality, we design a tailored branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, including novel customised dominance criteria in the labelling algorithm and adopting heuristics that exploit the problem features and effectively improve the algorithmic performance. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated based on the extensive computational study and compared with a commercial solver. The proposed acceleration techniques are found to be potent with regard to computational times, and useful managerial insights are provided as part of sensitivity analyses.}

abstract = {We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

	abstract = {Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart “Predict, then Optimize” (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure—that is, its objective and constraints—for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.

ABSTRACT = {A growing number of electricity utilities use machine learning-based outage prediction models (OPMs) to predict the impact of storms on their networks for sustainable management. The accuracy of OPM predictions is sensitive to sample size and event severity representativeness in the training dataset, the extent of which has not yet been quantified. This study devised a randomized and out-of-sample validation experiment to quantify an OPM’s prediction uncertainty to different training sample sizes and event severity representativeness. The study showed random error decreasing by more than 100% for sample sizes ranging from 10 to 80 extratropical events, and by 32% for sample sizes from 10 to 40 thunderstorms. This study quantified the minimum number of sample size for the OPM attaining an acceptable prediction performance. The results demonstrated that conditioning the training of the OPM to a subset of events representative of the predicted event’s severity reduced the underestimation bias exhibited in high-impact events and the overestimation bias in low-impact ones. We used cross entropy (CE) to quantify the relatedness of weather variable distribution between the training dataset and the forecasted event.},
