abstract={Severe weather power outages cause devastating damages affecting tens of millions of people and costing tens of billions of dollars of economic loss annually. It is estimated that these outages have cost the U.S. economy an inflation-adjusted annual average of 20 billion USD to 55 billion USD during the period of 2003–2012. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) have recently highlighted the importance of resilience building in the electricity vis-a-vis minimizing the risk of extreme events on the electricity sector, and thereby enhancing electricity service security and long term economic benefits. However, the federal and state-level risk and reliability metrics and standards for both electricity transmission and distribution networks do not include the impact of extreme events on electric power service, and have no effective mechanisms for assessing and regulating the levels of preparedness and response of the utilities impacted by extreme events. In other words, the existing framework to assess the benefits and costs of the investments in the electricity sector grossly undervalues the economic and societal costs associated with severe weather power outages. To address this gap, this research developed a risk-based decision support framework to assist regional and local planners and reliability and regulatory bodies to foster utility capital investments that minimize severe weather risks on electricity sector. The major objectives of this research are: (1) identify risk factors to severe weather-induced power outages affecting end-use consumers; (2) probabilistic estimation of economic loss due to a 100-year major power outage event leveraging the value of load loss concept; and (3) a framework for investment strategy selection based on reduced economic loss in the post-strategy implementation scenario compared to the traditional practice. First, the study conducted an exploratory analysis of the nationwide major power outage data during 2000–2015 to understand the patterns of the major power outages that occurred in the past. The results obtained from this analysis concluded that the U.S. electricity sector is vulnerable to failure in face of severe weather events with 52.9 percent of the major power outages caused owing to the severe weather and climate events. The exploratory analysis was followed by investigating the key predictors that increases the risks of severe weather-induced sustained major power outages using a multi-hazard approach. A two-stage hybrid risk estimation model was developed leveraging algorithm-based advanced data-mining techniques. Publicly available historical data on major power outages, socio-economic data, state-level climatological information, electricity consumption patterns and land-use data was used to train the models. The model analyzed state-level power outage data and considered all the states in the continental U.S. for identifying the major risk factors. Finally, the risk-based decision support system (RDSS) for strategy selection at the state-level was developed using the state of Texas (TX) as a case study. The different steps involved include: (i) identify the key risk predictors and their influence on the state electricity sector using the two-stage hybrid risk estimation model; (ii) identify strategies that will reduce the risks of the severe weather power outages; (iii) probabilistically estimate the risk of a major power outage that has a 1.0 percent chance to occur in the next year, i.e., in other words, estimate the size of a 100-year major power outage event under all the pre- and post- strategy implementation scenarios; (iv) assess the economic loss considering the value of load loss in face of the 100-year event and calculate the reduced loss due to implementation of the strategies. Thus, the RDSS will provide a platform to the state regulators to select strategies that would minimize the major power outage risk and reduce the economic loss in face of a major power outage event. This novel approach of considering the risks of severe weather induced power outages and proposing a method to include the economic costs of such outages in the regulatory decision-making process will help in the resilience enhancement of the grid.},

abstract = {The power system worldwide is facing challenges from a changing climate. Decision-makers are tasked with increasing the smartness and resilience of the energy infrastructure to reduce the negative impacts to customers, with the help of new technologies such as household renewable energy generators and electric vehicles. However, a largely overlooked topic is equity, and how the burdens and benefits of the power system are distributed to different communities. To fill this gap, this paper provides a thorough review of the implication of equity in the power system, the significance of guaranteeing energy equity both in everyday operation and disaster management, and the ongoing efforts to plan for equable resilience in various fields. Finally, a holistic power grid resilience enhancement framework is proposed that covers different stages of disaster management and different dimensions of energy equity.}

abstract={Severe weather power outages cause devastating damages affecting tens of millions of people and costing tens of billions of dollars of economic loss annually. It is estimated that these outages have cost the U.S. economy an inflation-adjusted annual average of 20 billion USD to 55 billion USD during the period of 2003–2012. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) have recently highlighted the importance of resilience building in the electricity vis-a-vis minimizing the risk of extreme events on the electricity sector, and thereby enhancing electricity service security and long term economic benefits. However, the federal and state-level risk and reliability metrics and standards for both electricity transmission and distribution networks do not include the impact of extreme events on electric power service, and have no effective mechanisms for assessing and regulating the levels of preparedness and response of the utilities impacted by extreme events. In other words, the existing framework to assess the benefits and costs of the investments in the electricity sector grossly undervalues the economic and societal costs associated with severe weather power outages. To address this gap, this research developed a risk-based decision support framework to assist regional and local planners and reliability and regulatory bodies to foster utility capital investments that minimize severe weather risks on electricity sector. The major objectives of this research are: (1) identify risk factors to severe weather-induced power outages affecting end-use consumers; (2) probabilistic estimation of economic loss due to a 100-year major power outage event leveraging the value of load loss concept; and (3) a framework for investment strategy selection based on reduced economic loss in the post-strategy implementation scenario compared to the traditional practice. First, the study conducted an exploratory analysis of the nationwide major power outage data during 2000–2015 to understand the patterns of the major power outages that occurred in the past. The results obtained from this analysis concluded that the U.S. electricity sector is vulnerable to failure in face of severe weather events with 52.9 percent of the major power outages caused owing to the severe weather and climate events. The exploratory analysis was followed by investigating the key predictors that increases the risks of severe weather-induced sustained major power outages using a multi-hazard approach. A two-stage hybrid risk estimation model was developed leveraging algorithm-based advanced data-mining techniques. Publicly available historical data on major power outages, socio-economic data, state-level climatological information, electricity consumption patterns and land-use data was used to train the models. The model analyzed state-level power outage data and considered all the states in the continental U.S. for identifying the major risk factors. Finally, the risk-based decision support system (RDSS) for strategy selection at the state-level was developed using the state of Texas (TX) as a case study. The different steps involved include: (i) identify the key risk predictors and their influence on the state electricity sector using the two-stage hybrid risk estimation model; (ii) identify strategies that will reduce the risks of the severe weather power outages; (iii) probabilistically estimate the risk of a major power outage that has a 1.0 percent chance to occur in the next year, i.e., in other words, estimate the size of a 100-year major power outage event under all the pre- and post- strategy implementation scenarios; (iv) assess the economic loss considering the value of load loss in face of the 100-year event and calculate the reduced loss due to implementation of the strategies. Thus, the RDSS will provide a platform to the state regulators to select strategies that would minimize the major power outage risk and reduce the economic loss in face of a major power outage event. This novel approach of considering the risks of severe weather induced power outages and proposing a method to include the economic costs of such outages in the regulatory decision-making process will help in the resilience enhancement of the grid.},

abstract = {The power system worldwide is facing challenges from a changing climate. Decision-makers are tasked with increasing the smartness and resilience of the energy infrastructure to reduce the negative impacts to customers, with the help of new technologies such as household renewable energy generators and electric vehicles. However, a largely overlooked topic is equity, and how the burdens and benefits of the power system are distributed to different communities. To fill this gap, this paper provides a thorough review of the implication of equity in the power system, the significance of guaranteeing energy equity both in everyday operation and disaster management, and the ongoing efforts to plan for equable resilience in various fields. Finally, a holistic power grid resilience enhancement framework is proposed that covers different stages of disaster management and different dimensions of energy equity.}

ABSTRACT = {A growing number of electricity utilities use machine learning-based outage prediction models (OPMs) to predict the impact of storms on their networks for sustainable management. The accuracy of OPM predictions is sensitive to sample size and event severity representativeness in the training dataset, the extent of which has not yet been quantified. This study devised a randomized and out-of-sample validation experiment to quantify an OPM’s prediction uncertainty to different training sample sizes and event severity representativeness. The study showed random error decreasing by more than 100% for sample sizes ranging from 10 to 80 extratropical events, and by 32% for sample sizes from 10 to 40 thunderstorms. This study quantified the minimum number of sample size for the OPM attaining an acceptable prediction performance. The results demonstrated that conditioning the training of the OPM to a subset of events representative of the predicted event’s severity reduced the underestimation bias exhibited in high-impact events and the overestimation bias in low-impact ones. We used cross entropy (CE) to quantify the relatedness of weather variable distribution between the training dataset and the forecasted event.},

This approach shows significant potential to revolutionize combinatorial decision-making in real-world applications that operate under uncertainty, where estimating unknown parameters within decision models is a major challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive review of DFL, providing an in-depth analysis of both gradient-based and gradient-free techniques used to combine ML and constrained optimization. It evaluates the strengths and limitations of these techniques and includes an extensive empirical evaluation of eleven methods across seven problems. The survey also offers insights into recent advancements and future research directions in DFL.},

    abstract = { Customers' perceptions of reliability may not always reflect the level of reliability purported by traditional reliability indices. This has been recognised and efforts have been made by the electricity supply industry (ESI) in the United Kingdom to relate ‘reliability investment’ with customers' marginal benefits obtained from such investment. A difficulty encountered during such earlier and recent efforts has been the lack of appropriate valuation of these benefits. With a view to correcting this paucity, the authors have conducted studies, based on customer surveys, aimed at assessing the customer outage costs (COC) due to electric service interruptions. The incremental values of these costs, ΔCOC, following reliability investment are considered proxies of reliability worth and customers' marginal benefits. The results of these studies have provided a very good insight into customers' concerns regarding supply interruptions, but most importantly a coherent method for evaluating the customer benefits (ΔCOC) has been developed and the required generic data for such evaluation generated. Using these data, a consistent method for calculating the value of lost load (VOLL) is also developed. }

	abstract = {Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart “Predict, then Optimize” (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure—that is, its objective and constraints—for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear. This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization.

abstract = {Motivated by the need for uninterrupted service provision in the telecommunications industry, this paper presents a novel problem concerning the transportation of diesel generators during an unplanned power outage. Given a set of base stations, each equipped with a capacitated back-up battery pack, the problem consists in finding an optimal delivery and pick-up schedule that minimises corresponding costs. The problem is significantly complicated by the fact that the delivery quantity is a decision variable, and the pick-up times depend on the delivery time, delivery quantity and constraints related to battery-charging requirements. To address the issue, we develop problem-specific pick-up time functions that can be effectively incorporated into the proposed algorithm. The problem is formulated as an arc-based model and a set-packing model. To solve it to optimality, we design a tailored branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, including novel customised dominance criteria in the labelling algorithm and adopting heuristics that exploit the problem features and effectively improve the algorithmic performance. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated based on the extensive computational study and compared with a commercial solver. The proposed acceleration techniques are found to be potent with regard to computational times, and useful managerial insights are provided as part of sensitivity analyses.}

abstract = {We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},
