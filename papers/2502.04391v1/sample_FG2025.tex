\section*{ETHICAL IMPACT STATEMENT}
Our research focuses on fairness-aware and robust face parsing for generative AI, addressing biases in segmentation models and their downstream impact on generative synthesis. While our work aims to mitigate demographic disparities and improve model resilience, we acknowledge potential ethical concerns related to dataset biases, misuse, and unintended societal impact.

\textbf{Potential Risks and Negative Impacts:}
Face parsing and generative models can be misused for unethical applications, such as surveillance, deepfake generation, or reinforcing demographic stereotypes. Despite our efforts to improve fairness, residual biases in datasets (e.g., CelebAMask-HQ) may persist, potentially leading to unequal model performance across demographic groups. Additionally, robustness improvements could inadvertently be leveraged to enhance adversarial facial synthesis, raising concerns about identity fraud.

\textbf{Risk-Mitigation Strategies:}
To mitigate these risks, we employ fairness-aware multi-objective training to reduce demographic disparities and systematically evaluate robustness against real-world perturbations. Our methodology prioritizes transparency and reproducibilityâ€”our dataset choices, fairness metrics, and evaluation protocols will be made publicly available to facilitate scrutiny and improvement. Furthermore, we emphasize ethical use cases, discouraging applications in deceptive or harmful generative AI practices.

\textbf{Human Subject and Data Ethics:}
Our study does not involve human subjects or personally identifiable information (PII). The datasets used (CelebAMask-HQ) are publicly available, and we adhere to all ethical guidelines concerning their use. While we acknowledge that publicly available datasets can contain biases, our methodology explicitly addresses this issue through fairness-aware training and demographic evaluation.

\textbf{Future Ethical Considerations:}
Future research should extend fairness-aware segmentation to more diverse and representative datasets, ensuring broader applicability and minimizing demographic bias. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaborations with ethicists, policymakers, and domain experts will be crucial to guiding responsible deployment and regulation of AI-generated content.

By integrating fairness and robustness into face parsing, we aim to contribute to the development of ethical, bias-aware AI models that enhance inclusivity and reliability in computer vision applications.
