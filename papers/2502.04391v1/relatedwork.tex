% 1. Face Parsing and Synthesis: Overview of traditional or recent SOTA methods (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SPADE, etc.).
% 2. Fairness in Vision Systems: Summarize attempts to mitigate bias or ensure fairness, especially in face tasks.
% 3. Robustness in Face/Gesture Recognition: Past methods for handling occlusions, noise, domain shifts.
% 4. Multi-Objective Optimization: Dynamic weighting or homotopy-based approaches in the literature.

%%% PROPOSED METHOD
\input{sections/03_methods}
% Formally define the tasks of face parsing, generation, or both. 
% Introduce notations (X for images, Y for segmentation masks, etc.).

\addtolength{\textheight}{-3cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
