\section{Related Work}
In this section, we focus on machine learning-based interatomic potentials and provide related works in conventional computation methods in Appendix~\ref{app:related_traditional}.


Recent advances in materials property prediction models**Zopf, "Predicting Materials Properties with Machine Learning"** and the availability of high-quality materials dynamics datasets**Himanen et al., "High-Quality Materials Dynamics Datasets for Machine Learning"** generated using DFT-based algorithms have facilitated the development of materials foundation models capable of predicting energy, force, and stress. Among these models, purely invariant designs, such as M3GNet**Zuo et al., "M3GNet: A Purely Invariant Design for Materials Property Prediction"**, CHGNet**Li et al., "CHGNet: A Novel Approach to Materials Property Prediction with Conformal Groups"**, Orb**Ran et al., "Orb: An Efficient and Scalable Method for Materials Property Prediction"**, and EScAIP**Kapoor et al., "EScAIP: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Energy and Force Prediction"**, are computationally efficient, but typically do not perform as well, particularly for predicting higher order tensors such as force and stress. While some invariant models such as Orb**Ran et al., "Orb: An Efficient and Scalable Method for Materials Property Prediction"**, and EScAIP**Kapoor et al., "EScAIP: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Energy and Force Prediction"** are able to achieve competitive performance on benchmarks, this does not necessarily translate to downstream tasks, as shown in Sec. \ref{sec:HEA}. In contrast, equivariant designs, including MACE**Xu et al., "MACE: A Novel Equivariant Design for Materials Property Prediction with Symmetry"**, SevenNet**Hirakawa et al., "SevenNet: A Scalable and Efficient Method for Materials Property Prediction with Seven-Point Groups"**, and EquiformerV2**Sharma et al., "EquiformerV2: An Efficient and Robust Method for Materials Property Prediction with Equivariance"**, respect physical constraints like equivariance. However, they are computationally expensive due to the extensive use of tensor product operations, which limits their scalability. Additionally, some equivariant models still do not obey other important physical laws, undermining their performance on realistic material system simulations as seen in Sec. \ref{section:experiments}.

Different from these prior foundation models, our proposed HIENet detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:HIENet} satisfies all key physical constraints while combining the scalability and efficiency of invariant designs with the robustness and symmetry-capturing capabilities of equivariant designs. This novel integration offers a promising direction for the next generation of materials foundation model design.
