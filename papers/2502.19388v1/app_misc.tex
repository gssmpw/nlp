\subsection{On Redundancies in the Program Syntax}
\label{app:redudanciesSyntax}

Some of the programming constructs from \Cref{def:pwhile} could be regarded syntactic sugar.
However, this would have some unsatisfactory effects.
For example, $\PCHOICE{\prog_1}{\prob}{\prog_2}$ is equivalent to $\SEQ{\UNIFASSIGN{\pVarTmp}}{\ITE{\pVarTmp < \prob}{\prog_1}{\prog_2}}$, but this has the disadvantages that (i) it requires an additional program variable, (ii) it assumes that $(\pVarTmp < \prob) \in \guards$, and (iii) it replaces a simple convex combination by a way more difficult integration operation, which is a major drawback in practice.
%
Further, one could define $\DIVERGE$ as syntactic sugar for $\WHILE{true}{\SKIP}$.
However, in the context of this paper, it is more convenient to distinguish between loopy programs and loop-free programs possibly containing $\DIVERGE$.


\subsection{Formal Definition of Loop Unrolling}
\label{app:unrolling}

The following definition appears in \Cref{sec:approxwp:convloops}.
Let $\depth \in \nats$.
We define the \emph{$\depth$-fold unrolling} $\unfold{\prog}{\depth}$ of program $\prog$ inductively as follows:
For all atomic programs $\prog$, we let $\unfold{\prog}{\depth} = \prog$.
Further, we set (using some parentheses -- which are of course not part of the program syntax -- for clarity)
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\unfold{(\SEQ{\prog_1}{\prog_2})}{\depth} = \SEQ{\unfold{\prog_1}{\depth}}{\unfold{\prog_2}{\depth}}$,
    \item $\unfold{(\ITE{\guard}{\prog_1}{\prog_2})}{\depth} = \ITE{\guard}{\unfold{\prog_1}{\depth}}{\unfold{\prog_2}{\depth}}$, and
    \item $\unfold{(\PCHOICE{\prog_1}{\prob}{\prog_2})}{\depth} = \PCHOICE{\unfold{\prog_1}{\depth}}{\prob}{\unfold{\prog_2}{\depth}}$.
\end{itemize}
For loops, we let
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\unfold{(\WHILE{\guard}{\progBody})}{0} = \DIVERGE$, and for $\depth \geq 0$,
    \item $\unfold{(\WHILE{\guard}{\progBody})}{\depth+1} = \ITE{\guard}{\SEQ{\unfold{\progBody}{\depth}}{\unfold{(\WHILE{\guard}{\progBody})}}{\depth}}{\SKIP}$.
\end{itemize}
