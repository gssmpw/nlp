We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general \emph{loops}, (ii) \emph{continuous} distributions, and (iii) \emph{conditioning}.
To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative \emph{invariants}, as is well established.
However, in the realm of continuous distributions, \emph{invariant verification} becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of \emph{integrals} in expectation-based program semantics.
Our key idea is to soundly \emph{under-} or \emph{over-approximate} these integrals via \emph{Riemann sums}.
We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure.
On the theoretical side, we prove \emph{convergence} of our Riemann approximations, and establish $\coRE$-completeness of the central verification problems.
On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting \emph{discrete} probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving \emph{continuous sampling}. Towards this end,
we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure \toolcaesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language.
We present several promising case studies.
