\subsection{Code LLMs} 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly developed and are significantly impacting automated software development. These foundational models can produce fluent human language and understand semantics to perform complex tasks, bringing new possibilities to automated code generation, including Santacoder____, CodeGPT____, etc. More and more open-source and proprietary Code LLMs have emerged and demonstrated competitive performance, including Starcoder____, CodeLlama____, Wizardcoder____, DeepSeek-Coder____, Qwen-Coder____, Claude-3.5-Sonnet____ and GPT-4o____ etc. 

\subsection{Critic Models for LLMs}

Reinforcement learning from human feedback has proven effective____, though it can be very labor-intensive. A promising approach involves using LLMs to themselves to assist in the evaluation, which can further improve model outputs____. Accurate and informative critique feedback allows LLMs to refine outputs, moving towards more advanced intelligence. However, despite their problem-solving strengths, LLMs currently demonstrate weak performance in critique tasks____. Improving LLM critique abilities relies on supervision from human annotations____ and stronger LLMs acting as human proxies____.
Recently, some critic benchmarks____ have also been proposed.
