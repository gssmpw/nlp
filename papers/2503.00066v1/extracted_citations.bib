	abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems which utilize the human intelligence to solve complex tasks have gained considerable interest and adoption in recent years. However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users' privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention due to the boom of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Among them, the emerging blockchain-based crowdsourcing is a typical paradigm, which gets rid of centralized cloud-servers and leverages smart contracts to realize task recommendation and reward distribution. However, there are still two critical issues yet to be solved urgently. First, malicious evaluation from crowdsourcing requesters will result in honest workers not getting the rewards they deserve even if they have provided valuable solutions. Second, unfair evaluation and reward distribution can lead to low enthusiasm for work. Therefore, the above problems will seriously hinder the development of blockchain-based crowdsourcing platforms. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework with enhanced trustworthiness and fairness, named TFCrowd. The core idea of TFCrowd is utilizing a smart contract of blockchain as a trusted authority to fairly evaluate contributions and allocate rewards. To this end, we devise a reputation-based evaluation mechanism to punish the requester who behaves as “false-reporting” and a Shapley value-based method to distribute rewards fairly. By using our proposed schemes, TFCrowd can prevent malicious requesters from making unfair comments and reward honest workers according to their contributions. Extensive simulations and the experiment results demonstrate that TFCrowd can protect the interests of workers and distribute rewards fairly.},

	abstract = {We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e. data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between blockchain transparency and data confidentiality, which is critical in crowdsourcing use-case. ZebraLancer ensures: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. On the other hand, allowing anonymity will enable a malicious worker to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing the accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e. the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol with the existing real-world blockchain.},

	abstract = {The crowdsourcing schemes which utilize the social network to solve complex tasks are an important part of open cooperation over the Internet. Although blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes have considerable advantages in decentralization and data sharing, there is still a challenge to gurantee the security of crowdsourced-sensitive information and the fairness of crowdsourcing on the blockchain. To this end, this article investigates a crowdsourcing scheme based on blockchain. First, we define the basic requirements of blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes including fairness, confidentiality, and integrity. And then, using secure hash, commitment, and homomorphic encryption, we propose a blockchain-based secure and fair crowdsourcing scheme, that is, BFC. The analysis results show that our scheme can satisfy the above requirements. Finally, the experimental results show that the computational overhead of the BFC scheme is acceptable to both the requester and the workers. In a word, our proposed crowdsourcing scheme has good expansibility in reality.},
