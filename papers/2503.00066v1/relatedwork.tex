\section{Related Work}
While current research has explored using blockchain to enhance trust and transparency in crowdsourcing-based label aggregation and reward distribution, it still needs to address the integration with active learning processes fully. We also notice a gap in balancing privacy and publicity. A comparison of current research integrating crowdsource labeling and blockchain is shown in Table \ref{table:related_work_comparison}. This comparison evaluates whether the proposed systems support active learning, can be deployed on a public blockchain allowing public participation, and include a fair and transparent incentivization mechanism.
