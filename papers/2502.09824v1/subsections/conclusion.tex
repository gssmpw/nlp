We present PUGS, an occupancy uncertainty estimation framework used for improving the robustness of grasp selection to measurement and pose uncertainty, which is common in underwater environments.
We perform experiments in simulation environments to quantify the quality of the proposed grasps from PUGS and showcase their improvement over baseline methods in challenging scenarios, such as noisy measurements or uninformative partial views. 
Real-world experiments are conducted in an underwater test tank to qualitatively evaluate the performance of the output of PUGS compared to baseline methods. Our results show that PUGS successfully leads the grasp location to ignore faulty and noisy measurements, with no hand-tuning required.

Future work will focus on modeling additional sources of uncertainty, such as measurement noise introduced from unfavorable visibility in underwater environments. 
Due to our formulation, additional uncertainties can be easily incorporated into PUGS. 
Currently, estimating the predictive uncertainty and sampling the occupancy field take on the order of minutes for the real world experiments. Optimization of similar methods has been performed for real-time probabilistic robotic perception~\cite{10093134}. This will be another direction for future research to enable the practical deployment of PUGS in the field.
