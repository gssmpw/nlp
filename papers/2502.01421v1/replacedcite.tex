Because of foundational importance and practical relevance of spectral-based sparsification on graphs, various variants of such sparsifiers have been studied across different computational models. Some examples include, dynamic sparsifiers____, streaming sparsifiers____, distributed and parallel sparsifiers,____, dynamic vertex sparsifiers____ and distributed vertex sparsifiers____.
