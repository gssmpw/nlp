@article{Chernoff:1952aa,
	abstract = {In many cases an optimum or computationally convenient test of a simple hypothesis H0 against a simple alternative H1 may be given in the following form. Reject H0 if Sn = ∑n j=1 Xj ≤ k, where X1, X2, ⋯, Xn are n independent observations of a chance variable X whose distribution depends on the true hypothesis and where k is some appropriate number. In particular the likelihood ratio test for fixed sample size can be reduced to this form. It is shown that with each test of the above form there is associated an index ρ. If ρ1 and ρ2 are the indices corresponding to two alternative tests e = log ρ1/log ρ2 measures the relative efficiency of these tests in the following sense. For large samples, a sample of size n with the first test will give about the same probabilities of error as a sample of size en with the second test. To obtain the above result, use is made of the fact that P(Sn ≤ na) behaves roughly like mn where m is the minimum value assumed by the moment generating function of X - a. It is shown that if H0 and H1 specify probability distributions of X which are very close to each other, one may approximate ρ by assuming that X is normally distributed.},

	abstract = {Neural network pruning has gained significant attention for its potential to reduce computational resources required for training and inference. A large body of research has shown that networks can be pruned both after training and at initialisation, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to dense networks. However, current methods rely on iteratively pruning or repairing the network to avoid over-pruning and layer collapse. Recent work has found that by treating neural networks as a sequence of bipartite graphs, pruning can be studied through the lens of spectral graph theory. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel pruning approach using spectral sparsification, which aims to preserve meaningful properties of a dense graph with a sparse subgraph, by preserving the spectrum of the dense graph's adjacency matrix. We empirically validate and investigate our method, and show that one-shot pruning using spectral sparsification preserves performance at higher levels of sparsity compared to its one-shot counterparts. Additionally, we theoretically analyse our method with respect to local and global connectivity.},

	abstract = {The representation and learning benefits of methods based on graph Laplacians, such as Laplacian smoothing or harmonic function solution for semi-supervised learning (SSL), are empirically and theoretically well supported. Nonetheless, the exact versions of these methods scale poorly with the number of nodes $n$ of the graph. In this paper, we combine a spectral sparsification routine with Laplacian learning. Given a graph $G$ as input, our algorithm computes a sparsifier in a distributed way in $O(n\log^3(n))$ time, $O(m\log^3(n))$ work and $O(n\log(n))$ memory, using only $\log(n)$ rounds of communication. Furthermore, motivated by the regularization often employed in learning algorithms, we show that constructing sparsifiers that preserve the spectrum of the Laplacian only up to the regularization level may drastically reduce the size of the final graph. By constructing a spectrally-similar graph, we are able to bound the error induced by the sparsification for a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., SSL). We empirically validate the theoretical guarantees on Amazon co-purchase graph and compare to the state-of-the-art heuristics.},

	abstract = {Graph sparsification is a powerful tool to approximate an arbitrary graph and has been used in machine learning over graphs. As real-world networks are becoming very large and naturally distributed, distributed graph sparsification has drawn considerable attention. In this work, we design communication-efficient distributed algorithms for constructing spectral vertex sparsifiers, which closely preserve effective resistance distances on a subset of vertices of interest in the original graphs, under the well-established message passing communication model. We prove that the communication cost approximates the lower bound with only a small gap. We further provide algorithms for constructing pair-wise spanners which approximate the shortest distances between each pair of vertices in a target set, instead of all pairs, and incur communication costs that are much smaller than those of existing algorithms in the message passing model. Experiments are performed to validate the communication efficiency of the proposed algorithms under the guarantee that the constructed sparsifiers have a good approximation quality.},
