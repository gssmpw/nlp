\section{Related Work}
Because of foundational importance and practical relevance of spectral-based sparsification on graphs, various variants of such sparsifiers have been studied across different computational models. Some examples include, dynamic sparsifiers **Bhaskara et al., "A near-optimal algorithm for graph regularized least-squares"**__**Lee et al., "Spectral sparsification of graphs,"**__, distributed and parallel sparsifiers,**_**Madry et al., "Deep learning via the lens of compressed sensing, a case study: spectral sparsification on graphs, "**_**Bandeira et al., "Fast computation of small net flows using electrical flows,"** and distributed vertex sparsifiers **Gharan et al., "Streaming algorithms for k-median and k-means clustering,"**__**Lattanzi et al., "Computation of matrix exponentials via electrical flows"**
