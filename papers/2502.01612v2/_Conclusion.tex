\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}


In this work, we have shown self-improvement training enables transformers to gradually generalize from easy to hard problems without access to hard labels. One extension is to incorporate more sophisticated verifiers as well as problem classes that is easy to verify but hard to solve. We expect self-improve to synergize with strong verification to enable transformers to solve harder problems beyond arithmetic or mazes.
