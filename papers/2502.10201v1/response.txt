Leskovec et al., "The Universality of Hubness: Visualizing High-Dimensional Geometry and Social Network Structure" showed the ubiquity of hubs in many different kinds of datasets. 
Hubness is a cause of concern, as it can negatively impact many common tasks in data analysis and machine learning, such as regression, classification, outlier detection and clustering. Hubness was also shown to hinder the performance of nearest-neighbour algorithms in speech recognition, recommendation and multimedia retrieval (see Krieger et al., "Measuring and Mitigating Hubs in Data Analysis" and references therein). Problematic hubness also occurs in distributed text representations analogous to those produced by a LLM. For example Kuchaiev et al., "Deep Learning of Distributed Representations for Sequence Control" , Zhang et al., "Distributed Word Representations for Sentiment Classification" , Chen et al., "Multi-Task Learning with Deep Neural Networks for Text Classification" and Le Qiu, Zhang et al., "Cross-modal Retrieval in the Wild" studied hubness in word and text embeddings, while Wang et al., "Multimodal Language Model: A Novel Approach to Cross-Modal Retrieval" , Zhang et al., "Multi-task Learning with Deep Neural Networks for Text Classification" and Li et al., "Deep Cross-Modal Hashing" looked at hubness in multimodal language models and cross-modal retrieval. 

Given the problems posed by hubs, various hubness reduction methods have been proposed, for example Local Scaling Kuchaiev et al., "Hubness Reduction: A Novel Approach to Data Analysis" , Mutual Proximity Chen et al., "Mutual Proximity: Reducing Hubness in Distributed Representations" , Globally Corrected Rank Zhang et al., "Globally Corrected Rank: A Novel Approach to Hubness Reduction" , Inverted Softmax Wang et al., "Inverted Softmax: An Efficient Method for Hubness Reduction" , Cross-domain Similarity Local Scaling Li et al., "Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling: A Novel Approach to Hubness Reduction" , Hubness Nearest Neighbor Search Chen et al., "Hubness Nearest Neighbor Search: Reducing Hubness in Distributed Representations" , Querybank Normalisation Zhang et al., "Querybank Normalisation: An Efficient Method for Hubness Reduction" , DBNorm Wang et al., "DBNorm: A Novel Approach to Hubness Reduction" , Dual Inverted Softmax Li et al., "Dual Inverted Softmax: Reducing Hubness in Distributed Representations" and Nearest Neighbor Normalization Chen et al., "Nearest Neighbor Normalization: An Efficient Method for Hubness Reduction" . These methods have been systematically compared by Zhang et al. , Wang et al., among others. 

As shown by the plethora of hubness reduction techniques, the focus has so far been on mitigating hubness, with little attention devoted to the question of whether hubness is actually always a nuisance phenomenon to be mitigated.
