    \caption{The proposed framework follows a structured pipeline for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. First, the HSI is read and undergoes dimensionality reduction before applying superpixel segmentation. Features are then extracted from each superpixel and, along with the initial labeling, are used to construct a superpixel-based graph. This graph is first processed by a bottom encoder before undergoing recursive pooling and encoding at multiple resolutions. The latent representations from all resolutions, including the bottom encoding, are concatenated and passed into a final classifier. The predicted labels are then mapped back to the superpixel regions, producing the final classification of the HSI.}

In this study, we aim to achieve precise classification predictions for a vast amount of unlabeled data while relying on a minimal set of labeled samples. We formulate the classification task within the framework of semi-supervised learning (SSL).

\begin{definition}[Semi-Supervised Classification Task]  
Given a labeled dataset \(\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^l\) and a label set \(\mathcal{L} = \{1, \ldots, c\}\) where \(\{y_i\}_{i=1}^l \in \mathcal{L}\), the goal is to learn a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{c+u}\) that leverages the unlabeled data \(\{x_k\}_{k=l+1}^{l+u}\) to enhance prediction accuracy for \(\{x_k\}_{k=l+1}^{l+u}\).
