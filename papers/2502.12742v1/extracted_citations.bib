Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN.},

abstract = {Commonly-used tools for cortical reconstruction and parcellation, such as FreeSurfer, are central to brain surface analysis but require extensive computation times. This paper proposes SegRecon, a fast learning approach where an integrated end-to-end deep learning method does simultaneously reconstruct and segment cortical surfaces directly from an MRI volume, all in a single step. We train a volume-based neural network to predict, for each voxel, the signed distance to the white-to-grey-matter interface along with its corresponding spherical representation in the registered atlas space. The continuous representation of the spherical coordinates enables our approach to naturally extract an implicit isolevel surface for its reconstruction and obtain the parcel labels from the spherical atlas. We illustrate the advantages of our method with thorough experiments on the MindBoggle dataset. Our parcellation results show more than 4\% improvements in average Dice accuracy with respect to FreeSurfer and a drastic speed-up from hours to seconds of computation.},

abstract = {A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},
