A previous article Kiczek, "Use Cases in Requirements Engineering" discussed the role of use cases in requirements and contrasted them with object-oriented requirements. The present paper extends that original discussion to a full-fledged requirements engineering method.

A number of requirements approaches share at least some of the objectives of UOOR. The field is a very broad one, with hundreds of proposals. We identified 15 well-documented methods which lend themselves to a point-by-point comparison based on the criteria discussed in section~\ref{characteristics}. Table~\ref{tab:related_work} is an overview of the results.

%None of the reviewed approaches satisfies all of the criteria identified in section~\ref{characteristics}.


NL-based requirements  Harel, "Behavioral Specification: The Very Music" are requirements formulated in the form of unrestricted \acrshort{nl} text, or \acrshort{nl} text, restricted in a certain way. NL-based requirements are easy to learn and are supported by a wide variety of tools and education materials. Scenarios (use cases  Auerbach, "Use Cases: Getting Your Requirements Right" , user stories Iacob, "Behavior-Driven Development" , and use cases 2.0 Kiczek, "Requirements Engineering Using Use Case Maps") are a powerful requirements technique. Still, they cannot serve as a requirements methodology. NL-based requirements, including scenarios, are prone to ambiguity, which can be partially eliminated by constraining the natural language. Requirements traceability relies on manually created traceability links. Requirements are reused by copy-pasting.

Use cases are an important modeling tool in UML Mylopoulos, "Dealing with Requirements-Change" . UML makes it possible to treat use cases as objects, subject to specialization and decomposition. UML use cases can have pre- and postconditions. It is possible in UML to associate contracts with individual operations through  natural language or the OCL (Object Constraint Language) notation. SysML Bockle, "Model-Based Systems Engineering with SysML" , an extended profile of UML, treats requirements as first-class entities, establishing direct links between requirements and other software artifacts (such as tests). Kiczek et al., "SysML for Requirements Engineers" illustrates the requirements specification process with SysML, and  Bockle et al., "Requirements Engineering with SysML" provide applications of SysML to all phases of software development. SysML does not provide semantics for requirements, although it is possible to associate contracts with individual operations through natural language or the OCL notation. SysML and UML are standardized notations and not methodologies.

The Restricted Use Case Modeling approach  Kiczek, "Requirements Engineering Using Use Case Maps" relies on a use case template and a set of restriction rules to reduce the ambiguity of use case specification and facilitate the transition to analysis models, such as UML class diagram and sequence diagram. The aToucan tool automates the generation of UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams  Kiczek et al., "aToucan: A Tool for Use Case Modeling" . The tool can generate traceability links from the textual use cases to the generated class diagram, but not to the source code. The approach does not advocate extracting abstract properties from use cases and domain knowledge, such as time-ordering and environmental constraints.

A Use Case Map (UCM) Kiczek, "Requirements Engineering Using Use Case Maps" depicts several scenarios simultaneously.
UCMs represent use cases as causal sequences of responsibilities, possibly over a set of abstract components. 
In UCMs, pre- and postconditions of use cases, as well as conditions at selection points, can be modeled with formal specification techniques such as ASM or LOTOS.  
UCMs specify properties of operations in relation to scenario sequences, rather than abstract properties of objects and operations. Use case maps do not provide a framework for requirements traceability and reuse.

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Mylopoulos, "Dealing with Requirements-Change" is a unified methodology for use-case-driven analysis and design, supported by UML Jacobson, "The Objectivist Method" as a unified notation. OOAD applies OO techniques (class-based decomposition, OO modeling) to the initial requirements, produced at the earlier stages of the development process. OOAD does not provide a framework for requirements traceability and reuse.

The OO-Method  Giorgini, "Designing Correct and Safe Systems with Object-Oriented Methods" combines conventional OO specification techniques Bucchiarone, "Object-Oriented Specification Languages: A Survey" with formal specification, relying on the OASIS object-oriented specification language  Giorgini et al., "OASIS: An Object-Oriented Specification Language" . 
The Integranova tool supports the specification process with an interactive interface and automatically generates the implementation code. However, this approach does not provide a framework for requirements traceability and reuse.

In goal-oriented requirements engineering  Bresciani, "Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering: A Survey" ,  Bresciani et al., "Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering with Objectiver" requirements are obtained through a series of refinements of high-level goals. With the help of the Objectiver tool  Bresciani, "Object-Oriented Goal-Analysis Using Objectiver" ,
requirements can be linked to other artifacts, such as goals, environment agents, or operations. However, traceability links to natural language requirements documents or implementation artifacts are out of the scope of the approach.

In test-driven development (TDD) Beck, "Test Driven Development: By Example" , a software engineer writes unit tests before implementing the systemâ€™s functionality in small iterations. Unit tests can be viewed as the means of capturing requirements: tests serve as a guide to code writing. In behavior-driven development (BDD) Lippert, "Behavior-Driven Development with Cucumber and Friends" , requirements are formulated as user stories, following a specific template. Dedicated tools transform user stories into parameterized unit tests. TDD and BDD rely on scenarios, which are not abstract enough to be \textit{requirements}: if scenarios attempt to cover \textit{all} possible situations, their number explodes, which impedes requirements traceability. BDD and TDD do not provide mechanisms for requirements reusability and static verification.
   
In the ACL/VF framework Kiczek et al., "A Contract Language Framework for Requirements" , use cases capture requirements, which are further formalized as grammars of responsibilities. Another Contract Language (ACL) contracts (pre- and postconditions and invariants) specify constraints, which scenarios' or responsibilities' execution poses on the system's state. In this approach, the requirements model is decoupled from the candidate implementation: a dedicated binding tool maps elements of the requirements model to the elements of candidate implementation. The approach requires a substantial background: familiarity with design by contract, ACL, and formal grammars. The approach is not seamless and does not provide a framework for requirements reuse.

The Multirequirements approach  Meyer, "The Multirequirements Approach" suggests using a single notation (Eiffel programming language) for requirements, design, and implementation. Requirements are formulated in 3 interconnected layers: natural language, software contracts in programming language, and diagrams. The approach does not provide a methodology and a framework for requirements traceability and reuse.

The PEGS approach attempts to provide a definition and taxonomy of requirements. According to this approach, requirements pertain to a Project intended, in a certain Environment, to achieve some Goals by building a System. Thus, requirements specification consists of four books: Project, Environment, Goals, and Systems, which correspond to each of these components  Bresciani et al., "Requirements Engineering with PEGS" . The approach provides principles and techniques of requirements specification, including seamless OO specification, yet does not provide an explicit methodology. 

The SIRCOD approach  Giorgini, "Designing Correct and Safe Systems with Object-Oriented Methods" provides a pipeline for converting natural language requirements to programming language contracts. The approach relies on the domain specific language, RSML, for automating conversion from natural language to programming language. In the Seamless Object-Oriented Requirements approach (SOOR), requirements are documented as software classes, which makes them verifiable and reusable  Giorgini et al., "Requirements Engineering with SOOR" . Routines of those classes, called specification drivers, take objects to be specified as arguments and express the effect of operations on those objects with pre- and postconditions. The SIRCOD and SOOR approaches focus on translating existing requirements specifications to contracts expressed in a programming language, rather than abstract enough requirements.
