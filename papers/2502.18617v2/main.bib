edition = {1},
address = {New York, NY},
abstract = {From object technology pioneer and ETH Zurich professor Bertrand Meyer, winner of
the Jolt award and the ACM Software System Award, a revolutionary textbook that makes
learning programming fun and rewarding. Meyer builds his presentation on a rich object-oriented
software system supporting graphics and multimedia, which students can use to produce
impressive applications from day one, then understand inside out as they learn new
programming techniques. Unique to Touch of Class is a combination of a practical,
hands-on approach to programming with the introduction of sound theoretical support
focused on helping students learn the construction of high quality software. The use
of full color brings exciting programming concepts to life. Among the useful features
of the book is the use of Design by Contract, critical to software quality and providing
a gentle introduction to formal methods. Will give students a major advantage by teaching
professional-level techniques in a literate, relaxed and humorous way.}

@book{usecase20,
  abstract = {This guide describes how to apply use cases in an agile and scalable fashion. It builds on the current state of the art to present an evolution of the use-case technique that we call Use-Case 2.0. The goal is to provide you with a foundation to help you get the most out of your use cases; one that is not only applicable for small colocated agile teams but also large distributed teams, outsourcing, and complex multi-system developments.
It presents the essentials of use-case driven development as an accessible and re-usable practice. It also provides an introduction to the idea of use cases and their application. It is deliberately kept lightweight. It is not a comprehensive guide to all aspects of use cases, or a tutorial on use-case modeling. It may not be sufficient 
for you to adopt the practice. For example, it is not intended to teach you how to model, for this we refer you to our previously published books on the subject.},
