\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes RankCoT, a knowledge refinement method that leverages the strengths of both ranking and summarization to effectively refine the knowledge from retrieval results, thereby aiding LLMs in generating more accurate responses. Our experimental studies show that RankCoT can effectively refine external knowledge and balance the utilization of internal and external knowledge. In-depth analysis reveals that the CoT generated by our method has a high similarity to the query and a high ground truth answer hit rate. 
%In addition, RankCoT reduces the input length to the Question-Answering model without the need for secondary encoding of external knowledge.
