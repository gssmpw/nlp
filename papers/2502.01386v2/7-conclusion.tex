\section{Conclusion}

This study highlights the critical vulnerability of RAG systems to sophisticated opinion manipulation attacks in real-world scenarios. By shifting focus from traditional factual or single-query attacks to topic-oriented adversarial manipulations, we reveal how attackers can systematically exploit the knowledge synthesis capabilities of LLMs to alter information perception and propagate biased narratives. The proposed Topic-FlipRAG framework demonstrates that combining adversarial ranking perturbations with LLMs' inherent reasoning abilities enables effective stance polarity shifts across interconnected queries, even in complex multi-perspective contexts. 
Experiments show that existing mitigation strategies inadequately address semantically sophisticated attacks. In the future, we will explore enhanced transparency protocols to maintain RAG systems as reliable information mediators.
