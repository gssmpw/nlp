Tobias' research has been supported by EPSRC's Excalibur
programme through the DDWG projects \textit{PAX--HPC} (Gant EP/W026775/1)
as well as \textit{An ExCALIBUR Multigrid Solver Toolbox for ExaHyPE}
(EP/X019497/1).
His group appreciates the support by Intel's Academic Centre of
Excellence at Durham University. 
The work has received funding through the eCSE project ARCHER2-eCSE11-2
\emph{ExaHyPE-DSL}, and Pawel and Tobias have been supported through EPSRC's \emph{HAI-End} project.

The code development relied on experimental test nodes installed within  
the DiRAC@Durham facility managed by the Institute for Computational Cosmology
on behalf of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility
(\href{www.dirac.ac.uk}{www.dirac.ac.uk}). The equipment was funded by BEIS capital funding via STFC capital grants ST/K00042X/1, ST/P002293/1, ST/R002371/1 and ST/S002502/1, Durham University and STFC operations grant ST/R000832/1. DiRAC is part of the National e-Infrastructure.
