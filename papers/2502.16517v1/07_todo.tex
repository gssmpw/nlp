\begin{itemize} 
  \item The paper suffers from the fact that we don't compare our annotation-based offloading to a manual OpenMP offloading. The latter should be quite easy to do with the two continuous memory variants. We leave a lot of a good story untold as we don't compare.
  
  \item Create a new compute kernel variant (new overloaded version):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The multiscale predicate is evaluated but only reduced into a bool (logical or), so the symmetric operation is not taken into account
      \item After the loop, we check this bool. If it is set, then we loop over all particle pairs again and now evaluate the symmetric operation
    \end{itemize}

    \item Pawel: Can we fit 'accelerator offloading' to the title? (and keywords)

    \item change 'conversations' to 'conversions'
    \item change 'struct attributes' to 'struct members' or 'struct fields' when talking about fields and not C++ attributes
    \item change 'temporal' to 'temporary'

\end{itemize}
