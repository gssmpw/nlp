\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In the present study, we proposed MoireDB,
a formula-generated dataset of interference-fringe images
for use with the PixMix method of data augmentation,
and conducted experiments to assess its impact on robustness.
Our results showed that, for several test categories,
data augmentation using MoireDB
achieved a greater improvement in robustness than
data augmentation with Fractal arts or FVis.
This demonstrates that formula-generated images based on illusory images
can help improve the robustness of deep learning models for image classification.
% In future work, we hope to conduct robustness tests using 
% datasets other than CIFAR-C, such as ImageNet-C, ImageNet-P, and 
% ImageNet-R. We also plan to use insights gleaned from 
% MoireDB-based data augmentation to explore in greater depth the relationship
% between illusory images and the robustness of deep learning models.
