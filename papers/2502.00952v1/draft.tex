\begin{abstract}
 We often treat social media as a lens onto society. How might that lens be distorting the actual popularity of political and social viewpoints? In this paper, we examine the difference between the viewpoints publicly posted in a community and the privately surveyed viewpoints of community members, contributing a measurement of a theory called the ``spiral of silence.'' This theory observes that people are less likely to voice their opinion when they believe they are in the minority---leading to a spiral where minority opinions are less likely to be shared, so they appear even further in the minority, and become even less likely to be shared. We surveyed active members of politically oriented Reddit communities to gauge their willingness to post on contentious topics, yielding 627 responses from 108 participants about 11 topics and 33 subreddits. We find that 72.6\% of participants who perceive themselves in the minority remain silent, and are only half as likely to post their viewpoint compared to those who believe their opinion is in the majority. Communities perceived as being more inclusive reduce the magnitude of this effect. These results emphasize how far out of step the opinions we see online may be with the population they purport to represent.

\section*{Broader Perspectives and Ethics}
This work was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institution. All participants signed an informed consent form before beginning the survey. One potential risk of our study is that participants may be exposed to controversial viewpoints; however, the harm of seeing these viewpoints is no more than what participants may be exposed to if otherwise browsing Reddit. For the purposes of privacy, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from our survey participants. All data is stored on secure servers that are accessible only to the authors of the paper. 

We discuss how our empirical findings can be leveraged to counter the spiral of silence, particularly through improving community safety. While this change may promote minoritized opinion sharing, it also places more work on moderators, who already are overburdened. Furthermore, if voicing minoritized opinions leads to conflict, it could negatively impact engagement within the community~\cite{altenburger2024consequences}. Nonetheless, we believe that our empirical insights on understanding how to promote minoritized opinion sharing will have beneficial impacts on community health.
