\subsection{Generating Controversial Viewpoints}
\label{sec:hai_design}
\subsubsection{Prompts}
Our first step is to generate a list of topics that are likely to lead to disagreement. We provide the subreddit name, description of the subreddit, and community rules retrieved using \texttt{PRAW}. For our study, we generate $20$ topics per subreddit using \texttt{GPT-4} with temperature set to 1. 
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}[style=gptprompt]
You are a member of r/${SUBREDDIT}. Your task is to generate controversial issues,
aka issues that will lead to disagreement between r/${SUBREDDIT} members.
<name>
${SUBREDDIT}
</name>
<description> 
${DESCRIPTION}
</description>
<rules>
${RULES}
</rules>
Provide ${NUMBER} issues that will be controversial in r/${SUBREDDIT}. 
Return just the issue, no justification.
\end{lstlisting}

We generate viewpoints representing different stances for each topic. Again, we provide the subreddit name with the description and community rules. We use the same set of hyperparameters from topic generation for this task. 
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}[style=gptprompt]
You are a member of r/${SUBREDDIT}. Your task is to generate viewpoints that
r/${SUBREDDIT} members would hold on a given topic.
<name>
${SUBREDDIT}
</name>
<description> 
${DESCRIPTION}
</description>
<rules>
${RULES}
</rules>
For each side of the issue, write a 50-word Reddit comment from the perspective of that side that 
follows the rules of r/${SUBREDDIT}. 
Issue: ${TOPIC}
Return only the comments as a list, no justification. Example output: ["I am pro-choice.", "I am pro-life."] 
\end{lstlisting}
 
Finally, we shorten each of the viewpoints that was generated using the following prompt. We use a temperature of $0$ for this task. 
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}[style=gptprompt]
Shorten a statement while retaining the same viewpoint. 
The statement should be phrased as an opinion.
Text: ${VIEWPOINT}
Return just the shortened statement, no justification.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Generated Topics and Viewpoints}
In Table~\ref{tab:viewpoint_list}, we provide the list of all eleven topics and their corresponding viewpoints. The first five topics were generated using \texttt{r/politics} as the seed subreddit and the subsequent six using \texttt{r/worldnews}. We also provide examples of applying our topic generation method to communities outside the realm of politics or social issues. In Table~\ref{tab:viewpoint_other}, we list five topics each from \texttt{r/nba} and \texttt{r/gaming}.

\input{Tables/viewpoint-list}
\input{Tables/viewpoints-other}


\subsection{Identifying Relevant Subreddits}
To find our list of political and social issues-oriented subreddits, we use the following process. Starting with 2,040 subreddits from \texttt{r/ListOfSubreddits}, we look at the 50 hottest submissions in each subreddit as of January 5, 2024. We select subreddits where the majority of submissions are in English -- classified using \texttt{langdetect}~\cite{nakatani2010langdetect} -- leaving us with 1,975 subreddits. Next, using \texttt{GPT-3.5-Turbo} we classify whether post titles are political (see below for prompt). We choose subreddits where more than $80\%$ of submissions are labelled as being political (N=48). From the remaining subreddits, we select our final list of 23 based on subreddit size. In our final survey, participants also had the option to list an additional subreddit they were an active member of, bringing us to 33 subreddits in total. 


\begin{lstlisting}[style=gptprompt]
Political content on Reddit is varied and can be about officials and activists, social issues, or news and current events. Looking at the following post title, would you categorize it as POLITICAL or NOT POLITICAL content? 

Answer 1 if it is POLITICAL, 0 otherwise.

Post: ${POST}
Answer:
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Knowledge Quiz}
\label{sec:app_kq}
To validate that participants were members of the subreddits they selected, they were given a knowledge screening quiz. In the quiz, the participants were shown three post titles, two of which belonged to top 50 hottest submissions of their selected subreddit and one that came from the top 50 hottest submissions of a different political subreddit. We manually checked that the title from the other subreddit was not relevant to the selected subreddit. The titles used in the knowledge quiz is listed in Table~\ref{tab:kq}.  
\input{Tables/kq}
\subsection{Survey Details}
Participants were compensated a prorated \$15/hr for completing the survey with a total of \$1,070 spent (including pilot studies, screenings, etc.). 

We provide the survey instrument used in the study as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In what year did you create your Reddit account?
\item Typically, how often do you post or comment on Reddit versus browsing what others have submitted (lurking)? 
\item Select up to 3 subreddits that you are an active member of. 
\item Are you an active member of any other subreddits that focus on political or social issues outside of those you have already selected? 
\item Provide the name of a subreddit that you are an active member of which focuses on political or social issues that is not one of the subreddits you have already selected. 
\item How diverse are the people for each subreddit? 
\item How included and able to contribute do new and existing members feel for each subreddit? 
\item Select up to 5 topics that are relevant to the subreddit. 
\item Which viewpoint on the topic do you agree with more? 
\item Indicate your level of agreement with the viewpoint. 
\item Indicate the level of agreement you think the majority of subreddit members have for the viewpoint.
\item Disregarding your own stance on the topic, should members of the subreddit be able to share this viewpoint? 
\item Imagine that you are browsing posts, and you see a post related to the selected topic. You notice that in the comments the following viewpoint has not been raised yet. Rate the likelihood you would share this viewpoint on the subreddit under your main account. 
\item Rate the likelihood you would upvote someone elseâ€™s comment expressing this viewpoint, if the comment was present.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}
Finally, we provide the descriptive statistics of the variables we use in our linear mixed-effect models in Table~\ref{tab:variables}.

\input{Tables/descriptive}

\section{Robustness Checks}
\label{sec:robustness}
In this section, we conduct three robustness checks on our analyses. First, we report results using an ordinal mixed effect regression model in Table~\ref{tab:model1_ordinal}. Second, we use an alternative measure (\textit{ModRatio}) for moderation. In our pre-registration, we planned on using both \textit{ModRatio} and \textit{Content Removal Rate} as measures of community moderation but ultimately removed \textit{ModRatio} as the two were correlated. Finally, we provide results for our analysis including a quadratic term for \textit{Content Removal Rate}.

\subsubsection{Ordinal mixed effect regression}
In Table~\ref{tab:model1_ordinal}, we use an ordinal mixed effect regression to predict \textit{Share Likelihood}, which is a Likert-scale with values ranging from $1$ to $7$. We find that this set of models yields qualitatively similar results to Models 1a-c reported in Sec~\ref{sec:results}. There is a statistically significant negative relationship between \textit{Incongruency} ($\beta=-0.66$, $p<0.001$) and the likelihood of sharing a viewpoint. Furthermore, there is a positive relationship between the dependent variable and \textit{Inclusion} ($\beta=0.28$, $p<0.01$) as well as a interaction effect between \text{Inclusion} and \text{Incongruency} ($\beta = 0.37$, $p < 0.05$).
\input{Tables/model1_share_ordinal}
\subsubsection{Replacing measures for moderation} We examine changes to the model when replacing \textit{Content Removal Rate} with \textit{ModRatio} as our measure of moderation. \textit{ModRatio} is the ratio of the number of subscribers to number of moderators in a subreddit. In this case, a higher \textit{ModRatio} would mean less active moderation as there are fewer moderators per subscribers. We apply a logarithmic transformation with base 2 after adding a start-value of 1 to \textit{ModRatio}. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:modratio}, we find a significant negative relationship between \textit{ModRatio} and \textit{Share Likelihood} ($p=0.04$). However, the impact on the dependent variable is minimal. When we look at model coefficients using non-standardized variables, a $1\%$ increase in the ratio of subscribers to moderators only leads to a $0.003$ increase in the likelihood of sharing an opinion. The trends with our other independent variables are the same as when we used \textit{Content Removal Rate}.

\subsubsection{Examining quadratic terms} We also report results of our linear mixed-effects model after including a quadratic term for \textit{Content Removal Rate} in Table~\ref{tab:quadratic}. Again, we see similar trends between \textit{Inclusion} and \textit{Incongruency} on \textit{Share Likelihood}. There is no significant relationship between the quadratic term and our dependent variable.

\section{Deviations from Pre-registration}
We pre-register our analyses on OSF.\footnote{Pre-registration materials at https://osf.io/gze65?view\_only=03f45025105a42b1b50cd6936ece06d0.} We also report the following deviations from our pre-registration. First, we split community values into two separate hypotheses as we found perceived inclusion and diversity were measuring distinct constructs. We also updated the wording on our hypotheses to mention incongruent viewpoints. Second, we changed how we measured \textit{Content Removal Rate}. In the pre-registration, we had planned to use 500 posts sampled from each subreddit; however, during analysis, we found this method underreported the amount of content removal compared to results from prior work~\cite{jhaver2019does}. Thus, we decided to rely on Pushshift data~\cite{pushshift2023dumps}, which gave us access to a larger corpus of posts. Third, we remove the variable \textit{Mod Ratio} from our models since it was correlated with \textit{Content Removal Rate}. For robustness, we replicate our results using \textit{Mod Ratio} as our measure for community moderation, finding similar results. We also added a random effect for subreddit. Finally, we conducted additional analyses using \textit{Upvote Likelihood} as our dependent variable.


\section{Other Techniques for Avoiding Self-Silencing}
In our survey we also ask participants what other actions they are likely to take for viewpoints they would not share under their main account. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:otheractions}, participants are most likely to ``lurk,'' or read discussion on a topic but not share their viewpoint. After lurking, the second most common option is to discuss the viewpoint offline with friends and family. Prior work~\cite{pewresearchcenter_2014_sos} found that people are more likely to engage in conversation on controversial political topics in face-to-face settings rather than on social media platforms. 

We also find that participants leverage the affordances on Reddit to find other means for expressing their viewpoint. For example, sharing the viewpoint using a ``throwaway account''~\cite{leavitt2015throwaway}, a temporary account created under a different pseudonym than the user's main account, is selected as a preferred option for 11 viewpoints. This suggests that in some cases, having a greater degree of anonymity, which a throwaway account offers, may help counteract silencing effects. Another option is to post the viewpoint to a different subreddit. When participants were asked why they decided to post to alternative subreddits, reasons included selecting subreddits that were smaller in size, were more related to the topic, or were more likely to agree with the viewpoint.
