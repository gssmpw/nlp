In this work, our goal is to measure the extent of the spiral of silence across different online communities. We also seek to identify community design factors that may amplify or mitigate self-silencing effects. Since directly measuring what is left unsaid using social media data is not possible, we propose a new method using LLMs to propose community-specific topics and viewpoints that are likely to be controversial. Then, we survey users' likelihood of opinion expression, opinion incongruency, and perceived community values. In total, we collected 627 responses from 108 Reddit users across 33 subreddits and 11 topics on their likelihood of opinion expression. Although self-silencing behavior is prevalent, community-level design decisions, such as promoting inclusivity, can encourage opinion sharing.
