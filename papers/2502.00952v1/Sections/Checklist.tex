\item For most authors...
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Would answering this research question advance science without violating social contracts, such as violating privacy norms, perpetuating unfair profiling, exacerbating the socio-economic divide, or implying disrespect to societies or cultures?
    \answerYes{Yes, advancing this research question would advance science without violating social contracts. We explore viewpoints that are not being expressed online that still fall within the bounds of what is considered ``acceptable'' within that community.}
