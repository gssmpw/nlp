    \footnotesize{\\ * We normalize the scores so that the average score of the unscaled doc1 is 0.}
    \caption{\textit{Top}: Changes in scores for doc1 (repeated tok1) and doc2 (repeated tok2) when increasing tok1's IDF at different scales, averaged across all samples. Larger increases in tok1's IDF result in larger score increase for doc1.  \textit{Bottom}: Changes in scores for doc1 and doc2 when decreasing tok1's IDF shows the inverse effect. Both increase and decrease has ranges where the monotonic trend reverses a little which suggests that there are optimal range for editing both ways.}
