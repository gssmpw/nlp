    \caption{Path patching from individual attention heads to final logits reveals 10.1, 10.4, 10.7, 10.10 as the most critcal head in sending soft-TF information to [CLS] for ranking score computation for both TFC1 and STMC1 diagnostic datasets. Notably, these critical heads are shared between TFC1 and STMC1, exhibiting very similar importance values.}
