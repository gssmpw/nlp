    \caption{For the majority of Matching Heads, after the initial occurrence of \( X_\text{selected} \), which causes a sharp increase in attention, subsequent occurrences result in only minimal incremental increases. This aligns with TFC2, which states that additional term occurrences yield smaller improvements.}
