    \caption{We find that the cross-encoder rediscovers a semantic variant of BM25. Specifically, Matching Heads, Contextual Query Representation Heads, and the embedding matrix compute, process and send BM25-like components' information to the Relevance Scoring Heads which finally compute the relevance score in a BM25-like manner.  %We show where the four components of BM25 (TF, IDF, k, and b) are  and transmitted in the model. %<CLS> to <SEP> is an example query, and <SEP> to <SEP> is an example document.
