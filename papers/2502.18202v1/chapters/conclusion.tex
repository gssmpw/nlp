\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we presented DenoMAE2.0, an enhanced denoising autoencoder that jointly optimizes reconstruction loss and an unmasked patch classification loss to improve robustness and performance. By incorporating a classification head that refines feature learning on unmasked regions, DenoMAE2.0 surpasses its predecessor, DenoMAE, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior ability to handle noisy data while preserving high classification accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the influence of auxiliary loss weighting and MLP hidden dimensions on performance, offering key insights into the role of hyperparameter tuning in optimizing denoising autoencoders.
