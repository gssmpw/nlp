\subsection{Early Work on Trustworthiness Detection}

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{muoz2019trust}. In \citep{sanchez2018detecting}, the trustworthiness of $\mathbb{X}$ users is evaluated with a S-SVDD approach over social network features, such as the number of friends, the number of followers, or the number of retweets. In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

\subsection{Multimodal Learning Applications}

Regarding multimodal learning, MS-SVDD has been applied over various OCC problems involving two modalities, such as Robot Execution Failures with torque and force \citep{xu2018robot}, Handwritten characters with Zernike moment and morphological features \citep{ma2005handwritten}, or SPECTF dataset with stress and rest condition images \citep{fujisawa2004spectrum}. MS-SVDD has also recently been applied to medical data for early detection of myocardial infarction \citep{wang2018myocardial}.

The diversity of these different works emphasizes the versatility of S-SVDD and MS-SVDD in terms of possible applications. Therefore, some directions have not been explored yet. For instance, multimodal applications were always limited in practice to two modalities, even though MS-SVDD could theoretically be leveraged with any number of modalities. Also, as mentioned earlier, several improvements such as graph embedding were only developed for unimodal S-SVDD and not MS-SVDD.

In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{xu2005novel}. In \citep{xu2018robot}, an alternative formulation for S-SVDD is proposed, allowing us to cross modalities two-by-two. By setting up different values for $\mathbf{\nu}_m$, we can create several regularizers for the training of the model.

In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{xu2005novel}. In \citep{xu2018robot}, an alternative formulation for S-SVDD is proposed, allowing us to cross modalities two-by-two. By setting up different values for $\mathbf{\nu}_m$, we can create several regularizers for the training of the model.

In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{xu2005novel}. In \citep{xu2018robot}, an alternative formulation for S-SVDD is proposed, allowing us to cross modalities two-by-two. By setting up different values for $\mathbf{\nu}_m$, we can create several regularizers for the training of the model.

In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{xu2005novel}. In \citep{xu2018robot}, an alternative formulation for S-SVDD is proposed, allowing us to cross modalities two-by-two. By setting up different values for $\mathbf{\nu}_m$, we can create several regularizers for the training of the model.

In \citep{mohammed2019credit}, authors address the problem of credit card fraud detection by leveraging various features over highly imbalanced datasets.

Numerous challenges have been addressed using SVDD and subspace learning \citep{xu2005novel}. In \citep{xu2018robot}, an alternative formulation for S-SVDD is proposed, allowing us to cross modalities two-by-two. By setting up different values for $\mathbf{\nu}_m$, we can create several regularizers for the training of the model.
