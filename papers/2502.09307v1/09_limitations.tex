\section*{Limitations}

In our study, we evaluated reading comprehension across a wide array of LLMs. However, the latest state-of-the-art models appeared too late to be incorporated into this version of our paper. Assessing their understanding of our sets would be interesting for a future version of this paper. Additionally, our focus was limited to measuring reading comprehension on Subject/Object GP sentences. Exploring LLMs' comprehension of other types of GP sentences would also be interesting. Finally, we did not collect data on metrics beyond reading comprehension, such as eye gaze or reading time, in our experiments. Gathering such metrics and analyzing their correlation with sentence comprehension could provide valuable insights.
