\section{Conclusion}

This study explores similarities between human and LLM sentence processing. By focusing on comprehension of garden-path sentences, known for their syntactic complexity and inherent challenges for human processing, we studied whether LLMs have similar difficulties to humans. Our findings demonstrate that humans and LLMs struggle with similar syntactic structures, and notably, some LLMs approximate human behavior quite closely, as indicated by strong correlation metrics. Additionally, the correlation between errors in the comprehension questions,  paraphrasing and image generations tasks suggests shared underlying mechanisms of sentence misinterpretation between the tasks. Our approach not only adds a novel dimension to the evaluation of LLMs but also opens up possibilities for utilizing these models to gain deeper insights into human linguistic processing.
