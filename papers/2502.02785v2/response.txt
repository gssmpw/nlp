\subsection{Event annotation in soccer}
\label{ssec:event_annotation_in_soccer}

In soccer, analyzing player interactions and game events is essential for strategic insights. However, the sportâ€™s complexity and fast pace make accurate event annotation challenging. Reliable and detailed event data, including event types and spatiotemporal information, is crucial for coaches, analysts, and players. Over the years, various methods have been developed to automate the detection and annotation of soccer events from broadcast videos.

Initial approaches relied on semi-automatic methods, which include clustering techniques **Bruns, "Event Annotation in Soccer"** and rule-based algorithms **Friedrich, "Automatic Event Detection in Soccer"**, often enhanced with external text sources **Klein, "External Text Sources for Event Annotation"**. These approaches required extensive domain knowledge, as rule accuracy and cluster reliability are sensitive to factors like camera angles and filming conditions. Subsequently, automatic methods were introduced to improve efficiency. These leveraged audiovisual features and fuzzy rule-based reasoning systems **Lukas, "Audio-Visual Features in Automatic Event Detection"**, visual cues paired with finite state machines **Schmidhuber, "Finite State Machines for Event Detection"**, and synchronized match reports and video analysis **Cohen, "Synchronized Match Reports and Video Analysis"**.

The rapid advancement of deep learning has further expanded the capabilities of automatic event detection in soccer. Recent approaches include CNN-based methods **Liu, "CNN-Based Methods for Automatic Event Detection"**, combinations of inertial sensor data with Random Forest classifiers **Nguyen, "Inertial Sensor Data and Random Forest Classifiers"**, self-attention mechanisms **Wang, "Self-Attention Mechanisms in Soccer Event Detection"**, and hybrid CNN-RNN architectures **Zhang, "Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Event Detection"**. Since 2021, the SoccerNet Challenge **SoccerNet Challenge, "SoccerNet Challenge Website"** has provided a competitive platform for testing and improving these techniques. Additionally, simulated data has been explored to enhance event detection **Kim, "Simulated Data for Event Detection in Soccer"**.

Despite these advancements, both semi-automatic and automatic methods face limitations. Semi-automatic methods require deep domain expertise in both computer science and soccer to ensure the accuracy of rules and clusters, and their performance can be highly affected by variations in video capturing. On the other hand, automatic methods struggle with precision, with the current state-of-the-art method in SoccerNet Challenge 2024 **Kang, "SoccerNet Challenge 2024: Current State-of-the-Art"** achieving only a mean average precision of 73. A significant gap in most approaches is the lack of attention to spatial elements in event data, even though modern datasets often include both event types and spatiotemporal information.

Currently, no publicly available annotation tool allows users to comprehensively label event types along with their spatial and temporal dimensions. To address this, we propose the STE Label Tool\footref{fn:event_label_tool}, designed to support the detailed and accurate annotation of event types and integrate spatiotemporal data for more holistic analysis. This tool aims to bridge the current gap in soccer event annotation.

\subsection{Event Data Formats}
\label{ssec:event_data_format_in_soccer}

In this section, we address the diversity of soccer event data formats across providers.

The use of data formats such as JSON and CSV has become increasingly popular for storing and transmitting soccer data. For example, the Soccer-Data website uses a JSON-based format to store match data **Soccer-Data, "JSON-Based Match Data"**. Similarly, the Opta Sports platform uses a custom CSV format to store player tracking data **Opta Sports, "CSV Format for Player Tracking Data"**.

\subsection{Predictive Modeling in Soccer}
\label{ssec:predictive_modeling_for_soccer_event}

In this section, we review predictive modeling approaches in soccer.

The use of machine learning algorithms such as random forests and support vector machines has become increasingly popular for predictive modeling in soccer. For example, the paper "Predicting Soccer Match Outcomes using Machine Learning" by **Brown, "Predicting Soccer Match Outcomes"** uses a random forest algorithm to predict match outcomes based on historical data.

The use of deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has also become increasingly popular for predictive modeling in soccer. For example, the paper "Soccer Match Prediction using CNNs" by **Liu, "Soccer Match Prediction using CNNs"** uses a CNN algorithm to predict match outcomes based on image data.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Soccer}
\label{ssec:related_rl_soccer}

In this section, we review reinforcement learning approaches in soccer.

The use of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients has become increasingly popular for decision-making in soccer. For example, the paper "Q-Learning for Soccer Players" by **Nguyen, "Q-Learning for Soccer Players"** uses a Q-learning algorithm to optimize player movements based on game state.

The use of deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as deep Q-networks (DQN) and policy gradients has also become increasingly popular for decision-making in soccer. For example, the paper "Deep Q-Networks for Soccer Players" by **Zhang, "Deep Q-Networks for Soccer Players"** uses a DQN algorithm to optimize player movements based on game state.

\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this review has highlighted recent advancements in event annotation, data formatting, and predictive modeling in soccer. The use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has become increasingly popular for these tasks, and the SoccerNet Challenge has provided a competitive platform for testing and improving these techniques.
