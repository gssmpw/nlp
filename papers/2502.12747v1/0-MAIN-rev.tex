%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.
%%

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting
%% the next command will enable that style.

    \toolkit~enables rapid prototyping of low-fidelity exoskeletons using 3D-printed and off-the-shelf components~(a). Its modular design allows easy customization of functionality and size~(b). To ease customization of the exoskeleton's interactive behavior, functional abstractions of basic functionalities and higher-level augmentation strategies are readily accessible through programming interfaces~(c). 
    The designed interaction can be tested in real-time~(d).}

  \Description{Overview of ExoKit’s workflow. The diagram consists of four sub-images, representing the stages of ExoKit’s workflow. (a) DIY Fabrication—a 3D printer software displays digital 3D models that shall be printed. (b) Assembly—a user assembles the modular, 3d printed components. (c) Implementation—a laptop connected to an Arduino is wired to the assembled hardware. A user implements some code. (d) Real-time Testing—the user wears the exoskeleton while the arm is being moved. The user can iterate and explores further alternatives, either restarting at the assembly or the implementation stage.}
