\section{Conclusion}
Towards effective RPLAs for established characters, 
this paper introduces \method, 
a collection of an authentic dataset, along with models and evaluation protocol based on such data.
The \method dataset offers high-quality data from 771 renowned books, and includes comprehensive data types such as authentic dialogues, plot summaries, character experiences, inner thoughts, \etc.
Then, we propose given-circumstance acting (GCA) for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters within authentic book scenarios. 
Applying GCA training to LLaMA-3.1 models using our dataset, we develop \method 8B and \method 70B, advanced open LLMs for role-playing. 
For evaluation, 
GCA combines multi-agent simulation and penalty-based LLM critics. 
Extensive experiments exhibit \method dataset's value for RPLA training, evaluation, and retrieval.
Moreover, \method models achieve state-of-the-art performance on both our evaluation and three existing RPLA benchmarks. 




\section*{Impact Statement} %

\method aims to advance RPLA research by providing effective dataset, models and evaluation protocol. 
We will release our dataset, models, and evaluation scripts to foster innovation in RPLAs. 
The dataset is intended for research purposes only.
For copyright policies, we will not distribute raw novel content. 
We require that anyone using our work must adhere to copyright policies and obtain proper permissions for any derivative works. 
The \method dataset is derived from literary works may involve ethical considerations, and the content involved does not represent the authors' viewpoints. 
Our methods can potentially be applied to develop agents for real-world individuals. 
However, such applications must strictly respect personal data privacy and obtain necessary consent.
We hope our research will benefit RPLA researchers and developers, but emphasize the importance of responsible development. Any applications must respect copyright policies, personal data privacy, and be developed with proper licensing.
