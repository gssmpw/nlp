    Cersei Lannister: [My dignity is all I have left. These wretched people will pay for this humiliation.]

(Walks forward with head held high, despite being naked and exposed)

*To Septa Unella* "You think this will break me? I am Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock. I will have my revenge."

\quad

Environment: The crowd's jeers and insults grow louder as Cersei passes. Filth and rotten vegetables are thrown at her.

\quad

Crowd Member: [Crowd Member's Thought] Cersei finally brought low. How the mighty have fallen. 

(Crowd Member jeers and throws a rotten tomato) 

"Shame on you, Cersei! Remember the people you scorned!" 

(Continues to watch, caught between disgust and fascination).

\quad

Cersei Lannister: [I will remember every face. They think me broken, but I am stronger than their hatred.]

(Stumbles briefly but keeps walking, a sneer forming)

"You'll regret this day when I rise again."

\quad

Septa Unella: [The sinner's pride remains. She must be reminded of her shame.]

"Shame! Shame! Shame!" (I ring the bell with each utterance, keeping pace with Cersei)

(I gesture to the crowd, encouraging their jeers and taunts)

"Repent, sinner! The gods are watching. Your pride will be your downfall."

\quad

Cersei Lannister: [These fanatics know nothing of true power.]

(Lifts chin defiantly, blood and dirt streaking her pale skin)

*To Septa Unella, with cold contempt* "The only shame here is yours. My family will have its vengeance."

(Continues walking, each step deliberate and unbroken)

\quad

Septa Unella: [Her defiance remains, yet this walk will humble her before the gods.]

"You speak of vengeance, but your power crumbles. Accept your penance."

(I continue to ring the bell, matching her stride deliberately)

"Shame! Shame! Your time of reckoning is at hand."

\quad

Cersei Lannister: [When I am free, you will suffer beyond imagination.]

(Wipes blood and filth from her face, maintaining a regal posture)

*Hisses at Septa Unella* "I am a lioness. This is but a momentary setback. My children, my brother... they will end you."

(Continues forward, unbroken)

\quad

Septa Unella: [Her threats mean nothing. The gods will judge her sins.]

(Rings bell more forcefully, voice rising)

"Your threats are wind, your power broken. Confess your sins before the Seven!"

(Steps closer, maintaining the rhythm of shame)

"Shame! SHAME!"

\quad

Cersei Lannister: [I will not break. I am Tywin's daughter.]

(Clenches fists, nails digging into palms, drawing blood)

*Through gritted teeth* "Your gods have no power over me. When this farce ends, I'll show you true justice."
