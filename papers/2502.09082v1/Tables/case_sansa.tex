    \textbf{\textit{{Profile}}}: Sansa Stark, a young noblewoman from the North, finds herself at the center of political intrigue and personal tragedy in "A Storm of Swords." Born to the noble House Stark, Sansa begins the story as a ward of the crown in King's Landing, her initial romantic notions of court life long since shattered.

    {\large{\textbf{\textit{{Lysa Arryn}}}}}

    \textbf{\textit{{Motivation}}}: I must protect what's mine. Petyr is mine, and this girl is trying to take him away from me. I'll show her what happens to those who cross me. 

    \textbf{\textit{{Profile}}}: Lysa Arryn, n√©e Tully, is a complex and volatile character in George R.R. Martin's "A Storm of Swords." As the widow of Jon Arryn, the former Hand of the King, and Lady of the Eyrie, Lysa plays a significant role in the political landscape of Westeros. She is the sister of Catelyn Stark and aunt to Sansa Stark, though her actions are often driven by her own desires rather than familial loyalty.

{\textbf{Simulation of \qquad \method 70B}} &
    Lysa Arryn: [My rage is building. I must confront this little slut.] You kissed him. (Her voice is shrill with accusation)

\quad

Sansa Stark: [I'm terrified, but I must remain calm and find a way out of this.] (She shakes her head in disbelief) [I can't believe this is happening. I need to explain myself carefully.] One kiss, aunt. A harmless kiss on the cheek, that's all.

\quad

Lysa Arryn: [She's lying! I won't let her manipulate me.] (She spots the wind-up knight) Was this how you kissed him? (She sets the knight moving, her eyes wild) You're a woman grown, aren't you? (Her voice rises to a shriek) \textcolor{blue}{Grown enough to be wed, wed enough to be bedded!}

\quad

Sansa Stark: [The pain is excruciating, but I can't show weakness now.] (She struggles to keep her face neutral despite the pain) [I need to find a way to calm her down.] Please, Aunt Lysa, I don't know what you mean. I'm just a guest here. I would never do anything to betray your trust.

\quad

Lysa Arryn: [I'll show her what happens to those who cross me.] (She screams) You're just like the others. You and your mother, you both drove me to this. I should push you out this door right now.

\quad

Sansa Stark: [I'm going to die if I don't think of something quickly.] (Tears stream down her face, mixing with the wind) [I need to appeal to her maternal side, to make her see me as a child again.] Mother? (Her voice trembles) Please, Aunt Lysa. I never meant to hurt you. I'm your niece, your blood. Please don't hurt me. I'm just a stupid little girl. I don't know anything about kissing men. I've never even had a kiss in my life. (She forces herself to look into Lysa's eyes) I'm afraid, Aunt Lysa. Please, don't push me out the door. I don't want to fly.
