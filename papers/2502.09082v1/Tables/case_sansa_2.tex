    Lysa Arryn: [My blood is boiling with jealousy and rage. I'll make this little harlot pay for trying to seduce my Petyr.] You threw yourself at him. That was the way of it.

    \quad
    
    Sansa Stark: [I'm trembling with fear, but I must defend myself.] That's not true.

    \quad
    
    Lysa Arryn: [She dares to deny it? I'll show her how serious I am.] Where are you going? Are you afraid? Such wanton behavior must be punished, but I will not be hard on you.

    \quad
    
    Sansa Stark: [I need to explain what really happened, maybe she'll listen to reason.] I was building a snow castle. Lord Petyr was helping me, and then he kissed me. That's what you saw.

    \quad
    
    Lysa Arryn: [Her words only fuel my anger and paranoia.] Have you no honor? Or do you take me for a fool? You do, don't you? You take me for a fool. Yes, I see that now.

    \quad
    
    Sansa Stark: [I'm confused and scared by her accusations about my mother.] My mother?

    \quad
    
    Lysa Arryn: [The memories of Catelyn's closeness with Petyr resurface, intensifying my jealousy.] Yes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn. Don't you think to play the innocent with me, you vile little liar.

    \quad
    
    Sansa Stark: [I'm horrified by these accusations about my mother.] No. (She wants to shriek) My mother is dead. She was your own sister, and she's dead. She didn't. She wouldn't.

    \quad
    
    Lysa Arryn: [My rage is reaching its peak. I'll make her understand the depth of my pain and jealousy.] How would you know? Were you there? (She grabs Sansa and starts pushing her towards the Moon Door)

    \quad
    
    Sansa Stark: [Panic overwhelms me as I realize the danger I'm in.] Don't! You're scaring me!

    \quad
    
    Environment: The wind howls through the open Moon Door, creating a chilling atmosphere. Snow blows in, adding to the tension and danger of the situation.
