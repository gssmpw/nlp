    Cersei Lannister: [I must not show weakness. I am a lioness of Lannister.] (walks slowly, head held high) [The cold is biting, but I will not shiver. I will not give them the satisfaction.]

\quad 

Environment: The crowd grows larger and more hostile as Cersei continues her walk. Shouts and jeers can be heard from all sides.

\quad 

Crowd Member: [I'll show this proud queen what we think of her.] (shouts) Whore! Whore! WHORE!

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [I will not let their words affect me. I am above this.] (continues walking, ignoring the shouts) [I must focus on putting one foot in front of the other.]

\quad 

Environment: A chunk of dung narrowly misses Cersei's head, splattering on the ground nearby. The crowd roars with laughter.

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [I will not falter. I will not show fear.] (stumbles slightly, then regains composure) [I must keep walking. I must endure.]

\quad 

Septa Scolera: [I must support the queen.] (begins to sing) 'Shame, shame, shame.'

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [Their words mean nothing. I am Cersei Lannister, and I will survive this.] (walks faster, almost losing step with the septa's chanting) [I must not run. I will not give them the satisfaction.]

\quad 

Septa Scolera: [She's trying to escape the shame.] (quickens her pace) 'Shame, shame, shame.'

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [I can't keep up this pace. My feet are bleeding, my body is shaking.] (struggles to keep up with Septa Scolera) [I must not falter. I am a Lannister.]

\quad 

Septa Unella: [The queen must be made to suffer.] (pushes Cersei hard) Keep moving, sinner.

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [The pain in my shoulder. The jeers of the crowd. I can't...] (almost falls, but manages to stay upright) [No, I will not fall. I will survive this.]

\quad 

Septa Scolera: [We're almost done.] (continues chanting) 'Shame, shame, shame.'

\quad 

Cersei Lannister: [I can't take much more of this. But I must. For House Lannister. For my children.] (forces herself to keep walking) [I will endure. I will rise again.]
