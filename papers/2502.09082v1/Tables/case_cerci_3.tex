{\textbf{Simulation of \qquad GPT-4o}} &
    Cersei Lannister: (As Cersei, I continue the walk with my head held high, despite the jeers and taunts of the crowd.)

\quad

Septa Unella: "Confess."

\quad

Cersei Lannister: (I look ahead, ignoring Unella's words and the hateful stares.) "I am a lioness. You will see me rise again." [I endure this humiliation, aware that my strength will prevail in the end.]

\quad

Septa Unella: [She must learn humility before she can rise again.] 

(Septa Unella walks beside Cersei, unmoved by her defiance.)

"Confess your sins, Cersei Lannister. Only then will the gods grant you mercy."

\quad

Cersei Lannister: (I pause briefly, fixing Septa Unella with a steely gaze.) 

"The gods... and you, know nothing of true strength."

(Continuing forward, I focus on the path, reminding myself of my resilience.) [I refuse to let them see my weakness.]

\quad

Environment: The crowd's jeers grow louder as Cersei continues her walk. Filth and rotten vegetables are hurled at her, some striking their mark.

\quad

Crowd Member: [She was once so powerful, now look at her. Will she ever regain her power?]

"Shame! Shame on the lioness!"

(I shove my way to the front of the crowd, adding my voice to the jeers, feeling part of this momentous act.)

\quad

Cersei Lannister: (I flinch as the filth hits, but I refuse to look away or react.)

"You may shame a lioness today, but do not forget who I am."

(With each step, I remind myself of my children and my house, steeling my resolve.) [Their hatred fuels my determination.]

\quad

Septa Scolera: (I walk with measured steps, observing Cersei's struggle amid the crowd's hostility.)

"Humility cleanses the soul, Cersei Lannister. Embrace it."

[I understand the purpose of this punishment, yet the spectacle pains me. Redemption should lead, not humiliation.]

(Glancing at the crowd, I maintain my stoic presence, supporting Septa Unella's efforts.)

\quad

Cersei Lannister: (I give a bitter, fleeting smile, defiance burning in my eyes.) 

"Humility is a lesson the powerful teach to the weak."

(I continue my walk, refusing to let their words and disdain tarnish my pride.) [I will persevere, for I am still a Lannister, even in this moment of disgrace.]
