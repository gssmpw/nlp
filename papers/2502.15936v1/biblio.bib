abstract = {The Starlink network from SpaceX stands out as the only commercial LEO network with over 2M+ customers and more than 4000 operational satellites. In this paper, we conduct a first-of-its-kind extensive multi-faceted analysis of Starlink performance leveraging several measurement sources. First, based on 19.2M crowdsourced M-Lab speed tests from 34 countries since 2021, we analyze Starlink global performance relative to terrestrial cellular networks. Second, we examine Starlink's ability to support real-time latency and bandwidth-critical applications by analyzing the performance of (i) Zoom conferencing, and (ii) Luna cloud gaming, comparing it to 5G and fiber. Third, we perform measurements from Starlink-enabled RIPE Atlas probes to shed light on the last-mile access and other factors affecting its performance.Finally, we conduct controlled experiments from Starlink dishes in two countries and analyze the impact of globally synchronized "15-second reconfiguration intervals'' of the satellite links that cause substantial latency and throughput variations. Our unique analysis paints the most comprehensive picture of Starlink's global and last-mile performance to date.},

abstract = {Earth observation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites collect enormous amounts of data that needs to be transferred first to ground stations and then to the cloud, for storage and processing. Satellites today transmit data greedily to ground stations, with full utilization of bandwidth during each contact period. We show that due to the layout of ground stations and orbital characteristics, this approach overloads some ground stations and underloads others, leading to lost throughput and large end-to-end latency for images. We present a new end-to-end scheduler system called Umbra, which plans transfers from large satellite constellations through ground stations to the cloud, by accounting for both spatial and temporal factors, i.e., orbital dynamics, bandwidth constraints, and queue sizes. At the heart of Umbra is a new class of scheduling algorithms called withhold scheduling, wherein the sender (i.e., satellite) selectively under-utilizes some links to ground stations. We show that Umbra's counter-intuitive approach increases throughput by 13--31\% \& reduces P90 latency by 3--6 \texttimes{}.},

ABSTRACT = {With the evolution of fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G) communication systems, the utilization of spectrum resources faces incremental challenges. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, as a crucial element in 6G technology, is expected to enhance energy efficiency and spectrum utilization efficiency by integrating radar and communication signals, achieving environmental awareness, and enabling scene interconnection. Simultaneously, to realize the vision of seamless coverage in 6G, research on integrated satellite-terrestrial communication has been prioritized. To integrate the advantages, ISAC for integrated satellite–terrestrial networks (ISTNs) in 6G has emerged as a potential research direction. This paper offers an extensive overview of the present state of key technologies for ISAC and the development of ISTNs. Meanwhile, with a focus on the ISTN-oriented 6G ISAC system, several hotspot topics, including future application scenarios and key technological developments, are outlined and demonstrated.},

abstract = {Small satellites, or CubeSats, are envisioned as a promising solution for future satellite communication networks because of their low costs and short deployment cycle. Currently, CubeSats communicate at conventionally allocated satellite communication frequencies. However, with the increase in the number of CubeSats, CubeSat-enabled communication systems, and many new use cases, new spectrum bands and a more efficient spectrum usage are needed. In this paper, a novel CubeSat design with reconfigurable multi-band radios for communication in dynamic frequencies is proposed.The multi-band radio design is realized by two complementary approaches, namely, an electronics-based and a photonics-based approach. The multi-band communication covers a wide range from radio frequencies (2–30 GHz), millimeter wave (30–300 GHz), Terahertz band (up to 10 THz), and optical frequencies (with typical bands of 850 nm/350 THz, 1300 nm/230 THz, and 1550 nm/193 THz). A thorough link budget analysis is conducted to demonstrate the potential of the proposed multi-band architecture for space information networks. Key parameters in the satellite constellation design are investigated to explore the feasibility of deployment at different altitudes in the exosphere orbit (500 km and above). A continuous global coverage is demonstrated to serve the Internet of Space Things, a new paradigm for next generation satellite communication networks.}

ABSTRACT = {Neural networks (NNs) have proven their ability to deal with many computer vision tasks, including image-based remote sensing such as the identification and segmentation of hyperspectral images captured by satellites. Often, NNs run on a ground system upon receiving the data from the satellite. On the one hand, this approach introduces a considerable latency due to the time needed to transmit the satellite-borne images to the ground station. On the other hand, it allows the employment of computationally intensive NNs to analyze the received data. Low-budget missions, e.g., CubeSat missions, have computation capability and power consumption requirements that may prevent the deployment of complex NNs onboard satellites. These factors represent a limitation for applications that may benefit from a low-latency response, e.g., wildfire detection, oil spill identification, etc. To address this problem, in the last few years, some missions have started adopting NN accelerators to reduce the power consumption and the inference time of NNs deployed onboard satellites. Additionally, the harsh space environment, including radiation, poses significant challenges to the reliability and longevity of onboard hardware. In this review, we will show which hardware accelerators, both from industry and academia, have been found suitable for onboard NN acceleration and the main software techniques aimed at reducing the computational requirements of NNs when addressing low-power scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining popularity and market share, driven by its ability to connect devices and systems that were previously siloed, enabling new applications and services in a cost-efficient manner. Thus, the IoT fuels societal transformation and enables groundbreaking innovations like autonomous transport, robotic assistance, and remote healthcare solutions. However, when considering the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT), which refers to the expansion of IoT in remote and geographically isolated areas where neither terrestrial nor cellular networks are available, internet connectivity becomes a challenging issue. Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are increasingly gaining popularity as a solution to provide connectivity in remote areas due to the growing integration of satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with cellular networks. In this survey, we provide the technological framework for NTNs and Remote IoT, followed by a classification of the most recent scientific research on NTN-based IoRT systems. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in IoRT and identify emerging research areas with high potential. In conclusion, we present and discuss 3GPP’s roadmap for NTN standardization, which aims to establish an energy-efficient IoRT environment in the 6G era.},
