\begin{abstract}

\glspl{ntn} are essential for ubiquitous connectivity, providing coverage in remote and underserved areas. However, since \glspl{ntn} are currently operated independently, they face challenges such as isolation, limited scalability, and high operational costs. Integrating satellite constellations with terrestrial networks offers a way to address these limitations while enabling adaptive and cost-efficient connectivity through the application of \gls{ai} models.  

This paper introduces {\em Space-O-RAN}, a framework that extends Open \gls{ran} principles to \glspl{ntn}. It employs hierarchical closed-loop control with distributed \glspl{spaceric} to dynamically manage and optimize operations across both domains. To enable adaptive resource allocation and network orchestration, the proposed architecture integrates real-time satellite optimization and control with \gls{ai}-driven management and \gls{dt} modeling. It incorporates distributed \glspl{sapp} and distributed applications (\glspl{dapp}) to ensure robust performance in highly dynamic orbital environments. A core feature is dynamic link-interface mapping, which allows network functions to adapt to specific application requirements and changing link conditions using all physical links on the satellite.

Simulation results evaluate its feasibility by analyzing latency constraints across different \gls{ntn} link types, demonstrating that intra-cluster coordination operates within viable signaling delay bounds, while offloading non-real-time tasks to ground infrastructure enhances scalability toward \gls{6g} networks.

\section{Introduction}

%The growing demand for reliable, high-capacity, and globally accessible connectivity has positioned \glspl{ntn} as a critical component of next-generation communication systems. NTNs - including \glspl{leo}, \glspl{meo}, \glspl{geo}, \glspl{hap}, and deep-space platforms, extend connectivity toremote and underserved regions,  overcoming the inherent limitations of terrestrial infrastructure. Recent advancements in satellite constellations, exemplified by initiatives like SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper highlight the transformative potential of \glspl{ntn} in achieving global connectivity~\cite{abdelsadek2023future, cheng2022service}. These developments underscore the growing role of integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial architectures in future global communication systems.

The demand for high-capacity, globally available connectivity has positioned \glspl{ntn} as a key element of next-generation communication systems. These networks—including \glspl{leo}, \glspl{meo}, \glspl{geo}, \glspl{hap}, and deep-space platforms—extend coverage to remote regions, addressing the limitations of terrestrial infrastructure. Recent advancements in satellite constellations, such as Starlink by SpaceX and Project Kuiper by Amazon, illustrate their potential to improve connectivity worldwide~\cite{abdelsadek2023future, cheng2022service}. While terrestrial and  \glspl{ntn} are still managed separately, there is a growing trend toward their complementary use \cite{abdelsadek2023future}.

However, standalone and closed NTN systems face fundamental limitations due to their isolated operation, reliance on dedicated feeder link infrastructure, high operational costs, and constrained optimization capabilities. Integrating  NTNs with terrestrial networks operating in the same spectrum and interference domains can transform these systems from siloed architectures into unified, efficient, and resilient networks. This convergence enables adaptive resource management and enhanced scalability, making \glspl{ntn} better suited to address the complex demands of emerging 6G applications \cite{abdelsadek2023future, cheng2022service}.

Moreover, the integration introduces significant improvements in network resiliency and adaptability. Jointly managed networks could autonomously deploy \gls{ntn} backhaul cells in disaster recovery and ad hoc communication scenarios, ensuring uninterrupted service when terrestrial infrastructure is compromised. Dynamic traffic monitoring within terrestrial networks enables real-time load balancing, optimizing resource allocation across \gls{ntn} and terrestrial domains based on contextual demands. Hierarchical closed-loop control mechanisms can facilitate unified network management, improving spectrum efficiency, minimizing interference, and enabling seamless traffic offloading between orbital and terrestrial segments. Furthermore, integrated architectures can unlock advanced use cases, such as distributed computing frameworks spanning terrestrial and space domains. The unified management of all on-board radio links and user-plane resources enables the deployment of virtualized network functions and other computational workloads, dynamically adapting to traffic fluctuations and processing demands. 

Achieving cohesive coordination presents significant technical challenges because of differences in operational characteristics and resource constraints \cite{cheng2022service}. Unlike terrestrial systems, \glspl{ntn} operate in highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments. For example,  the continuous movement of \glspl{leo} satellites necessitates frequent handovers and real-time connectivity updates. These dynamics introduce time-varying latency, intermittent connectivity, and frequent \gls{los} disruption, impacting service continuity and network stability \cite{iqbal2023ai}. Additionally, onboard limitations in power, computational resources, and thermal management constrain the deployment of advanced optimization algorithms, emphasizing the need for efficient task offloading strategies \cite{ren2023review}. The absence of standardized coordination protocols between the orbital and terrestrial layers further exacerbates these challenges, leading to fragmented operations, inefficient resource allocation, and increased interference risks in shared or adjacent spectrum bands \cite{jia2020virtual}.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes {\bf Space-O-RAN}, a novel architectural framework for the integrated control and optimization of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Built on Open RAN principles, Space-O-RAN incorporates (i) programmability through software-based protocol stacks, (ii) open interfaces for seamless cross-domain coordination, and (iii) multi-scale hierarchical closed-loop control for cross-domain optimization and orchestration.

The Space-O-RAN architecture extends O-RAN controllers to satellite systems through distributed \glspl{spaceric}, addressing the unique characteristics of \glspl{ntn}. By leveraging standardized interfaces such as E2, O1, A1, and O2, it enables efficient coordination across heterogeneous environments. Customizable rApps, sApps, and dApps enable real-time network control and optimization, while flexible functional splits enhance computational and communication workload distribution. Additionally, a terrestrial \gls{dt} framework supports predictive optimization, resource management, and performance evaluation. The architecture's capabilities are validated through numerical analysis of latency domains, demonstrating its potential for adaptive, scalable, and efficient network integration.

The article is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} discusses related work on \glspl{ntn} integration. Section~\ref{sec:challenges} highlights the challenges for efficient integrated control and optimization and discusses specific use cases that underline the need for such integration. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} provides details of the proposed framework, emphasizing its hierarchical structure and adaptive control mechanisms. It also presents an evaluation of feasible control latency. Finally, \cref{sec:future,sec:conclusions} presents the future outlook and summarizes the conclusions.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

Existing integrated terrestrial-\gls{ntn} architectures, such as \gls{sagin}~\cite{cui2022architecture}, focus primarily on user-plane solutions and lack closed-loop control mechanisms. While \gls{sagin} envisions seamless \gls{ntn}-terrestrial integration, its practical implementation remains limited by dynamic link variability, intermittent connectivity, and latency constraints. These factors make efficient real-time control loops difficult to implement, particularly when relying on existing \gls{ai}-driven approaches, which struggle with inconsistent data availability and computational constraints.

The integration of \gls{ai} into \glspl{ntn} faces significant challenges. Limited onboard resources restrict the execution of complex learning algorithms, while intermittent satellite connectivity and long propagation delays disrupt data collection, model training, and inference processes. Current solutions often fail to address real-time resource allocation, adaptive control, and precise timing synchronization, leaving interoperability between orbital and terrestrial layers largely conceptual, with no standardized implementations for protocol or interface alignment \cite{10716597}.

Recent research on \gls{ntn}-terrestrial integration has identified key trade-offs in \gls{ran} architectures. Lower-layer functional splits reduce latency but impose strict timing constraints that are difficult to meet in high-latency \gls{ntn} environments. Centralized architectures, while easier to implement, introduce bandwidth inefficiencies over feeder links \cite{Muro2024}. Modular architectures that leverage standardized interfaces, such as near-RT and non-RT \glspl{ric}, show potential for adaptive resource management and real-time control. However, they remain constrained by scalability issues, high latency, and the complexity of ensuring seamless handovers between satellite clusters \cite{oranntn2025}. Addressing these limitations requires innovations that balance distributed decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and efficient multi-domain integration.

On the industry side, \gls{3gpp} has made significant progress in interoperability with \gls{ntn}. Release 17 introduced extensions to \gls{5g} \gls{nr} for direct-to-device satellite connectivity, while Release 18 builds on these enhancements with dynamic handovers and spectrum sharing.  ITU-T Y.3207 (2024) defines INCA for Fixed, Mobile, and Satellite Convergence (FMSC), proposing a centralized control framework, but its feasibility in dynamic \gls{ntn} environments remains uncertain due to latency, overhead, and computational constraints. These developments provide a foundation for integration, but remain insufficient without additional architectural enhancements to address specific constraints in \gls{ntn}, such as real-time coordination, cross-layer control, and resource-aware \gls{ai} processing.
%The lack of closed-loop control procedures remains a major limitation in state-of-the-art approaches like \gls{sagin}~\cite{cui2022architecture}, which provide only conceptual models for integrated architectures and focus primarily on user plane solutions. While \gls{sagin} frameworks envision seamless integration of terrestrial and \glspl{ntn}, their practical implementation is hindered by the dynamic nature of \gls{ntn} links, intermittent connectivity, and significant latency. These challenges complicate the design of stable and efficient control loops and are exacerbated by the limitations of existing \gls{ai}-driven approaches.

%The incorporation of \gls{ai} technologies into \glspl{ntn} faces significant hurdles, as limited satellite resources constrain the deployment of complex algorithms, while intermittent connectivity and long propagation delays disrupt data collection and training cycles. Moreover, current solutions frequently do not succeed in address critical operational requirements, including real-time resource allocation, adaptive control, and precise timing synchronization. Furthermore, interoperability between orbital and terrestrial layers remains largely conceptual, with no concrete implementations for protocol or interface alignment \cite{10716597}.

%Recent efforts to integrate \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial networks have highlighted critical trade-offs in \gls{ran} architectures. Lower-layer splits reduce latency, but face strict delay constraints that are difficult to meet in high-latency \gls{ntn} environments, while centralized approaches suffer from bandwidth inefficiencies over feeder links \cite{seeram2024feasibilitystudyfunctionsplits}. Modular architectures that leverage standardized interfaces like near-RT and non-RT \glspl{ric} show potential for adaptive resource management and real-time control, but are challenged by scalability, high latency, and seamless handovers \cite{oranntn2025}. Addressing these limitations requires innovations that balance distributed decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and efficient integration across network segments.

%On the industry side, \gls{3gpp} standardization has significantly advanced \gls{ntn} interoperability. Release 17 introduced extensions to \gls{5g} \gls{nr} for direct-to-cell connectivity, and Release 18 builds on these developments by incorporating dynamic handovers and spectrum sharing. These provide a solid foundation for the bridge between terrestrial and satellite networks, but remain insufficient without additional architectural enhancements to address NTN-specific constraints.

\section{Challenges and Use Cases}
\label{sec:challenges}

This section identifies the key challenges in integrating optimization and control for terrestrial and \glspl{ntn}, highlighting the technical and operational barriers to seamless coordination.

\textbf{Dynamic Topologies and Fragmented Control.} The constant mobility of \glspl{leo} and \glspl{meo} satellites necessitates frequent handovers and dynamic network reconfiguration. These conditions introduce time-varying latency, intermittent connectivity, and \gls{los} disruptions due to environmental factors and orbital motion. For example, \glspl{geo} experience round-trip delays exceeding 240 ms, while \glspl{isl} exhibit variable latencies depending on orbital alignment. Such dynamics demand mechanisms for localized adaptation to ensure service continuity while maintaining coherence with global directives \cite{ren2023review}. Section~\ref{sec:feasibility} further examines latency boundaries and their implications for real-time operations.

\textbf{Interoperability and Standardization.} The absence of unified protocols for coordinating terrestrial and satellite systems presents a significant barrier to seamless integration. While theoretical frameworks have proposed conceptual models, practical mechanisms for signaling, closed-loop control, and cross-domain communication are still in their early stages of development. The lack of standardized interfaces and synchronization protocols leads to operational fragmentation, complicating interoperability across a diverse supply chain \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing, jia2020virtual}.

\textbf{Spectrum Management and Coexistence.} The shared use of spectrum across terrestrial and \glspl{ntn} poses significant challenges for coexistence and interference mitigation. Feasibility studies for Ka, Ku, and S bands have demonstrated potential, but the real-time allocation of spectrum and mitigation of interference between constellations require sophisticated coordination strategies. The increasing number of constellations and the growing demand for bandwidth underscore the urgency of developing mechanisms to maximize spectral efficiency while avoiding service disruption~\cite{jamshed2024non}.

\textbf{Security and Operational Reliability.} The expanded attack surface introduced by the integration of terrestrial and satellite domains amplifies risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption. The intermittent connectivity of satellite links, combined with the multi-hop nature of \glspl{isl}, creates vulnerabilities that traditional security protocols cannot fully address. Additionally, the disparate operational dynamics of terrestrial and satellite systems increase the complexity of ensuring reliable performance under constantly changing conditions \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing}.

\textbf{Hardware and Computational Constraints.} Satellites operate under strict constraints in power, processing capacity, and thermal management. CubeSats, for instance, are equipped with processors like the ARM Cortex-M, delivering tens to hundreds of megaflops, while larger geostationary platforms employ more powerful processors like the RAD750, capable of up to 400 megaflops. Memory capacities vary from 512 MB to 16 GB, depending on the platform. These limitations restrict the execution of complex algorithms and necessitate offloading of computationally intensive tasks to terrestrial systems. However, intermittent and bandwidth-limited satellite-terrestrial links complicate this approach, particularly for latency-sensitive applications \cite{ren2023review, wang2023satellite}. Power availability further exacerbates these challenges, with budgets ranging from $5–20\:\mathrm{W}$ for CubeSats and up to 20 kW for larger satellites, fluctuating due to factors like solar orientation and eclipse phases. Advanced power management technologies, such as \gls{mppt} and scalable energy storage, alleviate some of these issues but require careful optimization to sustain operations efficiently.

\subsection{Use Cases}

The following examples highlight how addressing critical integration challenges will support advanced applications.


\textbf{Rural and Localized Networks.} Deploying localized networks in remote or underserved areas demands flexible resource allocation and low-latency communication. Standalone \glspl{ntn} often struggle to meet these requirements due to limited adaptability. Integrated architectures address these limitations by enabling terrestrial base stations to act as ground stations, efficiently managing spectrum and resources across both terrestrial and non-terrestrial areas, removing the reliance on specific feeder links.

In rural regions, where the deployment and maintenance of terrestrial infrastructure is prohibitively expensive, \glspl{ntn} can provide high-speed broadband backhaul to existing base stations. By serving multiple regions globally, \glspl{ntn} distribute deployment costs across a vast user base, significantly reducing the financial burden on local communities compared to establishing fixed terrestrial networks. During tactical operations, integrated systems can ensure seamless service delivery by prioritizing low-latency command-and-control communication via terrestrial nodes, while leveraging \glspl{ntn} for robust data aggregation and high-latency bulk transmission. This dual capability supports critical applications without relying on pre-existing terrestrial infrastructure.

\textbf{Autonomous Disaster Response.} In disaster scenarios where the terrestrial infrastructure is severely disrupted or destroyed, integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems can ensure the continuity of communication. Using \glspl{isl} for backhaul and dynamic routing of traffic through unaffected terrestrial nodes, these systems enable real-time situational awareness, emergency coordination, and remote command-and-control. For example, a satellite-enabled backhaul can restore connectivity by dynamically allocating bandwidth to the affected region while prioritizing critical traffic, such as video feeds for search-and-rescue operations. Additionally, real-time telemetry from \glspl{ntn} enhances decision-making by complementing terrestrial sensing capabilities.


\textbf{Ubiquitous AI-Driven Applications.} Satellites provide unmatched global coverage for data collection, but face significant limitations in on-board storage, processing power, and energy efficiency, making local \gls{ai} inference impractical \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing, oranntn2025}. Integrated systems overcome these challenges by offloading data pre-processing, model training, and resource-intensive inference to terrestrial cloud or edge infrastructure. Federated AI would allow the use of terrestrial resources for distributed model training while leveraging \glspl{ntn} for global data collection. This approach would improve system-wide efficiency, reduce latency, and support scalable deployment of \gls{ai}-driven ubiquitous applications, such as autonomous navigation, predictive maintenance, and real-time analytics in remote or resource-constrained environments.


\section{Proposed Solution: Space-O-RAN}
\label{sec:architecture}


%Explain the constellation and why is it relevant here for the architecture

The Space-O-RAN architecture integrates terrestrial and \glspl{ntn}, addressing key challenges such as {\em dynamic connectivity, resource constraints, and scalability}. By applying open \gls{ran} principles and standardized interfaces, the architecture ensures seamless interaction between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments.

To efficiently manage satellite operations within a large constellation, we adopt a clustering approach~\cite{clustering}. Satellites are grouped based on orbital proximity, reducing system-wide signaling overhead and enabling localized decision-making. Instead of requiring continuous coordination across the entire constellation, each cluster autonomously optimizes its resources while maintaining alignment with broader network objectives. This decentralized approach enhances adaptability to dynamic topology changes and intermittent connectivity.

The architecture consists of two main domains: space-based and ground-based components (see \cref{fig:oran_space_arch}). The onboard AI-enabled edge network, optimized for resource-constrained environments, hosts modular network elements such as \glspl{sdu} and \glspl{scu}. At the core of this system is the \gls{spaceric}, a near-real-time \gls{ric} responsible for cluster-wide coordination and real-time adaptation. Unlike dApps, which directly interact with individual RAN functions, the \gls{spaceric} orchestrates intra-cluster decision-making, managing inter-satellite handovers, spectrum allocation, and resource scheduling while ensuring alignment with terrestrial directives. \glspl{sapp} operate within the \gls{spaceric}, functioning similarly to terrestrial \glspl{xapp} but designed for execution in orbit within a coordinated cluster.

Real-time connectivity is maintained by \glspl{sru}, each managing a dedicated link for \glspl{isl}, \glspl{fl}/\glspl{gsl}, and \glspl{sl}, ensuring cohesive communication with terrestrial systems and end-users. These links facilitate efficient task execution across network layers, minimizing latency in inter-satellite coordination and user-plane operations.

On the ground, the Terrestrial Cloud and \gls{smo} oversee long-term strategic operations, including \gls{ai} model training and \gls{dt} modeling for predictive optimization. Standardized O-RAN interfaces such as \gls{a1} and \gls{o1} enable closed-loop communication, integrating satellite telemetry to refine global policies and ensure continuous adaptation.

A functional split ensures efficient task allocation between the space and ground domains. Real-time tasks, such as beamforming, resource scheduling, and spectrum management, are handled at the satellite and cluster levels, making use of lower-latency \glspl{isl} for coordinated decision-making. \glspl{dapp} complement \glspl{sapp} and \glspl{rapp}, enabling dynamic control adjustments. Meanwhile, computationally intensive processes, including AI model training, telemetry aggregation, and long-term optimization, are offloaded to terrestrial cloud infrastructure via \glspl{gsl}, ensuring scalability without compromising real-time responsiveness.%Clustering neighboring satellites in overlapping orbital planes reduces system-wide coordination overhead, enabling localized optimization and efficient resource reuse. Each cluster operates under a leader-follower model, where a designated leader satellite dynamically manages intra-cluster tasks such as inter-satellite handovers, spectrum allocation, and resource scheduling, while ensuring alignment with global network directives. "

%XXX Two questions to address here. What is a cluster, and why do we need a Space RIC? Isn't it the same as dApps - applications interacting directly with RAN Nodes? What's fundamentally different? XXX


\subsection{Control Knobs and Optimization Surface.}
The architecture defines three hierarchical control levels, each operating on different timescales to address the complex demands of integrated terrestrial and \glspl{ntn}. The \textbf{strategic level}, supported by \gls{dt} and \gls{ai} large-scale models in the terrestrial cloud, gathers and processes data such as cluster-specific or satellite-level \glspl{kpi}. This level focuses on monitoring and optimizing the overall performance of the constellation in terms of coverage, energy efficiency, capacity utilization, resilience, and service life.

The \textbf{coordination level} manages resource allocation among satellite clusters, optimizing efficiency based on traffic conditions and the state of \gls{ai} pipelines. While this level operates on the on-board edge, it communicates with a cloud-based orchestrator to align with global objectives. However, it retains the ability to function autonomously in scenarios requiring localized decision-making.

At the \textbf{operational} level, control occurs at the individual satellite scale, where radio parameters and physical links are dynamically adjusted in real-time to respond to user demands and environmental variations. This ensures a seamless adaptation to traffic fluctuations, enhancing network responsiveness and overall efficiency.

The \textbf{optimization surface}  unifies these control layers, ensuring that all levels of the hierarchy dynamically adjust to maintain optimal balance between latency, throughput, energy consumption and spectral efficiency. 

\subsection{Feasibility Bounds}
\label{sec:feasibility}

The feasibility of Space-O-RAN is evaluated by examining the latency characteristics of \glspl{ntn} and their implications for the hierarchical control framework. Simulations of the Starlink constellation, comprising 6545 satellites and 33 ground gateways, provide latency insights critical for aligning real-time and non real-time operations. 

Due to the Starlink constellation design and density, each satellite has a consistent number of available \glspl{isl} below 10~ms delays (\cref{fig:isl_latency}), offering a reliable foundation for real-time tasks. %In contrast, due to the \gls{leo} satellite rapid motion, \glspl{gsl} exhibit higher and more variable delays (\cref{fig:g2s_latency}), making them suitable for non-time-critical operations.
Conversely, due to the \gls{leo} satellite rapid motion, the \glspl{gsl} delay exceeds 10 ms for 
% ranges from 10 to over 40 ms 
80\% of the possible elevation angles (\cref{fig:g2s_latency}).
% depending on satellite elevation. 
More of half of the satellites visible from the ground experience a propagation delay above 40~ms, which limits their suitability for real-time operations but makes them viable for strategic, non-critical tasks like policy updates and long-term resource allocation.

This latency stratification aligns with the functional split strategy, as previously described. Real-time, latency-sensitive decisions are localized to the operational and coordination levels, using \glspl{isl} for immediate adjustments and intra-cluster communication. Computationally intensive tasks, which can tolerate higher delays, are offloaded to the terrestrial cloud via \glspl{gsl}, ensuring efficient utilization of satellite and terrestrial resources.

The analysis also highlights critical trade-offs in the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Meanwhile reducing on-board processing delays can improve responsiveness, it places greater reliance on \glspl{isl} for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication. Conversely, centralized cloud-based processing risks overloading \glspl{gsl}, reducing spectral efficiency and introducing bottlenecks. The proposed hybrid approach mitigates these trade-offs by combining localized real-time decision-making at the cluster level with scalable computational resources in the terrestrial cloud.

%The \gls{spaceric} centrally coordinates the satellite cluster, housing satellite-specific \glspl{xapp} and \glspl{sapp} for near-real-time tasks like interference detection and management, and aiding constellation operations.

Unlike terrestrial \glspl{ric}, which rely on stable infrastructure, \gls{spaceric} is designed for decentralized control, enabling satellites to adapt dynamically to topology changes, intermittent connectivity, and constrained computational resources.

Each satellite runs an instance of \gls{spaceric}, but coordination follows a Leader-Follower model to optimize system-wide efficiency. The Leader interfaces with terrestrial non-RT \gls{ric}, receiving policies via \gls{a1} and \gls{o1}, processing real-time telemetry from \gls{e2}, and issuing intra-cluster control commands. It dynamically manages inter-satellite handovers, spectrum allocation, and resource scheduling, ensuring local adaptations align with global directives.

Followers execute Leader's control decisions via \glspl{dapp}, handling near-real-time tasks such as beam adjustments, modulation selection, and power control. To enhance resilience, all satellites maintain active but passive Coord \gls{sapp}, continuously synchronizing state information. If the Leader fails or loses connectivity, the \gls{fede2} protocol triggers an autonomous re-election, selecting the most suitable Follower based on link stability, computational capacity, and telemetry quality. Since Followers remain pre-synchronized, the transition occurs seamlessly with minimal service disruption.

\glspl{sapp} in \gls{spaceric} optimize cluster-wide decision making similar to terrestrial \glspl{xapp}, but are designed for in-orbit execution. These applications operate in a fully distributed manner, synchronizing state updates via inter-satellite links (\glspl{isl}) to prevent conflicts in resource allocation. The Leader enables these processes while avoiding a single point of failure, maintaining distributed control if it becomes unavailable until a new election occurs.

When a satellite detects degrading link conditions or prepares to leave the range of a cluster, the Leader synchronizes the beam parameters, link telemetry, and \gls{ai} model states with the next cluster, ensuring a seamless transition with minimal latency.

%The Space-RIC is a software-defined, distributed control system that extends the O-RAN RIC framework to satellite clusters, adapting it to the dynamic topology, constrained resources, and intermittent connectivity of space networks. Unlike terrestrial RICs, which rely on stable, high-bandwidth infrastructure, Space-RIC is designed for decentralized operation, enabling autonomous decision-making within satellite clusters while maintaining global coordination with terrestrial controllers.

%Each satellite runs an instance of the Space-RIC, but cluster-level coordination is handled by a dynamically elected Leader, which interfaces with the terrestrial non-RT RIC to align local operations with global directives. The Leader receives policies via A1 and O1 interfaces, processes real-time telemetry from E2, and distributes intra-cluster control commands. This ensures that all satellites within a cluster operate cohesively, adapting to traffic variations, link conditions, and resource constraints in near real-time. The Leader role is not static; it is assigned based on link stability, computational availability, and telemetry quality. In the event of failure or prolonged loss of connectivity, the FedE2 protocol triggers an autonomous re-election among the remaining satellites. Each satellite maintains a passive but synchronized control state, ensuring that leadership transitions occur seamlessly without service disruption.

%Space-RIC executes sApps, which are specifically designed for space-based O-RAN control, optimizing functions such as adaptive beamforming, dynamic spectrum reallocation, and power-aware scheduling. Unlike conventional terrestrial xApps, these applications are fully distributed, running across multiple satellites within a cluster and synchronized through the Leader. Each sApp instance processes local telemetry and periodically exchanges state information with its cluster peers via inter-satellite links. This ensures that updates such as beam adjustments and scheduling decisions are made with cluster-wide awareness, avoiding conflicts and maintaining stability. The Leader coordinates these processes but does not act as a central point of failure; if it goes offline, the remaining satellites continue executing distributed control autonomously until a new Leader is elected.

%When a satellite detects degrading service link conditions or prepares to exit a cluster’s operational boundary, the Leader initiates a predictive handover by synchronizing beam parameters, link telemetry, and AI model states with the next cluster. This ensures continuity with minimal latency, as the receiving satellite can immediately apply pre-computed adjustments upon taking over service responsibilities.



\subsection{Dynamic Link-Interface Mapping}
\label{subsec:link_mapping}

Dynamic link-interface mapping is a cornerstone of the architecture, addressing challenges in spectrum management and resource prioritization by enabling the adaptive assignment of O-RAN interfaces to specific link roles based on real-time network conditions. This flexibility is critical in the On-Board Compute-AI-Network Edge, where varying connectivity needs and diverse application demands require seamless coordination across network layers.

The system maps multiple O-RAN interfaces to a single physical link to support concurrent signaling and user-plane traffic. For example, an \gls{isl} can manage both the \gls{e2} interface for inter-satellite coordination within the \gls{spaceric} and the F1 interface for communication between the \gls{scu} and the \gls{sdu}, ensuring operational continuity across distributed satellite clusters. Similarly, \glspl{fl} and \glspl{sl} are dynamically allocated to prioritize critical services, such as emergency response or high-priority \gls{iot} traffic, using low-latency links like \glspl{isl}. Conversely, non-critical bulk data is routed through higher-latency paths, preserving premium resources for time-sensitive operations.

%This mapping strategy enhances spectral efficiency and resource utilization, seamlessly adapting to evolving network demands while ensuring that critical applications maintain priority. 
Table~\ref{tab:interface_mapping_flexibility} highlights the dynamical allocation capabilities, illustrating the optimized use of available links for balanced performance across the network.


% \subsection{Propagation Delay and Real-Time Control}

% Efficient management of propagation delay is fundamental for enabling real-time operations in \glspl{ntn}. \glspl{leo} constellations face frequent handovers and dynamic connectivity, which requires the use of low latency \glspl{isl} to ensure that delays remain below 50ms, as demonstrated in Fig.\ref{fig:isl_latency}. These links serve as the backbone for latency-sensitive tasks by leveraging the \gls{e2} interface for real-time signaling and satellite coordination.

% The results, depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:g2s_latency}, reveal that \glspl{isl} achieve consistent sub-10ms delays, enabling time-critical tasks such as adaptive beamforming, interference mitigation, and high priority traffic management. In contrast, \glspl{gsl} exhibit variable delays ranging from 10ms to over 40ms based on satellite elevation. These characteristics are taken advantage of the architecture's functional split strategies: \glspl{isl} are prioritized for real-time intra-cluster operations that require low latency, while \glspl{gsl} are reserved for non-critical tasks such as policy updates, model synchronization, and bulk data transfers to the terrestrial cloud. By integrating telemetry from distributed satellites and directives from the coordination level, \gls{spaceric} dynamically orchestrates operations through \glspl{sapp} and \glspl{dapp}. Parameters such as beam patterns are fine-tuned in real time, informed by on-board \gls{ai} inference models and closed-loop feedback mechanisms. These adjustments ensure that delay-sensitive operations align with global network objectives while adapting to localized conditions.

\subsection{AI Pipelines and Digital Twin}
The architecture integrates tailored \gls{ai} pipelines and \glspl{dt} to enhance adaptability and decision-making across terrestrial and non-terrestrial domains. Satellites locally preprocess telemetry data, including \glspl{kpi} such as latency and throughput, to reduce bandwidth demands before transmitting them to the terrestrial cloud.

The terrestrial cloud hosts \glspl{dt}, which simulate network states and inform global policy optimization. Federated learning enables distributed model updates, leveraging localized telemetry to refine global models while maintaining consistency across the constellation. Trained models are disseminated hierarchically to cluster leaders, which adapt and coordinate updates within their clusters based on real-time telemetry and localized needs. Retraining and iterative refinement occur through standardized feedback loops ensuring models remain effective under dynamic conditions. Real-time applications, such as adaptive beamforming, leverage these models onboard satellites, while computationally intensive processes are handled in the cloud. 


\subsection{Security and Interoperability}


The framework incorporates advanced security mechanisms to address threats associated with the integration of terrestrial and \gls{ntn} networks. While quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols represent a forward-looking approach, their feasibility in resource-constrained satellite environments remains subject to further evaluation. In the interim, lightweight encryption mechanisms secure \gls{isl} and \gls{gsl} communication, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Multi-factor authentication restricts unauthorized satellites from assuming critical roles such as cluster leadership, while the \gls{fede2} protocol enforces cryptographic safeguards to prevent unauthorized leader elections and preserve cluster coordination integrity.

Ephemeral key generation enhances security for transient data exchanges during link disruptions, mitigating risks of interception and replay attacks. Session-based authentication, combined with temporary token caching, enables rapid reestablishment of secure links during satellite handovers, reducing authentication latency while maintaining network resilience. Preauthentication mechanisms further optimize link reliability in dynamic environments, while automated token rotation and expiration policies mitigate credential compromise risks. Standardized O-RAN interfaces ensure secure interoperability, supporting scalable and resilient NTN-TN integration.


\section{Future Outlook}
\label{sec:future}

%Future integrated networks must address the challenges of scalability and autonomy posed by dynamic and resource-constrained environments. Autonomous self-healing and decentralized resource coordination will be critical for \glspl{ntn}, particularly for deep-space and extraterrestrial missions. Protocols such as \gls{hdtn} and the Bundle Protocol \cite{dudukovich2024advances} can mitigate latency and connectivity disruptions in these scenarios, enabling reliable operations independent of Earth-based communication. Advances in \gls{ai} and \gls{ml}, including distributed inference, federated learning, and model compression, will optimize satellite operations by reducing bandwidth and computational overhead. 

%As constellations expand, modular design principles are essential for the scalability and integration of planetary exploration nodes. This flexibility could enable applications like autonomous scientific research or precise space environmental monitoring. Integrated communication and sensing capabilities should simplify data processing by shifting resource-heavy tasks to ground centers. Additionally, using the THz spectrum for \glspl{isl} and terrestrial links \cite{alqaraghuli2023road} offers promise for ultra-high-throughput communication but faces challenges such as atmospheric attenuation. Dynamic spectrum management mechanisms within the proposed framework can address these by switching between THz and robust bands (e.g., Ka or Ku) based on real-time conditions. Addressing satellite power and processing limitations, improving network layer synchronization, and advancing standardization are crucial next steps for efficient and reliable systems.

Beyond planetary exploration, satellite-to-satellite services are expected to play a critical role in future space-based infrastructure. Applications such as in-orbit data relay, autonomous servicing, coordinated sensing, and distributed space computing will require high-throughput, low-latency interconnectivity. These capabilities will be particularly relevant for private space stations, orbital research facilities, and future space-based industrial operations, where seamless integration will be necessary to support real-time control and high-volume data exchanges.

Expanding \gls{ntn} will require \glspl{isl} with ultra-high capacity and adaptive spectrum management to support scalable and reliable communication. While the THz spectrum presents challenges such as atmospheric attenuation and hardware constraints, ongoing research is steadily addressing these limitations, making its integration into future \glspl{ntn} increasingly feasible \cite{alqaraghuli2023road}.
