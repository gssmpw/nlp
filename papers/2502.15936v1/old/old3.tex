\begin{abstract}

Despite significant advancements in \glspl{ntn}, their integration with terrestrial networks remains challenging due to decentralized architectures, fragmented control mechanisms, and the absence of standardized management interfaces. These limitations hinder effective coordination between the terrestrial and orbital domains, leading to operational inefficiencies and discontinuities. This paper proposes the O-RAN-in-Space architecture, a hierarchical and distributed framework for unifying terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems. At its core, the \gls{spaceric} enables constellation-wide coordination by integrating terrestrial \gls{ai}-driven systems and \gls{dt} with real-time satellite operations. The framework incorporates distributed \glspl{sapp} and \glspl{dapp} to implement adaptive control loops, ensuring robust performance under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions. A dynamic link-interface mapping strategy further enhances flexibility, aligning network functions with application-specific requirements even during intermittent connectivity. Simulation results validate the frameworkâ€™s feasibility, demonstrating compliance with signaling delay requirements and its potential to support efficient and resilient global connectivity management for \gls{6g} networks.

\section{Introduction}

The growing demand for reliable, high-capacity, and globally accessible connectivity has established \glspl{ntn} as a critical component of future communication systems. These networks, encompassing \glspl{leo}, \glspl{meo}, \glspl{geo}, \glspl{hap}, and deep-space platforms, extend connectivity to underserved and remote areas by overcoming the inherent limitations of terrestrial infrastructure. Initiatives like SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project Kuiper illustrate the potential of satellite constellations to address global connectivity challenges. However, achieving cohesive integration between terrestrial networks and \glspl{ntn} remains a significant technical challenge due to disparities in their operational characteristics and resource constraints \cite{cheng2022service}.

Unlike terrestrial systems, \glspl{ntn} operate in dynamic and resource-constrained environments. In particular, the movement of \glspl{leo} satellites necessitates frequent handovers and continuous updates to connectivity management systems, introducing time-varying latency, intermittent connectivity, and frequent loss of \gls{los}. These conditions disrupt service continuity and strain network stability \cite{iqbal2023ai, pugliese2024iab}. Furthermore, the limitations in power, computational capacity, and thermal management of satellite platforms restrict the deployment of complex resource optimization algorithms, highlighting the need for efficient offload strategies \cite{ren2023review}. The lack of standardized protocols for coordinating orbital and terrestrial layers exacerbates these issues, leading to fragmented operations, inefficient resource utilization, and interference risks in shared or adjacent spectrum bands \cite{jia2020virtual, xu2018software}.

Unlocking the full potential of integrated networks requires addressing these challenges. \Glspl{ntn} excel in providing global coverage and resilience, while terrestrial systems deliver high-throughput, low-latency performance. The integration of both can facilitate applications requiring uninterrupted connectivity in various environments. For example, autonomous vehicles in remote areas could utilize satellite links for essential communication and navigation, transitioning to terrestrial networks in urban areas for low-latency decision-making. Similarly, coordinated resource allocation across terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems could reduce operational costs while maintaining consistent service quality in high-demand or infrastructure-limited regions. These scenarios emphasize the need for a unified framework to optimize resources, ensure interoperability, and meet the evolving requirements of \gls{6g} \cite{abdelsadek2023future, cheng2022service}.

This paper proposes the O-RAN-in-Space framework, a novel architecture grounded in Open \gls{ran} principles. By employing distributed \glspl{spaceric}, the framework introduces hierarchical closed-loop control to adapt to dynamic space conditions in real time. Standardized interfaces such as E2 and A1 enable efficient coordination across heterogeneous environments, while flexible functional splits optimize the distribution of computational and communication workloads. These capabilities are further enhanced through \glspl{xapp}, \glspl{dapp}, and \gls{dt} frameworks, enabling robust resource optimization, predictive maintenance, and comprehensive performance evaluation, bridging theoretical advancements with practical implementations.


The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} discusses the architectural foundations and challenges of \glspl{ntn} integration. Section~\ref{sec:challenges} highlights specific use cases that underline the need for such integration. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} details the proposed framework, emphasizing its hierarchical structure and adaptive control mechanisms. Finally, \cref{sec:future,sec:conclusions} presents the future outlook and summarizes the conclusions.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

The absence of closed-loop control procedures remains a major limitation in state-of-the-art approaches like \gls{sagin}, which provide only conceptual models for integrated architectures. These frameworks lack practical mechanisms for the real-time management of integrated orbital and \gls{tn} segments. For example, they do not adequately address the feasibility of deploying \gls{ai} driven mechanisms critical to managing the dynamic conditions of \glspl{leo}, nor incorporate adaptive strategies for spectrum sharing and congestion avoidance, which are essential in highly dynamic environments of \glspl{ntn} \cite{iqbal2023ai, cheng2022service}. The fragmented approach to integration results in suboptimal coordination and unresolved coexistence challenges, further limiting operational efficiency. Furthermore, interoperability between orbital and terrestrial layers remains largely conceptual, with no concrete implementations for protocol or interface alignment \cite{10716597}.

Recent efforts to integrate \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial networks have highlighted critical trade-offs in RAN architectures. Lower-layer splits reduce latency, but face strict delay constraints that are difficult to meet in high-latency NTN environments, while centralized approaches suffer from bandwidth inefficiencies over feeder links \cite{seeram2024feasibilitystudyfunctionsplits}. Modular architectures that leverage standardized interfaces like near-RT and non-RT \glspl{ric} show potential for adaptive resource management and real-time control, but are challenged by scalability, high latency, and seamless handovers \cite{oranntn2025}. Addressing these limitations requires innovations that balance distributed decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and efficient integration across network segments.

\gls{3gpp} standardization efforts have also contributed to developments in \gls{ntn} interoperability. Release 17 introduced extensions to \gls{5g} \gls{nr} for direct-to-cell connectivity, while Release 18 expands these capabilities with dynamic handovers and spectrum sharing. These provide a solid foundation for the bridge between terrestrial and satellite networks, but remain insufficient without additional architectural enhancements to address NTN-specific constraints.



\section{Challenges and Use Cases}
\label{sec:challenges}

The primary challenges arise from the distributed nature of \glspl{ntn}, their mobility, resource limitations, and the critical need for efficient and resilient network management.

\subsection{Challenges}

The primary challenges arise from the distributed topology of \glspl{ntn}, their inherently mobile and resource-constrained nature, and the need for efficient spectrum utilization. These factors create significant barriers to achieving seamless interoperability and resource optimization in highly dynamic and restrictive environments.

\textbf{Dynamic Topologies and Fragmented Control} 
\glspl{leo} and \glspl{meo} satellites operate in constantly evolving environments, where rapid movement, frequent handovers, and intermittent connectivity introduce variability in latency, channel fading, and loss of \gls{los} for \glspl{isl} and \glspl{fl}. These disruptions complicate the maintenance of consistent service quality. Additionally, the decentralized nature of satellite constellations poses challenges for coordination, as local decision-making at the satellite level can diverge from overarching \gls{tn} policies, resulting in inefficient resource allocation and reduced overall performance \cite{ren2023review}.

\textbf{Interoperability and Standardization Gaps} 
The lack of unified protocols to coordinate the orbital and terrestrial layers limits seamless integration. Frequent handovers between satellites and ground stations require synchronized control mechanisms that existing frameworks like \gls{sagin} do not provide. This lack of standardization hinders efficient resource allocation, introduces latency spikes, and amplifies operational inefficiencies \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing, jia2020virtual}. In addition, protocol misalignments exacerbate challenges in achieving secure, reliable, and scalable data exchanges.

\textbf{Spectrum Management and Coexistence.} 
The coexistence of terrestrial and \gls{ntn} systems in shared or adjacent spectrum bands, such as Ka, Ku and S, introduces interference risks that must be mitigated through dynamic spectrum allocation strategies. Efficient spectrum sharing is essential to improve interoperability and avoid degradation of spectral efficiency, particularly in high-density or resource-constrained environments \cite{beyaz2024satellite}.

\textbf{Security and Operational Reliability}  An integrated operation of \glspl{ntn} introduces significant security challenges, including risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and signal interference. The intermittent and dynamic nature of constellations complicates the application of traditional security measures, which are often not suited to the latency and resource constraints of these environments. Moreover, the lack of unified protocols for authentication and control creates gaps in coordination, demanding decentralized and adaptive security mechanisms capable of ensuring robust and reliable communication under these conditions \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing}.

    \caption{The proposed framework coordinates on board Space-RIC (with s-Apps) with terrestrial SMO via flexible link mapping}
    \label{fig:oran_space_arch}
\end{figure*}


\textbf{Hardware and Computational Constraints.} 
Satellites face constraints in power availability, computational resources, and thermal management capabilities, which restrict the deployment of advanced algorithms and resource optimization mechanisms. Although task offloading to terrestrial systems offers a potential solution, it is heavily dependent on limited satellite-terrestrial links, creating potential bottlenecks. Effective integration requires architectures that balance computation on board with distributed processing to maintain operational stability \cite{ren2023review, wang2023satellite}.


\subsection{Use Cases}

Although standalone systems can address isolated scenarios, they fall short in resilience, efficiency, and adaptability when faced with dynamic or large-scale challenges. 

\textbf{Autonomous Disaster Response}  

In disaster scenarios, where terrestrial infrastructure is disrupted or unavailable, a combined architecture that uses \glspl{ntn} and \glspl{tn} could ensure uninterrupted connectivity. By dynamically rerouting traffic through \glspl{isl} or terrestrial backhaul pathways, the system would enable continuous communication for critical services such as live situational awareness and remote command-and-control operations. The ability to adapt routing strategies in real time would enhance resilience, using satellites for broad coverage and terrestrial nodes for localized backup, a synergy that is unattainable with actual standalone systems.

\textbf{Private, On-Demand Localized Networks}

The deployment of temporary private networks tailored to specific geographic areas and timeframes could become feasible through this hybrid approach. These networks might support large-scale events, emergency responses, or isolated industrial operations. Satellite edge computing could process localized data, providing secure communication channels for tasks such as environmental sensing and real-time monitoring. Dynamic resource allocation would ensure optimal performance by handling latency-sensitive applications via terrestrial layers, while satellites manage broader, less time-critical tasks. This flexibility, coupled with precise \gls{qos} management, minimizes inefficiencies and enables cost-effective resource utilization.

\textbf{Ubiquitous AI-Driven Applications}

A tightly coupled system combining the global reach of \glspl{ntn} with the computational resources of terrestrial infrastructure could revolutionize \gls{ai}-driven network management. Satellites could aggregate data from remote and inaccessible regions, performing preliminary processing or sensing tasks in real-time, while terrestrial systems execute computationally intensive processes such as model training for predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and resource optimization. This architecture enables efficient data distribution, reducing bandwidth consumption and improving responsiveness for applications that require rapid adaptation to dynamic environments. In the context of deep-space exploration, federated \gls{ai} architectures could enable collaborative data processing across satellites and spacecraft, reducing reliance on Earth-based systems and mitigating latency challenges. Tasks such as autonomous navigation, adaptive system maintenance, and large-scale scientific data analysis could be intelligently distributed between spaceborne and terrestrial nodes, ensuring resilience and operational efficiency in resource-constrained environments.


\section{Proposed Solution: O-RAN-in-space}
\label{sec:architecture}



The O-RAN-in-Space architecture (\cref{fig:oran_space_arch}) is designed to address the key challenges in integrating \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial O-RAN-supported systems, focusing on a layered control framework that bridges terrestrial cloud infrastructure and satellite-based edge computing. By implementing a hierarchical closed-loop control structure, this framework enables dynamic resource allocation and task distribution across Earth and orbital segments, ensuring operational efficiency under dynamic conditions while reducing dependence on continuous ground connectivity.

\subsection{Feasibility Bounds}

The feasibility analysis establishes the operational constraints that guide the design of the O-RAN-in-Space architecture, addressing challenges in signaling delay, resource management, and dynamic coordination under the unique conditions of \glspl{ntn}. By characterizing delay distributions and resource availability, the proposed framework ensures robust and scalable performance.

Simulations of the Starlink constellation (6545 satellites, 33 ground gateways) provide critical insights into achievable latency bounds. \glspl{isl} demonstrate consistent sub-10~ms delays (\cref{fig:isl_latency}), offering a reliable foundation for real-time tasks. In contrast, \glspl{gsl} exhibit higher and more variable delays (\cref{fig:g2s_latency}), making them suitable for non-time-critical operations. These latency characteristics motivate the layered control approach in O-RAN-in-Space, where \glspl{isl} are prioritized for real-time coordination, while \glspl{gsl} are reserved for strategic, non-critical directives.

The feasibility of deploying RAN architectures in \glspl{ntn} has highlighted critical trade-offs between latency, bandwidth, and computational efficiency. Studies on function splits reveal that lower-layer splits, while minimizing latency, are often constrained by the propagation delays of \glspl{gsl}. Centralized architectures, on the other hand, can overload feeder links with signaling traffic, reducing bandwidth efficiency. These constraints reinforce the need for a hybrid approach. The hierarchical clustering localizes real-time decision-making within satellite clusters using SpaceRICs, while computationally intensive and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to terrestrial clouds, ensuring efficient resource allocation and reduced latency bottlenecks. 

Static spectrum allocation further complicates traditional satellite systems, particularly under fluctuating traffic conditions. O-RAN-in-Space addresses this limitation through adaptive spectrum assignment, continuously optimized by closed-loop feedback mechanisms. This strategy ensures dynamic resource reallocation, preventing fragmentation, and maintaining high network performance, even during peak traffic scenarios. The distributed control framework of the system also mitigates disruptions due to mobility and connectivity losses, enabling cohesive and reliable operations throughout the constellation.

\end{table*}



\subsection{Core Components}

The architecture leverages both terrestrial and satellite-based components to ensure optimal performance, balancing real-time responsiveness and resource efficiency.

\textbf{Terrestrial Cloud.}

The terrestrial cloud, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:oran_space_arch}, manages high-level network functions, including long-term network planning, \gls{dt} modeling, and policy optimization. The vast computational resources in the cloud support non real-time processes such as training \gls{ml} models and performing large-scale data analytics. By offloading computationally intensive tasks to the terrestrial cloud, the satellite network can focus on maintaining real-time operations while minimizing energy consumption. Strategic directives generated in the cloud are transmitted to the satellite network through ground-to-satellite links with higher delay. These links, which make up the majority of available connections (\cref{fig:g2s_latency}), align with latency constraints. Approximately 300 ISLs maintain sub-10~ms latency, ensuring efficient real-time communication, while 450 ISLs show latency below 100~ms, supporting non-time-critical operations. The terrestrial cloud thus acts as the central coordination layer, ensuring cohesive operation even under dynamic network conditions.




\textbf{On-Board Edge.}

Onboard hardware resources, including \glspl{cpu}, \glspl{gpu}, and memory, are managed by an advanced \gls{os} middleware. This middleware dynamically allocates resources to meet current demands and, when combined with a virtualization layer, facilitates the deployment of multiple network functions. This setup improves adaptability and ensures that the network responds efficiently to varying traffic and service requirements. By combining these elements, the on-board edge delivers the real-time responsiveness required for dynamic \glspl{ntn} while minimizing the dependence on terrestrial input.

A distinctive feature of the architecture is its ability to dynamically map O-RAN interface functions onto physical links, enabling efficient bandwidth utilization and traffic management. This capability ensures that the architecture remains scalable and adaptable, supporting larger constellations and more complex \gls{ntn} deployments in the future.

\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\caption{\gls{spaceric} workflow}
\label{fig:spaceRIC}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Hierarchical Coordination of r/s/x/dApps}

To address the complexities inherent in \glspl{ntn}, the framework employs a hierarchical coordination structure that integrates terrestrial cloud resources with satellite-based systems. This design leverages \glspl{rapp}, \glspl{sapp}, \glspl{xapp}, and \glspl{dapp} to enable dynamic and adaptive resource management across terrestrial and orbital layers. Figure~\ref{fig:spaceRIC} provides an example of this coordination, focusing on a beamforming application to illustrate the interaction between different components.

At the terrestrial layer, \glspl{rapp} hosted in the \gls{smo} manage strategic, non-real-time functions such as \gls{dt} modeling and policy optimization. These \glspl{rapp} process aggregated data to generate high-level directives, which are communicated to the \gls{spaceric} Leader via the \gls{a1} interface. This ensures that constellation-level objectives are aligned with operational demands.

The \gls{spaceric} Leader, hosted on a primary satellite within each cluster, combines terrestrial directives with real-time telemetry and performance metrics gathered through distributed \glspl{sapp}. These \glspl{sapp} oversee critical tasks such as spectral resource allocation and handover decisions, ensuring effective coordination at the constellation level. For example, in the beamforming use case, \glspl{sapp} dynamically adjusts configurations to respond to user demand and orbital dynamics, reducing latency and improving efficiency relying on localized control. Near-real-time operations, such as interference mitigation and beam refinement, are managed by \glspl{xapp}, which operate using metrics accessed via the E3 interface. This interface links the O-DU to \glspl{dapp}, providing granular access to low-layer operational data.

Inter-satellite synchronization is maintained through \glspl{isl}, with the \gls{e2} interface supporting control signaling between the Leader and Followers. In cases of disrupted connectivity, \gls{fede2} enables multi-hop coordination, allowing Followers to reestablish alignment with the Leader and maintain cluster-wide synchronization. Followers equipped with \glspl{dapp} autonomously handle localized adjustments to resource allocations and operational parameters, ensuring responsiveness to real-time conditions while adhering to the Leaderâ€™s overarching strategy.


\subsection{Dynamic Link-Interface Mapping}

A key innovation of the proposed architecture is its ability to dynamically map multiple O-RAN interfaces onto a single physical link, adjusting to the functional and priority needs of the network. This capability is critical in \glspl{ntn}, where diverse conditions require seamless orchestration of multiple roles per link.

For example, a \gls{isl} can simultaneously support the \gls{e2} interface for \gls{spaceric} coordination and the \gls{f1} interface for \gls{du}-\gls{cu} communication, ensuring uninterrupted operation even when network functions are distributed across satellites. Such multipurpose configurations enable the network to adapt to dynamic connectivity changes while maintaining robust performance.

Similarly, \glspl{ul} and \glspl{fl} can handle both signaling and user traffic, with resource allocation dynamically adjusted to application-specific priorities. High-priority slices, such as emergency response or critical \gls{iot} applications, utilize low-latency \glspl{isl} or \glspl{ul}, while lower-priority traffic, such as bulk \gls{iot} data, is routed through higher-latency paths, preserving premium resources for latency-sensitive tasks.


Table~\ref{tab:interface_mapping_flexibility} illustrates how the primary and adaptive roles of each type of link enable dynamic orchestration of O-RAN interfaces throughout the network, providing enhanced flexibility and resilience in \glspl{ntn}.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Security and Interoperability}

To address the security challenges posed by the intermittent nature of \gls{ntn} links, particularly with ground stations, we suggest an adaptive link authentication mechanism. This approach involves session-based authentication with temporary caching of session tokens on both ends, allowing rapid reauthentication when a link reappears, bypassing a full handshake. In addition, ephemeral keys are generated at each reconnection to ensure that each session is uniquely secured, even if interrupted.

For predictable reestablishment scenarios, such as scheduled satellite passes, pre-authentication can be initiated just before the link becomes active, reducing connection latency. A \gls{daa} further supports autonomous authentication throughout the satellite network, enabling secure reauthentication even when terrestrial connectivity is inconsistent. Automated link monitoring with a timeout mechanism ensures that inactive session tokens are invalidated after link disruptions, adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized reconnections. Additionally, the framework is designed for seamless interoperability with O-RAN compatible \gls{tn}, allowing flexible integration with current \gls{5g} and emerging \gls{6g} systems.

\subsection{Propagation Delay and Real-Time Control}

For latency-critical applications, \glspl{isl} are prioritized to maintain propagation delays below a 50 ms threshold in \glspl{leo} constellations, leveraging the \gls{e2} interface for real-time signaling and coordination, as seen in \cref{fig:g2s_latency}. This setup is orchestrated by the \gls{spaceric}, which integrates telemetry from distributed satellites to dynamically adjust network operations. By reducing reliance on ground-based routing, which incurs higher latency, the architecture ensures low-delay communication essential for real-time \gls{ntn} applications.

Use cases such as autonomous disaster response benefit directly from this lower latency configuration, particularly through adaptive beamforming adjustments managed by \glspl{sapp} and \glspl{xapp}. These components enable rapid responses to changing user demands and orbital conditions, ensuring consistent service delivery. In addition, the framework improves the responsiveness for dynamic applications by enabling feasibility analysis and real-time control adjustments under diverse network conditions. 


\section{Future Outlook}
\label{sec:future}

The operational challenges of scalable and autonomous systems in dynamic, resource-constrained environments require innovative solutions for future integrated network deployments. As \glspl{ntn} extend their scope to deep-space and extraterrestrial missions, autonomous features such as self-healing mechanisms and decentralized resource coordination will be critical for maintaining reliability. Protocols like \gls{hdtn} and the Bundle Protocol \cite{dudukovich2024advances} will be essential for addressing the latency and intermittent connectivity inherent in these scenarios, enabling reliable performance even in the absence of direct Earth communication.

Advances in \gls{ai} and \gls{ml} will play a pivotal role in enhancing satellite network operations. Techniques such as distributed inference, model compression, and federated learning will optimize resource utilization by minimizing computational and bandwidth overhead. These capabilities enable adaptive responses to dynamic traffic patterns, particularly in \glspl{leo} constellations, and support predictive analytics for operational decision-making.

Scalability remains a core consideration as satellite constellations grow and new nodes, including those for planetary exploration, are incorporated. Modular design principles ensure seamless integration of additional components without disrupting ongoing operations. This scalability enables diverse applications, such as autonomous scientific research, precision environmental monitoring, and surface operations on extraterrestrial bodies.

Joint communication and sensing functionalities further enhance situational awareness and decision-making. By offloading data-intensive tasks, such as anomaly detection and environmental monitoring, to terrestrial processing centers, the burden on satellite hardware is reduced. This capability supports real-time analysis and responsiveness, critical for applications like disaster management and industrial automation in remote locations.

The adoption of THz spectrum for \glspl{isl} and terrestrial links \cite{alqaraghuli2023road} provides transformative potential for ultra-high-throughput communication. While atmospheric attenuation presents challenges, dynamic spectrum management allows THz bands to complement existing Ka, Ku, and laser \glspl{isl} effectively. This adaptability ensures efficient bandwidth utilization and robust performance across diverse operational scenarios.

Future efforts should focus on addressing satellite power and processing constraints, improving synchronization across network layers, and refining standardization efforts to enhance system efficiency. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents an innovative architecture for integrating \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial O-RAN-supported systems, addressing key challenges such as resource constraints, dynamic connectivity, and fragmented coordination. The framework leverages dynamic link-interface mapping and hierarchical control mechanisms to enable scalable and efficient multi-layered network management. These features bridge gaps inherent in standalone systems, facilitating coordinated operations across space, air, and terrestrial domains to support demanding applications.

The architecture achieves real-time decision-making at the space edge through distributed interactions among \glspl{rapp}, \glspl{xapp}, and satellite-specific \glspl{sapp}. This approach reduces signaling delays and enhances adaptability to changing conditions. Computationally intensive tasks, including predictive analytics and global optimization, are offloaded to terrestrial cloud resources, balancing edge processing with centralized control. This dual-layer strategy ensures responsiveness to latency-sensitive and high-priority service demands while maintaining operational efficiency under dynamic conditions.

Simulations confirm the feasibility of the proposed framework, demonstrating consistent sub-10~ms latency for \glspl{isl}, reliable signaling for \glspl{fl} and ground-to-satellite links, and effective adaptive resource management. These results validate the architectureâ€™s ability to maintain stable closed-loop control and robust coordination across network layers under the dynamic conditions characteristic of \glspl{ntn}.

By addressing limitations in spectrum efficiency, coordination, and scalability, this framework establishes a robust foundation for next-generation networks. Its modular and adaptable design supports applications ranging from disaster response to deep-space exploration, positioning it as a key enabler for \gls{6g}. The integration of emerging technologies, such as THz spectrum for ultra-high throughput communication, further expands its capabilities.

Future research will focus on optimizing satellite hardware and software to overcome power constraints, enhance inter-layer synchronization, and refine spectrum technology integration. These advancements aim to maximize operational performance, broaden connectivity solutions, and extend the frameworkâ€™s applicability to interplanetary communication and next-generation use cases.
