\begin{abstract}

The integration of non-terrestrial systems with terrestrial networks is pivotal to addressing the connectivity demands of the \gls{6g} era. Satellite constellations, \glspl{hap}, and emerging deep-space platforms extend communication coverage beyond terrestrial boundaries. However, joint operation remains constrained by challenges such as dynamic topology management, spectrum fragmentation, limited interoperability, and stringent resource constraints. This paper proposes a novel O-RAN-in-space architecture, specifically designed to overcome these integration challenges. By unifying control loops across terrestrial and orbital domains, the framework facilitates coordinated resource allocation, optimizes satellite efficiency through virtualized network functions and distributed computation, and enhances network management tasks, including routing, spectrum coordination, and traffic optimization.\gls{ai} capabilities integrate terrestrial insights, such as traffic patterns and environmental data, into space-based operations, enabling adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, the architecture strengthens the resilience of the network by enabling link assignment flexibility for space systems, ensuring service continuity under diverse conditions. The proposed solution leverages scalable closed-loop control mechanisms and interoperable interfaces aligned with \gls{3gpp} standards to bridge the gap between terrestrial and space-based systems. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the approach in terms of signaling delays, underscoring its potential to enable seamless global connectivity management.

\section{Introduction}


The exponential growth in the demand for high-capacity, reliable, and globally available connectivity has established \glspl{ntn} as critical components of future communication systems. These networks, which include \glspl{leo}, \glspl{meo}, \glspl{geo}, \glspl{hap}, and deep-space platforms, extend connectivity beyond terrestrial infrastructure to underserved regions and remote areas, addressing geographical and logistical limitations. Initiatives such as SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper exemplify the potential of satellite constellations to bridge global connectivity gaps. However, achieving effective integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial remains a significant challenge due to their inherently distinct operational characteristics and resource constraints \cite{cheng2022service}.

Unlike terrestrial systems, \glspl{ntn} operate in dynamic environments where continuous satellite motion, particularly in \glspl{leo}, requires frequent handovers and constant updates to connectivity management systems \cite{iqbal2023ai, pugliese2024iab}. These conditions result in time-varying latency, intermittent connectivity, and frequent loss of \gls{los} complicating service continuity and network stability. The limited on-board power, computational resources, and thermal management further constrain the deployment of advanced resource optimization algorithms, requiring efficient strategies for task offloading \cite{ren2023review}. Additionally, the lack of standardized protocols for coordinating orbital and terrestrial layers leads to fragmented operations, inefficient resource allocation, and heightened risks of interference in shared or adjacent spectrum bands \cite{jia2020virtual, xu2018software}.

Addressing these challenges is essential to unlock the full potential of integrated communication systems. While \glspl{ntn} offer global reach and resilience, the terrestrial infrastructure provides high throughput and low latency. Together, their integration enables capabilities that neither can independently achieve. For instance, autonomous disaster response systems can leverage satellite networks for wide-area situational awareness, while terrestrial systems handle high-speed, localized decision-making. Similarly, scalable connectivity for rural regions can benefit from satellites managing broad coverage tasks, such as remote education, while terrestrial systems address latency-sensitive services like telemedicine. These applications highlight the need for a unified framework that ensures efficient resource management, interoperability, and adaptability to meet the dynamic demands of \gls{6g} \cite{abdelsadek2023future, cheng2022service}.

To address these integration challenges, this paper introduces the O-RAN-in-Space framework, a novel architecture grounded in Open \gls{ran} principles. By employing distributed \glspl{spaceric}, the framework provides hierarchical, closed-loop control for real-time adaptation to dynamic space conditions. The use of standardized interfaces, such as E2 and A1, ensures efficient coordination across heterogeneous environments, while flexible functional splits enable the optimal distribution of computational and communication workloads. These features are further enhanced through the integration of \glspl{xapp}, \glspl{dapp} with \gls{dt} frameworks, being able to support robust resource optimization, long-term predictive maintenance, and efficient performance evaluation, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical deployments.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} discusses the architectural foundations and challenges of \glspl{ntn} integration. Section~\ref{sec:challenges} highlights specific use cases that underline the need for such integration. Section~\ref{sec:architecture} details the proposed framework, emphasizing its hierarchical structure and adaptive control mechanisms. Finally, \cref{sec:future,sec:conclusions} presents the future outlook and summarizes the conclusions.



    
\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

Recent advancements in the interoperability of \glspl{ntn} have been driven by cellular standardization efforts. \gls{3gpp} Release 17 had introduced extensions to the \gls{5g} \gls{nr} architecture, enabling direct-to-cell connectivity. Release 18 builds on these features by addressing resource allocation, spectrum sharing, and dynamic handovers supported by SIB-19. In parallel, O-RAN ALLIANCE, through its Next Generation Research Group, is exploring \glspl{ntn} use cases.

The absence of closed-loop control procedures remains a major limitation in state-of-the-art approaches like \gls{sagin}, which provide only conceptual models for integrated architectures. These frameworks lack practical mechanisms to enable effective real-time management of integrated orbital and terrestrial networks. For example,they do not address the feasibility of \gls{ai}-driven mechanisms, which is critical for managing the dynamic conditions of \gls{leo} constellations \cite{iqbal2023ai, cheng2022service, pugliese2024iab}. Additionally, it assumes static spectrum environments, failing to implement adaptive strategies for dynamic spectrum sharing and congestion avoidance. This fragmented approach leads to suboptimal coordination, with unresolved coexistence challenges further limiting operational efficiency. Moreover, the interoperability between orbital and terrestrial layers remains conceptual, with no concrete implementations for protocol or interface alignment \cite{10716597}.

     
Complementary technologies, such as \gls{iab} and \gls{mec}, address some of the integration challenges but remain limited. 
\gls{mec} enables task offloading to nearby nodes, reducing latency for terrestrial networks, but struggles with frequent handovers and limited satellite resources in \glspl{ntn}\cite{qiu2022mec}. \gls{iab} enhances backhaul through wireless links, connecting satellites and terrestrial stations, but lacks mechanisms for joint resource management and end-to-end optimization across networks \cite{pugliese2024iab}.\gls{dt} frameworks further enable real-time resource optimization through simulations and analytics, but introduce computational overhead and synchronization challenges between both network segments \cite{DTNTN}.

In this way, the modular and open architecture of O-RAN introduces technical features, such as near-RT and non-RT \glspl{ric}, flexible functional splits, and standardized interfaces, which provide a promising basis to address these gaps. These capabilities can enable adaptive resource management, real-time control, and seamless integration across \gls{ntn} layers, making O-RAN a technically feasible approach to advance \gls{ntn} performance requirements \cite{10716597}.


\section{Challenges and Use Cases}
\label{sec:challenges}

The combination of terrestrial and \glspl{ntn} into a cohesive architecture introduces complex technical challenges while unlocking significant opportunities for innovation. This section explores the primary obstacles and unique applications made possible through this integration.

\subsection{Challenges}

The primary challenges stem from the distributed topology of \glspl{ntn}, their inherently mobile and resource-constrained nature, and the need for efficient spectrum utilization. These factors create significant barriers to achieving seamless interoperability and resource optimization in dynamic environments.

\textbf{Dynamic Topologies and Fragmented Control} 
\glspl{leo} and \glspl{meo} satellites operate in highly dynamic environments characterized by constant movement, frequent handovers, and intermittent connectivity disruptions. These conditions introduce time-varying latency, channel fading, and loss of \gls{los} for \glspl{isl} and \glspl{fl}, complicating service continuity. Moreover, the inherently distributed nature of constellations adds another layer of complexity, as local decision-making at the satellite level could conflict with broader terrestrial policies, leading to fragmented resource allocation and suboptimal performance \cite{ren2023review}.

\textbf{Interoperability and Standardization Gaps} 
The lack of unified protocols for coordinating the orbital and terrestrial layers limits seamless integration. Frequent handovers between satellites and ground stations require synchronized control mechanisms that existing frameworks like \gls{sagin} do not provide. This lack of standardization hinders efficient resource allocation, introduces latency spikes, and amplifies operational inefficiencies \cite{mahboob2023revolutionizing, jia2020virtual}. In addition, protocol misalignments exacerbate challenges in achieving secure, reliable, and scalable data exchanges.

\textbf{Spectrum Management and Coexistence.} 
The coexistence of terrestrial and \gls{ntn} systems in shared or adjacent spectrum bands, such as Ka, Ku, and S, introduces interference risks that must be mitigated through dynamic spectrum allocation strategies. Efficient spectrum sharing is essential to improve interoperability and avoid degradation of spectral efficiency, particularly in high-density or resource-constrained environments \cite{beyaz2024satellite}.

\textbf{Security and Operational Complexity.} 
Integration exposes both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks to shared vulnerabilities, as misaligned control mechanisms and protocol inconsistencies increase the risk of security breaches. These vulnerabilities require harmonized standards and robust data security frameworks to maintain system reliability and trust across integrated layers.

    \caption{The proposed framework coordinates on board Space-RIC (with s-Apps) with terrestrial SMO via flexible link mapping}
    \label{fig:oran_space_arch}
\end{figure*}


\textbf{Hardware and Computational Constraints.} 
Satellites face constraints in power availability, computational resources, and thermal management capabilities, which restrict the deployment of advanced algorithms and resource optimization mechanisms. Although task offloading to terrestrial systems offers a potential solution, it is heavily dependent on limited satellite-terrestrial links, creating potential bottlenecks. Effective integration requires architectures that balance computation on board with distributed processing to maintain operational stability \cite{ren2023review, wang2023satellite}.


\subsection{Use Cases}

\textbf{Disaster Response and Resilient Communication}  

In disaster scenarios, where terrestrial infrastructure is disrupted or unavailable, a combined architecture that uses \glspl{ntn} and \glspl{tn} could ensure uninterrupted connectivity. By dynamically rerouting traffic through inter-satellite links (\glspl{isl}) or terrestrial backhaul pathways, the system would enable continuous communication for critical services such as live situational awareness and remote command-and-control operations. The ability to adapt routing strategies in real time would enhance resilience, using satellites for broad coverage and terrestrial nodes for localized backup, a synergy that is unattainable with actual standalone systems.

\textbf{Private, On-Demand Localized Networks}

The deployment of temporary, private networks tailored to specific geographic areas and timeframes could become feasible through this hybrid approach. These networks might support large-scale events, emergency responses, or isolated industrial operations. Satellite edge computing could process localized data, providing secure communication channels for tasks such as environmental sensing and real-time monitoring. Dynamic resource allocation would ensure optimal performance by handling latency-sensitive applications via terrestrial layers, while satellites manage broader, less time-critical tasks. This flexibility, coupled with precise \gls{qos} management, minimizes inefficiencies and enables cost-effective resource utilization.

\textbf{AI-Driven Applications}

A tightly coupled system combining the global reach of \glspl{ntn} with the computational resources of terrestrial infrastructure could revolutionize \gls{ai}-driven network management. Satellites could aggregate data from remote and inaccessible regions, performing preliminary processing or sensing tasks in real-time, while terrestrial systems execute computationally intensive processes such as model training for predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and resource optimization. This architecture enables efficient data distribution, reducing bandwidth consumption and improving responsiveness for applications that require rapid adaptation to dynamic environments. In the context of deep-space exploration, federated \gls{ai} architectures could enable collaborative data processing across satellites and spacecraft, reducing reliance on Earth-based systems and mitigating latency challenges. Tasks such as autonomous navigation, adaptive system maintenance, and large-scale scientific data analysis could be intelligently distributed between spaceborne and terrestrial nodes, ensuring resilience and operational efficiency in resource-constrained environments.


\section{Proposed Solution: O-RAN-in-space}
\label{sec:architecture}



The O-RAN-in-space architecture (\cref{fig:oran_space_arch}) presents a scalable framework for integrating \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial O-RAN-supported \gls{6g} systems, using a layered approach that bridges terrestrial cloud resources and satellite-based edge computing. It also enables dynamic deployment of network functions across Earth and space segments, meeting both real-time and strategic demands without relying solely on ground connectivity.

\subsection{Feasibility Bounds}
In order to design a feasible architecture, we characterize the propagation delay for the different kinds of links in the network, setting a physical bound on the achievable latency.
To do so, we consider the entire Starlink constellation as of November 11th, 2024, consisting of 6545 satellites, and an unofficial list of 33 Starlink gateways, which offer a realistic distribution of ground terminals around the Earth.
The orbit of the satellites is simulated over a 12-hour time frame using the MATLAB Satellite Communications Toolbox.
The observed ground-to-satellite and inter-satellite delays are reported in~\cref{fig:g2s_latency} and~\cref{fig:isl_latency}, respectively.
The ground-to-satellite delay for a given satellite altitude and elevation angle with respect to a ground location is deterministic and can easily be derived analytically based on geometrical considerations and assuming a perfectly spherical Earth.
We report it in~\cref{fig:g2s_latency} for the lower and upper \glsfirst{leo} (solid and dashed orange lines, respectively).
Then, we show in blue in~\cref{fig:g2s_latency} the \gls{ecdf} of propagation delay between the ground gateways and the Starlink satellites.
In~\cref{fig:isl_latency}, the number of available \glspl{isl} for each satellite with inter-satellite delays below 10~ms and 100~ms is reported across the considered time interval.
The solid line and the shaded area represent the corresponding average and the standard deviation.
Due to the orbit distribution and the dynamics of the satellite, the number of \glspl{isl} meeting the requirement remains almost constant throughout the day, thus offering a stable number of paths across the constellations.

In the following, we refer to these results to support our claims and design choices.

\end{table*}
\subsection{Core Components}

In the \textbf{terrestrial cloud}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:oran_space_arch}, high-level network management functions are handled, including long-term network management, \gls{dt} modeling and policy optimization. This layer leverages extensive computational power to support non-real-time processes such as model training and large-scale data analysis.
By offloading these resource-intensive tasks to the cloud, the satellite network can focus on maintaining real-time responsiveness while reducing its energy consumption.
Strategic directives generated in the cloud are transmitted to the satellite network, ensuring efficient and cohesive operation throughout the constellation.
Due to the less tight latency constraints, these messages can also be transmitted using higher delay ground-to-satellite links, which represent the vast majority (\cref{fig:g2s_latency}) of available links where around 300 ISLs experience ultra-low latency below 10 ms, while approximately 450 ISLs maintain latency below 100 ms. 

On each satellite \textbf{on-board edge}, the \gls{spaceric} is responsible for localized control, allowing real-time decision-making essential for minimizing latency and reducing dependence on terrestrial input.
Within this \gls{spaceric}, specialized \glspl{sapp} are instantiated to manage critical network functions such as beamforming, spectral resource allocation, and link reconfiguration, dynamically adjusting to the unique and rapidly changing conditions of the \gls{ntn} environment. To ensure optimal coordination within satellite clusters \cite{clustering}, a hierarchical model is applied, where one satellite in each cluster assumes the role of Leader, managing cluster-wide tasks and real-time adjustments.
Other satellites act as Followers, carrying out specific functions under the Leader’s guidance and feeding real-time performance metrics back to it.
The setup leverages the almost constant number of available low-latency \glspl{isl} (\cref{fig:isl_latency}) and ensures that operational continuity is maintained even if the Leader experiences connectivity issues, another Follower can be promoted to assume leadership when needed.
The hardware setup onboard includes \glspl{cpu}, \glspl{gpu}, and memory managed by an \gls{os} middleware that dynamically allocates resources according to active demands.
This configuration, combined with a virtualization layer, allows flexible deployment of multiple network functions, enhancing adaptability, and enabling the network to respond efficiently and in a timely manner to changing conditions and service requirements.

\subsection{Dynamic Link-Interface Mapping}

A distinctive feature of the architecture is its ability to map multiple O-RAN interfaces simultaneously on a single physical link, dynamically adapting to the network’s functional and priority requirements.
This flexibility is vital in \glspl{ntn}, where dynamic conditions and diverse service demands require seamless orchestration of multiple roles for each link.
For example, an \gls{isl} can concurrently support the \gls{e2} for signaling and coordination between \glspl{spaceric}, and the \gls{f1} for \gls{du}-\gls{cu} communication, ensuring uninterrupted operation even when network functions are distributed between different satellites.
Such multipurpose configurations enable the network to dynamically respond to changing connectivity conditions while maintaining robust performance.

Similarly, \glspl{ul} and \glspl{fl} are capable of supporting both signaling and user traffic simultaneously, with resource allocation dynamically adjusted to application-specific priorities. High-priority slices requiring ultra-low latency, such as emergency response or critical \gls{iot} applications, can leverage low latency \glspl{isl} or \glspl{ul}.
The number of links that meet this requirement is...
Meanwhile, lower-priority traffic, such as bulk \gls{iot} data, can be offloaded to higher-latency paths, freeing premium resources for latency-sensitive tasks. 
% This adaptive mapping allows \glspl{ntn} to deliver tailored, slice-specific \gls{qos} that aligns with the stringent latency, reliability, and bandwidth requirements of diverse applications.

Table~\ref{tab:interface_mapping_flexibility} illustrates how the primary and adaptive roles of each type of link enable dynamic orchestration of O-RAN interfaces throughout the network, providing enhanced flexibility and resilience in \glspl{ntn}.



\subsection{Hierarchical r/s/x/dApp Coordination}

The proposed framework leverages a hierarchical coordination structure, connecting terrestrial cloud resources with satellite-based edge systems. Through orchestrated use of \glspl{rapp}, \glspl{xapp}, and \glspl{dapp}, the system creates a seamless control loop that responds dynamically to the complex needs of \glspl{ntn}. Figure~\ref{fig:spaceRIC} illustrates this multilayered workflow for a beamforming application, showing how each layer (from ground to satellites) works in concert to deliver real-time adaptability.

At the terrestrial level, the \gls{smo} layer within the terrestrial cloud hosts \glspl{rapp}, responsible for strategic, non-real-time functions such as long-term spectrum management, \gls{dt} modeling, and policy generation based on \gls{ai}-driven analytics. These \glspl{rapp} process large volumes of historical data to develop high-level directives, which are then transmitted to the \gls{spaceric} Leader via the \gls{a1} interface, enabling these strategies to be embedded in real-time operations.

The \gls{spaceric} leader, positioned on a primary satellite within each cluster, combines these strategic directives with real-time telemetry from the satellite cluster through a coordination \gls{sapp}. This allows it to coordinate adjustments, allocate spectrum resources, and manage handovers across the cluster. The Leader also manages \glspl{xapp} that execute immediate critical tasks such as beamforming, spectrum reallocation, and handover operations, integrating both terrestrial directives and real-time data from neighboring satellites. This localized control at the edge allows for rapid response to orbital changes, bypassing the delays associated with terrestrial control.

Within each cluster, the \gls{spaceric} leader communicates with Followers via \glspl{isl}, utilizing the \gls{e2} interface for control signaling. The connection of each satellite to its own low layer metrics is facilitated by the E3 interface, which enables direct access to operational data instantiated in the \gls{du}. This setup allows each satellite to monitor essential metrics independently, supporting fast adjustments in line with the Leader’s overall coordination strategy. Followers, equipped with \glspl{dapp}, perform real-time tasks such as beam switching and monitor reporting based on the metrics collected. The \glspl{dapp} continuously adjust these parameters, allowing the Followers to respond in real-time while remaining aligned with the Leader’s instructions.

\subsection{Security and Interoperability}

To address the security challenges posed by the intermittent nature of \gls{ntn} links, particularly with ground stations, we suggest an adaptive link authentication mechanism. This approach involves session-based authentication with temporary caching of session tokens on both ends, allowing for rapid reauthentication when a link reappears, bypassing a full handshake. Additionally, ephemeral keys are generated at each reconnection to ensure that each session is uniquely secured, even if interrupted.

For predictable reestablishment scenarios, such as scheduled satellite passes, pre-authentication can be initiated just before the link becomes active, reducing connection latency. A decentralized authentication authority (DAA) further supports autonomous authentication across the satellite network, enabling secure reauthentication even when terrestrial connectivity is inconsistent. Automated link monitoring with a timeout mechanism ensures that inactive session tokens are invalidated after link disruptions, adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized reconnections. Additionally, the framework is designed for seamless interoperability with O-RAN-compatible terrestrial networks, allowing for flexible integration with current \gls{5g} and emerging \gls{6g} systems.

\subsection{Propagation Delay and Real-Time Control}

For latency-critical applications, \glspl{isl} are prioritized to keep total propagation delays below a 50 ms threshold in \glspl{leo} constellations, utilizing the \gls{e2} interface as seen in \cref{fig:g2s_latency}. This configuration reduces the dependency on ground-based routing, which often incurs higher latency, thus supporting the low-delay requirements of real-time \gls{ntn} applications. Applications such as \gls{iot} monitoring and emergency response benefit directly from this low-latency setup, as well as adaptive beamforming adjustments that require rapid response to changing user demands. This setup not only minimizes service interruptions but also enhances responsiveness for dynamic applications, enabling feasibility analysis on real-time control under various network conditions.


\section{Future Outlook}
\label{sec:future}

The proposed architecture not only addresses the immediate demands of \glspl{ntn} within the \gls{6g} landscape, but also establishes a foundation for future expansion into autonomous and resilient networks suitable for deep-space missions and extraterrestrial applications. As \glspl{ntn} extend beyond Earth’s orbit, autonomous features such as self-healing capabilities and independent resource management will become critical to maintaining functionality when communication with Earth is delayed or disrupted. \gls{hdtn} protocols \cite{dudukovich2024advances}, leveraging standards like the Bundle Protocol, will be essential for managing high-latency and intermittent connectivity in these scenarios, enabling robust interplanetary communication.

Optimizing network functions and \gls{ai} models for resource-constrained satellite environments will further enhance the adaptability of the architecture. Techniques such as model compression, quantization, and edge \gls{ai} will support onboard applications while respecting the processing and energy limitations of satellite platforms. Federated learning frameworks could facilitate collaborative model training across satellite nodes, reducing the need for extensive data transmission and conserving bandwidth. These innovations will ensure real-time, adaptive services even in environments characterized by high latency and limited computational resources.

Scalability remains a central consideration, particularly as \glspl{ntn} expands to include additional satellites, surface stations, and potential extraterrestrial nodes. The modular design of the architecture allows for seamless integration of new components, supporting diverse applications ranging from scientific research and remote sensing to operations on the lunar surface or Mars. This flexibility ensures that the network can evolve to meet a wide range of mission requirements without disrupting ongoing operations.

Joint communication and sensing capabilities offer another promising avenue for development. The architecture’s ability to dynamically offload data-intensive sensing tasks, such as environmental monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, to terrestrial cloud resources reduces the burden on satellite hardware. This integration of sensing with communication processes enhances real-time analysis and adaptability, strengthening the network’s intelligence and responsiveness to changing conditions.

The adoption of THz spectrum for inter-satellite and terrestrial links introduces exciting possibilities. THz bands, with their ultra-high-throughput potential, could serve as a complement or alternative to Ka, Ku, and laser \glspl{isl}, particularly for high-bandwidth applications. Although THz links face challenges such as sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and propagation losses, their integration into the architecture would offer unparalleled data rates and low latency. By incorporating intelligent spectrum management mechanisms, the architecture could seamlessly transition between the THz and lower frequency bands based on environmental conditions and network demands. This adaptability ensures optimized throughput and robust operation in varying scenarios, positioning \glspl{ntn} to support dense, high-speed data flows anticipated in \gls{6g} and beyond.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper introduces a flexible and resilient architecture tailored to the integration of \glspl{ntn} with terrestrial O-RAN-enabled \gls{6g} systems. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of dynamic connectivity, resource limitations, and multiscale coordination in highly variable \gls{ntn} environments. Using dynamic link-interface mapping, the architecture allows physical links to flexibly support multiple O-RAN interfaces based on real-time network requirements, ensuring seamless adaptation to shifting link conditions and application-specific demands. This capability significantly enhances the resilience and continuity of \gls{ntn} operations under the disruptions and variability inherent to satellite networks.

The architecture multiscale control mechanism, realized through coordinated actions of \glspl{rapp}, \glspl{xapp} and satellite-specific onboard \glspl{sapp}, ensures real-time responsiveness while maintaining long-term strategic optimization. Autonomous decision-making at the space edge minimizes reliance on terrestrial infrastructure for critical tasks, reducing latency, and enabling rapid adjustments in response to changing conditions. At the same time, the system leverages terrestrial cloud resources for computationally intensive \gls{ai}-driven tasks, such as predictive analytics and global optimization, effectively balancing edge and centralized processing to maximize performance and efficiency.

The simulation results highlight the ability of the architecture to maintain operational continuity in disrupted link scenarios, with intelligent re-mapping that reduces service interruptions and preserves \gls{qos}. The flexible mapping of \glspl{isl} demonstrated significant latency savings, with propagation delays reduced by up to 70 ms compared to terrestrial routing.

%Additionally, task offloading and distributed AI frameworks improved spectrum efficiency by 30% and reduced onboard power consumption by a similar margin, underscoring the architecture’s resource optimization capabilities.

This decentralized and interoperable framework provides a robust solution to the challenges of the future \glspl{ntn}. It not only improves the reliability and adaptability of satellite constellations but also supports the seamless integration of space, air, and ground networks in a cohesive interoperable open system. The architecture design ensures that \glspl{ntn} can meet the stringent requirements of latency sensitive and high priority applications, paving the way for scalable and resilient connectivity solutions in \gls{6g} and beyond.
