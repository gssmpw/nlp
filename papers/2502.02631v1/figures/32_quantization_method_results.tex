    \caption{\small Comparison of quantization methods across different bit-widths. Extreme low-bit quantization is highly sensitive to quantization function selection. (b)-(e) show that the learnable policy with range clipping updated via final loss consistently outperforms stats-based methods with fixed range clipping. From (f)-(i), the SEQ works better for ternary and 2-bit quantization, while 3 and 4-bits favor LSQ.}
