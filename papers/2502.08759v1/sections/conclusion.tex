\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this work introduces an effective entropy-based framework for incorporating human feedback into contextual bandits. By utilizing model entropy to trigger feedback solicitation, we significantly reduce the reliance on continuous human intervention, thus making the system more efficient and scalable. Our experiments show that even with low-quality human feedback, substantial performance gains can be achieved, underscoring the potential of entropy-based feedback mechanisms in various real-world applications. By dynamically selecting feedback opportunities based on model uncertainty, our approach provides a generalizable strategy for optimizing human intervention in learning systems, improving efficiency while minimizing unnecessary queries. Future work can explore further applications of entropy-based feedback in these domains, fostering more adaptive and intelligent human-in-the-loop learning frameworks.
%In this work, we presented a simple yet effective entropy based human feedback for contextual bandits. Within the entropy based human feedback framework, we introduced action recommendation by direct supervision and reward manipulation. Furthermore, we developed a method to determine the optimal timing for incorporating human feedback.
 %Our results indicate that this entropy-based approach not only significantly improves outcomes but also successfully mitigates the previously observed superficial engagement with human feedback. With small amount of human feedback we can achieve good performance, even if the quality of the feedback received is not very high. Furthermore, even low-quality human feedback, when suitably queried, can lead to significant performance gains.
 
%In conclusion, our research contributes to the broader discourse on the integration of human feedback in reinforcement learning. The insights gained from our experimental setup and the success of the entropy-based criterion pave the way for more sophisticated models that effectively harness human feedback.
