\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Visual contrastive learning aims to learn representations by contrasting similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data samples. The design of these pairs significantly impacts representation quality, training efficiency, and computational cost. A well-curated set of pairs leads to stronger representations and faster convergence.
As contrastive pre-training sees wider adoption for solving downstream tasks, data curation becomes essential for optimizing its effectiveness. 
In this survey, we attempt to create a taxonomy of existing techniques for positive and negative pair curation in contrastive learning, and describe them in detail.
% This survey introduces the research being done in this direction and aims to create a taxonomy of existing techniques used in positive and negative pair curation for contrastive learning. 
We also examine the trade-offs and open research questions in data curation for contrastive learning.
