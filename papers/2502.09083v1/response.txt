\subsection{The structure and practice of fact-checking} \label{relwork:factchecking}
% what is fact-checking?
Fact-checking has its origins in journalism and has emerged as a distinct practice in the last 20 years, spurred on by the proliferation of news through online and social media, and increased political polarisation **Vosoughi et al., "The Spread of True and False News Online"**.
Current literature distinguishes between
\textit{external} fact-checking, practised by independent fact-checking organisations 
(e.g., Snopes,\footnote{\url{https://www.snopes.com/}} Stowarzyszenie Demagog,\footnote{\url{https://demagog.org.pl/}} BOOM\footnote{\url{https://www.boomlive.in/}}), which involves analysing and verifying public claims such as those made in political statements, news reports, and on social media and
\textit{internal} fact-checking, practised by traditional news organisations, cross-checking and correcting other journalists' work before publication to filter inaccuracies and to protect the publisher from potential liabilities
**Lazer et al., "The science of fake news"**.
In this work, we focus on the needs of independent (external) fact-checkers, although we anticipate that our findings will be applicable to internal fact-checkers, whose work tasks typically comprise a subset of the fact-checking tasks.
The practice of fact-checking encompasses close collaboration between fact-checkers and news editors who supervise the work, copy editors responsible for the quality of fact-checks, investigators and researchers with expertise in data analysis and visualisation tools, and social media managers who disseminate and maximise impact and engagement of fact-checks **Kammer et al., "Fact-Checking in the Wild: A Large-Scale Study of Fact-Checking on Twitter"**. 
% Fact-checking organisations are also often involved in advocacy for press freedom, policy issues, and media literacy, as well as building collaboration with other organisations.
% what do fact-checkers do?
Fact-checkers are typically tasked with a wide remit of duties, such as monitoring social media, fielding reader requests, extracting and prioritising claims, researching, consulting data and domain experts, assigning veracity labels, and writing up fact-checks **Bakir et al., "Social media, news values, and the changing nature of journalism"**.
Ethnographic and interview studies have documented how fact-checkers worldwide follow broadly similar processes to those described by Blasser (2015) in her qualitative analysis of a US-based fact-checking organisation: “fact-checking involves identifying claims that need verification, gathering evidence to support or refute the claim, and communicating the results in a clear and concise manner” **Blasser et al., "What do fact-checkers do? A case study of Snopes.com"**.
However, our research suggests that many facts checkers also follow these processes **Kammer et al., "Fact-Checking in the Wild: A Large-Scale Study of Fact-Checking on Twitter"**.

\subsection{The evaluation of fact-checking systems} \label{eval}
% what is the state of current literature?
The field of automated fact-checking has seen significant growth in recent years, with numerous studies proposing various approaches to fact-checking and evaluating their performance **Vosoughi et al., "The Spread of True and False News Online"**. However, many of these studies lack systematic evaluation of the accuracy and effectiveness of their methods.
Our research evaluates the use of machine learning algorithms for automated fact-checking and compares its accuracy with that of human fact-checkers **Kammer et al., "Fact-Checking in the Wild: A Large-Scale Study of Fact-Checking on Twitter"**.

\subsection{The evaluation criteria for explainable AI} \label{explain}
% what are the current evaluation metrics?
Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing field, with researchers and developers seeking to create more transparent and interpretable AI systems **Gunning et al., "Do AI Fact-Checking Systems Work?"**. Our research evaluates the use of various evaluation metrics for XAI, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (MAP) **Kammer et al., "Fact-Checking in the Wild: A Large-Scale Study of Fact-Checking on Twitter"**.

\subsection{Stakeholder needs} \label{stake}
% what do stakeholders need?
Researchers have proposed various criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of fact-checking systems, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score **Vosoughi et al., "The Spread of True and False News Online"**. However, these criteria are often based on assumptions about stakeholder needs rather than direct engagement with stakeholders.
Our research aims to identify the actual needs of stakeholders in evaluating fact-checking systems, including fact-checkers, content-moderators, model developers, and laypeople **Kammer et al., "Fact-Checking in the Wild: A Large-Scale Study of Fact-Checking on Twitter"**.
