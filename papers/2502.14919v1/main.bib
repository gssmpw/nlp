Using machine learning (ML) to predict E. coli AMR is a more efficient method than traditional laboratory testing. However, further improvement in the predictive performance of existing models remains challenging. In this study, we collected 1937 high-quality whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from public databases with an antimicrobial resistance phenotype and modified the existing workflow by adding an attention mechanism to enable the modified workflow to focus more on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may significantly lead to the development of AMR in E. coli. While comparing the model performance before and after adding the attention mechanism, we also performed a cross-comparison among the published models using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Our study demonstrates that the discriminative positional colors of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) images can selectively influence and highlight genome regions without prior knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we developed an online tool (https://github.com/tjiaa/E.coli-ML/tree/main) for assisting clinicians in the rapid prediction of the AMR phenotype of E. coli and accelerating clinical decision-making.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest global problems threatening human and animal health. Rapid and accurate AMR diagnostic methods are thus very urgently needed. However, traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is time-consuming, low throughput and viable only for cultivable bacteria. Machine learning methods may pave the way for automated AMR prediction based on genomic data of the bacteria. However, comparing different machine learning methods for the prediction of AMR based on different encodings and whole-genome sequencing data without previously known knowledge remains to be done.In this study, we evaluated logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the prediction of AMR for the antibiotics ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. We could demonstrate that these models can effectively predict AMR with label encoding, one-hot encoding and frequency matrix chaos game representation (FCGR encoding) on whole-genome sequencing data. We trained these models on a large AMR dataset and evaluated them on an independent public dataset. Generally, RFs and CNNs perform better than LR and SVM with AUCs up to 0.96. Furthermore, we were able to identify mutations that are associated with AMR for each antibiotic.Source code in data preparation and model training are provided at GitHub website (https://github.com/YunxiaoRen/ML-iAMR).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Effective and timely antibiotic treatment depends on accurate and rapid in silico antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) predictions. Existing statistical rule-based Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) drug resistance prediction methods using bacterial genomic sequencing data often achieve varying results: high accuracy on some antibiotics but relatively low accuracy on others. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied to classify drug resistance for MTB and have shown more stable performance. However, there is no study that uses deep learning architecture like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a large and diverse cohort of MTB samples for AMR prediction. We developed 24 binary classifiers of MTB drug resistance status across eight anti-MTB drugs and three different ML algorithms: logistic regression, random forest and 1D CNN using a training dataset of 10,575 MTB isolates collected from 16 countries across six continents, where an extended pan-genome reference was used for detecting genetic features. Our 1D CNN architecture was designed to integrate both sequential and non-sequential features. In terms of F1-scores, 1D CNN models are our best classifiers that are also more accurate and stable than the state-of-the-art rule-based tool Mykrobe predictor (81.1 to 93.8\%, 93.7 to 96.2\%, 93.1 to 94.8\%, 95.9 to 97.2\% and 97.1 to 98.2\% for ethambutol, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, isoniazid and ofloxacin respectively). We applied filter-based feature selection to find AMR relevant features. All selected variant features are AMR-related ones in CARD database. 78.8\% of them are also in the catalogue of MTB mutations that were recently identified as drug resistance-associated ones by WHO. To facilitate ML model development for AMR prediction, we packaged every step into an automated pipeline and shared the source code at https://github.com/KuangXY3/MTB-AMR-classification-CNN.},

First, a pan-genome analysis shows that M. tuberculosis is highly conserved with sequenced variation concentrated in PE/PPE/PGRS genes. Second, the platform corroborates 33 genes known to confer resistance and identifies 24 new genetic signatures of AMR. Third, 97 epistatic interactions across 10 resistance classes are revealed. Fourth, detailed structural analysis of these genes yields mechanistic bases for their selection.

With the recent advances in sequencing technologies, applying machine learning techniques for AMR prediction have indicated promising results.

To address this shortcoming, we introduce a Rectified Classifier Chain (RCC) method for predicting multi-drug resistance. This RCC method was tested using annotated features of genomics sequences and compared with similar multi-label classification methodologies. We found that applying the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) base model to our RCC model outperformed the second-best model, XGBoost based binary relevance model, by 3.3\% in Hamming accuracy and 7.8\% in F1-score. Additionally, we note that in the literature machine learning models applied to AMR prediction typically are unsuitable for identifying biomarkers informative of their decisions; in this study, we show that biomarkers contributing to AMR prediction can also be identified using the proposed RCC method. We expect this can facilitate genome annotation and pave the path towards identifying new biomarkers indicative of AMR.},

Advancing methods for monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is especially needed for identifying potential resources of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), hot spots for gene exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequencing now enables direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are typically identified or predicted based on the “best hits” of sequence searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach produces a high rate of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep learning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs.

	abstract = {Motivation
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a huge problem in both developed and developing countries, and identifying strains resistant or susceptible to certain antibiotics is essential in fighting against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Whole-genome sequences have been collected for different microbial strains in order to identify crucial characteristics that allow certain strains to become resistant to antibiotics; however, a global inspection of the gene content responsible for AMR activities remains to be done.

Results
We propose a pan-genome-based approach to characterize antibiotic-resistant microbial strains and test this approach on the bacterial model organism Escherichia coli. By identifying core and accessory gene clusters and predicting AMR genes for the E. coli pan-genome, we not only showed that certain classes of genes are unevenly distributed between the core and accessory parts of the pan-genome but also demonstrated that only a portion of the identified AMR genes belong to the accessory genome. Application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether specific strains were resistant to antibiotic drugs yielded the best prediction accuracy for the set of AMR genes within the accessory part of the pan-genome, suggesting that these gene clusters were most crucial to AMR activities in E. coli. Selecting subsets of AMR genes for different antibiotic drugs based on a genetic algorithm (GA) achieved better prediction performances than the gene sets established in the literature, hinting that the gene sets selected by the GA may warrant further analysis in investigating more details about how E. coli fight against antibiotics.

	abstract = {Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) from genomic sequence data has become a significant component of overcoming the AMR challenge, especially given its potential for facilitating more rapid diagnostics and personalised antibiotic treatments. With the recent advances in sequencing technologies and computing power, deep learning models for genomic sequence data have been widely adopted to predict AMR more reliably and error-free. There are many different types of AMR; therefore, any practical AMR prediction system must be able to identify multiple AMRs present in a genomic sequence. Unfortunately, most genomic sequence datasets do not have all the labels marked, thereby making a deep learning modelling approach challenging owing to its reliance on labels for reliability and accuracy. This paper addresses this issue by presenting an effective deep learning solution, Mask-Loss 1D convolution neural network (ML-ConvNet), for AMR prediction on datasets with many missing labels. The core component of ML- ConvNet utilises a masked loss function that overcomes the effect of missing labels in predicting AMR. The proposed ML-ConvNet is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods in the literature by 10.5\%, according to the F1 score. The proposed model’s performance is evaluated using different degrees of the missing label and is found to outperform the conventional approach by 76\% in the F1 score when 86.68\% of labels are missing. Furthermore, the ML-ConvNet was established with an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) pipeline, thereby making it ideally suited for hospital and healthcare settings, where model interpretability is an essential requirement.},

	abstract = {The evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a persistent threat to global public health. Sequencing efforts have already yielded genome sequences for thousands of resistant microbial isolates and require robust computational tools to systematically elucidate the genetic basis for AMR. Here, we present a generalizable machine learning workflow for identifying genetic features driving AMR based on constructing reference strain-agnostic pan-genomes and training random subspace ensembles (RSEs). This workflow was applied to the resistance profiles of 14 antimicrobials across three urgent threat pathogens encompassing 288 Staphylococcus aureus, 456 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1588 Escherichia coli genomes. We find that feature selection by RSE detects known AMR associations more reliably than common statistical tests and previous ensemble approaches, identifying a total of 45 known AMR-conferring genes and alleles across the three organisms, as well as 25 candidate associations backed by domain-level annotations. Furthermore, we find that results from the RSE approach are consistent with existing understanding of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance due to mutations in the main drug targets, gyrA and parC, in all three organisms, and suggest the mutational landscape of those genes with respect to FQ resistance is simple. As larger datasets become available, we expect this approach to more reliably predict AMR determinants for a wider range of microbial pathogens.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the genome of a cell and its phenotype is a central problem in precision medicine. Nonetheless, genotype-to-phenotype prediction comes with great challenges for machine learning algorithms that limit their use in this setting. The high dimensionality of the data tends to hinder generalization and challenges the scalability of most learning algorithms. Additionally, most algorithms produce models that are complex and difficult to interpret. We alleviate these limitations by proposing strong performance guarantees, based on sample compression theory, for rule-based learning algorithms that produce highly interpretable models. We show that these guarantees can be leveraged to accelerate learning and improve model interpretability. Our approach is validated through an application to the genomic prediction of antimicrobial resistance, an important public health concern. Highly accurate models were obtained for 12 species and 56 antibiotics, and their interpretation revealed known resistance mechanisms, as well as some potentially new ones. An open-source disk-based implementation that is both memory and computationally efficient is provided with this work. The implementation is turnkey, requires no prior knowledge of machine learning, and is complemented by comprehensive tutorials.},

	abstract = {Polymyxins are used as treatments of last resort for Gram-negative bacterial infections. Their increased use has led to concerns about emerging polymyxin resistance (PR). Phenotypic polymyxin susceptibility testing is resource intensive and difficult to perform accurately. The complex polygenic nature of PR and our incomplete understanding of its genetic basis make it difficult to predict PR using detection of resistance determinants. We therefore applied machine learning (ML) to whole-genome sequencing data from {\textgreater}600 Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258 (CG258) genomes to predict phenotypic PR. Using a reference-based representation of genomic data with ML outperformed a rule-based approach that detected variants in known PR genes (area under receiver-operator curve [AUROC], 0.894 versus 0.791, P = 0.006). We noted modest increases in performance by using a bacterial genome-wide association study to filter relevant genomic features and by integrating clinical data in the form of prior polymyxin exposure. Conversely, reference-free representation of genomic data as k-mers was associated with decreased performance (AUROC, 0.692 versus 0.894, P = 0.015). When ML models were interpreted to extract genomic features, six of seven known PR genes were correctly identified by models without prior programming and several genes involved in stress responses and maintenance of the cell membrane were identified as potential novel determinants of PR. These findings are a proof of concept that whole-genome sequencing data can accurately predict PR in K. pneumoniae CG258 and may be applicable to other forms of complex antimicrobial resistance.
IMPORTANCE Polymyxins are last-resort antibiotics used to treat highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria. There are increasing reports of polymyxin resistance emerging, raising concerns of a postantibiotic era. Polymyxin resistance is therefore a significant public health threat, but current phenotypic methods for detection are difficult and time-consuming to perform. There have been increasing efforts to use whole-genome sequencing for detection of antibiotic resistance, but this has been difficult to apply to polymyxin resistance because of its complex polygenic nature. The significance of our research is that we successfully applied machine learning methods to predict polymyxin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258, a common health care-associated and multidrug-resistant pathogen. Our findings highlight that machine learning can be successfully applied even in complex forms of antibiotic resistance and represent a significant contribution to the literature that could be used to predict resistance in other bacteria and to other antibiotics.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis that poses a great threat to modern medicine. Effective prevention strategies are urgently required to slow the emergence and further dissemination of AMR. Given the availability of data sets encompassing hundreds or thousands of pathogen genomes, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to predict resistance to different antibiotics in pathogens based on gene content and genome composition. A key objective of this work is to advocate for the incorporation of ML into front-line settings but also highlight the further refinements that are necessary to safely and confidently incorporate these methods. The question of what to predict is not trivial given the existence of different quantitative and qualitative laboratory measures of AMR. ML models typically treat genes as independent predictors, with no consideration of structural and functional linkages; they also may not be accurate when new mutational variants of known AMR genes emerge. Finally, to have the technology trusted by end users in public health settings, ML models need to be transparent and explainable to ensure that the basis for prediction is clear. We strongly advocate that the next set of AMR-ML studies should focus on the refinement of these limitations to be able to bridge the gap to diagnostic implementation.},

	abstract = {Many real-world problems that require making optimal sequences of decisions under uncertainty involve costs when the agent wishes to obtain information about its environment. We design and analyze algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable MDPs (ACNO-MDPs), a special class of POMDPs in which the agent can choose to either (1) fully observe the state at a cost and then act; or (2) act without any immediate observation information, relying on past observations to infer the underlying state. ACNO-MDPs arise frequently in important real-world application domains like healthcare, in which clinicians must balance the value of information gleaned from medical tests (e.g., blood-based biomarkers) with the costs of gathering that information (e.g., the costs of labor and materials required to administer such tests). We develop a PAC RL algorithm for tabular ACNO-MDPs that provides substantially tighter bounds, compared to generic POMDP-RL algorithms, on the total number of episodes exhibiting worse than near-optimal performance. For continuous-state ACNO-MDPs, we propose a novel method of incorporating observation information that, when coupled with modern RL algorithms, yields significantly faster learning compared to other POMDP-RL algorithms in several simulated environments.},

	abstract = {Many real-world situations allow for the acquisition of additional relevant information when making an assessment with limited or uncertain data. However, traditional ML approaches either require all features to be acquired beforehand or regard part of them as missing data that cannot be acquired. In this work, we consider models that perform active feature acquisition (AFA) and query the environment for unobserved features to improve the prediction assessments at evaluation time. Our work reformulates the Markov decision process (MDP) that underlies the AFA problem as a generative modeling task and optimizes a policy via a novel model-based approach. We propose learning a generative surrogate model (GSM) that captures the dependencies among input features to assess potential information gain from acquisitions. The GSM is leveraged to provide intermediate rewards and auxiliary information to aid the agent navigate a complicated high-dimensional action space and sparse rewards. Furthermore, we extend AFA in a task we coin active instance recognition (AIR) for the unsupervised case where the target variables are the unobserved features themselves and the goal is to collect information for a particular instance in a cost-efficient way. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves considerably better performance than previous state of the art methods on both supervised and unsupervised tasks.},

	abstract = {Change in a data stream can occur at the concept level and at the feature level. Change at the feature level can occur if new, additional features appear in the stream or if the importance and relevance of a feature changes as the stream progresses. This type of change has not received as much attention as concept-level change. Furthermore, a lot of the methods proposed for clustering streams (density-based, graph-based, and grid-based) rely on some form of distance as a similarity metric and this is problematic in high-dimensional data where the curse of dimensionality renders distance measurements and any concept of “density” difficult. To address these two challenges we propose combining them and framing the problem as a feature selection problem, specifically a dynamic feature selection problem. We propose a dynamic feature mask for clustering high dimensional data streams. Redundant features are masked and clustering is performed along unmasked, relevant features. If a feature's perceived importance changes, the mask is updated accordingly; previously unimportant features are unmasked and features which lose relevance become masked. The proposed method is algorithm-independent and can be used with any of the existing density-based clustering algorithms which typically do not have a mechanism for dealing with feature drift and struggle with high-dimensional data. We evaluate the proposed method on four density-based clustering algorithms across four high-dimensional streams; two text streams and two image streams. In each case, the proposed dynamic feature mask improves clustering performance and reduces the processing time required by the underlying algorithm. Furthermore, change at the feature level can be observed and tracked.},

	abstract = {Solving real-life sequential decision making problems under partial observability involves an exploration-exploitation problem. To be successful, an agent needs to efficiently gather valuable information about the state of the world for making rewarding decisions. However, in real-life, acquiring valuable information is often highly costly, e.g., in the medical domain, information acquisition might correspond to performing a medical test on a patient. This poses a significant challenge for the agent to perform optimally for the task while reducing the cost for information acquisition. In this paper, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning framework that learns an active feature acquisition policy to solve the exploration-exploitation problem during its execution. Key to the success is a novel sequential variational auto-encoder that learns high-quality representations from partially observed states, which are then used by the policy to maximize the task reward in a cost efficient manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in a control domain as well as using a medical simulator. In both tasks, our proposed method outperforms conventional baselines and results in policies with greater cost efficiency.},

While global feature selection has been a well-studied problem for quite some time, only recently has the paradigm of instance-wise feature selection been developed. In this paper, we propose a new instance-wise feature selection method, which we term INVASE. INVASE consists of 3 neural networks, a selector network, a predictor network and a baseline network which are used to train the selector network using the actor-critic methodology. Using this methodology, INVASE is capable of flexibly discovering feature subsets of a different size for each instance, which is a key limitation of existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate through a mixture of synthetic and real data experiments that INVASE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Dynamic diagnosis is desirable when medical tests are costly or time-consuming. In this work, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a dynamic policy that selects lab test panels sequentially based on previous observations, ensuring accurate testing at a low cost. Clinical diagnostic data are often highly imbalanced; therefore, we aim to maximize the \$F\_1\$ score instead of the error rate. However, optimizing the non-concave \$F\_1\$ score is not a classic RL problem, thus invalidates standard RL methods. To remedy this issue, we develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the \$F\_1\$ score and duality of policy optimization, to provably find the set of all Pareto-optimal policies for budget-constrained \$F\_1\$ score maximization. To handle the combinatorially complex state space, we propose a Semi-Model-based Deep Diagnosis Policy Optimization (SM-DDPO) framework that is compatible with end-to-end training and online learning. SM-DDPO is tested on diverse clinical tasks: ferritin abnormality detection, sepsis mortality prediction, and acute kidney injury diagnosis. Experiments with real-world data validate that SM-DDPO trains efficiently and identifies all Pareto-front solutions. Across all tasks, SM-DDPO is able to achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy (in some cases higher than conventional methods) with up to \$85{\textbackslash}\%\$ reduction in testing cost.
