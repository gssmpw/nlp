    \caption{\textbf{Overview of our inference pipeline for illumination estimation.} A neutral color checker is pasted onto the input image, which is then encoded into the latent space. The input latent is processed through Laplacian composition before being concatenated with the masked image latent and the resized mask. The modified U-Net generates an inpainted result at fixed timestep $T$. After inverse gamma correction, we sample the color checker patches to obtain the final RGB illumination value. We highlight the steps and components that are different from the training pipeline.}
