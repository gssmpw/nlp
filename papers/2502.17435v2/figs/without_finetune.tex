    \caption{\textbf{Effect of fine-tuning and Laplacian decomposition.} 
    % Qualitative comparison showing the importance of fine-tuning and Laplacian Composition. From left to right: 
    (a) Results without fine-tuning show poor color checker quality due to the domain gap between the pre-trained diffusion model's training data (sRGB images) and our gamma-corrected raw images, leading to disharmonious inpainting results. (b) Results without Laplacian decomposition are biased by low-frequency information from the neutral color checker, leading to inharmonious generation. (c) Our full method with both components produces well-harmonized color checkers that accurately reflect scene illumination.}
