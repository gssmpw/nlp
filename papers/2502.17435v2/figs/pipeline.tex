\caption{\textbf{Overview of our training pipeline.} Starting from stable-diffusion-2-inpainting~\cite{rombach2021highresolution}, we enable color checker generation through end-to-end fine-tuning. Given a ground truth color checker image and its mask, we apply color jittering in the masked region. The input image latent passes through Laplacian decomposition before being concatenated with the masked image latent and the resized mask for the SD Inpainting U-Net. The model is trained with an L2 loss between the inpainted output and ground truth image at a fixed timestep $T$.}
