    \caption{\textbf{Sensitivity to color checker placement.} This figure demonstrates the robustness of our method across various color checker positions under a single light source scenario. The left part displays different placements of color checkers and their corresponding processed results, showing that our method remains effective under challenging warm color temperatures (regions with lower data distribution). The scatter plots on the right quantitatively validate this observation, where the estimated illumination values consistently cluster near the ground truth target, confirming the precision and consistency of our approach.}
