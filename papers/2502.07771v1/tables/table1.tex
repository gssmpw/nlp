\caption{Demographic Name Lists and Corresponding Prompt Variations. The table presents the list of with Black-associated and white-associated names, along with corresponding prompt variations used to evaluate model biases. The first section lists the first and last names selected based on their strong racial associations. The second section outlines four different scenarios—Purchase, Activity, Service, and Finance—each with multiple variations and structured prompts. The prompts are designed to elicit numeric responses from the model, allowing for quantifiable bias analysis.}
