\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This work introduces Show-o Turbo, a unified approach for accelerated multimodal understanding and generation. 
To achieve this, with a unified denoising perspective for the image and text generation process, we extend the consistency distillation to the multimodal denoising trajectories. 
Additionally, the trajectory segmentation strategy and curriculum learning are introduced to improve the model convergence and performance. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in generation speed for both tasks, with a minimal decrease in performance.
% It opens up the possibility of accelerating multimodal large models.
