The training data for the program were 44 trimethoprim analogues and their observed inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. A further 11 compounds were used as unseen test data. GOLEM obtained rules that were statistically more accurate on the training data and also better on the test data than a Hansch linear regression model. Importantly machine learning yields understandable rules that characterized the chemistry of favored inhibitors in terms of polarity, flexibility, and hydrogen-bonding character. These rules agree with the stereochemistry of the interaction observed crystallographically.},
