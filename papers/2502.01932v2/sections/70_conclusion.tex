We introduce VolleyBots, a new MARL testbed where drones cooperate and compete in volleyball under real-world physical dynamics. VolleyBots bridges the gap between existing MARL testbeds by introducing a turn-based interaction model, a hierarchical decision-making process, and a high-fidelity simulation for seamless sim-to-real transfer. Through extensive benchmarks from single-agent tasks to multi-agent cooperative and competitive tasks, we show that existing algorithms struggle to solve complex tasks that require both low-level motion control and high-level strategic play. We also showcase the feasibility of deploying policies trained in simulations directly onto physical drones, emphasizing VolleyBots' sim-to-real transfer and practical utility in real-world applications. We envision VolleyBots as a realistic and challenging testbed for MARL research in high-mobility, agile robotic platforms like drones.
