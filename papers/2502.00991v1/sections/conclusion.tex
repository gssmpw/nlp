\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we present \sysname, an efficient middle-tier approach that achieves serializability by strategically selecting between serializable and low isolation levels for dynamic workloads. 
% \sysname integrates the concurrency control within and outside the database and guarantees serializable scheduling for transactions under low isolation levels. %By employing the validation-based concurrency control outside the database, coupled with its optimizations, \sysname efficiently maintains the commit order of transactions involved in vulnerable edges without requiring workload modifications. 
\sysname introduces a unified middle-tier validation method to enforce the commit order consistent with the vulnerable dependency order, ensuring serializability in single-isolation and cross-isolation scenarios. Moreover, \sysname considers the trade-off between the performance benefits of low isolation levels and the serializability overhead. It adopts a graph-learned model to extract the runtime workload characteristics and adaptively predict the optimal isolation levels, achieving further performance improvement. 
% Utilizing a graph construct model, \sysname characterizes the workload into a graph structure and adaptively selects the optimal isolation strategy with the assistance of GCN. 
%We conduct extensive experiments to compare \sysname against various serializable guarantee solutions. 
The results show that \sysname can self-adaptively select the optimal isolation level and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art solutions and the native concurrency control in PostgreSQL. 

% a highly efficient and adaptive two-layer concurrency control framework designed for database-backend applications. \sysname seamlessly integrates concurrency control both within and outside the database, ensuring serializable scheduling even when operating under weaker isolation levels. By employing validation-based concurrency control outside the database, coupled with various optimizations, \sysname maintains the commit order of transactions involved in vulnerable edges without requiring workload modifications.

% Utilizing a graph construct model, \sysname characterizes the workload into a graph structure and adaptively selects the optimal isolation strategy with the assistance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). We conduct extensive experiments comparing \sysname to various state-of-the-art serializable guarantee solutions. The results demonstrate that \sysname can dynamically switch isolation strategies, achieving up to 21.6x higher throughput compared to these approaches.
