	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel inference attack that we coin as the reconstruction attack whose objective is to reconstruct a probabilistic version of the original dataset on which a classifier was learnt from the description of this classifier and possibly some auxiliary information. In a nutshell, the reconstruction attack exploits the structure of the classifier in order to derive a probabilistic version of dataset on which this model has been trained. Moreover, we propose a general framework that can be used to assess the success of a reconstruction attack in terms of a novel distance between the reconstructed and original datasets. In case of multiple releases of classifiers, we also give a strategy that can be used to merge the different reconstructed datasets into a single coherent one that is closer to the original dataset than any of the simple reconstructed datasets. Finally, we give an instantiation of this reconstruction attack on a decision tree classifier that was learnt using the algorithm C4.5 and evaluate experimentally its efficiency. The results of this experimentation demonstrate that the proposed attack is able to reconstruct a significant part of the original dataset, thus highlighting the need to develop new learning algorithms whose output is specifically tailored to mitigate the success of this type of attack.},

	abstract = {The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.},
