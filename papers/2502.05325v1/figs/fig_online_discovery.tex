    \caption{Illustration of the connection between online discovery problems and model extraction attacks. The left figure was inspired by Figure 4 of~\citet{tee2021lidar}. In this context, an autonomous robot explores an unknown 2D environment (e.g., a house). The objective of the robot is to produce a map of this house, given a limited view of its surroundings provided by different sensors (e.g., LIDAR and laser distance measurements). The right figure corresponds to the problem tackled in this paper: model extraction attacks aim at recovering the decision boundary of the underlying model, by observing answers to counterfactual queries.} % Thibaut: -- I would love to find a polygon exploration problem in which the query gives the closest polygon boundary, perhaps it exists.
