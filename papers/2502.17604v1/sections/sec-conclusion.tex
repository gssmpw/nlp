\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our research addresses vital questions regarding the integration of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) with smart contracts. We demonstrated through a proof of concept that smart contracts, particularly those executed using CosmWasm, can effectively generate AI/LLM inferences. %The local execution of these inferences ensures privacy compliance, and 
The use of WebGPU technology allows for efficient GPU-accelerated inferences within a smart contract environment. Our findings affirm the feasibility, performance efficiency, and security of utilizing AI models in blockchain environments. This opens up new avenues for blockchain applications, leveraging the power of AI and LLMs while maintaining security standards.
