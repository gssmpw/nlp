% In recent years Large Language Models (LLM) and advances in Machine Learning methods has been reshaping the industry and how we use these tools. A lot of work is being done in teh field of MlOps of handling and serving these LLM models and on distributed inference as well. On the otherhand the need for secured on chain computation is getting more important with each passingd ay.In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that leverages blockchain technology, specifically the Cosmos SDK, to enable distributed language model (LLM) inference. By utilizing WebAssembly (WASM), we establish interchain communication channels, allowing WASM modules running LLM inference logic to be deployed and executed across multiple blockchains. We evaluate the safety, scalability and model safety of such a system with emphasize on the portability of such a system and how it can be deployed agnostic of inference engine and model.



%In this era, significant transformations in industries and tool utilization are driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and advancements in Machine Learning. There's a growing emphasis on MLOps for managing and deploying these LLMs, along with a focus on distributed inference. Concurrently, the imperative for secure on-chain computation is escalating. Our paper introduces an innovative framework that integrates blockchain technology, particularly the Cosmos SDK, to facilitate distributed LLM inference. This system, built on WebAssembly (WASM), enables interchain communication and deployment of WASM modules executing LLM inference across multiple blockchains. We critically assess this system's safety, scalability, and model security, with a special focus on its portability and engine-model agnostic deployment.

Concurrently, the imperative for richer smart contracts and on-chain computation is escalating. Our paper introduces an innovative framework that integrates blockchain technology, particularly the Cosmos SDK, to facilitate on-chain AI inferences. This system, built on WebAssembly (WASM), enables interchain communication and deployment of WASM modules executing AI inferences across multiple blockchain nodes. We critically assess the framework from feasibility, scalability, and model security, with a special focus on its portability and engine-model agnostic deployment. The capability to support AI on-chain may enhance and expand the scope of smart contracts, and as a result enable new use cases and applications.
