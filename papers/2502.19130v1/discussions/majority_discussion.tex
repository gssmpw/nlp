[AGREE] As a Choir Member of the Southampton Philharmonic Choir who has performed at the Guildhall, I can confirm that the Southampton Choral Society is indeed one of the choirs that have sung at the Guildhall. Our experiences have shown that we often share the stage with the Southampton Choral Society during joint performances with orchestras and other ensembles. So, I'm happy to confirm that Southampton Choral Society is a correct answer.
