First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors Rob Cornish, Arnaud Doucet and Yee Whye Teh 
for their support, patience and invaluable mentorship throughout my DPhil journey. 
Their guidance taught me the importance of perseverance, rigour and not compromising on quality -- 
traits which I will cherish for the rest of my life.
They were present for me whenever I needed their help, while also providing me all the flexibility and independence that I needed to conduct my research. 

I would also like to sincerely thank the collaborators who I have had the privilege of working with throught my DPhil. 
Special thanks to Jean-Francois Ton, Chris Holmes, Lenon Minorics and Yang Liu whose guidance and insights have not only contributed to the success of my research projects but also taught me valuable skills which I will draw upon in future as well.

I am deeply grateful to Google DeepMind for funding my DPhil. 
It would not have been possible for me to pursue my studies without their generous support.

My experience at Oxford would be incomplete without the friendships I developed here. 
I would like to specially mention the amazing people who enriched my time at the department with laughter and camaraderie: Jef, Sahra, Emi, Bobby, Jin, Robert, Michael, Alan, Carlo, Andrew, Valentin, Chris, Sheh, Tyler, Jessie, Desi and Guneet.  
Not only did they make my DPhil an enjoyable journey, these are also some of the most smart, talented and supportive individuals that I have ever met and they continue to inspire me everyday. 

To my sister, thank you for being the one unwavering constant in my ever-changing life. 
And to my parents, I cannot express the gratitude I feel for your untiring dedication towards my and my sister's education.
It is impossible for me to list the countless sacrifices that you have made to set us up for success in our lives. 

Finally, I am forever indebted to God for blessing me with this incredible life.
