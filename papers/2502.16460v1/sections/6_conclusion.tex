In this paper, we proposed a resilient multi-robot coverage control algorithm that enhances the structural resilience of the MRS network during the coverage task. By posing the coverage problem as scaling and translating a virtual rigid structure formed by robots and their communication links, we showed that the resiliency of the underlying network could be enhanced in the presence of faults/cyberattacks or robot loss. We formulated the simultaneous centroid tracking and rigidity maintenance problem as an output tracking nonlinear MPC problem and proved that our proposed algorithm converges to the centroidal Voronoi configuration. Furthermore, as a consequence of bearing rigidity, we designed a rigidity recovery algorithm to reconfigure the MRS network in the event of a robot failure, which computes the set of new recovery edges for the neighbors of the faulty robot, enhancing the self-healing capabilities of the underlying MRS network. Finally, we conducted numerical simulations to corroborate our theoretical results. In the future, we would like to extend our approach to reconfigure the network despite multiple simultaneous robot failures when deployed in a dynamic environment.  

% In this paper, we proposed a resilient multi-robot coverage control algorithm that enhances the structural resilience of the MRS network during the coverage task. The proposed controller utilizes a nonlinear tracking MPC to simultaneously track Voronoi centroids while \textcolor{red}{maintaining a rigid bearing formation} structure. We proved that the proposed algorithm converges to the centroidal Voronoi configuration. Furthermore, we designed a \textcolor{red}{rigidity recovery algorithm} to reconfigure the MRS network in the event of a robot failure, which computes the set of new recovery edges for the neighbors of the faulty robot. Finally, we showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through a numerical simulation of an MRS with unicycle robot dynamics.

% In the current work, we focused on the static coverage problem and network reconfiguration when only one robot becomes faulty at any given time. In the future, we would like to extend our approach that reconfigures the network despite multiple simultaneous failures in dynamically changing environments.
