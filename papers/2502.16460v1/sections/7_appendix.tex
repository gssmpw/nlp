\section{Convergence Results and Proofs}
\label{app:convergence}
\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{th:convergence}}
The proof is divided into two parts. We first prove the recursive feasibility of the optimization problem throughout the evolution of the robot dynamics. We then prove the closed-loop stability and optimality of the steady-state position $\bar{r}_i^\dagger$ and its corresponding steady-state state-input pair $(\bar{x}_i^\dagger, \bar{u}_i^\dagger)$. For brevity, we define $\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i) := \mu \ell_{i,r}(r_{i,k} - \bar{r}_i) + (1-\mu)\ell_{i,b}(g_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i)$ for the rest of the proof.

We first introduce the following lemma, which will play an important role in proving the stability of the proposed decentralized centroid tracking controller. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:stab_eq}
Suppose Assumptions \ref{ass:invariant}, \ref{ass:dynamics}, \ref{ass:cost}, and \ref{ass:terminal} are met, and each robot dynamics is governed by \eqref{eq:agent_dynamics} with constraints $(x_{i,k},u_{i,k})\in \mathcal{Z}_i$. Consider for a given position setpoint, determined by Voronoi centroid $r_{i,k}$, the optimal steady-state solution of the MPC cost function $J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}_i, \bar{r}_i)$ at time $k$ is given by $(\bar{x}_i^*, \bar{u}_i^*, \bar{r}_i^*)$. Then, when $x_{i,k} = \bar{x}_i^*$, the optimal cost function
$J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}_i, \bar{r}^{\dagger}_i) = \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}^\dagger_i)$
where $\bar{r}_i^{\dagger}$ is same as \eqref{eq:offset_cost}.
%\mu \ell_{i,r}(r_{i,w} - \bar{r}^\dagger_i) + (1-\mu)\ell_{i,b}(g_{i,w}, \bar{r}^\dagger_i)$, 
% where
% \begin{equation*}
%     \bar{r}_i^{\dagger}= \argmin_{\bar{r}_i \in \mathcal{R}_i} \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\bar{r}_i).
% \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let the optimal steady-state solution of the MPC optimization cost $J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}_i, \bar{r}_i)$ at time $k$ be denoted as $(\bar{x}_i^*, \bar{u}_i^*, \bar{r}_i^*)$. By the definition of the MPC cost function \eqref{eq:mpc_cost}, its optimal value, when $x_{i,k} = \bar{x}_i^*$ is, 
\begin{equation}
    J_i^*(\bar{x}_{i}^*, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) =\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*).
\end{equation}
We will use proof by contradiction to prove this result. Let us assume that for a given $\mu \in (0, 1 ]$, $\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) > \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger)$, this implies that $\bar{r}_i^\dagger$ is the unique minimizer of the combined cost function $\ell_{i,c}^\mu(\cdot)$, and $\bar{r}_i^\dagger\neq \bar{r}_i^*$.
Let us define $\hat{r}_i$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:convex_set_ref}
    \hat{r}_i = \beta \bar{r}_i^* + (1-\beta)\bar{r}_i^\dagger, \quad \beta \in [0,1].
\end{equation}
Note that by the definition of $\mathcal{R}_i$, the state-input pair satisfies $(\bar{x}_i^*, \bar{u}_i^*) \in \hat{\mathcal{Z}_i}$ and hence lies in the interior of the constraint set $\mathcal{Z}_i$.
%From the definition of the set $\mathcal{R}_i$, it is clear that $(\bar{x}_i^*, \bar{u}_i^*) \in \hat{\mathcal{Z}_i}$ and hence in the interior of the constraint set $\mathcal{Z}_i$. 
Therefore, there exists a $\hat{\beta} \in [0,1)$, as a consequence of the restricted set $\bar{\mathcal{Z}_i}$ defined earlier, such that for a given $\beta \in [\hat{\beta}, 1]$, it is true that $(\bar{x}^*_{i}, \hat{r}_i) \in \Gamma_i$. That is, the state and the reference centroid lie in the invariant set for centroid tracking, and the sequence of inputs $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_i$ (generated by $\kappa_i(\bar{x}^*_{i}, \hat{r}_i)$) and $\hat{r}_i$ are a feasible solution of \eqref{eq:mpc}. 

Using the optimality of the solution $J_i^*(\cdot)$ and Assumption \ref{ass:terminal} providing bounds on the summation of the stage costs, the following holds:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:stage_cost_bound}
    \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},&g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) = J_i^*(\bar{x}_{i}^*, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) \nonumber
    \\&\leq J_i(\bar{x}_{i}^*, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \hat{\mathbf{u}}_i, \hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    \\&=\sum_{l=0}^{N-1} \ell_{i,l}(x_{i,l|k} - \bar{x}_{i}, \kappa_i(\bar{x}_i^*, \hat{r}_i) -  \bar{u}_i) \nonumber
    \\& + \ell_{i,N}(x_{i,N|k} - \bar{x}_i, \hat{r}_i)+ \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i)
    % \\&\stackrel{\text{(a)}} \leq \ell_{i,N}(\bar{x}^*_{i} - \hat{x}_i, \hat{r}_i) + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    % \\&\stackrel{\text{(b)}}\leq b|\bar{x}^*_{i} - \hat{x}_i|^\rho + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    % \\&\stackrel{\text{(c)}}\leq b \frac{\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \hat{r}_i}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho} + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    % \\&\stackrel{\text{(d)}}\leq b \frac{(1-\beta)^\rho\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho} + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:stage_cost_bound_2}
    \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\bar{r}_i^*) &\stackrel{\text{(a)}} \leq \ell_{i,N}(\bar{x}^*_{i} - \hat{x}_i, \hat{r}_i) + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    \\\stackrel{\text{(b)}}\leq& b|\bar{x}^*_{i} - \hat{x}_i|^\rho + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    \\\stackrel{\text{(c)}}\leq& b \frac{\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \hat{r}_i}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho} + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\hat{r}_i)\nonumber
    \\\stackrel{\text{(d)}}\leq& b \frac{(1-\beta)^\rho\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho} + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\hat{r}_i)
\end{align}
Step $\text{(a)}$ is a result of the summation of \eqref{eq:terminal_lyap_2} on both sides, resulting in the cancellation of alternate terms in the LHS yielding the inequality. For step $\text{(b)}$, we use the property of the terminal cost function \eqref{eq:terminal_lyap_1}. In step $\text{(c)}$, we use the property of the singular value of matrices, $\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \hat{x}_i} \leq \frac{1}{\sigma_{min}(C_i)}\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \hat{r}_i}$, where $\sigma_{min}(\cdot)$ is the minimum singular value of a matrix. Step $\text{(d)}$ is obtained by rearranging terms in \eqref{eq:convex_set_ref} and taking norm on both sides, i.e,  $\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \hat{r}_i} = (1-\beta)\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}$.

By using the convexity of $\ell_{i,r}(\cdot)$ and $\ell_{i,b}(\cdot)$ with \eqref{eq:convex_set_ref}, we have
\begin{align}
     \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\hat{r}_i) \leq \ &\beta \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) \nonumber
     \\&+ (1-\beta)\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger).
\end{align}
Thus, we can derive the following inequality
\begin{align}
      \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},&g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) \leq b \frac{(1-\beta)^\rho|\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger|^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho} \nonumber
      \\&\beta \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) + (1-\beta)\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger)
\end{align}
By rearranging terms, we get
\begin{align}
      \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},&\bar{r}_i^*) - \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger) \nonumber
      \\ &\leq \frac{b(1-\beta)^{\rho-1}\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho}
\end{align}~
Since $\rho>1$, taking limit on both sides as $\beta \rightarrow 1^-$ from the right, we get
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lemma1_cont}
      \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) - \ell_{i,c}^\mu(&r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger) \nonumber
      \\ &\leq \lim_{\beta\rightarrow1^-} \frac{b(1-\beta)^{\rho-1}\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}^\rho}{\bigl(\sigma_{min}(C_i)\bigr)^\rho}\nonumber
       \\& = 0
\end{align}~
Since we initially assumed that the combined cost follows $\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) - \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger)>0$, the inequality \eqref{eq:lemma1_cont} leads to contradiction which proves the result.
\end{proof}~
We will now prove the theorem by first proving the recursive feasibility of the proposed approach.

\textit{Recursive Feasibility}: Let us consider the state of robot $i$ at time $k$ to be $x_{i,k}$, and the optimal solution of the nonlinear centroid tracking control problem \eqref{eq:mpc} with $x_{i,k}$ and $r_{i,k}$ as inputs, is given by $(\mathbf{u}_i^*, \bar{r}_i^*)$. The resulting optimal sequence of the state is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{x}_i^* = [(x_{i,0|k}^*)^\top, (x_{i,1|k}^*)^\top, \dots, (x_{i,N|k}^*)^\top]^\top,
\end{equation}
where $(x_{i,N|k}^*, \bar{r}_i^*) \in \Gamma_i$.

To prove the recursive feasibility, we use identical steps from the standard MPC literature \cite{ferramosca2009mpc,limon2018nonlinear,limon2008mpc}, we define the successor state, $x_{i,k+1} = f_i(x_{i,k}, \kappa_{MPC}(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}))$. We also define the following sequences:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:inp_seq}
    \mathbf{u}_i^+ &= [(u_{i,1|k}^*)^\top, (u_{i,2|k}^*)^\top, \dots, (u_{i,N-1|k}^*)^\top, \kappa_i(x_{i,N|k}^*, \bar{r}_i^*)]^\top, \nonumber
    \\ r_i^+ &=  \bar{r}_i^*
\end{align}
Note that the first $N-1$ entries of the sequence $\mathbf{u}_i^+$ are the optimal control sequence from the optimization step at time $k$. It is augmented by an additional control input using the terminal control law $\kappa_i(\cdot)$. The predicted sequence of states for $x_{i,k+1}$ by choosing the control sequence $\mathbf{u}_i^+$ and $ r_i^+$ as reference centroid is given by:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:state_seq}
    \mathbf{x}_i^+ = [(x_{i,1|k}^*)^\top, \dots, (x_{i,N|k}^*)^\top, (x_{i,N|k+1})^\top]^\top
\end{align}
where $x_{i,N|k+1}$ denotes the terminal state at time $k+1$, given by $x_{i,N|k+1} = f_i(x_{i,N-1|k+1}, \kappa_i(x_{i,N-1|k+1}, \bar{r}_i^*))$. Using the sequence of states in \eqref{eq:state_seq}, we observe that when applying the control sequence $\mathbf{u}_i^+$ at time $k+1$, the following holds: $x_{i,N-1|k+1} = x_{i,N|k}^*$.
As a result, since we have $(x_{i,N|k}^*, \bar{r}_i^*) \in \Gamma_i$, then $(x_{i,N|k+1}^*, \bar{r}_i^*)\in \Gamma_i$.

Therefore, given $x_{i,1|k}^* = x_{i,k+1}$, the control sequence and reference centroid position defined by $(\mathbf{u}_i^+,r_i^+)$ are a feasible solution of \eqref{eq:mpc}. Hence, the proposed control law is well-defined and yields constraint satisfaction consistently throughout the evolution of the robot's dynamics.
%the constraints will be fulfilled throughout the evolution of the robot's dynamics.

\textit{Asymptotic Stability}: We will prove this by showing that the steady-state state-input pair $(\bar{x}_i^\dagger, \bar{u}_i^\dagger)$ corresponding to the minimizer of the combined reference tracking and bearing cost (i.e., $\bar{r}_i^\dagger$) is a stable equilibrium point and it is attractive for the robot dynamics \eqref{eq:agent_dynamics}. To show the stability of $(\bar{x}_i^\dagger, \bar{u}_i^\dagger)$, we demonstrate that the following function defined as
\begin{equation*}
      W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) = J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})-\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger) 
\end{equation*}
is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop robot dynamics in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point.
The terminal control law $u_i = \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i^\dagger)$ is admissible for all $x_{i,k}$ satisfying $\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}\leq \epsilon$, where $\epsilon>0$ can be chosen as a sufficiently small value to ensure that $x_{i,k}$ is in the neighborhood of $\bar{x}_i^\dagger$.
%We assume that there is a sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$ to guarantee that the terminal control law $u_i = \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i^\dagger)$ is admissible for all $x_{i,k}$ satisfying $\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}\leq \epsilon$. 
We now prove that $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})$ is a locally positive-definite function by proving the existence of a pair of suitable class $\mathcal{K}_\infty$ functions, $\alpha_W(\cdot)$ and $\beta_W(\cdot)$, such that 
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}) \leq W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) \leq \beta_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}).
\end{equation*}
Using Assumption \ref{ass:cost}, we can infer that
\begin{align}
    W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})&\geq  \ \ell_i({x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*,u_{i,k} - \bar{u}_i^*}) \nonumber
    \\&+ \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i^*) - \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger) \nonumber
    \\&\geq \alpha_\ell(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}) + \mu \alpha_r(\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}) \nonumber
    \\&\quad + (1-\mu)\alpha_b(\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger})\nonumber 
    \\&\geq \alpha_\ell(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}) + \mu \hat{\alpha}_r(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger})\nonumber
    \\&\quad + (1-\mu)\hat{\alpha}_b(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}),\nonumber
\end{align}
% \begin{align}
%     % W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,w}, g_{i,w})&\geq  \ \ell_i({x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*,u_{i,k} - \bar{u}_i^*}) \nonumber
%     % \\&+ \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w}, \bar{r}_i^*) - \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,w},g_{i,w},\bar{r}_i^\dagger) \nonumber
%     W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,w}, g_{i,w}) &\geq \alpha_\ell(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}) + \mu \alpha_r(\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger}) \nonumber
%     \\&\quad + (1-\mu)\alpha_b(\norm{\bar{r}_i^* - \bar{r}_i^\dagger})\nonumber 
%     \\&\geq \alpha_\ell(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}) + \mu \hat{\alpha}_r(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger})\nonumber
%     \\&\quad + (1-\mu)\hat{\alpha}_b(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}),
% \end{align}
where $\hat{\alpha}_r(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}) = \alpha_r\bigl(\sigma_{max}(C_i)\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}\bigr)$ and $\hat{\alpha}_b(\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}) = \alpha_b\bigl(\sigma_{max}(C_i)\norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}\bigr)$ are class $\mathcal{K}_\infty$ functions with $\sigma_{max}(C_i)$ as the maximum singular value of the matrix $C_i$. Then, there exists a class $\mathcal{K}_\infty$ function $\alpha_W(\cdot)$ such that 
\begin{align}
    W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,w}, g_{i,w}) &\geq \alpha_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*} + \norm{\bar{x}_i^* - \bar{x}_i^\dagger})\nonumber\\
    &\geq \alpha_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}).
\end{align}
Consider the input sequence generated by the local control law using $\bar{r}_i^\dagger$ to be the centroid reference position $\mathbf{u}^\kappa_{i} = \big[\bigl(\kappa_i(x_{i,0|k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger)\bigr)^\top, \dots, \bigl(\kappa_i(x_{i,N|k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger)\bigr)^\top\big]^\top$. This sequence will be feasible and satisfies the following inequality,
\begin{align}
    J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) &\leq J_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}^\kappa_i, \bar{r}_i^\dagger)\nonumber\\
    \leq \ell_{i,N}&(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger, \bar{r}_i^\dagger) + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^\dagger).
\end{align}
The above inequality results from the summation of \eqref{eq:terminal_lyap_2} on both sides, following step $\text{(a)}$ in \eqref{eq:stage_cost_bound}.

Using the above inequality and the conditions from Assumption \ref{ass:invariant}, we get
\begin{align}
    W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) & \leq\ell_{i,N}(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger, \bar{r}_i^\dagger) \leq b\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}\nonumber\\
    &\leq \beta_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}).
\end{align}

Next, we have to prove that $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})$ is a strictly decreasing function if $x_{i,k}\neq \bar{x}_{i}^*$. We define $J_i(x_{i,k+1}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}_i^+, \bar{r}_i^*)$ as the cost function evaluated at the successor state $x_{i,k+1} = f_i(x_{i,k}, \kappa_{MPC}(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}))$ with $\mathbf{u}_i^+$ as the input sequence and $\bar{r}_i^*$ as the position of the reference centroid defined in \eqref{eq:inp_seq}. Using Assumption \ref{ass:terminal} and standard procedures in deriving closed-loop stability of standard MPC \cite{limon2008mpc, limon2018nonlinear, ferramosca2009mpc}, we obtain:
\begin{align}
    \Delta&W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})\nonumber
    \\&= W_i(x_{i,k+1}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) - W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})\nonumber
    \\&= J_i^*(x_{i,k+1}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) - J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})\nonumber
    \\&\leq J_i(x_{i,k+1}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}; \mathbf{u}_i^+, \bar{r}_i^*) - J_i^*(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})\nonumber
    \\&=-\ell_{i}(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*, u_{i,k} - \bar{u}_i^*)-\ell_{i,N}(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*, \bar{r}_i^*)\nonumber
    \\&-\ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*) +\ell_{i}(x_{i,N|k} - \bar{x}_i^*, \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i^*) - \bar{u}_i^*)\nonumber
    \\&+\ell_{i,N}(x_{i,N|k+1} - \bar{x}_i^*, \bar{r}_i^*) + \ell_{i,c}^\mu(r_{i,k},g_{i,k},\bar{r}_i^*), 
\end{align}
where $x_{i,N|k+1}$ denotes the terminal state at time $k+1$, given by $x_{i,N|k+1} = f_i(x_{i,N|k}^*, \kappa_i(x_{i,N|k}^*, \bar{r}_i^*))$.
Using the definition of $\ell_{i,N}(\cdot)$ from Assumption \ref{ass:terminal} and positive definiteness of the stage cost function from Assumption \ref{ass:cost}, we obtain the following inequality:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:deltaW}
    \Delta W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) &\leq -\ell_{i}(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*, u_{i,k} - \bar{u}_i^*)\nonumber
    \\ &\leq\alpha_l(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}).
\end{align}
Then, since $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})$ is a Lyapunov function, we can guarantee the closed-loop stability.
To demonstrate the convergence of the robot positions to the optimal Voronoi centroids, i.e.,  $r_{i,k}$, we first show that at each time $k$, the proposed controller leads the robot states to asymptotically converge to $\bar{x}_i^*$. This is evident from the inequality \eqref{eq:deltaW} as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    W_i(x_{i,k+1}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) - W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) \leq\alpha_l(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}),
\end{equation*}
leads to the following result,
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*} = 0.
\end{equation}
% Since $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,w}, g_{i,w})\geq0$, we can write
% \begin{equation*}
%     \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,w}, g_{i,w}) = W_{i,\infty}.
% \end{equation*}
Next, using the results from Lemma \ref{lem:stab_eq}, we have that if $\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*}=0$, then $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) =0$. Therefore, since $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^*} = 0$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) = W_{i,\infty} = 0.
\end{equation}
Using the positive definiteness of $W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k})$ derived earlier, 
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\alpha_W(\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}) \leq \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}W_i(x_{i,k}, r_{i,k}, g_{i,k}) = 0.
\end{equation*}
Thus, we get $ \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}= 0$, which proves the result.
% Thus, we obtain 
% \begin{equation}
%     \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\norm{x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i^\dagger}= 0.
% \end{equation}
% This proves the result.
\section{Calculation of Terminal Ingredients}
\label{app:terminal}
To ensure the convergence of the proposed nonlinear tracking MPC, we consider an LQR based design \cite{carron2020model,chen1998quasi} for terminal ingredients, i.e., a terminal control law and an invariant set for centroid tracking.
% The proposed distributed coverage control based on nonlinear MPC framework requires terminal ingredients, i.e., a terminal control law and an invariant set for centroid tracking to ensure its convergence. \textcolor{red}{We leverage the method proposed in \cite{carron2020model}, which is an extended version of \cite{chen1998quasi} for a discrete-time system.} We will now present the design of the terminal control law and the invariant terminal set for centroid tracking.
\subsection{Terminal Control Law}
The terminal control law is derived for the linearized system, where the robot dynamics is linearized at the steady-state state-input pair $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)$ corresponding to the centroid reference position $\bar{r}_i$. As a result, we get the following state and input matrices.
% The terminal control law is computed for the linearized system. The linearization is performed on the steady-state state-input pair $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)$ corresponding to the centroid reference position $\bar{r}_i$. The linearization yields the following state and input matrices.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linearized}
    A_{i} = \frac{\partial f_i(x_{i}, u_{i})}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)}, \quad B_{i} = \frac{\partial f_i(x_i, u_i)}{\partial u_i}\bigg|_{(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)}
\end{equation}
The terminal control law $\kappa_i(x_i, \bar{r}_i) = K_i(x_i - \bar{x}_i)$, where $K_i$ is computed using LQR controller design for the linearized robot dynamics \eqref{eq:linearized}. The gain $K_i$ is designed so that the nonlinear robot dynamics is asymptotically stable in the neighborhood of $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)$.
%The gain $K_i$ is designed to asymptotically stabilize the nonlinear system in the neighborhood of $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)$.%, see \cite{kirk2004optimal}.

\subsection{Terminal Invariant Set for Centroid Tracking}
% \textcolor{red}{We adopt the method presented in \cite{carron2020model}, which is an extension of \cite{chen1998quasi} for discrete-time nonlinear coverage control problem.} 
The following lemma \cite{chen1998quasi} provides a region of attraction, i.e., characterization and design for the terminal invariant set for the robot dynamics controlled by a local linear state-feedback control.
\begin{lemma}
Suppose the closed-loop system $x_{i,k+1} = f_i(x_{i,k}, \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i))$ is stabilizable at $(\bar{x}_i, \bar{u}_i)$, and let the linearized closed-loop dynamics under the stabilizing controller $u_{i,k} = \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i)$ be defined as $A_{i,K} = A_i+BK_i$. Then,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a unique positive definite and symmetric solution $P_i$, which satisfies
    \begin{equation}
        \biggl(\frac{A_{i,K}}{\sqrt{1-c_i}}\biggr)^\top P_i\biggl(\frac{A_{i,K}}{\sqrt{1-c_i}}\biggr) - P_i = -Q_i^*
    \end{equation}
    where $Q_i^* = Q + K_i^\top R_i K_i$ is positive definite and symmetric, and $c_i$ satisfies 
    \begin{equation*}
        c_i < 1 - |\lambda_{\text{max}}(A_{i,K})|^2.
    \end{equation*}
    \item The following set $\Gamma_i(\zeta_i)$ is an invariant set for some $\zeta_i\in (0, \infty)$:
    %There exists a constant $\zeta_i\in (0, \infty)$ specifying an invariant set 
    \begin{multline*}
        \Gamma_i(\zeta_i) = \{ (x_{i,k},\bar{r}_i) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}\times \mathbb{R}^{d} \ | \\ (x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i)^\top P_i (x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_i) \leq \alpha_i, \  \bar{r}_i = C_i\bar{x}_i\},
    \end{multline*}
    such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The controller $u_{i,k} = \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i)$ for all $(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i) \in \Gamma_i(\zeta_i)$ satisfies the state and input constraints  $(x_{i,k}, u_{i,k}) \in \mathcal{Z}_i$.
        \item The set $\Gamma_i(\zeta_i)$ represents an invariant set for the nonlinear system \eqref{eq:agent_dynamics} controlled by the local control law $u_{i,k} = \kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i)$.
        \item For any $(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i) \in \Gamma_i(\zeta_i)$ with inputs obtained from the local control law $u_{i,k}=\kappa_i(x_{i,k}, \bar{r}_i)$, the infinite horizon cost starting at time $\tilde{k}>0$  
        \begin{equation*}
            J_i^\infty(\tilde{x}_{i}, u_{i,k}) = \sum_{k=\tilde{k}}^\infty x_{i,k}^\top Q_i x_{i,k} + u_{i,k}^\top R_i u_{i,k}
        \end{equation*}
        where $Q_i>0$ and $R_i>0$ represent positive definite matrices. The above cost function starting from $x_{i,\tilde{k}}= \tilde{x}_i$ subject to the nonlinear robot dynamics \eqref{ass:dynamics} is bounded. The bound is given by:
        \begin{equation*}
            J_i^\infty(\tilde{x}_{i}, u_{i,k}) \leq \tilde{x}_{i}^\top P_i \tilde{x}_{i}.
        \end{equation*}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is an immediate consequence of the result \cite[Lem. 4]{carron2020model}.
