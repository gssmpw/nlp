\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present the PPG, a pluggable framework designed to endow SAM and SAM 2 with auto-prompting and enhanced their interactive capabilities. Our PPG employs a CSM to extract contextual information from non-target data and a CCM to interpret user intentions, enabling it to generate efficient PP that effectively guides the model output to meet user needs. The PPG also can be implanted into other LVMs, continuously integrating cutting-edge foundation models to meet the evolving demands in widespread medical applications.
