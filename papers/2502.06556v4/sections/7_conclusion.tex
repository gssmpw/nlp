In conclusion, we build a reliable and high-quality project-level unit test generation benchmark -- ProjectTest -- with three programming languages. We comprehensively evaluate nine LLMs' unit test generation abilities with/without manual fixing and LLM self-fixing mechanism on ProjectTest. Besides, we conduct comprehensive error analyses per programming language.
