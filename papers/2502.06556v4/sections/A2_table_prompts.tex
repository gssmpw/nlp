%four prompts

%Python:
%Please generate enough unit test cases for each python file in the {method_signature} project. Ensure that the import path is correct, depending on whether the project is structured as a package. Make sure the tests can successfully compile. Make sure the tests have correct results. Try to achieve the highest coverage rate.

%Java:
%Please generate enough unit test cases for each java file in the {method_signature} project. Ensure to use mock properly for unit tests.
%Make sure the tests can successfully compile. Make sure the tests have correct results. Try to achieve the highest coverage rate.


%JS:
%Please generate enough unit test cases for every javascript file in {method_signature} project. Make sure the tests can successfully compile. Make sure the tests have correct results. Try to achieve the highest coverage rate.


%Python with comment signs:
%# {classname}\_test.py\n 
%# Test class of {classname}.\n 
%# Please generate enough unit test cases for each python file in the {method_signature} project. Ensure that the import path is correct, depending on whether the project is structured as a package.
