Our study has several limitations. First, due to our capacity, we mainly focus on three programming languages—Python, Java, and JavaScript—missing the chance to include other languages like C and C\#. Additionally, given the fact that the input length restrictions of current LLMs make them unsuitable for handling larger projects in their entirety, 
%as they may miss some information and fail to generate sufficient or high-quality unit tests for extensive codebases. 
we selected moderate-sized projects, allowing us to explore issues like the robustness of LLMs in unit test generation (e.g., hallucinations or incorrect assertions) rather than focusing solely on their ability to handle long-context inputs. 
% However, this approach may not fully capture the challenges of applying LLMs to larger-scale projects.
