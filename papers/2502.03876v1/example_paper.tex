\begin{abstract}
% 3D point-cloud anomaly detection is a real-world question underlying industry and computer science. However, in manufacturing, epically personalized manufacturing, obtaining amounts of training data is impossible. This paper aims to propose a review for untrained point-cloud anomaly detection method. Compared with unsupervised learning, untrained method doesn't require any data even unlabeled data. On the contrary, it requires some prior knowledge about the distribution of the points. 
% We are going to discuss this question in four chapters. Chapter 1 will be the introduction to the 3D point-cloud anomaly detection and related works. Chapter 2 will define the problem in mathematics and discuss two routes for solutions, decomposing and classification. Chapter 3 will review current works for point-cloud anomaly detection, and Chapter 4 will discuss the relationship between point-cloud anomaly detection and inverse problems, and consider some potential method for solutions.

% 3D point-cloud anomaly detection is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and computer science. In the context of production, particularly in personalized manufacturing, acquiring large amounts of training data is often infeasible. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of untrained point-cloud anomaly detection methods. Unlike unsupervised learning, untrained methods do not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the distribution of points.

% This paper is organized into four chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the problem of 3D point-cloud anomaly detection and reviews related works. Chapter 2 provides a formal definition of the problem and explores two potential solution approaches: decomposition and classification. Chapter 3 reviews existing methods for point-cloud anomaly detection. Finally, Chapter 4 examines the relationship between point-cloud anomaly detection and inverse problems, and discusses potential methodologies for addressing this challenge.

Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research problem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing that only one sample can be collected without any additional labels. How to accurately identify anomalies based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Unlike unsupervised learning, untrained methods do not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the manufacturing surfaces and anomalies. Examples are used to illustrate these prior knowledge and untrained machine learning model. Afterwards, literature review on untrained anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is also provided, and the potential of untrained deep neural networks for anomaly detection is also discussed as outlooks.
