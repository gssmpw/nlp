It can be seen that sentiments and emotions play important roles in multi-task fake news detection.

\subsection{Emotion-based Misinformation Detection}

Emotion and sentiment are important features in detecting misinformation ____. 
% {\bf I ADDED THIS SENTENCE TO FIX THE EMOTION-SENTIMENT PROBLEM...PLS CONFIRM} In our work we recognize that positive sentiment correlates with positive emotion and vice versa and use emotion as the principal labeling. 
____ introduce multitask frameworks for incorporating sentiment/emotion as auxiliary tasks to enhance the main misinformation detection task. ____ propose the FakeFlow for fake news detection that can capture the flow of affective information by combining topic and sentiments. ____ adapt LLMs for misinformation detection by levering affective information based on fine-tuning and RAG techniques respectively. However, these models are only applicable to fake source text and do not consider social content. ____ develop an attention-based mechanism by combining CNN and Bi-GRU for enriched extraction of dual emotion features. ____ analyze the relationship between dual emotions and propose dual emotion features, which can be plugged into existing fake news detectors. ____ further fuses the author's visual emotion for multi-modal rumor detection. These works indicate the importance of dual emotion features.
