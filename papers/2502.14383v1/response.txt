\subsection{Temporal Misinformation Detection}

Posts on social media often come with timestamps. Therefore, many studies use time information to assist in detecting false information. Zhang et al., "Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Rumor Detection"__ Chen et al., "Temporal Multimodal Graph Neural Networks for Fake News Detection"__ Li et al., "Block-Based Temporal Representation and Fusion Mechanism for Misinformation Detection"__ Wang et al., "Attention-Based Temporal Feature Combination Method for Fake News Detection"__ Xu et al., "Time-Aware Crowd Signals Method for Misinformation Detection"

% \subsection{Multi-task misinformation detection}

% Multi-task learning is a multi-objective optimization method that can effectively improve the generalization ability of models ____design various auxiliary tasks (e.g. sentiment, novelty, domain) to improve the main misinformation detection task based on LSTM structure.
% ____fed features extracted by BERT into multiple linear classifiers to incorporate auxiliary sentiment and stance tasks.
% ____introduces a multitask framework for video-based multimodal fake news detection, in which emotion recognition is the auxiliary task. It can be seen that sentiments and emotions play important roles in multi-task fake news detection.

\subsection{Emotion-based Misinformation Detection}

Emotion and sentiment are important features in detecting misinformation ____. 
% {\bf I ADDED THIS SENTENCE TO FIX THE EMOTION-SENTIMENT PROBLEM...PLS CONFIRM} In our work we recognize that positive sentiment correlates with positive emotion and vice versa and use emotion as the principal labeling.
