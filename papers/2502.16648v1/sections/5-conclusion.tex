\section{Conclusion}
We present a novel approach to \textit{Few-shot Continual Relation Extraction} that integrates \textit{Open Information Extraction (OIE)} for addressing undetermined relations. By incorporating leveraging OIE and structured descriptions, our method effectively improves performance of FCRE models. In addition, we are also the first work that explores and elevates \textit{Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)} in the setting of Continual Learning. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.
