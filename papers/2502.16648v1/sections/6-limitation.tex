\section{Limitation}
The dataset labeled with UR (undetermined relations) may, in fact, contain instances that align with predefined relation types, though the original annotators did not indicate this. As we cannot be sure that every instance is a true relation, we continue to assign them to the UR category and test using the same data and settings for all methods to ensure fairness. Note that further data verification is beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, training and testing with a large number of undetermined relations is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, optimizing this process can be considered as future work to improve efficiency.
