\begin{abstract}
% This document is a supplement to the general instructions for *ACL authors. It contains instructions for using the \LaTeX{} style file for ACL 2023.
% The document itself conforms to its own specifications, and is, therefore, an example of what your manuscript should look like.
% These instructions should be used both for papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted papers.
% Few-shot continual relation extraction has recently shown effectiveness in retaining prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, models often encounter situations where either no relations are present or they are faced with previously unseen relation types. In such cases, the model must be able to correctly identify and extract these unknown relation types, which is especially valuable for tasks like graph construction and relation extraction. Despite this, most existing approaches either fail to account for these complex scenarios or adopt overly simplistic designs with limited entity sets, which fall short of the diverse entity-relation pairs found in natural language. In this paper, we propose more realistic scenarios that are optimized for few-shot continual relation extraction, enabling models to effectively learn established relation types while also extracting previously undetermined ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through Open Information Extraction (OIE), a method commonly used in graph construction tasks, and highlight its potential to improve performance in real-world graph-related problems.
Typically, \textit{Few-shot Continual Relation Extraction (FCRE)} models must balance retaining prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks with extremely limited data. However, real-world scenarios may also involve unseen or undetermined relations that existing methods still struggle to handle. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages the \textit{Open Information Extraction} concept of \textit{Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)}. Our method not only exposes models to all possible pairs of relations, including determined and undetermined labels not available in the training set, but also enriches model knowledge with diverse relation descriptions, thereby enhancing knowledge retention and adaptability in this challenging scenario. In the perspective of KGC, this is the first work explored in the setting of Continual Learning, allowing efficient expansion of the graph as the data evolves. 
Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art FCRE baselines, as well as the efficiency in handling dynamic graph construction in this setting.

% \section{Experiments}

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Footnotes are inserted with the \verb|\footnote| command.\footnote{This is a footnote.}

% \subsection{Tables and figures}

% See Table~\ref{tab:accents} for an example of a table and its caption.
% \textbf{Do not override the default caption sizes.}

% \subsection{Hyperlinks}

% Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
% \begin{quote}
% \tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
% \end{quote}
% This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

% \subsection{Citations}



% Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
% We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
% You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

% \subsection{References}

% \nocite{Ando2005,augenstein-etal-2016-stance,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015,goodman-etal-2016-noise,harper-2014-learning}

% The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
% If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
% \bibliography{custom}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{quote}
% You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/Anthology/Anthology.bib.gz}.
% To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
% \bibliography{anthology,custom}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{quote}
% Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

% \subsection{Appendices}

% Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

% \section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
% \label{sec:bibtex}

% Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

% Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
% Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
% If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.

% \section*{Limitations}
% ACL 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.
% The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.

% While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
% Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
% In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

% \section*{Ethics Statement}
% Scientific work published at ACL 2023 must comply with the ACL Ethics Policy.\footnote{\url{https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics}} We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).
