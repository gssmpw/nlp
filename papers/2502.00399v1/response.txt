\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{2.1 Vertiport Location Selection}
Vertiports, which are essential infrastructure for UAM, should be installed in appropriate locations considering demand, economic feasibility, operational capability, and safety. Numerous studies employing various methodologies have been conducted to address these considerations.

The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method involves making optimal choices by assessing multiple evaluation criteria across different options, employing techniques such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Focus Group Interviews (FGI). Fadhil (2018), "Optimization of UAM Ground Infrastructure Placement" ____ Lee et al. (2023), "Multi-Criteria Decision Making for Optimal Vertiport and UAM Network Design" ____ Recent studies have adequately considered whether the area is permissible for flight.

From a data-driven perspective, recent studies on Vertiport location assessment have utilized data from four major categories—spatial, mobility, environmental, and socio-economic—for conducting multifaceted analyses. Straubinger et al. (2021), "Evaluating Urban Spatial Structures for UAM Ecosystem" ____ Bulusu et al. (2021), "Feasible Combinations of Vertiport Locations Using Traffic Data" ____ Kotwicz Herniczek et al. (2022), "Impact of Airspace Restrictions on Vertiports and UAM Routes" ____ EASA (2021), "Social Acceptance of UAM in Europe" ____ Other related literature is summarized in Table \ref{tab:Major Data}.


\subsection{2.2 Integration of UAM with Existing Transportation Systems}

Since the emergence of the UAM concept, researchers have proposed various approaches for integrating Vertiports into the existing transportation system. Fadhil (2018), "UAV-Based Urban Air Mobility Infrastructure Location Optimization" ____ Rajendran et al. (2019), "Airport Accessibility Enhancement through Vertiport Integration" ____ Wang et al. (2023), "Vertiport-to-Airport Transfer Service for Conventional Air Transportation" ____ Those studies have focused on transfers between UAM and existing urban transportation networks, and the idea of linking highway infrastructure with UAM has not been proposed.
