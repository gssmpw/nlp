\caption{\textbf{Overall architecture of our proposed \modelname.}  \modelname is based on Stable Diffusion, and can take random noise or a reference frame as input to generate new or specific scenes. Afterwards, \modelname generates video sequences from frame 1 to frame N orderly. We employ the proposed latent variable propagation module to feed the denoised latent features at previous frame to current frame as the noise prior, which can maintain video temporal consistency.  This frame-by-frame generation strategy enables to generate videos of arbitrary lengths. In addition, we employ ControlNet~\citep{zhang2023adding} to introduce BEV layout for fine-grained control on data generation.}
