\caption{\textbf{Comparison of Unisim, Panacea, and our proposed Glad:} (a) The Nerf-based Unisim \citep{yang2023unisim} struggles to render unseen scene and objects when the simulated ego trajectory deviates from the source data. (b) The diffusion-based Panacea \citep{wen2023panacea} generates fixed-length video data in an offline manner. It suffers from relatively high memory  consumption, and lacks the  adaptability to accommodate variations in dynamic simulated trajectory.  (c) Our  \modelname is designed for fame-by-frame generation, enabling to generate videos of arbitrary lengths and exhibiting good flexibility in the variations of simulated trajectory.}
