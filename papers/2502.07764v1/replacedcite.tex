\paragraph{Constrained RL.} It is known that stochastic expectation-constrained policies are polynomial-time computable via linear programming ____, and many planning and learning algorithms exist for them ____. Some learning algorithms can even avoid violation during the learning process under certain assumptions____. Furthermore, ____ developed no-regret algorithms for cMDPs and extended their algorithms to the setting with a constraint on the cost accumulated over all episodes, which is called a knapsack constraint____.


\paragraph{Safe RL.} The safe RL community____ has mainly focused on no-violation learning for stochastic expectation-constrained policies____ and solving chance constraints____, which capture the probability of entering unsafe states. Performing learning while avoiding dangerous states____ is a special case of expectation constraints that has also been studied____ under non-trivial assumptions. In addition, instantaneous constraints, which require the immediate cost to be within budget at all times, have also been studied____.
