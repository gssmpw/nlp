The JIRIAF Resource Manager (JRM) serves as an integral component of the framework, effectively leveraging the Kubernetes framework with Virtual Kubelet \cite{virtual-kubelet}. A fundamental Kubernetes cluster comprises a master node/control plane that oversees cluster management and worker nodes with kubelets connected to the containerd socket for container execution. Given that installing a regular kubelet necessitates root credentials, which are typically unavailable to ordinary users at compute sites, we employ the Virtual Kubelet to circumvent this limitation while still utilizing the Kubernetes framework. The Virtual-Kubelet-Cmd (VK) is a virtual kubelet implemented using BASH commands and operates in userspace. It translates a container into a BASH script composed of several processes. This approach serving as JRM allows JIRIAF to execute user applications as containers across various computing sites by simply running BASH commands in userspace, all the while ensuring unified control and monitoring through Kubernetes.
