\section{Conclusion}


This paper presents \ours{}, a step toward more efficient and responsible web crawling for LLM pretraining. 
By prioritizing documents based on the pretraining needs, our method improves crawling efficiency and reduces unnecessary crawling, easing the burden on web hosts.
While fair use of web data remains a critical challenge, we hope that \ours{} can help mitigate these concerns and promote more compliant and sustainable practices in obtaining pretraining data for LLMs.
