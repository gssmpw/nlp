Can we do a small scale page rank and show that in degree correlations well with page rank? we can put it here as figure 2b. we should also cite a bunch of references that state in degree is a good surrogate of PageRank. Also GPT-2's pretraining corpus, WebText, used in-degree from Reddit as data selection score. cite and discuss it too.}}
