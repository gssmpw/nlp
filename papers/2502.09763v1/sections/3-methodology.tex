\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
%In order to understand and model deception attacks in \MR environments, it is necessary to employ a systematic and comprehensive methodology.


We employed a systematic methodology that included an extensive literature review and development of theoretical models to describe the \MR deception attacks.
The literature review identified relevant theories, models, attacks, and empirical outcomes, which informed each step in our process (Figure~\ref{fig:method}). 
Using our review and expert knowledge, we derived an ontology of \MR deception attacks (Figure~\ref{fig:attacks-mindmap}). 
We connected technical attacks from the literature to our ontology (Table~\ref{tab:attacks}).
Subsequently, we integrated an information-theoretic perspective to examine how deception attacks impact information communication in \MR (Figure~\ref{fig:mr-communication-model}). Next, we developed a decision-making model that describes how cognitive processes handle sensory stimuli from \MR headsets (Figure~\ref{fig:process-model}). Finally, we combined our ontology and two models to derive a framework for assessing the cognitive effects of \MR deception attacks on decision-making (Table~\ref{tab:framework}). %Each step of our methodology is essential in building an in-depth understanding and framework of the subject.

\emph{\textbf{Literature Review}}\addition{~(Section~\ref{sec:relwork})}: 
We conducted a systematic literature review covering a wide range of topics, including deception, privacy, perceptual manipulation, cognition, and decision-making.
%defined by explicit criteria for the inclusion and exclusion, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant topics. 
We used Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, MIT Press, and APA PsycArticles. % to collect relevant articles. 
Search terms included mixes of ``\AR/\VR Security'', ``\MR Deception'', ``Perceptual Manipulation'', and ``Decision-Making''. 
We collected articles from reputable journals and conference proceedings, including  USENIX Security, S\&P, ISMAR, IEEE VR, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology. 
We limited articles to those published in the past five years to ensure relevance to current \MR technologies. 
However, we additionally took into account important historical works that had significant impact. % on the field. 
We focused on articles %that clearly addressed our research focus and only considered those 
with well-defined research questions, comprehensive analysis, and innovative contributions.

The filtering process began by retrieving over 200 articles from search engines and databases. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts for relevance to ensure a consensus-based approach. The criteria for relevance included: alignment with \textbf{\MR security}, \textbf{information theory}, \textbf{cognition}, and \textbf{deception psychology}; presence of well-defined research questions; and contributions to the field's innovation and depth of analysis. 
%We assessed the research questions and contributions. 
We reviewed full texts to confirm suitability based on the depth of analysis, innovation, and relevance to our research objectives. 
Articles were excluded if they lacked depth of analysis, innovation, or relevance to the key themes. % of MR security, information theory, deception psychology, and cognition.
%Articles that met all inclusion criteria were selected. %After the full-text review, we included articles that met all inclusion criteria and contributed significantly to understanding MR security, privacy-related attacks, and the psychological impacts of virtual deception and manipulation. 
This resulted in a final selection of ($n=80$) articles across different domains, which are categorized in Table \ref{tab:PaperCategories}.

% To compile a comprehensive list of relevant articles, we employed a systematic methodology, reviewing, categorizing, and evaluating prior literature. 
% Our team of researchers identified various articles defining a range of paramount definitions, concepts, and theories used within this review. 
% These topics include but are not limited to: \MR, virtual deception, information processing, and human cognition. 
% The amassed data subsequently underwent a secondary analysis wherein we meticulously categorized and interrelated the found information, establishing the groundwork for deriving an ontology and mind map. 
%Thus, establishing the groundwork for the development of a comprehensive research framework.

%\subsection{\MR Deception Attacks Ontology}
%\item 
\emph{\textbf{\MR Deception Attacks Ontology}}\addition{~(Section~\ref{sec:decattacks})}: After our literature review, two researchers iteratively outlined an encyclopedic map of identified deception attacks. The iterative process was enhanced using the mini-Delphi method \cite{dalkey1963experimental, pan1996mini} in which two subject matter experts reviewed and further refined the ontology across each iteration. The outcome was a mind map of deception attacks in \ac{MR} (Figure~\ref{fig:attacks-mindmap}).
Then, we characterized how technical attacks identified in our literature review fit within the newly developed ontology~(Table~\ref{tab:attacks}).

%\subsection{Information-Theoretic Model of Deception Attacks in \MR}
%\item 
\emph{\textbf{Information Theory and Deception Attacks}}\addition{~(Section~\ref{sec:information-theoretic})}: We derive an information-theoretic model to describe how \MR deception attacks affect information communication. We employ Borden-Kopp's deception model \cite{kopp:2018} that uses Shannon's information theory \cite{shannon1948mathematical} to formulate how information is transmitted from a source (e.g., \MR application) to a user via a \MR headset. Additionally, we utilize Vitanyi's model of mimicry \cite{Vitanyi} to mathematically assess differences between source-generated messages and those created by an attacker. %, which helps with the identification and measurement of deception.


%\subsection{\MR Decision-Making Model}
 \emph{\textbf{Decision-Making and Deception Attacks}}\addition{~(Section~\ref{sec:decision-making})}: We used our \MR Deception Ontology and our review of deception psychology and cognition literature to develop an \MR Decision-Making Model. This model connects cognitive processes of perception, attention, memory, and decision-making to types of deception attacks. This process involved a mini-Delphi approach in which renditions of the model were iteratively revised using expert knowledge and prior literature.

 %\subsection{\MR Threat-Modeling Cognitive Framework}
 \emph{\textbf{\MR \acf{DAF}}}\addition{~(Section~\ref{sec:cog-framework})}: We utilize our two models to develop a framework for analyzing the effects of \MR deception attacks on information communication and human cognition. This framework allows for qualitatively evaluating the impact of MR deception attacks on cognitive processes associated with perception, attention, memory. 
 %Such evaluations are useful for assessing damage in threat modeling approaches (Appendix~\ref{app:using-daf}).
 %Table~\ref{tab:framework} provides a general account of how categories of MR deception attacks from our ontology affect information transmission and cognition. %This table is a crucial element of our framework, facilitating an in-depth understanding of the utilization of information-theoretic principles to detect and mitigate the effects of deception attacks in MR environments.

\finding{Our multidisciplinary methodology shows how to connect disparate knowledge into an ensemble framework. As computing becomes more ubiquitous, security challenges require broader perspectives and analysis, particularly in terms of human cognition. We are not aware of other work that connects literature and theories from cybersecurity, \MR, and cognitive sciences into a cohesive framework.}

 % This framework classifies attacks according to their operational mechanisms, which can be overt, covert, involving degradation, denial, corruption, or subversion, and the cognitive processes they aim to disrupt. The purpose of mapping these attacks to the aspects of human cognition they exploit is to offer a systematic understanding of the potential vulnerabilities that exist in MR environments. The methodology entails analyzing channel characteristics, such as bandwidth ($W$), signal ($S$), noise ($N$), and mimicry ($M$), in relation to MR deception. In addition, this study evaluates the impact of these attacks on the perception mechanisms, including active/passive ($A/P$) perception, selection ($Sel$), organization ($Org$), and interpretation ($Int$). It also examines the effects on attention and memory.
