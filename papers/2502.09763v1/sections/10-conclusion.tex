%What are the different types of deception attacks within MR systems, and how can they be organized in a meaningful way? 
\MR technologies provide a wide range of opportunities while raising significant cybersecurity challenges. 
\MR systems influence how we perceive physical and virtual environments, making them particularly susceptible to deception attacks.
This multidisciplinary SoK brings together diverse knowledge to provide a systematic way for categorizing and analyzing \MR deceptive attacks and their effects. 
It serves as a foundation and guide for future research.
%What does prior literature say about MR deception attacks, and how can we use it to inform ongoing discussion in the field?
Our examination indicates that while there is a growing interest in \MR security and a number of technical attacks, there is a lack of comprehensive research regarding deception attacks, particularly with regards to information communication and human cognition. 
Future work should investigate empirical studies of how \MR deception attacks affect cognitive processes.
Such studies can inform new techniques for detecting and mitigating threats from \MR deception attacks.
\addition{We envision \DAF as a generalizable framework; however, specialized domains may possess nuances not fully captured by \DAF.
%Further, new \MR technologies may lead to new categories of deception attacks. 
While we expect our information-theoretic approach to remain valid across \MR technologies, where information is still transmitted and processed,
it may be necessary to extend \DAF through new metrics and additional models.
We look forward to seeing how researchers can leverage \DAF in studies of deception.}
%We bridge this gap, drawing from past works and contributing to the ongoing research. %Our \MR cognitive framework that we have developed achieves this balance.
%Going forward, this framework allows both researchers and practitioners to describe, discuss, and, most importantly, systematically formulate the effects of these attacks.


%How do we formulate MR deception attacks in a systematic manner to help researchers and practitioners discuss and study attacks and their effects?
%Formulating \MR deception attacks has two challenges: it must be accurate enough for academic evaluation, while also being applicable in practical scenarios. 

%How do MR deception attacks affect decision-making processes?
%One area of significant research interest is related to the impact of \MR deception attacks on decision-making processes. The \MR decision-making model that we have presented in our research, provides valuable insights into the impact of deceptive content on users' perceptions leading to misinformed decisions with potentially severe outcomes.

%What guidance can we give MR system/hardware designers in dealing with deception attacks and their effects?


%What are directions for future work in studying MR deception?
