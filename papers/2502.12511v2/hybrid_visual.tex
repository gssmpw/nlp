    \caption{Hybrid model training. A three-second spectrogram is sampled and made into patches. After masking, the patches are processed by their respective tokenizer, consisting of a linear projection and positional embedding. The resulting tokens are fed to a shared encoder/projector module. To compute the hybrid loss, two forward passes are performed with vertical and square patches. The hybrid loss is the average of the vertical and square losses.}
