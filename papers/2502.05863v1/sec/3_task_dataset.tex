\section{Preliminary}
\subsection{Task Formulation}
We provide a formal problem formulation for query-based retrieval.
Specifically, given an image $I_i$ or a text prompt $P_t$ from the style-specific query set $Q_s$, the retrieval model needs to compute the score between input and target queries and rank the corresponding answers $A$ as high as possible. In the task settings for STEM education retrieval, which share a similar goal, the objective is to rank all answers correctly in response to input queries across various style-specific query sets ${Q}_{s=1}^n$.
If the dataset does not contain the corresponding different style queries, the model should list the same category queries as the suggestions.

SER is a multi-style benchmark dataset we construct to facilitate accurate retrieval for teachers in STEM education. 
It contains a total of 24,000 text captions, audio clips and different style queries to accommodate different educational scenarios.
As illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:data_sample}, SER contains:
{\bf Text and Natural Image:} the most common query type, allowing teachers to describe problems using natural language or images for retrieval.
{\bf Audio:} a communication medium in education, enabling teachers to articulate complex queries, which can be further enhanced with LLMs or audio encoders.
{\bf Sketch:} hand-drawn sketches, whether created by users or written on blackboards, provide structural cues such as shape, pose, line, and edges to describe the problem.
{\bf Art:} art-style images as queries help bridge the gap between stylistically different images and original images, improving retrieval consistency across styles. 
{\bf Low-Resolution:} queries involving lower-resolution images, such as those captured from a distance, ensure usability in scenarios where high-quality images are unavailable.

The details of the dataset construction pipeline are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:data_collection}, we use the original STEM education image in the source dataset, and extensively collected datasets from the following sources: 1. online resources such as \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets}{Kaggle}, \href{https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon}{GitHub}, \href{https://jr.brainpop.com/subject/science/}{BrainPOP}, \href{https://keypoint.keystonesymposia.org/}{Frontiers}, \href{https://learning.dk.com/us}{DKlearning}, \href{https://www.inaturalist.org/}{iNaturalist}, \href{https://www.asiastem.org/steam-free-resources}{AAES}, etc. 2. relevant education dataset research, such as GAN \cite{jin2023gan} and PromptAloud \cite{lee2024prompt}. To ensure high-quality data, more than 20 Ph.D. students from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electronics, computer science, and education conducted a secondary screening of the raw images. They also generate multi-modal combinations (image/text/audio) by leveraging AIGC models.
Based on the natural images, the following steps were undertaken:
{\bf Text Generation:} we manually proofread the natural text descriptions.
{\bf Audio Recording:} the corresponding audio parts are recorded to match the text captions.
{\bf Sketch Images:} Canny algorithms are used to produce sketch images, Pidinet \cite{pdc} is employed to optimize and enhance low-quality sketches, and manual refinement is performed to achieve the final results.
{\bf Art-Style Images:} Flux model \cite{flux} is utilized to create art-style images.
{\bf Low-Resolution Images:} Gaussian Blur algorithms are applied to generate low-resolution images.
According to the National Science Foundation (NSF)â€™s classification of STEM education, we collect 6,000 original samples spanning six styles, three modalities, and over 22 subjects. This comprehensive dataset, as illustrated in Appendix Fig.\ref{fig:distribution}, ensures diversity and quality across multiple educational domains.
