The underlying graphs have a comparably low node degree and high diameter, while information in the graph is globally relevant, hence graph neural networks face the challenge of long term dependencies. We propose a specific architecture based on message passing which displays excellent results for a number of benchmark tasks in the WDS domain. Further, we investigate a multi-hop variation, which requires considerably less resources and opens an avenue towards big WDS graphs.",

    abstract = {Publisher Summary
    Water-distribution system design optimization is one of the most heavily researched areas in the hydraulics profession. This chapter presents a methodology for the multiobjective least-cost robust design of water distribution networks under uncertain demand. The problem is solved using genetic algorithms (GAs) after converting the original problem formulation to an equivalent, simplified, deterministic optimization problem. This way, computational efficiency of the methodology is significantly increased. The methodology is verified in a case study, where, among other things, optimal robust solutions obtained are compared to well-known deterministic solutions from the literature. The results clearly demonstrate that neglecting uncertainty in the design process may lead to serious underdesign of water distribution networks. The methodology proposed here is of a general type in terms that different uncertain parameters with different probability-distribution function (pdf) types can be considered. Its disadvantage is that the target level of the design robustness cannot be specified explicitly in the problem formulation phase, that is, it has to be specified indirectly (by specifying the target value of parameter). Therefore, the actual level of robustness can be calculated only once the optimization process has converged and the final solution is obtained.}

    abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to show that Bayesian optimization can be regarded as a general framework for the data-driven modelling and solution of problems arising in water distribution systems. Scenario-based hydraulic simulation and Monte Carlo are key tools in modelling in water distribution systems. The related optimization problems fall into a simulation/optimization framework in which objectives and constraints are often black box. Bayesian optimization (BO) is characterized by a surrogate model, usually a Gaussian process but also a random forest, as well as neural networks and an acquisition function that drives the search for new evaluation points. These modelling options make BO nonparametric, robust, flexible, and sample efficient, making it particularly suitable for simulation/optimization problems. A defining characteristic of BO is its versatility and flexibility, given, for instance, by different probabilistic models, in particular different kernels, different acquisition functions. These characteristics of the Bayesian optimization approach are exemplified by two problems: cost/energy optimization in pump scheduling and optimal sensor placement for early detection of contaminant intrusion. Different surrogate models have been used both in explicit and implicit control schemes, showing that BO can drive the process of learning control rules directly from operational data. BO can also be extended to multi-objective optimization. Two algorithms are proposed for multi-objective detection problems using two different acquisition functions.},

    abstract = {The majority of water pipelines are subjected to serious deterioration and degradation challenges. This research examines the application of optimized neural network models for estimating the condition of water pipelines in Shaker Al-Bahery, Egypt. The proposed hybrid models are compared against the classical neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and group method of data handling using four evaluation metrics. These metrics are; Fraction of Prediction within a Factor of Two (FACT2), Willmott's index of agreement (WI), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). The results show that the neural network trained using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm (FACT2 = 0.93, WI = 0.96, RMSE = 0.09, and MBE = 0.05) outperforms other machine learning models. Furthermore, three multi-objective swarm intelligence algorithms are applied to determine the near-optimum intervention strategies, namely PSO salp swarm optimization, and grey wolf optimization. The performances of the aforementioned algorithms are evaluated using Generalized Spread (GS), Spread (Δ), and Generational Distance (GD). The results yield that the PSO algorithm (GS = 0.54, Δ = 0.82, and GD = 0.01) exhibits better results when compared to the other algorithms. The obtained near-optimum solutions are ranked using a new additive ratio assessment and grey relational analysis decision-making techniques. Finally, the overall ranking is obtained using a new approach based on the half-quadratic theory. This aggregated ranking obtains a consensus index and a trust level of 0.97.},

    abstract = {Frequent water pollution incidents have occurred recently, leading to severe damages, economic loss, and long-lasting society impact. Therefore, installation of water quality monitoring sensors in water distribution system (WDS) has been advocated as a viable solution to enable real-time pollution detection and thus the mitigation of the risks associated with catastrophic contamination incidents. Given the significant cost of placing sensors at all locations in a network, a critical issue is where to deploy the sensors within the distribution system while the network still gets covered. Although there exist a significant number of articles on sensor placement, WDS for contamination detection is unique comparing to other networks such as power grids, road networks, structural networks and microwave radio networks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature survey on the sensor placement problem for contamination detection in WDS, with a special focus on optimization strategies and framework. Current challenges, issues, and research directions are also identified and discussed.},

    ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method for optimal pressure sensor placement in water distribution networks using information theory. The criterion for selecting the network nodes where to place the pressure sensors was that they provide the most useful information for locating leaks in the network. Considering that the node pressures measured by the sensors can be correlated (mutual information), a subset of sensor nodes in the network was chosen. The relevance of information was maximized, and information redundancy was minimized simultaneously. The selection of the nodes where to place the sensors was performed on datasets of pressure changes caused by multiple leak scenarios, which were synthetically generated by simulation using the EPANET software application. In order to select the optimal subset of nodes, the candidate nodes were ranked using a heuristic algorithm with quadratic computational cost, which made it time-efficient compared to other sensor placement algorithms. The sensor placement algorithm was implemented in MATLAB and tested on the Hanoi network. It was verified by exhaustive analysis that the selected nodes were the best combination to place the sensors and detect leaks.},

    abstract="The water supply is part of the critical infrastructure as the accessibility of clean drinking water is essential to ensure the health of the people. To guarantee the availability of fresh water, efficient and reliable water distribution networks are crucial. Monitoring these systems is necessary to avoid deterioration in water quality, deal with leakages and prevent cyber-physical attacks. While the installation of a growing amount of sensors is increasing the possibilities to monitor the system, considering the control of the senors becomes another challenge as sensor faults negatively influence the reliability of systems dealing with leakages and monitoring water quality. In this work, we aim to overcome the negative implications induced by sensor faults by using a sensor fault monitoring system based on three steps. First, established residual based fault detection is applied. In a second step, we extend this method to a fault isolation technique and finally propose fault accommodation by standard imputation techniques and different types of virtual sensors.",

volume={2},
abstract={The water supply network (WSN) is subjected to leaks that compromise its service to the communities, which, however, is challenging to identify with conventional approaches before the consequences surface. This study developed Machine Learning (ML) models to detect leaks in the WDN. Water pressure data under leaking versus non-leaking conditions were generated with holistic WSN simulation code EPANET considering factors such as the fluctuating user demands, data noise, and the extent of leaks, etc. The results indicate that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a supervised ML model, can accurately classify leaking versus non-leaking conditions; it, however, requires balanced dataset under both leaking and non-leaking conditions, which is difficult for a real WSN that mostly operate under normal service condition. Autoencoder neural network (AE), an unsupervised ML model, is further developed to detect leak with unbalanced data. The results show AE ML model achieved high accuracy when leaks occur in pipes inside the sensor monitoring area, while the accuracy is compromised otherwise. This observation will provide guidelines to deploy monitoring sensors to cover the desired monitoring area. A novel strategy is proposed based on multiple independent detection attempts to further increase the reliability of leak detection by the AE and is found to significantly reduce the probability of false alarm. The trained AE model and leak detection strategy is further tested on a testbed WSN and achieved promising results. The ML model and leak detection strategy can be readily deployed for in-service WSNs using data obtained with internet-of-things (IoTs) technologies such as smart meters.},

abstract = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been used to capture spatial correlation between multiple sensors for better performance of short-term water demand forecasting, which is essential for the implementation of smart water such as optimal scheduling and anomaly detection. However, the GCN assumes every sensor's importance to be the same and describes the spatial correlation purely from a data perspective. To resolve the two issues that affect prediction accuracy, this study proposes a weighting strategy and develops a spatial correlation-based GCN (SCGCN) prediction model. Self-attention mechanism is used to comprehensively analyze water demand data of every sensor and flow resistance between sensors (i.e., head loss along pipes), generating spatial correlation coefficients with the consideration of hydraulics. Then the coefficients are used as weights to aggregate neighboring sensors’ data, extracting accurate input features for the SCGCN model. The study utilized real monitoring data to develop the SCGCN model and compare it with a traditional artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results show that the SCGCN model can outperform the ANN model, especially for multi-step prediction. The root mean square errors of 30, 45, and 60 min multi-step prediction cases are reduced by 4.4\% to 9.2\% for different sensors.}

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}
