    abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to show that Bayesian optimization can be regarded as a general framework for the data-driven modelling and solution of problems arising in water distribution systems. Scenario-based hydraulic simulation and Monte Carlo are key tools in modelling in water distribution systems. The related optimization problems fall into a simulation/optimization framework in which objectives and constraints are often black box. Bayesian optimization (BO) is characterized by a surrogate model, usually a Gaussian process but also a random forest, as well as neural networks and an acquisition function that drives the search for new evaluation points. These modelling options make BO nonparametric, robust, flexible, and sample efficient, making it particularly suitable for simulation/optimization problems. A defining characteristic of BO is its versatility and flexibility, given, for instance, by different probabilistic models, in particular different kernels, different acquisition functions. These characteristics of the Bayesian optimization approach are exemplified by two problems: cost/energy optimization in pump scheduling and optimal sensor placement for early detection of contaminant intrusion. Different surrogate models have been used both in explicit and implicit control schemes, showing that BO can drive the process of learning control rules directly from operational data. BO can also be extended to multi-objective optimization. Two algorithms are proposed for multi-objective detection problems using two different acquisition functions.},

volume={2},
abstract={The water supply network (WSN) is subjected to leaks that compromise its service to the communities, which, however, is challenging to identify with conventional approaches before the consequences surface. This study developed Machine Learning (ML) models to detect leaks in the WDN. Water pressure data under leaking versus non-leaking conditions were generated with holistic WSN simulation code EPANET considering factors such as the fluctuating user demands, data noise, and the extent of leaks, etc. The results indicate that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a supervised ML model, can accurately classify leaking versus non-leaking conditions; it, however, requires balanced dataset under both leaking and non-leaking conditions, which is difficult for a real WSN that mostly operate under normal service condition. Autoencoder neural network (AE), an unsupervised ML model, is further developed to detect leak with unbalanced data. The results show AE ML model achieved high accuracy when leaks occur in pipes inside the sensor monitoring area, while the accuracy is compromised otherwise. This observation will provide guidelines to deploy monitoring sensors to cover the desired monitoring area. A novel strategy is proposed based on multiple independent detection attempts to further increase the reliability of leak detection by the AE and is found to significantly reduce the probability of false alarm. The trained AE model and leak detection strategy is further tested on a testbed WSN and achieved promising results. The ML model and leak detection strategy can be readily deployed for in-service WSNs using data obtained with internet-of-things (IoTs) technologies such as smart meters.},

abstract = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been used to capture spatial correlation between multiple sensors for better performance of short-term water demand forecasting, which is essential for the implementation of smart water such as optimal scheduling and anomaly detection. However, the GCN assumes every sensor's importance to be the same and describes the spatial correlation purely from a data perspective. To resolve the two issues that affect prediction accuracy, this study proposes a weighting strategy and develops a spatial correlation-based GCN (SCGCN) prediction model. Self-attention mechanism is used to comprehensively analyze water demand data of every sensor and flow resistance between sensors (i.e., head loss along pipes), generating spatial correlation coefficients with the consideration of hydraulics. Then the coefficients are used as weights to aggregate neighboring sensors’ data, extracting accurate input features for the SCGCN model. The study utilized real monitoring data to develop the SCGCN model and compare it with a traditional artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results show that the SCGCN model can outperform the ANN model, especially for multi-step prediction. The root mean square errors of 30, 45, and 60 min multi-step prediction cases are reduced by 4.4\% to 9.2\% for different sensors.}

We propose a specific architecture based on message passing which displays excellent results for a number of benchmark tasks in the WDS domain. Further, we investigate a multi-hop variation, which requires considerably less resources and opens an avenue towards big WDS graphs.",

    abstract="The water supply is part of the critical infrastructure as the accessibility of clean drinking water is essential to ensure the health of the people. To guarantee the availability of fresh water, efficient and reliable water distribution networks are crucial. Monitoring these systems is necessary to avoid deterioration in water quality, deal with leakages and prevent cyber-physical attacks. While the installation of a growing amount of sensors is increasing the possibilities to monitor the system, considering the control of the senors becomes another challenge as sensor faults negatively influence the reliability of systems dealing with leakages and monitoring water quality. In this work, we aim to overcome the negative implications induced by sensor faults by using a sensor fault monitoring system based on three steps. First, established residual based fault detection is applied. In a second step, we extend this method to a fault isolation technique and finally propose fault accommodation by standard imputation techniques and different types of virtual sensors.",
