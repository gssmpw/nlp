\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we proposed a novel data generation framework, \ours{}, which generates high-quality instructions at low cost by employing diversity-based filtering and iterative feedback task generation. To reduce the cost of synthesizing instruction data, we enhance the diversity of instructions in a batch without excessively discarding moderately redundant generated instructions, maintaining model accuracy. Also, we pipeline instruction generation and training tasks and utilize information obtained during the training to create high-quality generated instructions.  According to our results, \ours{} enhances the accuracy of AI models by 5.2\%, compared with traditional methods, while reducing data generation costs by 36\%.
