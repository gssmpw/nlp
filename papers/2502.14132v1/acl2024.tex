\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The main limitations of our work concern the characteristics of the dataset we analyse. First, we restrict our analysis to notes written in English, excluding over half a million notes in other languages. This decision was made to avoid potential noise and biases arising from the authors’ unfamiliarity with public discourse in different regions and reliance on machine translation. In future work, we aim to extend our analysis to other languages.

Moreover, except for a small subset of notes, we did not have access to the original tweets they were written for. Even when the tweet text was available, many contained non-text media, were written in internet vernacular that was challenging to interpret, or lacked important context. These factors limit the accuracy and effectiveness of our models and analysis.

Finally, due to resource constraints, our manual annotation study was limited to a relatively small sample of tweets and notes. In future work, we wish to utilise crowd workers to not only annotate a larger dataset but also increase the diversity and perspective of the annotators. 


\section*{Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations}
\label{sec:ethics}

% The Community Note dataset is a rich dataset and we hope that researchers will study it more.


Given that this work analyses real-world posts, ethical concerns may arise from using this data for research purposes.
Posts from non-protected accounts and Community Notes on Twitter/X are publicly available, however, we acknowledge that they may contain sensitive personal information.
To minimise any breach of anonymity and privacy, we anonymised links to individual accounts, and we do not publicly release this information. 
We do not analyse the posts or notes by individual users, and instead examine aggregated data in the form of topics and sources cited.

Although the Community Notes dataset represents attempts to curb harmful misinformation and conspiracies, given the intense partisanship involved \citep{allen2022partisan,draws_effects_2022}, as well as the explicit content of some claims, some instances may be considered offensive.
We also acknowledge that our own perspectives and biases as authors shape the impact of our findings in certain ways.
For example, as mentioned in the previous section, we were unable to analyse non-English posts in-depth, so our conclusions are likely somewhat focused on discourse in the Anglosphere (e.g., the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc.).
Furthermore, although we based our criteria for conspiracy theories on well-established sources, e.g., \href{https://apnews.com/hub/conspiracy-theories}{AP News}, \href{https://www.factcheck.org/issue/conspiracy-theories/}{FactCheck.org}, the \href{https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/coronavirus-response/fighting-disinformation/identifying-conspiracy-theories_en}{European Commission}, and identified conspiratorial narratives from both left- and right-wing sources, our own perspectives (i.e., as scientists from Western countries) may also have impacted what we considered to be conspiracy theories.

% we didn't use crowdworkers for annotation which may have given a broader perspective.
