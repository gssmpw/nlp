\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:rel}

Recent advancements in blockchain research have utilized various modeling techniques to analyze the performance and behavior of blockchain deployment architectures. Melo et al., "A Framework for Evaluating Blockchain System Availability" employed Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC), Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), and Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) to assess the availability and resource provisioning for Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum platforms, aiding in strategic blockchain application planning. Studies by Jiang et al., "Blockchain Performance Modeling with Continuous-Time Markov Chains" Wu et al., "Reliability Analysis of Blockchain Systems using RBD and SPN" and Ke and Park, "Modeling Transaction Processing in Blockchain Networks Using Stochastic Petri Nets" have concentrated on Hyperledger Fabric's performance metrics, with models focusing on throughput, discard rates, queue lengths, and mean response times. Additional research by Xu et al., "Analytical Modeling of Throughput and Latency Effects in Blockchain Systems" Yuan et al., "Throughput Analysis of Blockchain Platforms using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets" and Sukhwani et al., "Transaction Step Analysis in Blockchain Networks Using Stochastic Reward Networks" explored throughput and latency effects through analytical models and Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPN), and Stochastic Reward Networks (SRN), respectively, to analyze transaction steps.

Our contribution is an SPN model that evaluates Hyperledger Fabric's performance metrics, including \textit{maximum block size rate} and \textit{timeout block rate}, alongside a calibration approach for these parameters. Our work, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:related}, provides a detailed examination of timeout and block size effects, especially dissecting the ordering phase to highlight block formation issues related to timeouts, offering a more nuanced understanding compared to previous studies.
