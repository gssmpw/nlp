\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary method for 3D human segmentation. We introduce a novel HumanCLIP model and a MaskFusion module, which efficiently transfer the knowledge from 2D pre-trained vision-language models to the segmentation of 3D human data. Our method can seamlessly conduct semantic segmentation based on arbitrary user-defined text queries. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods on five 3D human datasets. Additionally, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including points clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.
