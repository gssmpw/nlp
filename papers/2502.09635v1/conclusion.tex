\section{Conclusion}

We propose a context- and reference-augmented reasoning and prompting model for fact-checking. To model contextual and referential documents, we construct a three-layer graph with intra- and cross-layer reasoning. To integrate evidence into claims, we design evidence-conditioned prompting, which produces unique prompt embeddings for each claim. A future work is to extend three-layer graph to a multi-modal graph for fact-checking.
