\label{sec:experiment_environment}

All the experiments were conducted on Linux server with 4 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs. Its operating system is 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa). We implemented our proposed model CORRECT using Python 3.9 as programming language and PyTorch 1.14.0 as deep learning library. Other frameworks include numpy 1.22.2, sklearn 0.24.2, and transformers 4.43.3.
