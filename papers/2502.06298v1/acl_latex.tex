\begin{abstract} 

This study introduces two novel benchmarks, SeaExam and SeaBench, designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian (SEA) application scenarios. Unlike existing multilingual datasets primarily derived from English translations, these benchmarks are constructed based on real-world scenarios from SEA regions. SeaExam draws from regional educational exams to form a comprehensive dataset that encompasses subjects such as local history and literature. In contrast, SeaBench is crafted around multi-turn, open-ended tasks that reflect daily interactions within SEA communities. Our evaluations demonstrate that SeaExam and SeaBench more effectively discern LLM performance on SEA language tasks compared to their translated benchmarks. This highlights the importance of using real-world queries to assess the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.~\footnote{SeaExam and SeaBench are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaExam} and \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/SeaBench}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we introduced two benchmarks, SeaExam and SeaBench, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs within Southeast Asian (SEA) application scenarios. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrated that these benchmarks better reflect the daily use of regional languages and provide more accurate insights into LLM performance in real-world multilingual scenarios compared to translated datasets. Our findings emphasize the importance of using real-world benchmarks for evaluating modelsâ€™ multilingual capabilities. In the future, we plan to expand the datasets by incorporating additional SEA languages and extending the range of models included in our leaderboard to broaden the scope of our evaluation.


\section*{Limitations}
Like many existing benchmarks, SeaExam and SeaBench are static, which may lead to issues such as saturation and data contamination. To address these challenges, we are curating additional questions and keeping this dataset private. We also plan to implement dynamic updates to these benchmarks in the future to further mitigate these limitations. Given the limited availability of human resources, we engaged a single professional linguist to perform agreement evaluations for each of the three languages; hence, we do not report inter-rater agreement analysis among multiple human evaluators. However, the study by \citet{zheng_judging_2023} indicated that human agreement rates are approximately 80\%, which provides a useful reference for our results.
