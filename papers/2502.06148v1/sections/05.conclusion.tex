\section{CONCLUSION}
In this work, we propose a novel \framework~framework to improve the accuracy and reliability of responses generated by LLMs in RAG systems.
Our method allows the LLM to select the more accurate one from a pair of responses generated based on internal parametric knowledge solely and by integrating external retrieved knowledge, to achieve enhanced performance. 
To strengthen the capabilities of the LLM in generating and selecting correct answers, we develop a \approach~method that trains the LLM with Direct Preference Optimization over a newly built Retrieval-Generation Preference (RGP) dataset. 
We conduct extensive experiments and analyses, which well validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
We hope this work paves the way for the development of more robust and reliable LLMs in RAG.
