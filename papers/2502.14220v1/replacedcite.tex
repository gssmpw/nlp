\section{Related Work}
To our knowledge, NDPage is the first work to provide a highly efficient, programmer-transparent virtual-to-physical translation mechanism for NDP systems, achieved through a novel page table design with modest hardware modifications. 
Several prior works have focused on reducing address translation overhead in NDP systems. 
vPIM____ optimizes page table accesses using a \textit{network-contention-aware hash} page table and allocates some NDP cores for \textit{pre-translation}. 
However, the hash-based page table limits certain virtual memory functionalities, such as page data sharing, and requires programmers to modify their applications to conform to the vPIM framework. 
DIPTA____ improves page table access by strategically placing page tables closer to the data. 
Nevertheless, DIPTA restricts page mapping associativity, potentially leading to significant performance degradation in applications that frequently encounter page conflicts. 
In contrast, NDPage provides a programmer-transparent solution that imposes no restrictions on page mapping.
