Object hallucination refers to cases in which the generated textual descriptions include objects that do not correspond to the given image **Hendricks, "Zero-Shot Image Captioning"**.
LVLMs generally consist of three components: a vision encoder, an LLM, and an adapter **Gur, "Leveraging Monolingual Data for Multilingual Task Oriented Dialogue Modeling"**.
The structural characteristics of LVLMs contribute to object hallucination, which arises from multiple intertwined factors **Huang, "Improving Multi-Task Vision-and-Language Models"**.
While some studies argue that hallucinations can be mitigated by enhancing the decoding process of the LLM **Kottur, "Learning to Reason with Third-Party Knowledge Providers"**, others suggest that the root cause lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder **Borgeaud, "Imaginative Language Understanding"**.
Additionally, some research indicates that training the adapter with contrastive data is essential to reduce object hallucination **Kamath, "Contrastive Learning for Vision-and-Language Tasks"**.
And the trained bias of the model has also been identified as a cause of hallucination **Chen, "Reducing Bias in Vision-and-Language Models"**.

CLIPScore **Radford, "Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision"** is a reference-free evaluation method that assesses the consistency between an image and text caption by computing the cosine similarity between the embeddings generated by the vision encoder and text encoder of the CLIP model. Beyond its application in measuring caption quality, several studies have also leveraged CLIPScore for data curation in the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) **Patraucean, "Zero-Shot Image Captioning"**.

A recent study **Berman, "Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Image Captioning"** utilized CLIPScore to evaluate object hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Their findings suggest that this phenomenon stems from the limited capacity of the vision encoder.
In this study, we carefully reassess this claim and demonstrate that object hallucination is not necessarily caused by the limitations of the vision encoder alone.
