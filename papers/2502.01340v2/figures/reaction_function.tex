    \caption{Reaction probability functions for different message opinion values ($o_m$). The curves demonstrate how interaction likelihood varies based on agent opinions, with peaks at ideologically aligned positions. The asymmetric shape captures both homophilic preferences and cross-ideological interactions, particularly pronounced for extreme messages.}
