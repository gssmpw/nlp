    \caption{Evolution of opinion polarization across different user groups and recommendation settings. The figure shows polarization dynamics for (left) the entire user population, (middle) regular users, and (right) influencers over multiple iterations. Lines represent different combinations of recommendation bias (SSR: Same Stance Ratio) and initial opinion distributions. Notably, moderate cross-ideological exposure (70\% SSR, solid lines) leads to higher polarization than complete echo chambers (100\% SSR, dashed lines), particularly in trimodal distributions. This counterintuitive finding challenges the echo chamber hypothesis, suggesting that awareness of opposing views can intensify polarization through antagonistic group dynamics. The effect varies across different initial opinion distributions: Unimodal, Trimodal (three distinct opinion clusters), and Asymmetric Trimodal (three unequally weighted clusters).}
