\subsection{Ablation study}
To assess the contribution of each key component in our model, we conduct an ablation study by systematically removing four critical modules: \textbf{Reasoning Path}, \textbf{Relevance Score}, \textbf{Schema Linking}, and \textbf{Similar Examples}.  We evaluate the resulting impact on performance using EX shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}. Our findings indicate that each component plays a crucial role in the model’s effectiveness. Removing the Reasoning Path leads to a 3.5-point drop in EX, highlighting its importance in guiding the model toward generating accurate SQL queries. The absence of the Relevance Score resulted in a 5.8-point decrease in EX, underscoring its contribution to overall performance. Eliminating Schema Linking causes a 7.5-point drop in EX, which demonstrates its critical role in similar example construction. Overall, each of the four components—Reasoning Path, Relevance Score, Schema Linking, and Similar Examples—is essential for achieving optimal performance in SQL generation.
