In this paper, we introduce SAFE-SQL, a novel unsupervised framework designed to improve Text-to-SQL execution accuracy by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. Through extensive experiments, we show that fine-grained example generation, and optimal threshold filtering contribute to the overall performance increase. Specifically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with notable improvements over ablated versions, highlighting the importance of these modules in generating accurate and semantically valid SQL queries. Our findings underscore the capability of large language models when carefully structured and enhanced, to address complex Text-to-SQL tasks.
