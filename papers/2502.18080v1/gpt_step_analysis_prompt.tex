\begin{prompt}{User Prompt for gpt-4o to Determine the Number of (Erroneous) Reasoning Rounds}
% \label{prompt:rwt}
You will be provided with a math problem and a solution generated by a reasoning model.
\\
The model's response may consist of multiple reasoning rounds.
\\
One reasoning round is a part of the full model generation and is defined as a complete reasoning process or verification process that explicitly contains the final answer.
\\
Your task is to carefully analyze the response to determine the number of reasoning rounds it contains, and identify how many of these solutions contain erroneous steps, including intermediate erroneous steps or erroneous final answer that is different from the ground truth answer.
\\
After you reasoning process, please give your final conclusions as ``\#\#\#\# Number of rounds: \textless number\textgreater" and ``\#\#\#\# Number of wrong rounds: \textless number\textgreater".
