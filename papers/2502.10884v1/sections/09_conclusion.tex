\section{Conclusion}
\label{conc}
Our work bridges decades of accessibility efforts with AI coding assistants, offering a novel solution to persistent web accessibility challenges. 
Through a formative user study, we identify shortcomings in how current AI-assisted development workflows handle accessibility implementation. Accordingly, we develop CodeA11y, a GitHub Copilot Extension, and demonstrate that novice developers using it are significantly more likely to create accessible interfaces. By focusing on integrating accessibility improvements seamlessly into everyday development workflows, this work marks a first step toward fostering accessibility-conscious practices in human-AI collaborative UI development.
