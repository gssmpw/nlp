abstract = {The analysis of time-series data associated with modernday industrial operations and
scientific experiments is now pushing both computational power and resources to their
limits. In order to analyze the existing and (more importantly) future very large
time series collections, new technologies and the development of more efficient and
smarter algorithms are required. The two editions of the Interdisciplinary Time Series
Analysis Workshop brought together data analysts from the fields of computer science,
astrophysics, neuroscience, engineering, electricity networks, and music. The focus
of these workshops was on the requirements of different applications in the various
domains, and also on the advances in both academia and industry, in the areas of time-series
management and analysis. In this paper, we summarize the experiences presented in
and the results obtained from the two workshops, highlighting the relevant state-ofthe-
art-techniques and open research problems.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most popular time-series tasks because it enables unsupervised data exploration and often serves as a subroutine or preprocessing step for other tasks. Despite being the subject of active research across disciplines for decades, only limited efforts focused on benchmarking clustering methods for time series. Unfortunately, these studies have (i) omitted popular methods and entire classes of methods; (ii) considered limited choices for underlying distance measures; (iii) performed evaluations on a small number of datasets; or (iv) avoided rigorous statistical validation of the findings. In addition, the sudden enthusiasm and recent slew of proposed deep learning methods underscore the vital need for a comprehensive study. Motivated by the aforementioned limitations, we present Odyssey, a modular and extensible web engine to comprehensively evaluate 80 time-series clustering methods spanning 9 different classes from the data mining, machine learning, and deep learning literature. Odyssey enables rigorous statistical analysis across 128 diverse time-series datasets. Through its interactive interface, Odyssey (i) reveals the best-performing method per class; (ii) identifies classes performing exceptionally well that were previously omitted; (iii) challenges claims about the use of elastic measures in clustering; (iv) highlights the effects of parameter tuning; and (v) debunks claims of superiority of deep learning methods. Odyssey does not only facilitate the most extensive study ever performed in this area but, importantly, reveals an illusion of progress while, in reality, none of the evaluated methods could outperform a traditional method, namely, k-Shape, with a statistically significant difference. Overall, Odyssey lays the foundations for advancing the state of the art in time-series clustering.},

abstract = {Clustering time series is a useful operation in its own right, and an important subroutine in many higher-level data mining analyses, including data editing for classifiers, summarization, and outlier detection. While it has been noted that the general superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean Distance for similarity search diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets, as we shall show, the same is not true for clustering. Thus, clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally challenging task. In this work, we address this lethargy in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both upper and lower bounds to prune off a large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy is admissible; giving us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering as an anytime algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology, medicine and entomology.},

abstract = {There is demand for scalable algorithms capable of clustering and analyzing large time series data. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised artificial neural network for clustering, visualizing, and reducing the dimensionality of complex data. Like all clustering methods, it requires a measure of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer that accommodates distortions when aligning time series. Despite its popularity in clustering, DTW is limited in practice because the runtime complexity is quadratic with the length of the time series. To address this, we present a new a self-organizing map for clustering TIME Series, called SOMTimeS, which uses DTW as the distance measure. The method has similar accuracy compared with other DTW-based clustering algorithms, yet scales better and runs faster. The computational performance stems from the pruning of unnecessary DTW computations during the SOM’s training phase. For comparison, we implement a similar pruning strategy for K-means, and call the latter K-TimeS. SOMTimeS and K-TimeS pruned 43\% and 50\% of the total DTW computations, respectively. Pruning effectiveness, accuracy, execution time and scalability are evaluated using 112 benchmark time series datasets from the UC Riverside classification archive, and show that for similar accuracy, a 1.8\texttimes{} speed-up on average for SOMTimeS and K-TimeS, respectively with that rates vary between 1\texttimes{} and 18\texttimes{} depending on the dataset. We also apply SOMTimeS to a healthcare study of patient-clinician serious illness conversations to demonstrate the algorithm’s utility with complex, temporally sequenced natural language.},

abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of clusters, or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Clustering multivariate time series is a critical task in many real-world applications involving multiple signals and sensors. Existing systems aim to maximize effectiveness, efficiency and scalability, but fail to guarantee the interpretability of the results. This hinders their application in critical real scenarios where human comprehension of algorithmic behavior is required. This paper introduces Time2Feat, an end-to-end machine learning system for multivariate time series (MTS) clustering. The system relies on inter-signal and intra-signal interpretable features extracted from the time series. Then, a dimensionality reduction technique is applied to select a subset of features that retain most of the information, thus enhancing the interpretability of the results. In addition, domain experts can semi-supervise the process, by providing a small amount of MTS with a target cluster. This process further improves both accuracy and interpretability, narrowing down the number of features used by the clustering process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, interpretability, efficiency, and robustness of Time2Feat through experiments on eighteen benchmarking time series datasets, comparing them with state-of-the-art MTS clustering methods.},

It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ∼2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2.°5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.}

	Abstract = {Process models play an important role in modern information systems and in service-based applications. Given the sizes of current process model repositories, there is a critical need for techniques allowing to retrieve process models fulfilling user needs. While the problem of process similarity search has been extensively studied in the literature, existing techniques do not use semantic annotations that are proposed by the semantic web services languages and models. In this paper, we propose a framework, called PSearch, for semantic annotated process models discovery. Given a user query formulated as a process model, Psearch uses a fast search technique that returns a ranked list of similar models in the repository. In a second step, a fine-grained matching method can be applied between the query and one or several matching candidates.},

@article{DistributedS2G,
	Abstract = {The automated detection of sequential anomalies in time series is an essential task for many applications, such as the monitoring of technical systems, fraud detection in high-frequency trading, or the early detection of disease symptoms. All these applications require the detection to find all sequential anomalies possibly fast on potentially very large time series. In other words, the detection needs to be effective, efficient and scalable w.r.t. the input size. Series2Graph is an effective solution based on graph embeddings that are robust against re-occurring anomalies and can discover sequential anomalies of arbitrary length and works without training data. Yet, Series2Graph is no t scalable due to its single-threaded approach; it cannot, in particular, process arbitrarily large sequences due to the memory constraints of a single machine. In this paper, we propose our distributed anomaly detection system, short DADS, which is an efficient and scalable adaptation of Series2Graph. Based on the actor programming model, DADS distributes the input time sequence, intermediate state and the computation to all processors of a cluster in a way that minimizes communication costs and synchronization barriers. Our evaluation shows that DADS is orders of magnitude faster than S2G, scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the cluster and can process much larger input sequences due to its scale-out property.},

abstract = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one of the most popular data mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power, but also as a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this paper, we describe k-Shape, a novel algorithm for time-series clustering. k-Shape relies on a scalable iterative refinement procedure, which creates homogeneous and well-separated clusters. As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. An extensive experimental evaluation against partitional, hierarchical, and spectral clustering methods, with the most competitive distance measures, showed the robustness of k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly accurate, and efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications.},

abstract = {Clustering time series is a recurrent problem in real-life applications involving data science and data analytics pipelines. Existing time series clustering algorithms are ineffective for feature-rich real-world time series since they only compare the time series based on raw data or use a fixed set of features for determining the similarity. In this paper, we showcase FeatTS, a feature-based semi-supervised clustering framework addressing the above issues for variable-length and heterogeneous time series. Specifically, FeatTS leverages a graph encoding of the time series that is obtained by considering a high number of significant extracted features. It then employs community detection and builds upon a Co-Occurrence matrix in order to unify all the best clustering results. We let the user explore the various steps of FeatTS by visualizing the initial data, its graph encoding and its division into communities along with the obtained clusters. We show how the user can interact with the process for the choice of the features and for varying the percentage of input labels and the various parameters. In view of its characteristics, FeatTS outperforms the state of the art clustering methods and is the first to be able to digest domain-specific time series such as healthcare time series, while still being robust and scalable.},

year = {2022},
volume = {15},

abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

abstract = {Subsequence anomaly detection in long sequences is an important problem with applications
in a wide range of domains. However, the approaches that have been proposed so far
in the literature have severe limitations: they either require prior domain knowledge
that is used to design the anomaly discovery algorithms, or become cumbersome and
expensive to use in situations with recurrent anomalies of the same type. In this
work, we address these problems, and propose an unsupervised method suitable for domain
agnostic subsequence anomaly detection. Our method, Series2Graph, is based on a graph
representation of a novel low-dimensionality embedding of subsequences. Series2Graph
needs neither labeled instances (like supervised techniques), nor anomaly-free data
(like zero-positive learning techniques), and identifies anomalies of varying lengths.
The experimental results, on the largest set of synthetic and real datasets used to
date, demonstrate that the proposed approach correctly identifies single and recurrent
anomalies without any prior knowledge of their characteristics, outperforming by a
large margin several competing approaches in accuracy, while being up to orders of
magnitude faster.},

relational databases, Column Stores, and Array Databases are not a suitable solution
either, since none of these systems offers native support for data series. Our vision
is to design and develop a generalpurpose Data Series Management System, able to copewith
big data series, that is, very large and fast-changing collections of data series,
which can be heterogeneous (i.e., originate from disparate domains and thus exhibit
very different characteristics), and which can have uncertainty in their values (e.g.,
due to inherent errors in the measurements). Just like databases abstracted the relational
data management problem and offered a black box solution that is now omnipresent,
the proposed system will allow analysts that are not experts in data series management,
as well as common users, to tap in the goldmine of the massive and ever-growing data
series collections they (already) have},

abstract = {Rapid developments in hardware, software, and communication technologies have facilitated the emergence of Internet-connected sensory devices that provide observations and data measurements from the physical world. By 2020, it is estimated that the total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50 billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for IoT data analytics will also be discussed. A use case of applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to Aarhus smart city traffic data is presented for a more detailed exploration.}
