, Time Series Graph Clustering problem can be formulated as a graph clustering task where we aim to partition the nodes into clusters such that the condition in Problem~\ref{problem} holds and the values of $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ indicate the quality of the clustering interpretability. In this context, the time series graph is constructed by transforming each time series into a subgraph using a function $\mathcal{M}$.

The subgraphs are then combined to form the final graph embedding, which represents the relationships between the time series. The objective is to find the largest possible values of $\lambda$ and $\gamma$, such that the condition in Problem~\ref{problem} holds, indicating that each node belongs exclusively to one cluster. 

To address this challenge, we can utilize various clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to partition the graph into clusters based on the similarity between nodes. The quality of the clustering can be evaluated using metrics like silhouette score or Calinski-Harabasz index.

In addition, we can employ techniques from spectral clustering to refine the clustering results and improve the interpretability of the graph embedding. By optimizing the values of $\lambda$ and $\gamma$, we can balance the trade-off between representativity and exclusivity, leading to more meaningful cluster assignments.

The Time Series Graph Clustering problem has practical applications in various domains, such as anomaly detection, classification, and regression analysis. It can also be used for visualizing complex relationships between time series data, enabling better understanding of the underlying patterns and trends.
