\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Despite significant interest in time series clustering, many existing methods lack interpretability. We introduce $k$-Graph, a novel graph-based approach that clusters time series datasets while providing interpretable clustering partitions. Our experiments show that $k$-Graph effectively addresses the challenges outlined in Section~\ref{sec:intro}. It combines the strengths of existing methods by preserving temporal dependencies and achieving performance on par with raw and deep learning approaches. Additionally, it enhances interpretability without sacrificing granularity, a common issue with feature-based methods. 

\rev{In future work, we aim to explore the use of Graph Neural Networks in our clustering process and extend our approach to multivariate time series.}
We note that applying $k$-Graph to multivariate time series is not straight-forward. 
The main challenge in doing so is due to the inter-dependencies among dimensions, which should be considered in the graph embedding step.
This would lead to a potential explosion of the graph size. 
We consider this problem non-trivial, and a very interesting future research direction.
