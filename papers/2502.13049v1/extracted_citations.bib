abstract = {There is demand for scalable algorithms capable of clustering and analyzing large time series data. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised artificial neural network for clustering, visualizing, and reducing the dimensionality of complex data. Like all clustering methods, it requires a measure of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer that accommodates distortions when aligning time series. Despite its popularity in clustering, DTW is limited in practice because the runtime complexity is quadratic with the length of the time series. To address this, we present a new a self-organizing map for clustering TIME Series, called SOMTimeS, which uses DTW as the distance measure. The method has similar accuracy compared with other DTW-based clustering algorithms, yet scales better and runs faster. The computational performance stems from the pruning of unnecessary DTW computations during the SOM’s training phase. For comparison, we implement a similar pruning strategy for K-means, and call the latter K-TimeS. SOMTimeS and K-TimeS pruned 43\% and 50\% of the total DTW computations, respectively. Pruning effectiveness, accuracy, execution time and scalability are evaluated using 112 benchmark time series datasets from the UC Riverside classification archive, and show that for similar accuracy, a 1.8\texttimes{} speed-up on average for SOMTimeS and K-TimeS, respectively with that rates vary between 1\texttimes{} and 18\texttimes{} depending on the dataset. We also apply SOMTimeS to a healthcare study of patient-clinician serious illness conversations to demonstrate the algorithm’s utility with complex, temporally sequenced natural language.},

abstract = {Clustering time series is a useful operation in its own right, and an important subroutine in many higher-level data mining analyses, including data editing for classifiers, summarization, and outlier detection. While it has been noted that the general superiority of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean Distance for similarity search diminishes as we consider ever larger datasets, as we shall show, the same is not true for clustering. Thus, clustering time series under DTW remains a computationally challenging task. In this work, we address this lethargy in two ways. We propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both upper and lower bounds to prune off a large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This pruning strategy is admissible; giving us provably identical results to the brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering as an anytime algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas with both single and multidimensional case studies in the domains of astronomy, speech physiology, medicine and entomology.},

abstract = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one of the most popular data mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power, but also as a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this paper, we describe k-Shape, a novel algorithm for time-series clustering. k-Shape relies on a scalable iterative refinement procedure, which creates homogeneous and well-separated clusters. As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. An extensive experimental evaluation against partitional, hierarchical, and spectral clustering methods, with the most competitive distance measures, showed the robustness of k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly accurate, and efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications.},

abstract = {Clustering is one of the most popular time-series tasks because it enables unsupervised data exploration and often serves as a subroutine or preprocessing step for other tasks. Despite being the subject of active research across disciplines for decades, only limited efforts focused on benchmarking clustering methods for time series. Unfortunately, these studies have (i) omitted popular methods and entire classes of methods; (ii) considered limited choices for underlying distance measures; (iii) performed evaluations on a small number of datasets; or (iv) avoided rigorous statistical validation of the findings. In addition, the sudden enthusiasm and recent slew of proposed deep learning methods underscore the vital need for a comprehensive study. Motivated by the aforementioned limitations, we present Odyssey, a modular and extensible web engine to comprehensively evaluate 80 time-series clustering methods spanning 9 different classes from the data mining, machine learning, and deep learning literature. Odyssey enables rigorous statistical analysis across 128 diverse time-series datasets. Through its interactive interface, Odyssey (i) reveals the best-performing method per class; (ii) identifies classes performing exceptionally well that were previously omitted; (iii) challenges claims about the use of elastic measures in clustering; (iv) highlights the effects of parameter tuning; and (v) debunks claims of superiority of deep learning methods. Odyssey does not only facilitate the most extensive study ever performed in this area but, importantly, reveals an illusion of progress while, in reality, none of the evaluated methods could outperform a traditional method, namely, k-Shape, with a statistically significant difference. Overall, Odyssey lays the foundations for advancing the state of the art in time-series clustering.},

	Abstract = {The automated detection of sequential anomalies in time series is an essential task for many applications, such as the monitoring of technical systems, fraud detection in high-frequency trading, or the early detection of disease symptoms. All these applications require the detection to find all sequential anomalies possibly fast on potentially very large time series. In other words, the detection needs to be effective, efficient and scalable w.r.t. the input size. Series2Graph is an effective solution based on graph embeddings that are robust against re-occurring anomalies and can discover sequential anomalies of arbitrary length and works without training data. Yet, Series2Graph is no t scalable due to its single-threaded approach; it cannot, in particular, process arbitrarily large sequences due to the memory constraints of a single machine. In this paper, we propose our distributed anomaly detection system, short DADS, which is an efficient and scalable adaptation of Series2Graph. Based on the actor programming model, DADS distributes the input time sequence, intermediate state and the computation to all processors of a cluster in a way that minimizes communication costs and synchronization barriers. Our evaluation shows that DADS is orders of magnitude faster than S2G, scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the cluster and can process much larger input sequences due to its scale-out property.},

abstract = {Subsequence anomaly detection in long sequences is an important problem with applications
in a wide range of domains. However, the approaches that have been proposed so far
in the literature have severe limitations: they either require prior domain knowledge
that is used to design the anomaly discovery algorithms, or become cumbersome and
expensive to use in situations with recurrent anomalies of the same type. In this
work, we address these problems, and propose an unsupervised method suitable for domain
agnostic subsequence anomaly detection. Our method, Series2Graph, is based on a graph
representation of a novel low-dimensionality embedding of subsequences. Series2Graph
needs neither labeled instances (like supervised techniques), nor anomaly-free data
(like zero-positive learning techniques), and identifies anomalies of varying lengths.
The experimental results, on the largest set of synthetic and real datasets used to
date, demonstrate that the proposed approach correctly identifies single and recurrent
anomalies without any prior knowledge of their characteristics, outperforming by a
large margin several competing approaches in accuracy, while being up to orders of
magnitude faster.},
