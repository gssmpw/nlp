\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this study advances the understanding of how different mobility aid users perceive sidewalk barriers. By conducting an online image survey with five mobility aid groups, we gathered nuanced perspectives on how users of walking canes, walkers, mobility scooters, manual wheelchairs, and motorized wheelchairs navigate the urban environment. From the findings synthesized in this study, we created two example applications, \textit{i.e.,} an interactive accessibility rating maps based on each user group's perceived passability and a disability-aware routing prototype based on OSMnx to generate personalized, optimal paths for each mobility group. 
These applications showcase the potential for our survey data to inform people with mobility disabilities about residential and social choices, provide personalized route planning strategies, and develop analytical tools to identify obstacles and assess the impact of their removal for different user groups.
