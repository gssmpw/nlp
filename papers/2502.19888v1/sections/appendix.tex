The categories are further grouped into 4 Project Sidewalk label categories: Obstacles (A-C), Surface problems (D-G), Curb ramps (H), and Missing curb ramps (I).
    The matrix on the right displays the Q score ranking per user group for each category, arranged from the most passable (left) to the least passable (right).
