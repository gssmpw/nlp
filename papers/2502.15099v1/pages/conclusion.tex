\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on images in bug reports to reveal their characteristics and functions, analyzing their potential for use in automated bug report reproduction. We identify patterns in image quantity and types, examining their functional roles, usage patterns, and the essential information conveyed by each role. These insights lay the groundwork for future research aimed at differentiating images based on their roles and exploring potential techniques to leverage each role effectively in automated bug reproduction. This research also opens opportunities for enhancing existing tools or developing new, versatile tools that can integrate a broader range of information from bug reports to improve reproduction accuracy.
