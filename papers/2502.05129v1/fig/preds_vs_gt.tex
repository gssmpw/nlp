 Mean and standard deviation of total predicted counts vs total ground truth counts per clip on the KL-val and KR test sets. Size of the dot corresponds to the number of images with the associated ground truth count. The model systematically predicts lower counts than ground truth for KR clips with large numbers of fish, where tracks of distinct fish may overlap and become difficult to distinguish on the echogram.
