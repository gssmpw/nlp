%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Knowledge tracing aims to trace students’ evolving knowledge states by predicting their future performance on concept-related exercises. Recently, some graph-based models have been developed to incorporate the relationships between exercises to improve knowledge tracing, but only a single type of relationship information is generally explored. In this article, we present a novel Dual Graph Ensemble learning method for Knowledge Tracing (DGEKT), which establishes a dual graph structure of students’ learning interactions to capture the heterogeneous exercise–concept associations and interaction transitions by hypergraph modeling and directed graph modeling, respectively. To combine the dual graph models, we introduce the technique of online knowledge distillation. This choice arises from the observation that, while the knowledge tracing model is designed to predict students’ responses to the exercises related to different concepts, it is optimized merely with respect to the prediction accuracy on a single exercise at each step. With online knowledge distillation, the dual graph models are adaptively combined to form a stronger ensemble teacher model, which provides its predictions on all exercises as extra supervision for better modeling ability. In the experiments, we compare DGEKT against eight knowledge tracing baselines on three benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that DGEKT achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract="Deep knowledge Tracing is a family of deep learning models that aim to predict students' future correctness of responses for different subjects (to indicate whether they have mastered the subjects) based on their previous histories of interactions with the subjects. Early deep knowledge tracing models mostly rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that can only learn from a uni-directional context from the response sequences during the model training. An alternative for learning from the context in both directions from those sequences is to use the bidirectional deep learning models. The most recent significant advance in this regard is BERT, a transformer-style bidirectional model, which has outperformed numerous RNN models on several NLP tasks. Therefore, we apply and adapt the BERT model to the deep knowledge tracing task, for which we propose the model BiDKT. It is trained under a masked correctness recovery task where the model predicts the correctness of a small percentage of randomly masked responses based on their bidirectional context in the sequences. We conducted experiments on several real-world knowledge tracing datasets and show that BiDKT can outperform some of the state-of-the-art approaches on predicting the correctness of future student responses for some of the datasets. We have also discussed the possible reasons why BiDKT has underperformed in certain scenarios. Finally, we study the impacts of several key components of BiDKT on its performance.",

abstract="Knowledge tracing aims to estimate students' knowledge state or skill mastering level over time, which is evolving into an essential task in educational technology. Traditional knowledge tracing algorithms generally use one or a few features to predict students' behaviour and do not consider the latent relations between these features, which could be limiting and disregarding important information in the features. In this paper, we propose MLFBK: A Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT Knowledge Tracing model, which is a novel BERT based Knowledge Tracing approach that utilises multiple features and mines latent relations between features to improve the performance of the Knowledge Tracing model. Specifically, our algorithm leverages four data features (student{\_}id, skill{\_}id, item{\_}id, and response{\_}id, as well as three meaningful latent relations among features to improve the performance: individual skill mastery, ability profile of students (learning transfer across skills), and problem difficulty. By incorporating these explicit features, latent relations, and the strength of the BERT model, we achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in knowledge tracing tasks. We use t-SNE as a visualisation tool to analyse different embedding strategies. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies and activation function evaluation to evaluate our model. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates good interpretability.",
