The literature suggests that how individuals form and develop their perceptions of AI limitations is a complex process influenced by individual and contextual factors. Understanding how people identify and categorize different types of limitations is crucial at the individual level (Markus, 2001). Professional background and expertise shape these interpretations, with individuals from different functional areas potentially perceiving limitations differently (Bartel, 2018).

Contextual influences emerge as equally important in perception formation. The organizational environment, including existing technological infrastructure and support systems, shapes individuals' perceptions of limitations (Gilliland & Barge, 1999). Industry-specific challenges and opportunities create unique contexts influencing perception formation (Katz & Allen, 1985). External discourse, including media representation and professional networks, also contributes to how individuals understand and interpret AI limitations (Weick, 1995).

The literature highlights sensemaking at both individual and collective levels in how people interpret and respond to AI limitations. At the individual level, sensemaking involves personal interpretation and meaning-making processes (Bartel & Saunders, 2006). Individuals engage in retrospective reflection on their experiences with AI, drawing on their professional identity and past experiences to make sense of the limitations they encounter (Weick, 1995). This individual sensemaking process is ongoing, as people continuously update their interpretations based on new experiences and information.

The collective dimension of sensemaking emerges through social interactions and shared meaning construction. Knowledge sharing is an important mechanism, with groups developing shared understandings through formal and informal discussions (Bartel & Saunders, 2006). Informal networks are particularly important in sharing experiences and interpretations across organizational boundaries (Katz & Allen, 1985). These collective processes do not replace individual sensemaking but interact with it, as individuals draw on collective interpretations while contributing their understanding to the group's sensemaking process. Social dynamics within organizations influence both individual and collective sensemaking. Peer experiences and opinions shape interpretations, while leadership is essential in framing how limitations are understood and addressed (Gilliland & Barge, 1999).

The literature suggests that organizational readiness develops through distinct patterns influenced by organizational responses and cultural evolution. Organizations adapt to perceived limitations through various mechanisms, including resource allocation decisions and capability development (Bartel & Saunders, 2006). These responses shape the organization's overall readiness for AI adoption.

Cultural evolution appears to be an important aspect of readiness development. Organizations change work practices and routines as they adapt to AI technologies. Shifts in organizational attitudes and the development of learning processes emerge as important elements of this evolution (Weick, 1995). Patterns of resistance and acceptance also play a significant role in how readiness develops over time.
