\section{Realizable Setting}

In this section, we consider the instance $(X,f)$ that is realizable by some hypothesis class $\calH$. 
In Section~\ref{sec:realizable_general}, we provide a multi-party verification  protocol for the general hypothesis class that achieves perfect recall and nonresponsive disclosure at most the Leave-One-Out dimension (Definition~\ref{defn:leave_one_out}) of the hypothesis class.
In Section~\ref{sec:realizable_linear_margin}, we characterize the Leave-One-Out dimension for the family of linear classifiers with margin $\gamma$.

% \begin{theorem}\label{thm:protocol_realizable}
%     Consider a hypothesis class $\calH$ of binary classifiers on the set $X$ with Leave-One-Out dimension $k$.  
%     Let $f:X\to \{+1,-1\}$ be the true label for responsive/non-responsive documents and $(X,f)$ be a realizable instance with respect to $\calH$. Then, \Cref{alg:abstract_critical_points_protocol} is a multi-party verification protocol with the follwoing properties.
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item (Recall) The recall is $1$.
%         \item (Non-responsive disclosure) If Alice reports the labels of all documents correctly, the non-responsive disclosure is at most $k$.
%         \item (Truthful) Alice's best strategy is to report all labels correctly. 
%         \item (Efficiency) Given an oracle $\calO$ for checking membership in $\calH$, the protocol run in time $O(|X|)$.
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:protocol_realizable}
    Let $\calH$ be a hypothesis class of binary classifiers on a set $X$ with Leave-One-Out dimension $k$.  
    Suppose $f: X \to \{+1,-1\}$ represents the true labels for responsive and nonresponsive documents, and let $(X,f)$ be a realizable instance with respect to $\calH$. Then, \Cref{alg:abstract_critical_points_protocol} defines a multi-party verification protocol with the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{(Recall)} The recall is $1$.
        \item \textbf{(Nonresponsive Disclosure)} If Alice reports all labels correctly, the number of disclosed nonresponsive documents is at most $k$.
        \item \textbf{(Truthfulness)} Alice's best strategy is to report all labels truthfully.
        \item \textbf{(Efficiency)} Given an oracle $\calO$ for membership testing in $\calH$, the protocol runs in time $O(|X|)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    % Furthermore, there is a subset $X'\subseteq X$ and a instance $(X',f)$, where $f(x) = -1$ for all $x \in X'$, such that $(X',f)$ is realizable wrt to $\calH$ (by restricting the domain to $X'$) and any protocol with recall $1$ will have nonresponsive disclosure at least $k$.
    % Furthermore, there exists a subset $X' \subseteq X$ such that the instance $(X', f)$, where $f(x) = -1$ for all $x \in X'$, is realizable with respect to $\calH$ (when restricted to $X'$) and has the following property.
    % Any protocol for $(X',f)$ with recall $1$ must incur a nonresponsive disclosure of at least $k$.
    Furthermore, there exists a subset $X' \subseteq X$ such that $(X', f)$, with $f(x) = -1$ for all $x \in X'$, is realizable with respect to $\calH$ (when restricted to $X'$), and any protocol achieving recall $1$ on $(X', f)$ must incur a nonresponsive disclosure of $k-1$.
