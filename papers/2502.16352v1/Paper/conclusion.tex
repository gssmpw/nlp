\section{Conclusion}

We presented a multi-party classification protocol that verifies a hypothesized labeling with limited disclosure of nonresponsive documents. Its key insight is that the number of nonresponsive points disclosed is fundamentally tied to the Leave-One-Out dimension of the hypothesis class. For linear classifiers with large margins, the bound on nonresponsive disclosure is independent of the dimension, providing a strong privacy guarantee. We also extended the protocol to nonrealizable settings by introducing a robust Leave-One-Out dimension that accounts for classification errors, offering similarly efficient verification with minimal disclosure.

A few immediate avenues remain open. First, our skew-obtuse family analysis could be adapted from strict margins to average-margin conditions. Thus, it would be interesting to generalize our protocols for verifying classifiers with an “expected” large margin. 
Second, it would be worthwhile to investigate whether additional structural properties of the hypothesis class—beyond margin separation—can be exploited for efficient verification, especially in the nonrealizable case.
