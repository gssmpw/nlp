\begin{lemma}[Exponentially many nearly orthogonal vectors]
\label{lem:exp_many_neearly_orthogoanl_vectors}
For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a collection of $N = \exp(c\epsilon^2d)$ unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the absolute value of the inner product between any pair is at most $\epsilon$, where $c > 0$ is an absolute constant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us construct the vectors by selecting $N = \exp(c\epsilon^2d)$ vectors independently and uniformly at random from $\{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\}^d$. We will show that with positive probability, all pairwise inner products are bounded by $\epsilon$ in absolute value.

For any fixed pair of vectors $v_1, v_2$ chosen according to this distribution we an analyze the inner product $\langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ as the sum of $d$ independent random variables where each term in this sum has mean zero and magnitude $\frac{1}{d}$.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Each coordinate of each vector is independently $\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$
%     \item The inner product $\langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$ is the sum of $d$ independent random variables
%     \item Each term in this sum has mean zero and magnitude $\frac{1}{d}$
% \end{itemize}

By Hoeffding's inequality, for any fixed pair of vectors:
\[
    \mathbb{P}(|\langle v_1, v_2 \rangle| > \epsilon) \leq 2\exp(-2\epsilon^2d)
\]

By the union bound:
\[
    \mathbb{P}(\exists i,j: |\langle v_i, v_j \rangle| > \epsilon) \leq \binom{N}{2} \cdot 2\exp(-2\epsilon^2d) < N^2\exp(-2\epsilon^2d)
\]

Substituting $N = \exp(c\epsilon^2d)$ where $c < 1$:
\[
    N^2\exp(-2\epsilon^2d) = \exp(2c\epsilon^2d - 2\epsilon^2d) < 1
\]

Therefore, with positive probability, all pairwise inner products are at most $\epsilon$ in absolute value, proving the existence of such a collection.
\end{proof}
