\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present \ours{} to convert static 3D models into articulation-ready assets that support realistic animation. We first introduce a large-scale dataset \ourdata{} with high-quality articulation annotations, which is carefully curated from Objaverse-XL. Built upon this dataset, we develop a novel two-stage pipeline that first generates skeletons through auto-regressive sequence modeling, naturally handling varying numbers of bones or joints within skeletons across different 3D models. Then we predict skinning weights in a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and joints. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance and generalization ability across diverse object categories.
