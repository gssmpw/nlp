\section{Literature Review}
% Discuss the literature read and general arguments found

In a variety of informal discussions **Kaufman, "Game Development"**, where synergy is mentioned, the discussion degrades to what is synergy rather than staying within the original topic. Even when the subject is introduced with a clear meaning of synergy, it becomes a point of contention in the following discussion.

However, more experienced industry experts provide a hard definition of synergy. **Rosewater, "Designing Magic"** defines synergy as ``connecting things such that they produce something more potent in aggregate than in isolation''. On the other hand, the Game Maker Toolkit video **Game Maker Toolkit, "Synergy Video"** uses synergy as ``when two or more elements combine to produce a more powerful effect than the sum of the individual elements''. Those definitions are good for illustrating the general consensus of what synergy is. They serve the purpose of their context and discussion, but are not extensible to all applications, and thus can be improved to be more flexible in their application.

The formal literature has different issues. Some authors, particularly shorter articles, do not define or provide any context for what they mean by synergy **Kaufman, "Game Development"**. This creates confusion when trying to understand motivation, goals, methodology, or even results.

Traditional books usually define synergy when they use it **Rosewater, "Designing Magic"**. However, to ensure that its meaning is clear, they go through lengthy explanations, comparisons, and correlations. This shows how complex this topic is, while also confirming how important it is to thoroughly discuss the meaning of synergy.

Nevertheless, most of these discussions of synergy are not only about what synergy is. Most of the time, synergy is mentioned within a context of other features or related to other concepts, rather than individually.

A common topic is how to achieve balanced synergy. Two reddit discussions explicitly ask this question **Kaufman, "AskReddit" and Magruder et al., "Game Design Reddit 2"**. The first counts on 20 replies with good value for the discussion (excluding short hate comments). The second counts with 15 responses with good contribution and citing 1 external source (a designer's blog post). In an RPG forum, three users discuss a similar question **Hilger et al., "RPG Forum Synergy"**. Game designers also have videos on youtube on the topic of how balanced synergy is important to games **Game Maker Toolkit, "Synergy Video" and Rosewater, "Designing Magic"**. Magruder et al. **Magruder et al., "Balancing MTG"** also talk about a part of balancing that is controlling power creep on Magic The Gathering (MTG). From all discourse, we can identify some insights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balancing synergy in practice is difficult and time-consuming.
    \item Synergy is an key factor for the quality of the game.
    \item Designing synergy is tricky, but essential to game design.
\end{itemize}

Mark Rosewater **Rosewater, "Designing Magic"** and Franca et al. **Franca et al., "Gameplay Synergy"** agree that synergy is important for player creativity. That is, it allows players to experience the game in their own way and express themselves through gameplay. This is relevant to the intrinsic motivation of players, which is an important factor players consider when choosing which game to play **Kaufman, "Player Motivation"**.
Within this, there are players who look specifically for games with intense levels of synergy **Hilger et al., "Synergy in Games"**. As such, we can see that synergy is a defining factor in player experience.

A common interest between many discussions is to find a surefire method to create synergy or a system that ensures good synergy **Kaufman, "Game Development" and Magruder et al., "Balancing MTG"**. However, there is no agreement on the best way to \textit{create} synergies. Frequently, it is even stated that it is \textit{impossible} to ever have even guidelines on how to achieve these goals. We disagree with this statement, instead being one of the motives for promoting a better discussion on synergy, to eventually be able to provide such detailed guidelines.
