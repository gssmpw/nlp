	abstract = {This paper presents a personalized character recommendation system for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games which are considered as one of the most popular online video game genres around the world. When playing MOBA games, players go through a draft stage, where they alternately select a virtual character to play. When drafting, players select characters by not only considering their character preferences, but also the synergy and competence of their team’s character combination. However, the complexity of drafting induces difficulties for beginners to choose the appropriate characters based on the characters of their team while considering their own champion preferences. To alleviate this problem, we propose DraftRec, a novel hierarchical model which recommends characters by considering each player’s champion preferences and the interaction between the players. DraftRec consists of two networks: the player network and the match network. The player network captures the individual player’s champion preference, and the match network integrates the complex relationship between the players and their respective champions. We train and evaluate our model from a manually collected 280,000 matches of League of Legends and a publicly available 50,000 matches of Dota2. Empirically, our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in character recommendation and match outcome prediction task. Furthermore, a comprehensive user survey confirms that DraftRec provides convincing and satisfying recommendations to the real-world players. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/DraftRec .},

The most effective decks are shared and become popular among players through online communities. Players then keep enhancing those decks by replacing cards and testing those new deck variations in online arenas. This fine-tuning process is time-consuming and most of the time leads to small improvements in the players win rate. This article presents CreativeStone, a creativity booster for Hearthstone card decks. Our creativity-guided approach uses a genetic algorithm and the regent-dependent creativity metric to identify the core cards of an existing deck, and then improves it toward a more valuable and novel deck by adding cards that are synergic to the core cards, but also different from the ones in the original deck. Our experimental results show that CreativeStone can boost even legendary decks, outperforming handcrafted ones by 21\% in win rate.},

One of the MOBA games, League of Legends (LoL), is popular with game players, and professional leagues have been created worldwide. LoL has the ban and pick system to ban or pick champions before the game starts. This system affects the outcome of the game, which is even more important in the professional leagues. In this paper, we present a champion recommendation system of LoL. Recommendations are conducted sequentially in the same manner as in the ban and pick system. To address this challenge, we collect professional matches to create the ban and pick dataset and use the data to train two models for both teams. Experimental results show that the neural network classifier performs better than the random forest classifier. In addition, we explain the reason that the performances of the two models are different by separately analyzing the sequences.},

With the increasing popularity of LoL and the emergence of tournaments, betting related to the game has also emerged, making the investigation in this area even more relevant. A variety of models were evaluated and the results were encouraging. A model based on LightGBM showed the best performance, achieving an average accuracy of 81.62\% in intermediate stages of the match when the percentage of elapsed time was between 60\% and 80\%. On the other hand, the Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models proved to be more effective in early stages of the game, with promising results. This study contributes to the field of machine learning applied to electronic games, providing valuable insights into realtime prediction in League of Legends. The results obtained may be relevant for both players seeking to improve their strategies and the betting industry related to the game.},

Previous research has emphasized prematch prediction and used data from amateur games, which are more easily available than those from professional level. However, the commercial value of win prediction exists at the professional level. Furthermore, predicting real-time data is unexplored, as is its potential for informing audiences. Here, we present the first comprehensive case study on live win prediction in a professional esport. We provide a literature review for win prediction in a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) esport. This article evaluates the first professional-level prediction models for live DotA 2 matches, one of the most popular MOBA games, and trials it at a major international esports tournament. Using standard machine learning models, feature engineering and optimization, our model is up to 85\% accurate after 5 min of gameplay. Our analyses highlight the need for algorithm evaluation and optimization. Finally, we present implications for the esports/game analytics domains, describe commercial opportunities and practical challenges, and propose a set of evaluation criteria for research on esports win prediction.},

However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We ﬁnd that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

The current approach to quest design is dominated by a task-orientated paradigm in which a quest is viewed as a series of tasks to be completed as part of the narrative structure of the game. This paper presents an alternative paradigm that shifts away from the predominant taskbased approach to quest design. Based on a study of existing quest models, a dual quest framework of singular and synergy quests is proposed. Within the frameworks, tasks become an intermediary step within the quest which is now focused on the transﬁguration of the player character. This approach offers a practical design structure for both procedural and manual quest design.},

But in contrast with the many theories of emergence or complexity that rely on some underlying force or 'law', the 'Synergism Hypothesis', as Peter Corning calls it, is in essence an economic theory of biological complexity; it is fully consistent with mainstream evolutionary biology. Corning refers to it as Holistic Darwinism. Among the many important insights that are provided by this new paradigm, Corning presents a scenario in which the human species invented itself; synergistic, behavioral and technological innovations were the 'pacemakers' of our biological evolution. Synergy has also been the key to the evolution of complex modern societies, he concludes.},

Although this variety of metrics extends the spectrum of alternatives to assess creative artifacts, the lack of domain independent metrics makes hard to compare artifacts produced by different studies, which in turn slows down the research progress in the ﬁeld. In this paper, we propose an domain independent metric, called Regent-Dependent Creativity (RDC), that assesses the creativity of arti- facts. This metric requires that artifacts are described within the Regent-Dependent Model, in which artifacts features are represented as dependency pairs. RDC combines the Bayesian Surprise and Synergy to mea- sure novelty and value, respectively. We show two case studies from different domains (fashion and games) to demonstrate how to model artifacts and assess creativity through RDC. We also propose and make available a simple API to promptly use RDC.},

As pop culture, games are as important as film or television -- but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games. Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like "play," "design," and "interactivity." They look at games through a series of eighteen "game design schemas," or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance. Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.},

Yet, Magic: the Gathering has not just survived but thrived for over 25 years with the game’s designers publicly stating their aim to keep curbing power creep. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the rate of power creep in the game. Herein, we formally deﬁne a conservative metric power creep and calculate its occurrence in the game of Magic: the Gathering. Although having an increasing rate, power creep appears low with an average of 1.56 strictly better card faces released per year.},

The action and controlls in this game are top notch but, i can't help but feel that the game could be better in other areas.
