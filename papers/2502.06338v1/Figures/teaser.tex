   \caption{\textbf{3D-lifted depth completion results in out-of-domain cases.}
   % In out-of-domain scenario, most depth completion models, including both supervised~\cite{zhang2023completionformer} and unsupervised~\cite{wong2021unsupervised}, trained on the standard benchmark~\cite{uhrig2017sparsity} perform poorly.
   % In contrast, our test-time alignment method achieves a robust results.
   Regardless of supervised~\cite{zhang2023completionformer} or unsupervised methods~\cite{wong2021unsupervised}, most depth completion models perform poorly on out-of-domain data.
   In contrast, our zero-shot depth completion method, which employs test-time alignment, consistently achieves robust results.
   In this example, the other models are trained on the KITTI Depth Completion dataset~\cite{uhrig2017sparsity}, while our zero-shot approach is not trained on any specific depth completion dataset. Both are tested on the nuScenes dataset~\cite{caesar2020nuscene}.
