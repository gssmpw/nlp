   \caption{\textbf{Test-time alignment process.} 
   We incorporate a two-step hard alignment process into the reverse sampling process including an optimization loop and resample at regular intervals.
   We optimize \coral{$\mathbf{z}_0(\mathbf{z}_t)$} and remap it to \coral{$\hat{\mathbf{z}}_t$}.
   The latent is then decoded into depth, where the loss is measured against sparse depth.
   For visibility, the sparse depth points are enlarged.
