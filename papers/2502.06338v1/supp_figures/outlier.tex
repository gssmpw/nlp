    Our outlier filtering algorithm effectively detects see-through points on car windows in sparse depth measurements.
    Aligning with filtered sparse depth and visualizing the absolute error map against the ground truth shows the elimination of high-error regions caused by outliers,  specifically see-through points on car windows.
