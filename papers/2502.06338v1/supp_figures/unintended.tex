   \caption{\textbf{Comparison of guided sampling and our test-time alignment methods.} When using guided sampling~\cite{chung2023dps} with sparse measurements, the completed depth map often becomes corrupted due to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model. In contrast, our test-time alignment method directs the stochastic process towards a desirable solution that aligns with the sparse measurements.}
