ADMSv2 employs a unified multi-layered architecture that integrates several open-source frameworks to collect, store, manage, and analyze a variety of data sources, including massive traffic sensor data, bus trajectory data, transportation network data, and traffic incidents data. ADMSv2 enables numerous applications in intelligent transportation, urban planning, public policy, and emergency response, all of which are critical for city resilience. Here, we demonstrate three application scenarios running on top of ADMSv2 to showcase the efficiency of its capabilities of query processing on real-world streaming and historical data as well as real-time data analysis using deep learning for traffic forecasting.},

abstract = {Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets.},

However, the underlying complex spatial-temporal correlations and heterogeneities make this problem challenging. Existing methods usually use separate components to capture spatial and temporal correlations and ignore the heterogeneities in spatial-temporal data. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Networks (STSGCN), for spatial-temporal network data forecasting. The model is able to effectively capture the complex localized spatial-temporal correlations through an elaborately designed spatial-temporal synchronous modeling mechanism. Meanwhile, multiple modules for different time periods are designed in the model to effectively capture the heterogeneities in localized spatial-temporal graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms other baselines.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={01}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Song, Chao and Lin, Youfang and Guo, Shengnan and Wan, Huaiyu}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={914-921} }

year = {2017},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as inter-region traffic, events, and weather. We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast the inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.},

abstract = {Truck speed prediction plays a key role in truck transportation management. However, it is a very challenging task since the truck traffic usually shows complex patterns. Most of the existing traffic prediction methods lack the ability to model the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of truck traffic or ignore contributing contextual factors that impact traffic. Also, truck traffic data is typically sparse and noisy, which makes the truck speed prediction an even more challenging task. How to improve the truck speed prediction by taking advantage of other relevant truck traffic information (such as the truck flow) has not been investigated in depth. Additionally, traffic congestions and poor driving conditions caused by extreme weather conditions can make sudden changes in the general pattern of the truck speed. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Task Context Based Gated Recurrent Unit Graph Convolutional Network (MT-C2G) to predict the truck speed under extreme weather conditions. MT-C2G includes four major components: The spatial dependence learning component captures the spatial dependencies shaped by the topological structure of the road network. Truck traffic feature temporal dependence modeling component is built to acquire the temporal dependencies involved in the truck traffic features, and contextual feature temporal dependence modeling component employs a layer of GRU units to capture the temporal dependencies of contextual factors. The multi-task learning component then leverages the information between the truck speed and flow prediction tasks through attention mechanism for improving the performance. Moreover, a data augmentation method SMOTE is utilized to balance the data with the extreme weather conditions. Experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MT-C2G fairly outperforms six state-of-the-art traffic prediction methods.},
