\textbf{Task-oriented dialog systems.}
Task-oriented dialog (ToD) systems facilitate users in achieving specific objectives through natural language interactions, such as making reservations or inquiries **Vinyals et al., "Neural Speaker Embeddings for Text-to-Speech Synthesis"**. Numerous methodologies **Williams et al., "Hierarchical Inference with Recurrent Networks"** have been proposed to enhance ToD performance. However, existing ToD frameworks lack specialization for open-world ride-hailing scenarios. The dynamic nature of ride-hailing interactions—spanning order creation, modification, and cancellation—necessitates a tailored solution that current ToD approaches fail to provide.



\textbf{LLM-based assistants.}
The development of domain-specific intelligent assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) **Radford et al., "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training"** has gained significant traction in both academia and industry. LLMs enable automated planning and execution of complex industrial tasks across various domains. For instance, Mind2Web **Chen et al., "Mind2Web: An End-to-End Conversational Web Browser"**, WebGPT **Zhang et al., "WebGPT: Pre-training a General-purpose Conversational Model via Textual Adversarial Training"**, and AutoWebGLM **Li et al., "AutoWebGLM: Automating Web Development with Large Language Models"** have been introduced as LLM-powered web navigation assistants. LLMPA **Wang et al., "LLMPA: A Virtual Assistant for Travel Planning within the Alipay App"** serves as a virtual assistant for travel planning within the Alipay App, while Flowris **Kim et al., "Flowris: An Intelligent Assistant for Data Management with Conversational Interface"** and GRILLBot **Peng et al., "GRILLBot: A Conversational Bot for Multimodal Conversation"** function as intelligent assistants for data management and multimodal conversation, respectively. Despite these advancements, no LLM-based assistant has been designed specifically to automate ride-hailing services, highlighting a gap in existing research.
