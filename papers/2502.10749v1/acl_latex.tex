\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
%Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in numerous applications, with fine-tuning for specific tasks often yielding superior performance.
While most current approaches rely on further training techniques, such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, to enhance model capacities, model merging stands out for its ability of improving models without requiring any additional training.
%Model merging, also known as model fusion, is an emerging technique that combines weights from task-specific models to create a single, general-purpose model capable of handling multiple tasks without additional training. While prior work has primarily focused on merging models through weight averaging or sparsified task vectors, these approaches often suffer from task interference and the loss of critical task-specific information.
In this paper, we propose a unified framework for model merging based on low-rank estimation of task vectors without the need for access to the base model, named \textsc{LoRE-Merging}. Our approach is motivated by the observation that task vectors from fine-tuned models frequently exhibit a limited number of dominant singular values, making low-rank estimations less prone to interference. We implement the method by formulating the merging problem as an optimization problem. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating interference and preserving task-specific information, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art performance in model merging techniques.

\section*{Limitations}
Although we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on merging homogeneous models, we have not yet evaluated it on merging heterogeneous models which is a much more challenging task. Compared to existing task-vector based model merging methods, our method is the most suitable one that can be adapted to heterogeneous model merging, as we disentangle the base model and task vectors. We think how to expand \textsc{LoRE-Merging} to heterogeneous model merging should be a promising future direction.
