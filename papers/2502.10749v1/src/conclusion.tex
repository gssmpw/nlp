\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for merging homogeneous models based on low-rank estimation, named \textsc{LoRE-Merging}.
The main motivation of our work is to estimate task vectors using low-rank approximation without the need of access to the base model. We achieve it by formulating the merging problem as an optimization problem.
%For the model merging problem, we introduce the implicit low-rank merging method and utilize the coordinate descent method to solve the resulting implicit optimization problem.
%For the special case where the base model is explicitly available, we modify the implicit low-rank merging method and propose a variant tailored for the explicit base model scenario.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods.
