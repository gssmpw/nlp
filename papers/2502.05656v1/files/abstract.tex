We show that the standard discrete update rule of transformer layers can be naturally interpreted as a forward Euler discretization of a continuous dynamical system. Our \emph{Transformer Flow Approximation Theorem} demonstrates that, under standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions, token representations converge uniformly to the unique solution of an ODE as the number of layers grows. Moreover, if the underlying mapping satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition with a negative constant, the resulting dynamics are contractive, causing perturbations to decay exponentially across layers. Beyond clarifying the empirical stability and expressivity of transformer models, these insights link transformer updates to a broader iterative reasoning framework, suggesting new avenues for accelerated convergence and architectural innovations inspired by dynamical systems theory.
