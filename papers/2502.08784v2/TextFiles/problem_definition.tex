In the fully observable case, we can formally define the control problem as minimization of a cost function in Eq. \eqref{eq:fullyobservableloss} for $t\in [t_i, t_f]$, subject to the dynamics $\mathcal{N}$ of $\f$ and dynamics $F$ of $d$. A shorthand notation is used $\f = \f(x, t)$:
\begin{align}    
    &\min_{a(\cdot)}\;
    % \mbox{ControlCost}(\mathbf{\f}, \mbox{'Target'})\label{eq:fullyobservableloss},\\
    \int_{t_i}^{t_f}||\mathcal{T}(\f(x, t')) - \sigma^*(t')||^2dt' \label{eq:fullyobservableloss}, \\
    &\qquad\mbox{s.t. }
    \begin{cases}
        \partial_t\f = \mathcal{N}(\f; d(t), \ell(x), t),\\
        \dot{d}(t) = F(d(t), a(t)).
    \end{cases}\label{eq:coupledDE}
\end{align}
% The 'ControlCost' in Eq. \eqref{eq:fullyobservableloss} causes $\pi$ to select actions which influence the solution $\f$ to possess desired 'Target' properties such as energy patterns in the environment. 
where $\mathcal{T}(\zeta(x,t))=\sigma(t)$ is a function that computes a signal we wish to predict and control, such as scattered energy, at a particular location or in the entire domain, $\Omega$. The goal of this control problem is to select actions which influence $\f$ to posses properties defined by a reference signal $\sigma^*(t)$.

This problem is challenging, because of the coupling between ODE and PDE in the constraint in Eq. \eqref{eq:coupledDE}, and the complexity of control of an entire function, $\f$. Moreover, wave propagates at a much higher speed in comparison to the responsiveness of a physically realizable robot. That creates two different time scales in the above-mentioned coupling, which requires a particular consideration.   

We assume the robot knows the dynamics, $F$, of its scatterers which define the time-varying boundary conditions for the wave, $\f$. A direct solution to this problem is intractable, so we propose to learn a low-dimensional dynamical control system of $\f$, which captures the essential properties of $\f$, and to utilize this low dimensional dynamics for the design of control law.
% which is controllable by the robot by its indirect interaction with wave through scatterers. 

% Notable, $\f$ and $d$ evolve in two different time-scales, fast and slow, which allows for a physical realization of such a robot. 

% This optimization problem is intractable in general, because it requires the full knowledge of a solution, $\f$, to a PDE parameterized by controllable, $d(t)$ and uncontrollable function, $\ell(x)$, which is usually complex. Both the environment PDE and the robot's ODE appear in the constraint because the true $\f$ must satisfy its governing PDE and $F$ is assumed to be known to the agent.

% Selection of $\pi$ such that Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullyobservableloss} is sufficiently small causes the solution $\f$ to posses desirable properties defined by an optimal signal $\sigma^*(t)$. 



% \subsection{Partially Observable PDE} 
% In the partially observable case, which is the focus of the current work, the optimization problem is defined as follows. 

% In the partially observable case, which is the focus of the current work, we propose to learn a reduced dimensional model of $\f$ to make the optimization problem in Eq.~\ref{eq:fullyobservableloss} tractable.
