\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \sysname, the first underwater acoustic system that enables
image transmission on mobile devices.
By combining generative image compression with reliability-enhancing techniques at the PHY layer,
\sysname transmits 256$\times$256 color images with low latency
across various underwater conditions,
preserving high perceptual quality even under stringent bandwidth limitations
and severe transmission errors.
By extending underwater communication from text messaging to image
transmission, \sysname contributes to the ongoing development of underwater
technologies.
