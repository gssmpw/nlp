AquaHelper____ focuses on designing robust signal detection algorithms for SOS message transmission.
The information transmitted by their systems is very limited.
Although some work in____ attempts to communicate via QR codes on mobile devices. Successfully scanning the QR code heavily depends on the underwater visibility and the distance between the sender and receiver. Instead, \sysname is capable of transmitting images on mobile devices.


\parab{Customized hardware.}
Researchers in ____ transmit an RGB image via a Piezo-acoustic backscatter____. Due to its low data rate, it takes hours to send a raw RBG data.
Amphilight____ and Shrimp____ employ optical techniques for underwater transmission, utilizing customized LED lights and laser diodes, respectively. However, the optics-based communication system is mainly limited by the transmission distance and the light condition underwater.
Unlike others, \sysname focuses on enabling underwater communication on commercial off-the-shelf mobile phones, making the technology more accessible and ubiquitous.




\parab{Chirp-based acoustic systems.}
Chirp-based transmission protocol is widely adopted for underwater communication____. They mainly focus on the optimization of the transmission protocols such as rate adaptation, modulation designs, multi-path elimination. Their designed protocols still are for a small packet and require larger transmission power and bandwidth which cannot be directly applied for image transmission on mobile devices.
\sysname optimizes the chirp-based protocol tailored for robust image transmission on commercial mobile devices.

\parab{Underwater image transmission.}
Researchers in ____ utilize the traditional CNN-based image compression approach to reduce image size. However, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:mov_challenges}, the images compressed by those approaches do not meet the required size by mobile devices and are not robust to transmission errors. \sysname utilizes the state-of-the-art generative compression models which are bandwidth-efficient and error-resilient.










\subsection{Generative Compression}
Generative compression has attracted significant attention ____ and has been successfully applied to image/video codecs and wireless communication, where it reduces communication overhead without compromising the quality of the received images or videos.
\sysname is the first system to apply generative compression to underwater communications, and it also extends this capability to other limited-bandwidth or error-prone scenarios---such as satellite networks and rural communication.

Image tokenization____, as a way for generative compression, learns a compact image representation for various downstream tasks such as classification, reconstruction, and generation.
Since the introduction of neural discrete representation____, numerous methods____ have been developed. Among these, VQGAN____ and TiTok____ were selected for our system due to their balance between compressed image size and decoded image quality.
