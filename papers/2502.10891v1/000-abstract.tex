Underwater communication is essential for both recreational and
scientific activities, such as scuba diving.
However, existing methods remain highly constrained by environmental
challenges and often require specialized hardware,
driving research into more accessible
underwater communication solutions.
While recent acoustic-based communication systems support
text messaging on mobile devices, their low data rates
severely limit broader applications.

We present \sysname, the first acoustic communication system
capable of underwater image transmission on commodity mobile devices.
To address the key challenges of underwater environments---limited
bandwidth and high transmission errors---\sysname employs and enhances
generative image compression to improve compression efficiency,
and integrates it with reliability-enhancement techniques at the
physical layer to strengthen error resilience.
We implemented \sysname on the Android platform and demonstrated its
feasibility for underwater image transmission.
Experimental results show that \sysname enables reliable, low-latency
image transmission while preserving perceptual image quality,
across various bandwidth-constrained and error-prone underwater conditions.
