\section{Related Work}
In \cite{paler2020parallelizing}, Paler et al. introduced a "parallel query Bucket Brigade QRAM" based on different query definitions. Their parallel queries refer to classical queries to classical memory, reducing the depth of a single query (quantum query defined in this paper) from $O(N)$ to $O(\log(N))$ by parallelizing Clifford + T gates in the data retrieval stage. This improvement is accounted for and further enhanced by the $O(1)$ data retrieval in Sec.~\ref{sec:background}. However, serving multiple \emph{quantum} queries in a single QRAM remains a highly non-trivial problem and is resolved by our work.
