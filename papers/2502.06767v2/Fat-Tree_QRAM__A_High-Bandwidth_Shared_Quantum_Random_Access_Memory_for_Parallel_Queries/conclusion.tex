\section{Conclusion}
We presented a blueprint for a shared QRAM architecture based on multiplexed quantum routers in a Fat-Tree structure. It is capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries in parallel, while preserving the space, time, and fidelity scalings as a Bucket-Brigade QRAM. We demonstrate that the hardware architecture can be efficiently implemented on platforms such as superconducting cavities with native \texttt{CSWAP} gates and limited connectivity. Our results suggest Fat-Tree QRAM as a promising architecture for implementing high-bandwidth, noise-resilient quantum queries.
