\noindent{\bf Graph filtering-based approaches.} Within the realm of graph signal processing, GCN is regarded as a parameterized graph convolutional filter ____. As a representative approach, NGCF ____ was introduced by learning appropriate LPFs while capturing high-order collaborative signals inherent in user--item interactions ____. LightGCN ____ achieved convincing performance by eliminating linear transformation and non-linear activation from the GCN layers in NGCF. By closing the gap between LightGCN and graph filtering methods alongside a closed-form solution for the infinite-dimensional LightGCN, GF-CF ____ stood out for achieving accurate recommendation performance while significantly reducing time consumption with its parameter-free nature. PGSP ____ made use of a mixed-frequency filter that combines a linear LPF with an ideal LPF. Turbo-CF ____ introduced polynomial graph filtering for CF, enabling diverse LPF designs without costly matrix decomposition. In a subsequent study, to show its efficacy in another recommendation scenario, Group-GF ____ was developed by presenting multi-view polynomial graph filtering that offers a holistic view of complex user--group dynamics in the group recommendation task. 

\noindent\textbf{MC recommender systems.} Efforts have consistently been made to incorporate MC ratings to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. In one of the initial endeavors, a support vector regression-based approach ____ was introduced to assess the relative importance of individual criteria ratings. CFM ____ was formulated by collectively employing matrix factorization for MC rating matrices. DTTD ____ was developed by integrating cross-domain knowledge alongside side information. Moreover, in light of the extensive adoption of deep learning, there has been a continuous endeavor to develop DNN-based MC recommender systems. For instance, ExtendedSAE ____ was introduced to capture the relationship between MC ratings using stacked autoencoders. LatentMC ____ was designed with variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent vectors, constituting latent MC ratings. DMCF ____ was devised for predicting MC ratings using a DNN, with the predicted ratings being aggregated by another DNN. AEMC ____ employed deep autoencoders, capturing non-linear relationships between users' preferences for criteria. As pioneer work on integrating light graph convolution into MC recommender systems, CPA-LGC ____ was devised to capture complex semantics in MC ratings.
