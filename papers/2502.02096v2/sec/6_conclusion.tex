\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced Dual-Flow, a novel framework for highly transferable multi-target adversarial attacks. By employing Cascading Distribution Shift Training to develop an adversarial velocity function, our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dual-Flow achieves remarkable improvements in transferability and robustness compared to previous multi-target generative attacks. These findings highlight the potential of Dual-Flow as a powerful tool for evaluating and improving the robustness of machine learning models.
