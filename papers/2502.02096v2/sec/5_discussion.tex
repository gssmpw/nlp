% 主要讨论SDE潜在的优势
\paragraph{Potential Advantage of SDE.} Although our experiments with Cascading SDE have not yet surpassed the performance of Cascading ODE, we believe that methods based on Schrödinger bridges~\cite{de2021diffusion} have the potential to bring significant improvements. Schrödinger bridge formulations provide a principled way to learn stochastic transport maps, which could offer better control over the reverse trajectory and enhance the stability of the cascading distribution shift.
