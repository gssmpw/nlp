% Scientific document retrieval is an essential task that facilitates literature discovery and scientific breakthroughs.
In specialized fields like the scientific domain, constructing large-scale human-annotated datasets poses a significant challenge due to the need for domain expertise.
Recent methods have employed large language models to generate synthetic queries, which serve as proxies for actual user queries.
However, they lack control over the content generated, often resulting in incomplete coverage of academic concepts in documents. % and limited improvements in retrieval performance.
We introduce \textbf{C}oncept \textbf{C}overage-based \textbf{Q}uery set \textbf{Gen}eration (\textbf{\proposed}) framework, designed to generate a set of queries with comprehensive coverage of the document's concepts.
A key distinction of \proposed is that it adaptively adjusts the generation process based on the previously generated queries.
We identify concepts not sufficiently covered by previous queries, and leverage them as conditions for subsequent query generation.
This approach guides each new query to complement the previous ones, aiding in a thorough understanding of the document.
% Furthermore, we introduce new techniques to filter out low-quality queries and enhance retrieval using the concept information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \proposed significantly enhances query quality and~retrieval~performance.
