We propose \proposed framework to generate a set of queries that comprehensively cover the document concepts.
\proposed identifies concepts not sufficiently covered by previous queries, and leverages them as conditions for subsequent query generation.
This approach guides each new query to complement the previous ones, aiding in a comprehensive understanding of the document.
Extensive experiments show that \proposed significantly improves both query quality and retrieval performance, even with limited training data. 
Future work may explore its applicability across various domains. 
In particular, e-commerce \cite{SSCDR, DERRD, MvFS} presents a promising opportunity, as users often express multi-faceted needs involving desired attributes, characteristics, or specific use cases. 
We expect \proposed to better simulate user queries in such scenarios and leave further investigation for future work.
