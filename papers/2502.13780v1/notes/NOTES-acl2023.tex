\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we take stock of where we stand wrt to human-centered MT. Ideally, we highlight some challenges and opportunities and a path. The main challenge I see with this work--- besides bringing relevant arguments---is finding a way to make it specifically applicable to the MT application and not AI/NLP more generally. 
\hl{What is specific to MT that cannot be more broadly said of NLP?}

\section{Introduction}

\textbf{--}\textit{Technology is made by people for people. }
\bigskip


\noindent\textbf{--}\textit{The L in NLP means language, and language means people.} \bs{add cit.}

\paragraph{Motivation} 
NLP technologies have evolved into vastly user-facing applications that are used by millions of people in so many contexts---some of which are also inherently risky, e.g. the medical domain. \bs{[others?]}
Of course, this requires a shift: we are no longer within an abstract academic discipline but rather contributing to the shaping of deployed technologies that need to serve real users in real-world scenarios.  And yet, we still do not really know that much about how users interact with the technology, for what needs, in which contexts, and how we can support them properly. \
The development chain of models is often self-reflecting: \hl{the relevance of the proposed technologies is usually assessed wrt to values that are internal to the field}, e.g. overall performance, scalability, new domain, efficiency \citep{birhane-2022}.\footnote{Or this is at least what \citet{birhane-2022} finds in the broader Machine Learning (ML) field.} \textit{But are we empowering users and their needs? Are we putting them in the conditions to make sensible choices about how and when to use the technologies?}

\paragraph{Meta-reflection on the NLP field:}
Overall, in the field, we are attesting a growing interest towards directions that better account for users, and human-centered approaches. A case in point regards: 

\noindent--- the \textbf{Human-centered NLP special theme}  at NAACL 2022\footnote{\url{https://2022.naacl.org/blog/special-theme/}}
    
     \noindent---the new \textbf{human-centered track} at *CL conferences, introduced with EMNLP 2023\footnote{\url{https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/main_conference_papers/}}
    
     \noindent---\textbf{HCI+NLP workshops}, in 2024 reaching its third edition \footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/hciandnlp/home}}
   
    \noindent---\textbf{Tutorial on Human-centered evaluation of Language Technologies} at EMNLP 2024:\footnote{\url{https://2024.emnlp.org/program/tutorials/}} 
  
    \noindent--- ongoing workshop proposal on \textbf{Participatory approaches to NLP}---this still signals desire to include users/people in technology design
    
    Note that there also was at ACL 2024 the \textit{Human-centered LLM workshop}\footnote{https://aclanthology.org/2024.hucllm-1.0.pdf}, but here honestly human-centered is sort of used vaguely...
    Also, it is good to keep in mind that we had to underscore in this paper \citet{artificial} the need for works to state that using LLms as subjects, it not the same as actually including subjects. 




\bs{TODO: maybe prepare a query on the ACL anthology with just human-centered to see mentions}. Use as keywords human-centric, centred, centered.  

\paragraph{Why Automatic Translation?}


\section{Vague background}

There is a lack of work that foregrounds human engagement 
\citep{cercas-curry-etal-2020-conversational, mengesha2021don, wang2024measuring}. 


\section{What are human-centered approaches?}
According to the NAACL special theme: 


\begin{itemize}
    \item is human-centered an \hl{empty signifier}?
    \item what does the legislation says about human-centered? e.g. \hl{AI act}
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples of risky situations where people do not know how to assess MT quality}

\section{List of issues/desiderata for human-centered MT}

According to NAACL special theme

\textit{As NLP applications increasingly mediate peopleâ€™s lives, it is crucial to understand how the design decisions made throughout the NLP research and development lifecycle impact people, whether they are users, developers, data providers or other stakeholders. For NAACL 2022, we invite submissions that address research questions that meaningfully incorporate stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of NLP resources, models and systems. We particularly encourage submissions that bring together perspectives and methods from NLP and Human-Computer Interaction. In addition to papers presenting research studies, we invite survey and position papers that take stock of past work in human-centered NLP and propose directions for framing future research.}

\textit{Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): usability studies of language technologies; needs-findings studies; studies of human factors in the NLP R\&D lifecycle, including interactive systems; human-centered fairness, accountability, explainability, transparency, and ethics in NLP systems; or human-centered evaluations of NLP technologies.}

\textit{Relevant methods include (but are not limited to) user-centered design, \hl{value-sensitive design},\footnote{\bs{check some FBK work on this}.} participatory design, assets-based design, and qualitative methods, such as grounded theory. We welcome contributions that use such methods to study NLP problems, as well as methodological innovations and tools that tailor these methods to NLP.}

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes are inserted with the \verb|\footnote| command.\footnote{This is a footnote.}

\subsection{Tables and figures}


\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
\begin{quote}
\tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
\end{quote}
This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

\subsection{Citations}






The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
\bibliography{custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz}.
To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
\bibliography{anthology,custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

\subsection{Appendices}

Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

\section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
\label{sec:bibtex}



Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.

\section*{Limitations}
ACL 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.
The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.

While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
Scientific work published at ACL 2023 must comply with the ACL Ethics Policy.\footnote{\url{https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics}} We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).
