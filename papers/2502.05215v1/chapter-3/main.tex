This chapter is based on the paper \fullcite{fernandez2023stable}.

Generative image modeling enables a wide range of applications but raises ethical concerns about responsible deployment.
In particular, it is challenging to trace the origin of generated content, which is important for content moderation, intellectual property, and accountability, in a context where deepfakes and manipulated images are increasingly common.
This chapter introduces Stable Signature, an active content tracing method combining image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Models. 
The goal is for all generated images to conceal an invisible watermark allowing for future detection and/or identification.
The method quickly fine-tunes the latent decoder of the image generator, conditioned on a binary signature.
A pre-trained watermark extractor recovers the hidden signature from any generated image and a statistical test then determines whether it comes from the generative model. 
We evaluate the invisibility of the watermarks on a variety of generation tasks, and show that they are robust to strong image modifications.
For instance, it detects the origin of an image generated from a text prompt, then cropped to keep 10\% of the content, with 90+\% accuracy at a false positive rate below 10$^{-6}$.
