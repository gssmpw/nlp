\chapter{Proactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking}\label{chapter:audioseal}

This chapter is based on the paper \fullcite{san2024proactive}.

In the rapidly evolving field of speech generative models, there is a pressing need to ensure audio authenticity against the risks of voice cloning. 
This chapter presents AudioSeal, an audio watermarking technique designed specifically for localized detection of AI-generated speech. 
It is the counterpart to the image watermarking method presented in Chap.~\ref{chapter:stable-signature} in two respects: it is a post-hoc watermarking method (as opposed to watermarking during generation), and it is designed for audio signals (which present different challenges).
AudioSeal employs a generator / detector architecture trained jointly with a localization loss to enable localized watermark detection up to the sample level, and a novel perceptual loss inspired by auditory masking, that enables better imperceptibility. 
AudioSeal achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of robustness to real life audio manipulations and imperceptibility based on automatic and human evaluation metrics. 
Additionally, AudioSeal is designed with a fast, single-pass detector, that significantly surpasses existing models in speed, achieving detection up to two orders of magnitude faster, making it ideal for large-scale and real-time applications.
