This chapter is based on the paper \fullcite{fernandez2022sslwatermarking}.

In the context of content distribution on platforms, watermarking may improve content moderation by embedding a unique identifier -- a specific marker that can be used to verify the source -- into each piece of content as soon as it is uploaded. 
This allows for active tracing of its origin, ensuring greater control over the material shared.
In this chapter, we revisit watermarking techniques based on pre-trained deep networks, in the light of self-supervised approaches.
We present a way to embed both marks and binary messages into their latent spaces, leveraging data augmentation at marking time. 
The resulting method is very versatile: it can operate at any resolution, with variable payload and tradeoff between quality and robustness, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.
It creates watermarks robust to a broad range of transformations (rotations, crops, JPEG, contrast, etc). 
It significantly outperforms the previous zero-bit methods, and its performance on multi-bit watermarking is on par with state-of-the-art encoder/decoder architectures trained end-to-end for watermarking.
