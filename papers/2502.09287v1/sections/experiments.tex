\section{Experiments}

We conclude our analysis of the copy task problem with numerical experiments illustrating the potential benefits of initialization of the parameters of linear models using representations from Eq.~\eqref{Param_of_the_as} and Eq.~\eqref{Param_of_the_bs}. We consider the following task: Given a dataset of autoregressive sequences $U = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_N)$ of length $N$, generated as: \(u_n = \rho u_{n-1} + \varepsilon_n, \  \varepsilon_n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2), \ u_1 \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1),\) where $\rho \in [0,1)$ is the correlation factor and $\sigma^2 = 1 - \rho^2$, the task is for the model to restore the output \(Y = u_{t^*}\) for a fixed index $t^*$ in the sequence. This boils down to learning a shift of $K^* = N-t^*$ with a finite number of samples. We use an input-independent linear model as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:filter_new}, where the vector $a$ is initialized with Eq.~\eqref{Param_of_the_as}, and vector $b$ with Eq.~\eqref{Param_of_the_bs}. In an initial set of experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of initializing with linearly-spaced phases for tasks with a large horizon, compared to random initialization with phases sampled across the entire disk. Subsequently, we assess the robustness of gridded initialization to variations in $K_\text{init}$, highlighting its flexibilityâ€”a crucial property for real-world applications where the task horizon is typically uncertain. See results in Fig.~\ref{fig:xps}, where (left plot) we see that our filter yields increasing benefits as $\rho$ grows compared to initialization with random phases, and (right plot) the optimal performance is obtained with the correct $K_\text{init} = K^*$ for initialization, yet the method remains robust even when initialized far from the optimal value. In all experiments, we took $S=128$.
