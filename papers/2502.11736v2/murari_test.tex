\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The explanation of the results is adequate''} (AI) vs. 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The explanation is too brief and misses key statistical trends in Figure 3, such as the anomaly at epoch 50''} (human)
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The paper uses supervised learning techniques effectively''} (AI), but the actual technique described is reinforcement learning.
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The methodology section is sufficient''} (AI), without noting that 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The comparison to baseline models lacks clarity, especially in explaining the choice of hyperparameters''} (human)
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``Provide more examples for better understanding''} (AI), instead of 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``Add examples demonstrating how the algorithm performs under different lighting conditions to clarify its robustness''}
\\ \hline

\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``Overall, the related work section is relevant''} (AI) vs. 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The related work section does not include recent advancements in transformer-based architectures, such as XYZ-2023''} (human)
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The dataset appears to be balanced''} (AI), but the dataset is actually imbalanced based on the class distributions mentioned in Section 4.2
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The discussion is clear''} (AI), but it misses feedback like 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The discussion should explore why the proposed approach underperforms on Dataset B, as highlighted in Table 2''} (human)
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``Clarify the introduction''} (AI), rather than 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``Reorganize the introduction to define the problem before introducing the contributions, as this will improve flow and reader engagement''}
\\ \hline

\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The conclusion is well-written''} (AI) vs. 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The conclusion does not address limitations, such as the small sample size used in the experiments''} (human)
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``The results suggest strong performance''} (AI), but it incorrectly claims 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``The model outperforms all baselines,''} while Table 3 shows it underperforms in some metrics
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``Results are promising''} (AI), lacking human feedback such as 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``Consider expanding on the implications of your findings for real-world applications, particularly in autonomous navigation''}
&
\fontsize{12pt}{22pt}\selectfont 
\textcolor{blue}{``Improve the figures for better clarity''} (AI), rather than 
\textcolor{darkgreen}{``Increase the font size in Figure 4 and add units to the axes labels for better readability''}
