\section{Adaptations}

In this section, we show three examples of practical adaptations of Kanana models to popular applications of LLMs: embedding models, retrieval-augmented models, and function calling models.
Through experimental results, we show that the performances of Kanana models are further improved in each relevant benchmarks when task-specific training techniques are further applied, showcasing the possibility of adapting Kanana models to a wide range of applications.
