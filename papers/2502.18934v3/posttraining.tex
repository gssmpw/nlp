\section{Post-training}

Building on Kanana pre-trained models, we further develop instruction-tuned models for direct interaction by natural language.
In Section \ref{subsec:post_train_performance}, we highlight the performance of Kanana instruction-tuned models, demonstrating superior performance on Korean tasks and competitive results on other tasks.
Section \ref{subsec:post-training-data} presents the details of the specifics regarding the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and preference datasets.
Section \ref{subsec:post_train_process} outlines the extensive post-training techniques applied on Kanana instruction models.
