\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities across various tasks. However, even minor variations in query phrasing, despite preserving the underlying semantic meaning, can significantly affect their performance. To address this, we focus on enhancing LLMs' awareness of symmetry in query variations and propose \methodlong, a data-centric approach that improves the model's ability to extract useful information from context. Unlike existing methods that emphasize reasoning chain augmentation, our approach improves model robustness at the knowledge extraction stage through query augmentation, enabling more data-efficient training and stronger generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings. Extensive experiments on both logical and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that \method\ enhances reasoning performance across diverse query variations, providing new insights into improving LLM robustness through structured dataset curation.

\section*{Limitations}
While \method\ demonstrates improved performance of reasoning consistency under query variations, we primarily evaluate it on arithmetic and logical reasoning tasks. As a result, its potential and effectiveness on more complex tasks or domains such as specialized scientific reasoning and code generation remain underexplored. 

% We acknowledge that enhancing LLM capabilities, such as with the \method\ proposed in this paper, may raise certain ethical considerations. However, we believe that none requires specific attention in this context.
