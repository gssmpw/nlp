We proposed the \RPT algorithm that is provably robust against arbitrary join orders of an acyclic query. Our evaluation in \duckdb shows that \rpt ensures a small variation in the execution time between random join orders for acyclic queries while improving their end-to-end performance at the same time. We hope that our results advance the state-of-the-art of robust SQL analytics and will simplify the join optimization logic in future query optimizers.
