\subsection{Applying Psychological Measurements in CSCW}
Psychological measurement has played a central role in the fields of human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work ____. In many cases, designers and organizations can develop bespoke surveys in user experience design ____. Yet high-stakes situations such as mental health rely on scientifically-validated measures.

Researchers in human-computer interaction have called for greater consideration of trauma in the design of technologies, making reference to the work of people who review harmful content for social media platforms [1] and artificial intelligence training systems [2]. Because the design of systems that structure human labor necessarily involves conflicting needs and aims ____ with different evidentiary requirements, no single measure of mental health will serve all purposes. In this section, we summarize the different parties who need to measure content reviewers' mental health and their sometimes conflicting use cases for clinical and psychological measures.

Content reviewing labor is structured in a complex supply chain of organizations with conflicting interests around worker mental health ____. This complexity is reflected in the scholarship within social computing, where researchers sometimes operationalize mental health as an independent variable that predicts productivity and retention for unpaid workers [3], sometimes describe it as an occupational risk [4], and other times describe it as a social justice concern [5]. In public talks, trust and safety professionals at large platforms have also described mental health measurement as a tool for supply chain transparency as they evaluate the constellation of contractors and sub-contractors who provide this labor ____. 

\textbf{Content Reviewers}
Many content reviewers may not realize they are experiencing mental health issues, as such problems can manifest gradually ____ and reviewers may become accustomed to feelings of anxiety, stress, and unhappiness at work and view these emotions as common [6]. Ignoring early warning signs can exacerbate negative mental states, leading to illnesses, burnout, and other health problems. Such burnout can also negatively impact job performance, relationships, and home life ____. Self-assessment could help workers prioritize their well-being and observe early signs of discomfort ____. With feedback on their symptoms, workers could make informed assessments of how their work affects them, seek care, and request changes to their work arrangements ____.

\textbf{Organizations that rely on content reviewing}
Since content reviewing work implicates many organizations across a labor supply chain of for-profit, non-profit, and public-interest organizations, these organizations have many potential uses for mental health measurement, some of them conflicting. Within organizations, measurements are relevant to three groups: managers, clients, and organizations that work with volunteer content reviewers.

\textit{Managers and designers} need to be able to identify working conditions that are especially harmful to whole groups of workers, whether those working conditions are the design of a software workflow, the design of an office building, or the management culture of a unit. They also need to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve workplace conditions ____. \text{Clients of organizations} that provide content reviewing labor need to be able to assess the well-being of subcontractors well enough to manage liability and ensure compliance with mental health best practices, sometimes across countries and cultures [7]. Clinical psychologists have reported that some companies have retained them to manage compliance and liability through supply chain transparency, though none of this work has been made public ____. Organizations that work with \textit{volunteer reviewers,} such as humanitarian groups, Wikipedia, or social media platforms, face distinct challenges to sustain levels of volunteering or support people whose trauma may make it difficult for them to step away from content reviewing [8]. Commercial platforms that rely on volunteer moderation also face this challenge, with the added constraint that too much support for unpaid volunteers might expose them to legal liability if courts determine that moderators should be compensated ____.

\textbf{Labor Organizers}
Measurements of content reviewer mental health can also be powerful tools for labor organizers. Consider, for example, the publicly stated goals of the Safe Content Advocacy Network (SCAN), led by the Kenyan moderator and organizer Daniel Motaung [9]. This organization seeks to advocate for better working conditions for moderators- an advocacy goal that reliable mental health measures could inform ____. These Kenyan workers, alongside content reviewers in Columbia, have now successfully unionized ____.

\textbf{Social Scientists}
In parallel with the pragmatic interests of tech firms, moderators, and other stakeholders, improved measurements of mental health could also contribute more general discoveries to the fields of psychology and design. Digital communications systems have created a new class of psychological experience for humankind - processing highly disturbing material at an unprecedented scale and speed [10]. Efforts to understand the psychological process created by these design decisions could help us better understand the nature of trauma more generally. Furthermore, attempts to transfer and validate clinical psychology measurements from other fields into content moderation could add clarity to the generalizability and limitations of the standard trauma measures we consider in this review ____.
