ABSTRACT = {The upcoming vogue of climate assemblies and other forms of mini-publics are to give citizens a central role in climate policy-making and to break the political impasse. Yet climate mini-publics face challenges in political environments too, such as co-option, favoring expert opinions, and losing touch with the broader public. To remedy such pitfalls, recent papers have argued to combine synchronous deliberations of small groups of citizens with online participation procedures for the larger public. In this article, we report the results of a three-step combination model, where first a mini-public in the region of Súdwest-Fryslân (NL) was given a “carte blanche” to draft the content and the parameters of several related policy alternatives. Second, their proposals were fed into a digital participation tool to consult the wider public. Third, a citizens forum translated the outcomes of the maxi-public into policy recommendations, which were unanimously approved by the municipal council. In this paper, we report our findings of combining mini- and maxi-publics and how the actors involved evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the combination of these two participatory approaches.},

To tackle these concerns, many argue that citizens should, through the use of digital platforms, have greater involvement in decision-making processes. This paper describes research into two such platforms, ‘Decide Madrid’ and ‘Better Reykjavik’. Through the use of interviews, questionnaires, ethnographic observation, and analysis of platform data, the study will determine if these platforms provide greater participation or simply replicate what is already offered by numerous other digital tools. The findings so far suggest that to be successful platforms must take on a form of deliberative democracy, allowing for knowledge co-production and the emergence of collective intelligence. Based on this, we aim to identify key features of sustainable models of online participation.},

However, in recent years there has been an increasing amount of concern that its functioning across the world may be eroding. In response, efforts to combat such change are emerging. Considering the pervasiveness of technology and its increasing capabilities, it is no surprise that there has been much focus on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to this end. Questions as to how AI can be best utilized to extend the reach of democracy to currently non-democratic countries, how the involvement in the democratic process of certain demographic groups (e.g. ethnic minorities, women, and young people) can be increased, etc. are frequent topics of discussion. In this article, I would like not merely to question whether this is desirable but rather argue that we should be trying to envisage ways of using AI for the exact opposite purpose: that of replacing democratic systems with better alternatives.},

            That there are more opportunities than ever for citizens to express their views may be, counterintuitively, a problem facing democracy—the sheer quantitative overabundance overloads policymakers and citizens, making it difficult to detect the signal amid the noise. This overload has been accompanied by marked decline in civility and argumentative complexity. Uncivil behavior by elites and pathological mass communication reinforce each other. How do we break this vicious cycle? Asking elites to behave better is futile so long as there is a public ripe to be polarized and exploited by demagogues and media manipulators. Thus, any response has to involve ordinary citizens; but are they up to the task? Social science on “deliberative democracy” offers reasons for optimism about citizens' capacity to avoid polarization and manipulation and to make sound decisions. The real world of democratic politics is currently far from the deliberative ideal, but empirical evidence shows that the gap can be closed.},

After summarising the relevant ideas of argumentation theory, we overview three recent contributions from the authors and their collaborators: (1) on how to automatically identify reply polarity (agreement or disagreement) between arguments submitted in online debates, (2) on locating where the justified arguments are likely to be and how that depends on the "degree of antagonism" of the debate, and (3) on how to present the arguments made in debates such that a reader would get as many of the justified arguments as possible without having to read the entire debate.

Moderators also edit and refactor debates as they grow. Thus, moderators play a critical role in cultivating and maintaining debates. Conﬂict between moderators is typical. It is a feature of argumentation and debate. However, not all conﬂict is productive. Conﬂict between moderators can undermine collaboration (by distracting from the task of managing debates) and drive attrition (by discouraging participation on the site altogether). Based on a ten-month participant observation on Kialo, we identify a common source of conﬂict between moderators: adversarial beliefs and values. Moderators are not neutral participants on Kialo. They take positions on debate topics. We suggest foregrounding these positions, which are potential sources of conﬂict, through interface design as a scalable solution to conﬂict management.},

The theoretical field was built through several independent approaches. We can pinpoint five different stages: a phase of transition and theoretical innovation compared to the models of participatory democracy that characterized the sixties and seventies; the first formulations and insights, in the early eighties; the constituent phase proper in the late eighties; the phase of articulation of a deliberative field and its overlapping with other intellectual traditions; and finally the consolidation of the philosophical foundations of deliberative democracy, mainly thanks to Jürgen Habermas and John Rawls, with their works of the early nineties.},

Examining how deliberation manifests across different societies has considerable promise for both explanatory and normative political theory. To explain why people deliberate—which should be among the first questions deliberative democrats ponder—it is first necessary to examine how people deliberate, and why this varies. Doing so with a comparative and historical perspective, even in the preliminary fashion presented here, reveals how social and political ideals can motivate and shape deliberative practice. And there are normative stakes in this agenda. If collective deliberation is to prevail in global governance, we must fashion political ideals which motivate diverse peoples to come together in discourse, rather than confront their problems, or compound them, by less desirable means.},

Epistemic democratic deliberation plays a role in some traditional approaches, but it has been more prominent in recent decades.

There is no justice without democracy in the sense that only citizens can democratically determine the specific content of justice. At the same time, there is also no democracy without justice in the sense that democratic outcomes are legitimate only to the extent that they can be understood as proper elaborations of the substantive but abstract ideal of justice-as-impartiality.},

In practice, scholars of mini-publics have examined the importance of moderators, structures, and dispositions, including empathy, for outcomes related to listening. Studies using the Deliberative Quality Index reveal factors that improve listening in legislatures. Research examining reciprocity utilize measures that could help us better understanding deliberative listening. Work by Hendriks and Sercan (2017) has even directly examined listening in deliberation.

Second, deliberative democracy (on the large scale) makes it possible for societies to talk to themselves about what they are doing and where they want to go.

In view of the important consequences for citizens, research on institutional deliberation focuses mainly on the ability to produce intelligent decisions. It employs a wide range of approaches to assess that ability. We review diverse literatures on institutional deliberation, with attention to legislatures (especially the US Congress), chief executives, bureaucratic agencies, courts, and popular referendums. These institutions employ a variety of distinctive processes and routinely assess voluminous and detailed information. Deficiencies in institutional deliberation often arise from imbalanced or uninformed constituency pressures. Thus institutional deliberation appears to benefit from moderate insulation from public and interest-group demands. Popular referendums have mixed effects on the intelligence of policymaking. In some circumstances, regular policymaking institutions can create opportunity for more deliberative popular forums to play effective roles in policy development.},

Finally, we analyze the possible roles of mini-publics within the political process. In both practical and normative terms, mini-publics tend to be perceived as consultative bodies. We examine arguments against the use of mini-publics in political decision making, evidence from their integration with direct and representative decision-making, and finally arguments for giving mini-publics a more decisive role in the political process.},

The effect involves in good part reversing the influences of strategic and manipulatory political discourse via discourse regulation and the activation of norms consistent with consistent with the “deliberative stance”. Scaling up the deliberativeness involves a form of mini-public trust, with a focus on the regulation of discourses by trusted peers, and deliberating citizens acting as exemplars of deliberative behaviour. To the extent that both practice and institutionalization exceed certain conditions there is scope for mini-publics to become engines for deliberative democratization.},

This analysis contends that political communication across Internet-based forums hosted by government bodies, the mainstream media, and multi-platforms of citizens’ talk should be assessed by taking into consideration diversified, complex, and usually contradictory interactions amongst actors that have distinct functions and interests within the political system. Insofar as deliberative principles and expectations are counterfactual, empirical research is always needed to investigate whether or not deliberative virtues are present in different contexts of media-based communication in a continuum of practices that form the deliberative system.},

The chapter considers the roles and risks that governance networks offer for public deliberation understood in broader systemic terms. It argues that networks play a number of important systemic functions: they generate ideas, inform deliberation, and provide opportunities for discursive connectivity. But empirical research reveals that networks can also pose pathologies for deliberative systems; they can be elite, exclusive, and dominated by special interests. A number of practical strategies are offered for how deliberative systems can boost the deliberative and democratic credentials of governance networks.},

Deliberative theorists now owe a detailed specification of what the key sites of deliberation are, how they relate to each other, and how those relations can yield emergent legitimacy, sometimes from practices and institutions that are not obviously deliberative on their face.

It is centred around several paradoxes and impossibility results identifying conflicts between different intuitively plausible desiderata. In recent years, there has been a growing dialogue between the two literatures. This paper discusses the connections between them. Important insights are that (i) deliberation can complement aggregation and open up an escape route from some of its negative results; and (ii) the formal models of social choice theory can shed light on some aspects of deliberation, such as the nature of deliberation-induced opinion change.},

Considerable evidence has shown that low levels of political knowledge, ideological inconsistency, and a vulnerability to framing effects are common elements of citizen belief systems. These represent both a challenge and an opportunity for deliberative forums. Evidence shows that deliberation can, under the right circumstances, interrupt typical cognitive patterns and produce more thoughtful and informed political judgments. But the extent to which deliberation has such salutary effects also depends on group-level dynamics and norms. We review three important types of group effects: group polarization, the effects of preference diversity on group interactions, and how unequal social identities can shape deliberative exchanges.

Focusing on the concept of framing, and leveraging the evidence for the psychological processes of “elaboration,” we argue that much of the advantages of deliberation can be achieved through citizens’ reasoning over the alternative frames and arguments provided by a competitive party system.

While in some strands of sociology it still is, this chapter argues that sociological work on deliberation has by and large moved away from big ideas toward a narrow project that is somewhat disconnected from the world outside the ivory tower. The chapter presents the best sociology has to offer scholars of deliberation, with a focus on ideas and practice. Specifically, the chapter advocates an approach to deliberation that engages with the relational turn of sociology, focusing less on decision-making outcomes and more on social relations and dynamics.},

This chapter examines three evolving areas of deliberative lawmaking—administrative lawmaking, districting commissions, and deliberative plebiscites—that underscore the ongoing relevance and promise of “second wave” deliberative democratic institutional design. The “notice and comment” structure of administrative rule-making, for instance, can invite the admission of multiple voices into the lawmaking process, especially when combined with the court’s role in incentivizing such practice. The trend toward nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions establishing legislative district lines can also generate powerful deliberative democratic dividends. Similarly, practices in plebisicitary democracy—whether through instances such as citizen policy juries or other directly democratic mechanisms—can contribute toward the deliberative democratization of law and society.},

They also argue that deliberative constitutionalism redirects longstanding debates in constitutional theory away from the standard courts–legislatures axis.

Second, three sets of conditions—related to 1) formal institutions, 2) social context, 3) issue characteristics—conduce “deliberative moments” in a negotiation. The chapter illustrates how these conditions work, with a focus on EU negotiations. Third, we explore the impact of deliberative negotiation on delivering outcomes

              (e.g. by offering solutions to the negotiators’ dilemma) and on producing “better” outcomes (e.g. by increasing the likelihood of overall preference satisfaction).

In this chapter, we want to consider, and indeed defend, the claim that deliberation has a vital role to play in deeply divided societies—not just in terms of shaping relationships between competing political elites, but also between elites and the ordinary citizens they claim to represent. To substantiate this argument, we draw on and contribute to a growing body of literature on deliberative consociation and deliberative democracy in divided societies that seeks to examine whether deliberation can help ethnic groups in conflict to deal democratically with their divisions.},

	abstract = {Latin America is a recurring reference among scholars of deliberative democracy, mostly due to the participatory budgeting, which was created in Brazil, and quickly spread around the world. The participatory budgeting was deemed successful due to its positive social and political outcomes, but also because it has shown that deliberation can be an inclusive and effective means of democratic decision-making. Yet, the participatory budget is one among hundreds of deliberative practices evolved in Latin America. While a large volume of research has focused on factors leading to participatory budgeting’s success, few have asked what are the contextual and institutional factors that explain why such inclusive and effective deliberative practice was born and bred in Latin America. This chapter tackles this question, and answers it by casting light on a variety of deliberative practices that compose Latin America’s vast experimentation with democracy.},

Can deliberation bear the burden of political legitimation or does deliberation itself require institutional support? In this chapter, we outline some of the cultural-institutional factors that variously foster and constrain deliberation in Europe. Further specification is provided through outlining the two main positions on the role and nature of deliberative democracy in the European Union context, namely the transnational and the institutional variant. An important question today concerns the prospects for deliberation after the Euro-crisis, a major institutional and constitutional crisis for the EU. The Euro-crisis (and the other associated challenges) is transforming the EU into a segmented political order which reduces the democratic merits of deliberation. Deliberation within segmented contexts is biased towards professionalized expertise and the trained incapacity of epistemic communities.},

The first addresses the paradigmatic features of transnational deliberation, the second looks at the more applied issue of how such a practice could be institutionalized, and the third considers the prospects for transnational deliberation as a complex system of interrelated parts. The argument of the chapter is that the “systemic turn” offers the most promising avenue for conceptualizing and realizing transnational and global deliberation, as it resists the temptation to place too much emphasis on a particular institution, forum or process.},

Those stretches are motivated by a desire to make the model either more deliberative or more democratic or moral realistic—or sometimes, in the best-case scenario, all three at once. A deliberative systems approach enables all three to be achieved, some at one place in the system and others at other places.},

We report both intrinsic evaluation metrics (perplexity), and extrinsic measures of the coherence of model outputs, as judged by an expert human rater. With a few exceptions, the rate at which models produced coherent responses ranged from 15-50\%. In contrast, human performance (users of the Kialo argument mapping platform) ranged from 65-82\% coherent, depending on the task.

However, even if different claims share the same stance on the same topic, their assessment depends on the prior perception and weighting of the different aspects of the topic being discussed. This renders it difficult to learn topic-independent quality indicators. In this paper, we study claim quality assessment irrespective of discussed aspects by comparing different revisions of the same claim. We compile a large-scale corpus with over 377k claim revision pairs of various types from kialo.com, covering diverse topics from politics, ethics, entertainment, and others. We then propose two tasks: (a) assessing which claim of a revision pair is better, and (b) ranking all versions of a claim by quality. Our first experiments with embedding-based logistic regression and transformer-based neural networks show promising results, suggesting that learned indicators generalize well across topics. In a detailed error analysis, we give insights into what quality dimensions of claims can be assessed reliably. We provide the data and scripts needed to reproduce all results.},

Besides recounting experiences with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose noncomputational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users – a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design.},

We reflect on this question based on a recent case of online participatory budgeting in a neighborhood of The Hague, the Netherlands (Duinoord Begroot).

Furthermore, the use of few participation criteria in the initial stages of the process can enhance the diversity of gathered ideas. In terms of deliberation, we discuss how the structure of an online platform may ‘nudge’ citizens towards deliberation. The results indicate that while the platform generated an equal distribution of arguments in favor of and against proposals, it did not engage citizens en masse in online discussions.

By also comparing with the best voter, we demonstrated the wisdom of the crowds, suggesting that democracy (distributed system) is a better option than dictatorship (centralized system), if those certain, natural conditions are met. Voting systems are not restricted to politics, they are ensemble methods for artificial intelligence, but the context of this article is natural intelligence. It is important to find a system that is fair (e.g. freedom of expression on the ballot exists), especially when the outcome of the voting system has social impact: some voting systems have the unfair inevitability to trend (over time) towards the same two major candidates (Duverger's law).},

A fair amount of research has focused on the institutional conditions fostering deliberation (design), while the outcomes of online deliberation processes (results) have mostly been neglected.

We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments. Then we argue for the “correctness” or “appropriateness” of our theory with two strong arguments. The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of our theory of argumentation. The second argument illustrates how our theory can be used to investigate the logical structure of many practical problems. This argument is based on a result showing that our theory captures naturally the solutions of the theory of n-person games and of the well-known stable marriage problem. By showing that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure, we introduce a general logic-programming-based method for generating meta-interpreters for argumentation systems, a method very much similar to the compiler-compiler idea in conventional programming.},

	abstract = {Deliberative and participatory approaches to democracy seek to directly include citizens in decision-making and agenda-setting processes. These methods date back to the very foundations of democracy in Athens, where regular citizens shared the burden of governance and deliberated every major issue. However, thinkers at the time rightly believed that these methods could not function beyond the scale of the city-state, or polis. Representative democracy as an innovation improved on the scalability of collective decision making, but in doing so, sacrificed the extent to which regular citizens could participate in deliberation. Modern technology, including advances in computational power, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques, presents a unique opportunity to scale out deliberative processes. Here we describe Polis, an open source web application capable of collecting and synthesizing feedback from people in a scalable and distributed fashion. Polis has shown itself capable of building shared understanding, disincentivizing counterproductive behavior (trolling), and cultivating points of consensus. It has done this in the context of journalistic and academic research, and directly as part of decision-making bodies at local and national levels, directly affecting legislation. These results demonstrate that deliberative processes can be scaled up beyond the constraints of in-person gatherings and small groups.},

However, deliberative discussion and consensus-reaching can be difficult in online chats in part because of the lack of structure. To explore the feasibility of a conversational agent that enables deliberative discussion, we designed and developed DebateBot, a chatbot that structures discussion and encourages reticent participants to contribute. We conducted a 2 (discussion structure: unstructured vs. structured) × 2 (discussant facilitation: unfacilitated vs. facilitated) between-subjects experiment (N = 64, 12 groups). Our findings are as follows: (1) Structured discussion positively affects discussion quality by generating diverse opinions within a group and resulting in a high level of perceived deliberative quality. (2) Facilitation drives a high level of opinion alignment between group consensus and independent individual opinions, resulting in authentic consensus reaching. Facilitation also drives more even contribution and a higher level of task cohesion and communication fairness. Our results suggest that a chatbot agent could partially substitute for a human moderator in deliberative discussions.

In this study we focus on the case of Decidim Barcelona, the online participatory-democracy platform launched by the City Council of Barcelona in which proposals can be discussed with an interface that combines threaded discussions and comment alignment with the proposal. This innovative approach allows to examine whether neutral, positive or negative comments are more likely to generate discussion cascades. The results reveal that, with this interface, comments marked as negatively aligned with the proposal were more likely to engage users in online discussions and, therefore, helped to promote deliberative decision making.},

Monte Carlo simulations highlight that separable item response models of roll call votes capture non-separability via correlated ideal points and higher salience of a primary dimension. We apply our model to the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament. In both settings, we find that legislators’ preferences over two basic dimensions are non-separable.

We also show that when a congressional legislator is replaced by a new member of the opposite party, one relative extremist is replaced by an opposing extremist. We call this leapfrog representation, a form of representation that leaves moderates with a dearth of representation in Congress. We see evidence of leapfrog representation in states and House districts and in the aggregate as well: the median member of the 109th House was too conservative compared to the median American voter, yet the median of the 110th House was too liberal. Thus, the median American voter was leapfrogged when the 109th House transitioned to the 110th. Although turnover between the 109th and 110th Senates occurred at approximately the same rate as between the 109th and 110th Houses, the Senate appears to be a more moderate institution whose median member does not move as abruptly as that of the House.},

Also prominent currently is one that uses Bayesian techniques. However, in more than one dimension, they both have several problems, of which nonidentiﬁability of ideal points is the most precarious. The approach that we offer uses a particular mode of principal components analysis to estimate ideal points. It applies logistic regression to estimate roll-call parameters. It has a special feature that provides some guidance for deciding how many dimensions to use.

Recent applications include large data sets of various types including roll calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods for ideal points with massive data. We derive the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce essentially identical estimates within minutes.

This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},

However, the number of interactions between the RS and the user is still limited. One aim of AL is therefore the selection of items whose ratings are likely to provide the most information about the user’s preferences. In this chapter, we provide an overview of AL within RSs, discuss general objectives and considerations, and then summarize a variety of methods commonly employed. AL methods are categorized based on our interpretation of their primary motivation/goal, and then sub-classiﬁed into two commonly classiﬁed types, instance-based and model-based, for easier comprehension. We conclude the chapter by outlining ways in which AL methods could be evaluated, and provide a brief summary of methods performance.},

Under the assumption that social networks are homophilic (McPherson et al., 2001), this is, the propensity of users to cluster along partisan lines, I develop a Bayesian Spatial Following model that scales Twitter users along a common ideological dimension based on who they follow. I apply this network-based method to estimate ideal points for Twitter users in the US, the UK, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. The resulting positions of the party accounts on Twitter are highly correlated with oﬄine measures based on their voting records and their manifestos. Similarly, this method is able to successfully classify individuals who state their political orientation publicly, and a sample of users from the state of Ohio whose Twitter accounts are matched with their voter registration history. To illustrate the potential contribution of these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior is polarized along ideological lines. Using the 2012 US presidential election campaign as a case study, I ﬁnd that public exchanges on Twitter take place predominantly among users with similar viewpoints.},

This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party identification.},

            The Deliberative Reasoning Index (DRI) is a method for assessing the positions formed by a group taking part in deliberation and their relationship to deliberative ideals of reasoning. The method is informed by a theory of reasoning as intrinsically a group process, and so it is best understood as an emergent group-level property. DRI captures the extent that a group coheres towards a shared understanding of the issue and takes seriously all relevant considerations in forming positions. The method involves measuring and aggregating the proportionality (intersubjective consistency) of differences between individuals regarding considerations, compared to their differences regarding preferred actions. DRI can be applied to analysis of how deliberative reasoning is improved, as well as perform comparisons across different cohorts. The method fills an important niche in the methodological inventory of deliberative democracy, evaluating outcomes without imposing external standards on their content.},

We test the model using data from the U.S. Congress over the past 150 years, and ﬁnd that our predictions are consistent with the two major political parties’ historical trajectory. In particular, the model explains how polarization between the Democrats and Republicans since the 1960s could be a consequence of increasing ideological homogeneity within the parties.},

We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans’ policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability.

	abstract = {Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) aim to increase voters’ political competence by providing them with the closest political party according to their preferences. To do this, VAAs usually compare and aggregate the positions of users and political parties on a set of policy issues by deﬁning a conceptual space and some distance metric on it. In this paper, we argue that the main method for performing the comparison adapts to users’ preferences unsatisfactorily because 1) they use unjustiﬁed a priori decisions for weighting policy issues and 2) they employ the same issue-voting space on all policy issues. Some exceptional cases address these issues by providing a community-based recommendation, but often come with lack of interpretability. To ﬁll these gaps, we propose an adaptive algorithm that learns the conﬁguration of the conceptual space from users’ answers. We employ a hybrid VAA that uses expert coding for the party positions and users’ data to adjust the calculation of the distance between users and parties. This new matching method, the Learning VAA, innovates by adjusting the saliency and issue-voting space for every policy issue. We argue and empirically demonstrate that our model ﬁts better the users’ preferences while providing a higher degree of interpretability.},

Recently flourishing research on VAAs addresses this phenomenon and provides explanations for the dissemination and popularity of these tools. Moreover, VAAs have been analyzed regarding their effects on political parties, candidates, and on voters in regard to their electoral behavior. Research shows that using a VAA indeed makes a difference, while the effect depends strongly on the way a VAA is designed and by whom it is used. The abundance of data generated by VAAs bears potential for comparative studies of public opinion and party systems over time and across countries, and thereby bridges research on VAAs to general questions of political science research.},

We seek to understand the extent to which they demotivate users, reducing the workforce of contributors, versus the extent to which they help users improve as encyclopedia editors. Overall we ﬁnd that reverts are powerfully demotivating, but that their net inﬂuence is that more quality work is done in Wikipedia as a result of reverts than is lost by chasing editors away. However, we identify key conditions – most speciﬁcally new editors being reverted by much more experienced editors –under which reverts are particularly damaging. We propose that reducing the damage from reverts might be one eﬀective path for Wikipedia to solve the newcomer retention problem.},

CAT algorithms respond to individuals' previous answers to select subsequent questions that most efficiently reveal respondents' positions on a latent dimension.

(1) Are stance classification models generalizable across datasets? We construct a single dataset model to train/test dataset-against-dataset, finding models do not generalize well (avg F1=0.33). (2) Can we improve the generalizability by aggregating datasets? We find a multi dataset model built on the aggregation of datasets has an improved performance (avg F1=0.69). (3) Given a model built on multiple datasets, how much additional data is required to fine-tune it? We find it challenging to ascertain a minimum number of data points due to the lack of pattern in performance. Investigating possible reasons for the choppy model performance we find that texts are not easily differentiable by stances, nor are annotations consistent within and across datasets. Our observations emphasize the need for an aggregated dataset as well as consistent labels for the generalizability of models.},

Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned in the text or that training data for every target is given. This paper considers the more challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned and no training data is available for the test targets. We experiment with conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms encoding the tweet and the target independently. Performance is improved further when the conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We evaluate our approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving performance second best only to a system trained on semi-automatically labelled tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach achieves state–of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {In recent times, a phenomenon that threatens the representative democracy of many developed countries is the low voter turnout. Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are used to inform citizens about the political stances of the parties that involved in the upcoming elections, in an eﬀort to facilitate their decision making process and increase their participation in this democratic process. VAA is a Web application that calls the users and parties to state their position in a set of policy statements, which are based on the current aﬀairs of their country and then it recommends to each user the party that better ﬁts their political views. SVAAs, a social recommendation approach of VAAs, on the other hand, base their recommendation on the VAA community of users in a collaborative ﬁltering manner. In this paper we resort to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in an attempt to improve the eﬀectiveness of SVAAs. In particular, we try to model party-supporters using HMMs and then use these models to recommend each VAA user the party whose model best ﬁts his/her answer sequence of the VAA policy statements. HMMs proved to be eﬀective machine learning tools for sequential and correlated data and this is the main rationale behind this study. VAA policy statements are usually correlated and grouped into categories such as external policy, economy, society, etc. As a result, opting from the various answer choices in each policy statement might be related with selections in previous and subsequent policy statements. Given that the order of policy statements is kept ﬁxed within each VAA one can assume that (a) answer patterns (sequences of choices for all policy statements included in the VAA) can be found that characterise ‘typical’ voters of particular parties, and (b) the answer choice in each policy statement can be ‘predicted’ from previous answer choices. For our experiments we use three datasets based on the 2014 elections to the European Parliament (http://www.euvox2014.eu/), which are publicly available through the Preference Matcher website (http://www.preferencematcher.org/?page\_id=18).},

The results indicate that the advice depends strongly on the spatial model adopted. A majority of the users of StemWijzer would have received another advice, if another spatial model had been used. At the aggregate level this means that how often a particular party is presented as best match depends strongly on the method used to determine the advice.

High support of the favored opinion in the social environment is treated as a positive feedback which reinforces the value associated to this opinion. In connected networks of sufficiently high modularity, different groups of agents can form strong convictions of competing opinions. Linking the social feedback process to standard equilibrium concepts we analytically characterize sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization. While previous models have emphasized the polarization effects of deliberative argument-based communication, our model highlights an affective experience-based route to polarization, without assumptions about negative influence or bounded confidence.},

However, there is also increasing evidence that conversation between people with opposing political views—which social media can enable—may decrease animus between them. Do anonymous online conversations between people of different parties exacerbate or mitigate partisan polarization? We created a mobile chat platform to study the impact of such discussions. Our study recruited Republicans and Democrats in the United States to complete a survey about their political views. We later randomized them into treatment conditions where they were offered ﬁnancial incentives to use our platform to discuss a contentious policy issue with an opposing partisan. We ﬁnd that people who engage in anonymous cross-party conversations about political topics exhibit substantial decreases in polarization compared to a placebo group that was asked to write an essay using the same conversation prompts. These depolarizing effects were particularly strong among Republicans and correlated with the civility of dialogue between study participants. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the potential for well-designed social media platforms to mitigate political polarization and underscore the need for a ﬂexible platform for scientiﬁc research on social media.},

Acquiring the values of features may be costly, and simply acquiring all values may be wasteful or prohibitively expensive. Active feature-value acquisition (AFA) selects features incrementally in an attempt to improve the predictive model most cost-effectively. This paper presents a framework for AFA based on estimating information value. Although straightforward in principle, estimations and approximations must be made to apply the framework in practice. We present an acquisition policy, sampled expected utility (SEU), that employs particular estimations to enable effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively little information is available about the underlying domain. We then present experimental results showing that, compared with the policy of using representative sampling for feature acquisition, SEU reduces the cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits consistent performance across domains. We also extend the framework to a more general modeling setting in which feature values as well as class labels are missing and are costly to acquire.},

But these vote-specific parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections among roll call analysis, item-response models, and “full-information” factor analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings, and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis.},

However, qualitative interviews are seldom used in economics and other disciplines inclined toward quantitative data analysis, likely due to concerns about limited scalability, high costs, and low generalizability. In this paper, we introduce an AI-assisted method to conduct semi-structured interviews. This approach retains the depth of traditional qualitative research while enabling large-scale, cost-effective data collection suitable for quantitative analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through a large-scale data collection to understand the stock market participation puzzle. Our 395 interviews allow for quantitative analysis that we demonstrate yields richer and more robust conclusions compared to qualitative interviews with traditional sample sizes as well as to survey responses to a single open-ended question. We also demonstrate high interviewee satisfaction with the AI-assisted interviews. In fact, a majority of respondents indicate a strict preference for AI-assisted interviews over human-led interviews. Our novel AI-assisted approach bridges the divide between qualitative and quantitative data analysis and substantially lowers the barriers and costs of conducting qualitative interviews at scale.},

Our findings suggest that there is a tendency toward swing voting among smartvote users, most prominently among younger voters. Moreover, we find that smartvote users who were very surprised by the outcome of their voting recommendations were also more inclined to change their party choices. Furthermore, we examine the directional change of the initial voting preferences of those voters who stated that the tool had influenced their voting decisions. Our findings are valid only for a self-selected sample of smartvote users; thus, we discuss necessary steps for improvement in future VAA research.},

This renders discourse a dynamic network phenomenon. Accordingly, the structure and dynamics of policy debates can be analyzed with a combination of content analysis and dynamic network analysis. After annotating statements of actors in text sources, networks can be created from these structured data, such as congruence or conflict networks at the actor or concept level, affiliation networks of actors and concept stances, and longitudinal versions of these networks. The resulting network data reveal important properties of a debate, such as the structure of advocacy coalitions or discourse coalitions, polarization and consensus formation, and underlying endogenous processes like popularity, reciprocity, or social balance. The added value of discourse network analysis over survey-based policy network research is that policy processes can be analyzed from a longitudinal perspective. Inferential techniques for understanding the micro-level processes governing political discourse are being developed.},

We test whether synthetic responses can be distinguished from real responses, analyze errors of synthetic data, and investigate content similarities between synthetic and real data. We conclude that GPT-3 can, in this context, yield believable accounts of HCI experiences. Given the low cost and high speed of LLM data generation, synthetic data should be useful in ideating and piloting new experiments, although any fndings must obviously always be validated with real data. The results also raise concerns: if employed by malicious users of crowdsourcing services, LLMs may make crowdsourcing of self-report data fundamentally unreliable.},

In contrast to other scaling methods, W-NOMINATE explicitly assumes probabilistic voting based on a spatial utility function, where the parameters of the utility function and the spatial coordinates of the legislators and the votes can all be estimated on the basis of observed voting behavior. Building on the W-NOMINATE software written by Poole in FORTRAN, the new package facilitates easier data input and manipulation, generates bootstrapped standard errors, and includes a new suite of graphics functions to display the results. We demonstrate the functionality of this package by conducting a natural experiment using roll calls —an experiment which is greatly simpliﬁed by the data manipulation capabilities of the W-NOMINATE package in R.},

We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. We conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with Google Docs. We found that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. A second study demonstrated that in larger groups, Wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools.},

However, the merging process could also impact annotators’ attitudes towards the content. To test this theory, we propose comparative news annotation; that is, annotating similarities and diferences between a pair of articles. By developing and deploying NewsComp—a prototype system—we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 109) to examine how users’ annotations compare to experts’, and how comparative annotation afects users’ perceptions of article credibility and quality. We found that comparative annotation can marginally impact users’ credibility perceptions in certain cases; it did not impact perceptions of quality. While users’ annotations were not on par with experts’, they showed greater precision in fnding similarities than in identifying disparate important statements. The comparison process also led users to notice diferences in information placement and depth, degree of factuality/opinion, and empathetic/infammatory language use. We discuss implications for the design of future comparative annotation tasks.},

Advances in technology now enable new, hybrid methods that combine some of the benefits of both approaches. Drawing inspiration from online information aggregation systems like Wikipedia and from traditional survey research, we propose a new class of research instruments called wiki surveys. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on contributions from participants, we envision an evolving survey driven by contributions from respondents. We develop three general principles that underlie wiki surveys: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. Building on these principles, we develop methods for data collection and data analysis for one type of wiki survey, a pairwise wiki survey. Using two proof-of-concept case studies involving our free and open-source website www.allourideas.org, we show that pairwise wiki surveys can yield insights that would be difficult to obtain with other methods.},

The CaringBridge (CB) dataset is a massive collection of journals written by patients and caregivers during a health crisis. Topic modeling on the CB dataset, however, is challenging due to the asynchronous nature of multiple authors writing about their health journeys. To overcome this challenge we introduce the Dynamic Author-Persona topic model (DAP), a probabilistic graphical model designed for temporal corpora with multiple authors. The novelty of the DAP model lies in its representation of authors by a persona — where personas capture the propensity to write about certain topics over time. Further, we present a regularized variational inference (RVI) algorithm, which we use to encourage the DAP model’s personas to be distinct. Our results show signiﬁcant improvements over competing topic models — particularly after regularization, and highlight the DAP model’s unique ability to capture common journeys shared by different authors.},

We demonstrate that a third wave of autocratization is indeed unfolding. It mainly aﬀects democracies with gradual setbacks under a legal façade. While this is a cause for concern, the historical perspective presented in this article shows that panic is not warranted: the current declines are relatively mild and the global share of democratic countries remains close to its all-time high.

            Vaccines save millions of lives every year. They are recommended by experts, trusted by the majority of people, and promoted by expensive health campaigns. Even so, people with neutral attitudes are more persuaded by people holding anti-vaccine than pro-vaccine attitudes. Our analysis of vaccine-related attitudes in more than 140 countries makes sense of this paradox by including approaches from social influence. Specifically, we show that neutral people are positioned closer to anti- than to pro-vaccine people in the opinion space, and therefore more persuadable by them. We use dynamic social simulations seeded with vaccine survey data, to show how this effect results in a drift towards anti-vaccine opinions. Linking this analysis to data from two other multi-country datasets, we found that countries in which the pro-vaccine people are less associated to the neutrals (and so less able to influence them) exhibit lower vaccination rates and stronger increase in distrust. We conclude our paper by showing how taking social influence into account in vaccine-related policy-making can possibly reduce waves of distrust towards vaccination.},

It discusses the nature of values and spells out the features that are common to all values and what distinguishes one value from another. The theory identifies ten basic personal values that are recognized across cultures and explains where they come from. At the heart of the theory is the idea that values form a circular structure that reflects the motivations each value expresses. This circular structure, that captures the conflicts and compatibility among the ten values is apparently culturally universal. The article elucidates the psychological principles that give rise to it. Next, it presents the two major methods developed to measure the basic values, the Schwartz Value Survey and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Findings from 82 countries, based on these and other methods, provide evidence for the validity of the theory across cultures. The findings reveal substantial differences in the value priorities of individuals. Surprisingly, however, the average value priorities of most societal groups exhibit a similar hierarchical order whose existence the article explains. The last section of the article clarifies how values differ from other concepts used to explain behavior—attitudes, beliefs, norms, and traits.},

To this end, we present Value Injection Method (VIM), a collection of two methods -- argument generation and question answering -- designed to inject targeted value distributions into LLMs via fine-tuning. We then conduct a series of experiments on four tasks to test the effectiveness of VIM and the possibility of using value-injected LLMs to predict opinions and behaviors of people. We find that LLMs value-injected with variations of VIM substantially outperform the baselines. Also, the results suggest that opinions and behaviors can be better predicted using value-injected LLMs than the baseline approaches.},

Cities are highly heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income of their residents, but also with respect to the cleanliness of their neighborhoods, the beauty of their architecture, and the liveliness of their streets, among many other evaluative dimensions. Until now, however, our ability to understand the effect of a city’s built environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on urban perception. Here, we build on the intuition that inequality is partly conspicuous to create quantitative measure of a city’s contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images, we measure the perception of safety, class and uniqueness; in the cities of Boston and New York in the United States, and Linz and Salzburg in Austria, finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the images of New York and Boston is larger than the range of perceptions elicited by images from Linz and Salzburg. We interpret this as evidence that the cityscapes of Boston and New York are more contrasting, or unequal, than those of Linz and Salzburg. Finally, we validate our measures by exploring the connection between them and homicides, finding a significant correlation between the perceptions of safety and class and the number of homicides in a NYC zip code, after controlling for the effects of income, population, area and age. Our results show that online images can be used to create reproducible quantitative measures of urban perception and characterize the inequality of different cities.},

In our strongly interconnected society, social influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as herding in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the amplification of fears during epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based models lack systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments showing how participants answering factual questions revise their initial judgments after being exposed to the opinion and confidence level of others. Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects exposed to peer-opinion for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength of peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our observations demonstrates how opinions in a group of interacting people can converge or split over repeated interactions. In particular, we identify two major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the presence of a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect, caused by the presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar opinions. Additional simulations reveal the existence of a tipping point at which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective opinion in a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in which self-confident and better informed minorities challenge the views of a large uninformed majority.},

            Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

	abstract = {Missing data values and differing sampling rates, particularly for important parameters such as particle size and stream composition, are a common problem in minerals processing plants. Missing data imputation is used to avoid information loss (due to downsampling or discarding incomplete records). A recent deep-learning technique, variational autoencoders (VAEs), has been used for missing data imputation in image data, and was compared here to imputation by mean replacement and by principal component analysis (PCA) imputation. The techniques were compared using a synthetic, nonlinear dataset, and a simulated milling circuit dataset, which included process disturbances, measurement noise, and feedback control. Each dataset was corrupted with missing values in 20\% of records (lightly corrupted) and in 90\% of records (heavily corrupted). For both lightly and heavily corrupted datasets, the root mean squared error of prediction for VAE imputation was lower than the traditional methods. Possibilities for the extension of missing data imputation to inferential sensing are discussed.},

However, debates on such forums can sometimes escalate into full blown exchanges of hate or misinformation. An important tool in understanding and tackling such problems is to be able to infer the argumentative relation of whether a reply is supporting or attacking the post it is replying to. This so called polarity prediction task is difficult because replies may be based on external context beyond a post and the reply whose polarity is being predicted. We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walk techniques to capture the wider context of a discussion thread in a principled fashion. Specifically, we propose methods to perform root-seeking graph walks that start from a post and captures its surrounding context to generate additional embeddings for the post. We then use these embeddings to predict the polarity relation between a reply and the post it is replying to. We evaluate the performance of our models on a curated debate dataset from Kialo, an online debating platform. Our model outperforms relevant baselines, including S-BERT, with an overall accuracy of 83\%.},

Numerous design features of large-scale online discussion systems allow larger numbers of people to discuss shared problems, enhance critical thinking, and formulate solutions. We review the transdisciplinary literature on the design of digital mass deliberation platforms and examine the commonly featured design aspects (e.g., argumentation support, automated facilitation, and gamification) that attempt to facilitate scaling up. We find that the literature is largely focused on developing technical fixes for scaling up deliberation, but may neglect the more nuanced requirements of high quality deliberation. Furthermore, current design research is carried out with a small, atypical segment of the world's population, and little research deals with how to facilitate and accommodate different genders or cultures in deliberation, counter pre-existing social inequalities, build motivation and self-efficacy in certain groups, or deal with differences in cognitive abilities and cultural or linguistic differences.

We demonstrate the tbip with two types of politicized text data: U.S. Senate speeches and senator tweets. Though the model does not analyze their votes or political aﬃliations, the tbip separates lawmakers by party, learns interpretable politicized topics, and infers ideal points close to the classical vote-based ideal points. One beneﬁt of analyzing texts, as opposed to votes, is that the tbip can estimate ideal points of anyone who authors political texts, including non-voting actors. To this end, we use it to study tweets from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Using only the texts of their tweets, it identiﬁes them along an interpretable progressive-tomoderate spectrum.},

During the second phase, 510 participants discussed about the population issue on the online platform we developed. We gathered data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3.

Even we limit ourselves to the political context in the legislative processes; we need a better understanding of latent factors, such as legislators, bills, their ideal points, and their relations. From the modeling perspective, this is difﬁcult 1) because these observations lie in a high dimension that requires learning on low dimensional representations, and 2) because these observations require complex probabilistic modeling with latent variables to reﬂect the causalities. This paper presents a new model to reﬂect and understand this political setting, NIPEN, including factors mentioned above in the legislation. We propose two versions of NIPEN: one is a hybrid model of deep learning and probabilistic graphical model, and the other model is a neural tensor model. Our result indicates that NIPEN successfully learns the manifold of the legislative bill’s text, and NIPEN utilizes the learned low-dimensional latent variables to increase the prediction performance of legislators’ votings. Additionally, by virtue of being a domain-rich probabilistic model, NIPEN shows the hidden strength of the legislators’ trust network and their various characteristics on casting votes.},

Many VAAs draw on low-dimensional spatial representations to match voters to political elites. Yet VAA spatial maps tend to be deﬁned purely on a priori grounds. Thus fundamental psychometric properties, such as unidimensionality and reliability, remain unchecked and potentially violated. This practice can be damaging to the quality of spatial matches. In this paper we propose dynamic scale validation (DSV) as a method to empirically validate and thereby improve VAA spatial maps. The basic logic is to draw on data generated by users who access the VAA soon after its launch for an evaluation (and potential adjustment) of the spatial maps. We demonstrate the usefulness of DSV drawing on data from three actual VAAs: ParteieNavi, votulmeu and choose4cyprus.},

While VAAs have been shown to enhance political knowledge and increase electoral turnout, research also demonstrates that voters frequently experience comprehension problems when responding to the political attitude statements in a VAA. We describe two studies in which we test a new type of VAA, called Conversational Agent VAA (CAVAA), in which users can easily access relevant information about the political issues in the VAA statements by asking questions to a chatbot. Study 1 reports about an online experiment (N = 229) with a 2 (Type: traditional VAA/CAVAA) x 2 (Political sophistication: low/high) design. Results show that CAVAA users report higher perceived political knowledge scores and also answer more factual knowledge questions correctly than users of a regular VAA. Also, participants’ CAVAA experience was evaluated better. In Study 2 (N = 180), we compared three CAVAA designs (a structured design with buttons, a non-structured design with an open text ﬁeld, and a semi-structured design with both buttons and an open text ﬁeld), again for higher and lower politically sophisticated users. While the three designs score equally high on factual and perceived knowledge indicators, the experience of the structured CAVAA was evaluated more positively than the non-structured version. To explore the possible cause for these results, we conducted an additional qualitative content analysis on 90 chatbot-conversations (30 per chatbot version). This analysis shows that users more frequently access additional information in a structured design than in a non-structured design, whereas the number of break-offs is the same. This suggests that the structured design delivers the best experience, because it provides the best trigger to ask questions to the chatbot.},

In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs’ ability to simulate political debates. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model’s inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.},

The wide amount of readily available information provided by VAAs to users has been shown to contribute to reducing the transactional costs involved in gathering relevant political information. Available evidence also supports the idea that VAA users are more likely to cast a ballot in elections as a result. The extent to which electoral participation is caused by using a VAA, however, remains unclear. Against this background, we reassess the mobilizing effect of VAAs by means of a multi-method approach. Our cross-sectional analysis of 12 national election study data sets provides further support to the idea that VAA usage increases users’ chances of casting a ballot in elections as compared to non-users. This conclusion is strengthened by the results of a randomized field experiment conducted in the context of the 2013 Italian parliamentary election.},

Here we develop an approach for exploratory analysis of hierarchical datasets using the Wasserstein distance metric that takes into account the shapes of within-unit distributions. We use tSNE to construct 2D embeddings of the units, based on the matrix of pairwise Wasserstein distances between them. The distance matrix can be eﬃciently computed by approximating each unit with a Gaussian distribution, but we also provide a scalable method to compute exact Wasserstein distances. We use synthetic data to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our Wasserstein t-SNE, and apply it to data from the 2017 German parliamentary election, considering polling stations as samples and voting districts as units. The resulting embedding uncovers meaningful structure in the data.},

            Using data from Twitter (now X), this study deploys artificial intelligence (AI) and network analysis to map and profile climate change denialism across the United States. We estimate that 14.8\% of Americans do not believe in climate change. This denialism is highest in the central and southern U.S. However, it also persists in clusters within states (e.g., California) where belief in climate change is high. Political affiliation has the strongest correlation, followed by level of education, COVID-19 vaccination rates, carbon intensity of the regional economy, and income. The analysis reveals how a coordinated social media network uses periodic events, such as cold weather and climate conferences, to sow disbelief about climate change and science, in general. Donald Trump was the strongest influencer in this network, followed by conservative media outlets and right-wing activists. As a form of knowledge vulnerability, climate denialism renders communities unprepared to take steps to increase resilience. As  with other forms of misinformation, social media companies (e.g., X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok) should flag accounts that spread falsehoods about climate change and collaborate on targeted educational campaigns.},

The test result should ideally be close to the result that the participant would have gotten after answering the full battery of questions. We propose a method that allows respondents to conclude a VAA early and still get results with sufficient accuracy.The method proposed here extends the Graded Response Model and the Maximum Information Criterion, used in Item Response Theory. The aim of the method is to allow the user to control the length of the test. Furthermore, we want a simpler interpretation of multidimensional parameter estimates than we get from traditional MIRT. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm for adaptive IRT capable of selecting from a pool of items that belong to separate unidimensional scales. Using both simulated data and response data from a voting advice application project, we evaluate the accuracy of shorter tests implemented with our adaptive method. When only a few test items are answered, our proposed method outperforms a static-order IRT test of equal length in identifying the best match. We expect that implementation of the method can increase participation and engagement in voting advice applications.},

Based on a classification of news outlets curated by

We characterize the networks of information flow to find the most influential spreaders of fake and traditional news and use causal modeling to uncover how fake news influenced the presidential election. We find that, while top influencers spreading traditional center and left leaning news largely influence the activity of Clinton supporters, this causality is reversed for the fake news: the activity of Trump supporters influences the dynamics of the top fake news spreaders.},

Using political bias and fact-checking tools, we measure the volume of politically biased content and the number of users propagating such information. We then identify influencers—users with the greatest ability to spread news in the Twitter network. We observe that the fraction of fake and extremely biased content declined between 2016 and 2020.

Understanding the capacities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking tasks is therefore essential for ensuring the health of our information ecosystem. Here, we evaluate the use of LLM agents in fact-checking by having them phrase queries, retrieve contextual data, and make decisions. Importantly, in our framework, agents explain their reasoning and cite the relevant sources from the retrieved context. Our results show the enhanced prowess of LLMs when equipped with contextual information. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3, but accuracy varies based on query language and claim veracity. While LLMs show promise in fact-checking, caution is essential due to inconsistent accuracy.

We identified approaches to designing PB voting that minimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the digital process from the citizens' perspective.

Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories.

This paper takes an inductive approach in political theory to critically examine three features of online deliberation that matter for deliberative democracy: scale, transparency, and the facilitation of equality. It argues that the enhancement of equality should be given special attention when designing and implementing deliberative DDIs. Equality is a basic democratic value that is crucial for the intrinsic quality of deliberation. One way of enhancing equality through digital deliberative practices is via AI facilitation, which can assist human facilitators and help mitigate power dynamics, often present in non-digital settings.},

Our work develops new methods to (1) measure political biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our ﬁndings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness. 1 Warning: This paper contains examples of hate speech.},

	abstract = {Recommending cold items is a long-standing challenge for collaborative filtering models because these cold items lack historical user interactions to model their collaborative features. The gap between the content of cold items and their behavior patterns makes it difficult to generate accurate behavioral embeddings for cold items. Existing cold-start models use mapping functions to generate fake behavioral embeddings based on the content feature of cold items. However, these generated embeddings have significant differences from the real behavioral embeddings, leading to a negative impact on cold recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we propose an LLM Interaction Simulator (LLM-InS) to model users’ behavior patterns based on the content aspect. This simulator allows recommender systems to simulate vivid interactions for each cold item and transform them from cold to warm items directly. Specifically, we outline the designing and training process of a tailored LLM-simulator that can simulate the behavioral patterns of users and items. Additionally, we introduce an efficient “filtering-and-refining” approach to take full advantage of the simulation power of the LLMs. Finally, we propose an updating method to update the embeddings of the items. we unified trains for both cold and warm items within a recommender model based on the simulated and real interactions. Extensive experiments using real behavioral embeddings demonstrate that our proposed model, LLMInS, outperforms nine state-of-the-art cold-start methods and three LLM models in cold-start item recommendations.},

	abstract = {Traditional recommender systems leverage users’ item preference history to recommend novel content that users may like. However, modern dialog interfaces that allow users to express language-based preferences offer a fundamentally different modality for preference input. Inspired by recent successes of prompting paradigms for large language models (LLMs), we study their use for making recommendations from both item-based and language-based preferences in comparison to state-of-the-art item-based collaborative filtering (CF) methods. To support this investigation, we collect a new dataset consisting of both item-based and language-based preferences elicited from users along with their ratings on a variety of (biased) recommended items and (unbiased) random items. Among numerous experimental results, we find that LLMs provide competitive recommendation performance for pure language-based preferences (no item preferences) in the near cold-start case in comparison to item-based CF methods, despite having no supervised training for this specific task (zero-shot) or only a few labels (fewshot). This is particularly promising as language-based preference representations are more explainable and scrutable than item-based or vector-based representations.},

To this end, we leverage a recently introduced dataset containing group discussions of people collaborating to solve a task. To find out what makes someone change their mind, we incorporate various techniques such as neural text classification and language-agnostic change point detection. Evaluation of these methods shows that while the task is not trivial, the best way to approach it is using a languageaware model with learning-to-rank training. Finally, we examine the cues that the models develop as indicative of the cause of a change of mind.},

	abstract = {The assessment of bias within Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical concern in the contemporary discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of their potential impact on societal dynamics. Recognizing and considering political bias within LLM applications is especially important when closing in on the tipping point toward performative prediction. Then, being educated about potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can drive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In this way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political bias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct or assistant models) concerning political issues within the European Union (EU) from a German voter’s perspective. To do so, we use the ”Wahl-O-Mat,” a voting advice application used in Germany. From the voting advice of the ”Wahl-O-Mat” we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with German political parties. We show that larger models, such as Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties, while smaller models often remain neutral, particularly when prompted in English. The central finding is that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in the alignment concerning a specific party. Our findings underline the importance of rigorously assessing and making bias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities of performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine learning prediction and language generation.},

In experimental studies (N=2,543, N=1,848), we use an intervention to reduce these often exaggerated fears. With these fears reduced, partisans become more committed to upholding democratic norms. They may also become more willing to vote against candidates of their own party who break these norms. The findings suggest that we can foster democratic stability by strengthening trust in opposing partisans’ commitment to democracy.},

We observed that the methods used for voting input and the presentation of choices influence LLM voting behavior. We discovered that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chainof-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings.

Understanding the causal effect of predictions on the eventual outcomes is crucial for foreseeing the implications of future predictive models and selecting which models to deploy. However, this causal estimation task poses unique challenges: model predictions are usually deterministic functions of input features and highly correlated with outcomes. This can make the causal effect of predictions on outcomes impossible to disentangle from the direct effect of the covariates. We study this problem through the lens of causal identiﬁability. Despite the hardness of this problem in full generality, we highlight three natural scenarios where the causal effect of predictions can be identiﬁed from observational data: randomization in predictions, overparameterization of the predictive model deployed during data collection, and discrete prediction outputs. Empirically we show that given our identiﬁability conditions hold, standard variants of supervised learning that predict from predictions by treating the prediction as an input feature can ﬁnd transferable functional relationships that allow for conclusions about newly deployed predictive models. These positive results fundamentally rely on model predictions being recorded during data collection, bringing forward the importance of rethinking standard data collection practices to enable progress towards a better understanding of social outcomes and performative feedback loops.},

Existing studies show that ordinary users have the potential to understand the fundamental mechanism of DP and its implications for the privacy-utility trade-off when they are communicated clearly through textual and visual aids and, accordingly, make informed decisions about sharing their data under differential privacy protection. However, these attempts either only implicitly mention a few possible values for ε, such as low, medium, and high, or altogether leave it out of the communication. In this paper, we conduct a between-subject user study (N = 426) to investigate the effectiveness of nine interactive visual tools to communicate ε explicitly and on a continuous scale in a data-sharing scenario related to publishing positive COVID-19 test results. These interactive visual tools allow casual users to visualize DP’s effects on data accuracy and/or privacy loss for various ε values. We found that visualizations incorporating the privacy loss component have a signiﬁcant impact on assisting users in selecting values that are closer to the recommended values by experts. However, depending on the ratio between DP noise and underlying data, the accuracy loss component disparately affects users’ ε decision; the bigger the relative error, the bigger the selected epsilon and vice versa. Thus, accuracy portrayals should be carried out with care. We contextualize our ﬁndings in the existing literature and conclude with insights and recommendations on effectively employing our ﬁndings to communicate differential privacy to casual users.},

	abstract = {User cold-start recommendation is one of the most challenging problems that limit the effectiveness of recommender systems. Metalearning-based methods are introduced to address this problem by learning initialization parameters for cold-start tasks. Recent studies attempt to enhance the initialization methods. They first represent each task by the cold-start user and interacted items. Then they distinguish tasks based on the task relevance to learn adaptive initialization. However, this manner is based on the assumption that user preferences can be reflected by the interacted items saliently, which is not always true in reality. In addition, we argue that previous approaches suffer from their adaptive framework (e.g., adaptive initialization), which reduces the adaptability in the process of transferring meta-knowledge to personalized RSs. In response to the issues, we propose a task-difficulty-aware metalearning with adaptive update strategies (TDAS) for user cold-start recommendation. First, we design a task difficulty encoder, which can represent user preference salience, task relevance, and other task characteristics by modeling task difficulty information. Second, we adopt a novel framework with task-adaptive local update strategies by optimizing the initialization parameters with task-adaptive per-step and per-layer hyperparameters. Extensive experiments based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our TDAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/XuHao-bit/TDAS.},

            The Partial Credit model with a varying slope parameter has been developed, and it is called the Generalized Partial Credit model. The item step parameter of this model is decomposed to a location and a threshold parameter, following Andrich's Rating Scale formulation. The EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters was derived. The performance of this generalized model is compared with a Rasch family of polytomous item response models based on both simulated and real data.
            Simulated data were generated and then analyzed by the various polytomous item response models. The results obtained demonstrate that the rating formulation of the Generalized Partial Credit model is quite adaptable to the analysis of polytomous item responses. The real data used in this study consisted of NAEP Mathematics data which was made up of both dichotomous and polytomous item types. The Partial Credit model was applied to this data using both constant and varying slope parameters. The Generalized Partial Credit model, which provides for varying slope parameters, yielded better fit to data than the Partial Credit model without such a provision.

            Can brief, unmoderated cross-partisan discussions reduce political polarization, even when partisans disagree on the issue under discussion? This article reports results from an experiment that matched 582 UK Labour and Conservative party voters for a ten-minute, unmoderated chat discussion about a contentious issue in a wait-list control design. Issue disagreement between discussing partisans randomly varied, and was visible throughout the discussion. Results show that after the discussion, out-partisan sympathy and willingness to have cross-partisan discussions increased. There was no statistically significant effect on opinions. The effect on sympathy was lower when partisans’ issue opinions were further apart. Treatment effects correlate with reported experiences of perspective-getting, inclusion in the discussion, commonality and reduced misperceptions. Conservative respondents about to discuss immigration softened their views just prior to the discussion.},

However, empirical evidence of this causal relationship is inconsistent at best. One reason could be that many previous studies were unable to separate the effects caused by individual exposure to like-minded content from the effects caused by the algorithms themselves. This study presents results from two quasi-experiments in which participants were exposed either to algorithmically selected or randomly selected arguments that were either in line or in contrast with their attitudes on two different topics. The results reveal that exposure to like-minded arguments increased participants’ attitude polarization and affective polarization more intensely than exposure to opposing arguments. Yet, contrary to popular expectations, these effects were not amplified by algorithmic selection. Still, for one topic, exposure to algorithmically selected arguments led to slightly stronger attitude polarization than randomly selected arguments.},

To address user fatigue and incomplete responses, some applications (such as the Swiss Smartvote) oﬀer a condensed version of their questionnaire. However, these condensed versions cannot ensure the accuracy of recommended parties or candidates, which we show to remain below 40\%. To address these limitations, this work introduces an adaptive questionnaire approach that selects subsequent questions based on users’ previous answers, aiming to enhance recommendation accuracy while reducing the number of questions posed to the voters. Our method uses an encoder and decoder module to predict missing values at any completion stage, leveraging a two-dimensional latent space that is reﬂective of the traditional methods used in political science for visualizing ideology. Additionally, a selector module is proposed to determine the most informative subsequent question based on the voter’s current position in the latent space and the remaining unanswered questions. We validated our approach using the Smartvote dataset from the Swiss Federal elections in 2019, testing various spatial models and selection methods to optimize the system’s predictive accuracy. Our ﬁndings indicate that employing the IDEAL model both as encoder and decoder, combined with a PosteriorRMSE method for question selection, signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of recommendations, achieving 74\% accuracy after asking the same number of questions as in the condensed version.},

However, the semantic gap between natural language and recommendation tasks is still not well addressed, leading to multiple issues such as spuriously correlated user/item descriptors, ineffective language modeling on user/item data, inefficient recommendations via auto-regression, etc. In this paper, we propose CLLM4Rec, the first generative RS that tightly integrates the LLM paradigm and ID paradigm of RSs, aiming to address the above challenges simultaneously. We first extend the vocabulary of pretrained LLMs with user/item ID tokens to faithfully model user/item collaborative and content semantics. Accordingly, a novel soft+hard prompting strategy is proposed to effectively learn user/item collaborative/content token embeddings via language modeling on RS-specific corpora, where each document is split into a prompt consisting of heterogeneous soft (user/item) tokens and hard (vocab) tokens and a main text consisting of homogeneous item tokens or vocab tokens to facilitate stable and effective language modeling. In addition, a novel mutual regularization strategy is introduced to encourage CLLM4Rec to capture recommendation-related information from noisy user/item content. Finally, we propose a novel recommendation-oriented finetuning strategy for CLLM4Rec, where an item prediction head with multinomial likelihood is added to the pretrained CLLM4Rec backbone to predict hold-out items based on soft+hard prompts established from masked user-item interaction history, where recommendations of multiple items can be generated efficiently without hallucination1.},

There is an evolving paradigm in this research field that recommendation network learning occurs both on the cloud and on edges with knowledge transfer in between (i.e., edge-cloud collaboration). Recent works push this filed further by enabling edge-specific context-aware adaptivity, where model parameters are updated in real-time based on incoming on-edge data. However, we argue that frequent data exchanges between the cloud and edges often lead to inefficiency and waste of communication/computation resources, as considerable parameter updates might be redundant. To investigate this problem, we introduce Intelligent Edge-Cloud Parameter Request Model (IntellectReq). IntellectReq is designed to operate on edge, evaluating the cost-benefit landscape of parameter requests with minimal computation and communication overhead. We formulate this as a novel learning task, aimed at the detection of out-of-distribution data, thereby fine-tuning adaptive communication strategies. Further, we employ statistical mapping techniques to convert real-time user behavior into a normal distribution, thereby employing multi-sample outputs to quantify the model’s uncertainty and thus its generalization capabilities. Rigorous empirical validation on three widely-adopted benchmarks evaluates our approach, evidencing a marked improvement in the efficiency and generalizability of edge-cloud collaborative and dynamic recommendation systems.},

This tutorial is designed to review the progression of LLM4Rec and provide an in-depth analysis of the prevailing studies. We will discuss how LLMs advance recommender systems in model architecture, learning paradigms, and capabilities like conversation, generalization, planning, and content generation. Additionally, the tutorial will highlight open problems and challenges in this nascent field, addressing concerns related to trustworthiness, efficiency, online training, and recommendation data modeling. Concluding with a summary of the takeaways from previous research, the tutorial will suggest avenues for future investigations. Our aim is to help the audience grasp the developments in LLM4Rec, as well as to spark inspiration for further research. By doing so, we expect to contribute to the growth and success of LLM4Rec, possibly leading to a fundamental change in recommender paradigms.},

We term this property algorithmic fidelity and explore its extent in GPT-3. We create “silicon samples” by conditioning the model on thousands of sociodemographic backstories from real human participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and reflects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and sociocultural context that characterize human attitudes. We suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic fidelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of humans and society across a variety of disciplines.},

            A core problem in deliberative democracy is the tension between two seemingly equally important conditions of democratic legitimacy: deliberation, on the one hand, and mass participation, on the other. Might artificial intelligence help bring quality deliberation to the masses? The answer is a qualified yes. The chapter first examines the conundrum in deliberative democracy around the trade-off between deliberation and mass participation by returning to the seminal debate between Joshua Cohen and Jürgen Habermas. It then turns to an analysis of the 2019 French Great National Debate, a low-tech attempt to involve millions of French citizens in a two-month-long structured exercise of collective deliberation. Building on the shortcomings of this process, the chapter then considers two different visions for an algorithm-powered form of mass deliberation—Mass Online Deliberation (MOD), on the one hand, and Many Rotating Mini-publics (MRMs), on the other—theorizing various ways artificial intelligence could play a role in them. To the extent that artificial intelligence makes the possibility of either vision more likely to come to fruition, it carries with it the promise of deliberation at the very large scale.},

To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage.

Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10\% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30\% for some PubMed sub-corpora.

We suggest that matching offers key improvements over existing methods to tackle self-selection into VAA use in observational studies. To improve confidence in selection on observables, we complement matching estimates with an extensive sensitivity analysis, including a placebo test. Empirically, we study the effect of smartvote, a popular VAA from Switzerland, on turnout in the 2007 Swiss federal election. We find that smartvote usage significantly increased the individual-level probability to vote. Our results suggest that smartvote was, on the aggregate, responsible for about 1.2 \% points of the total tally with an estimated cost of nine Swiss Francs (7.5 U.S. dollars or 1.4 “Big Macs”) per additional vote.

              INTRODUCTION
              Democracy, at its best, rests upon the free and equal exchange of views among people with diverse perspectives. Collective deliberation can be effectively supported by structured events, such as citizens’ assemblies, but such events are expensive, are difficult to scale, and can result in voices being heard unequally. This study investigates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these limitations, using AI mediation to help people find common ground on complex social and political issues.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              We asked whether an AI system based on large language models (LLMs) could successfully capture the underlying shared perspectives of a group of human discussants by writing a “group statement” that the discussants would collectively endorse. Inspired by Jürgen Habermas’s theory of communicative action, we designed the “Habermas Machine” to iteratively generate group statements that were based on the personal opinions and critiques from individual users, with the goal of maximizing group approval ratings. Through successive rounds of human data collection, we used supervised fine-tuning and reward modeling to progressively enhance the Habermas Machine’s ability to capture shared perspectives. To evaluate the efficacy of AI-mediated deliberation, we conducted a series of experiments with over 5000 participants from the United Kingdom. These experiments investigated the impact of AI mediation on finding common ground, how the views of discussants changed across the process, the balance between minority and majority perspectives in group statements, and potential biases present in those statements. Lastly, we used the Habermas Machine for a virtual citizens’ assembly, assessing its ability to support deliberation on controversial issues within a demographically representative sample of UK residents.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Group opinion statements generated by the Habermas Machine were consistently preferred by group members over those written by human mediators and received higher ratings from external judges for quality, clarity, informativeness, and perceived fairness. AI-mediated deliberation also reduced division within groups, with participants’ reported stances converging toward a common position on the issue after deliberation; this result did not occur when discussants directly exchanged views, unmediated. Although support for the majority position increased after deliberation, the Habermas Machine demonstrably incorporated minority critiques into revised statements. We replicated these results in a virtual citizens’ assembly, additionally finding that during AI-mediated deliberation, the views of groups of discussants tended to move in a similar direction on controversial issues. These shifts were not attributable to biases in the AI, suggesting that the deliberation process genuinely aided the emergence of shared perspectives on potentially polarizing social and political issues.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              This research demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance collective deliberation by finding common ground among discussants with diverse views. The AI-mediated approach is time-efficient, fair, scalable, and outperforms human mediators on key dimensions. Rather than simply appealing to the majority, the Habermas Machine prominently incorporated dissenting voices into the group statements. AI-assisted deliberation is not without its risks, however; to ensure fair and inclusive debate, steps must be taken to ensure users are representative of the target population and are prepared to contribute in good faith. Under such conditions, AI may be leveraged to improve collective decision-making across various domains, from contract negotiations and conflict resolution to political discussions and citizens’ assemblies. The Habermas Machine offers a promising tool for finding agreement and promoting collective action in an increasingly divided world.

                  (Left) The AI mediator uses participants’ opinions to generate group statements and iteratively refines those statements through participants’ critiques. (Middle) Statements from the AI mediator (purple) garner stronger endorsement than those written by a human mediator (orange). (Right) AI mediation leaves groups less divided after deliberation, whereas simply sharing opinions with others does not.},

	abstract = {For cold-start recommendation, it is important to rapidly proﬁle new users and generate a good initial set of recommendations through an interview process — users should be queried adaptively in a sequential fashion, and multiple items should be oﬀered for opinion solicitation at each trial. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that learns to conduct the interview process guided by a decision tree with multiple questions at each split. The splits, represented as sparse weight vectors, are learned through an L1-constrained optimization framework. The users are directed to child nodes according to the inner product of their responses and the corresponding weight vector. More importantly, to account for the variety of responses coming to a node, a linear regressor is learned within each node using all the previously obtained answers as input to predict item ratings. A user study, preliminary but ﬁrst in its kind in cold-start recommendation, is conducted to explore the eﬃcient number and format of questions being asked in a recommendation survey to minimize user cognitive eﬀorts. Quantitative experimental validations also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both the prediction accuracy and user cognitive eﬀorts.},

SVAAs extend VAAs by providing (a) community-based recommendations, (b) comparison of users’ political opinions, and (c) a channel of user communication. In addition, SVAAs enriched with data mining modules, can operate as citizen sensors recording the sentiment of the electorate on issues and candidates. Drawing on VAA datasets generated by the Preference Matcher research consortium, we evaluate the results of the ﬁrst VAA—Choose4Greece—which incorporated social voting features and was launched during the landmark Greek national elections of 2012. We demonstrate how an SVAA can provide community based features and, at the same time, serve as a citizen sensor. Evaluation of the proposed techniques is realized on a series of datasets collected from various VAAs, including Choose4Greece.

	abstract = {The relevance and importance of voting advice applications (VAAs) are demonstrated by their popularity among potential voters. On average, around 30\% of voters take into account the recommendations of these applications during elections. The comparison between potential voters' and parties' positions is made on the basis of VAA policy statements on which users are asked to express opinions. VAA designers devote substantial time and effort to analyzing domestic and international politics to formulate policy statements and select those to be included in the application. This procedure involves manually reading and evaluating a large volume of publicly available data, primarily party manifestos. A problematic part of the work is the limited time frame. This study proposes a system to assist VAA designers in formulating, revising, and selecting policy statements. Using pre-trained language models and machine learning methods to process politics-related textual data, the system produces a set of suggestions corresponding to relevant VAA statements. Experiments were conducted using party manifestos and YouTube comments from Japan, combined with VAA policy statements from six Japanese and two European VAAs. The technical approaches used in the system are based on the BERT language model, which is known for its capability to capture the context of words in the documents. Although the output of the system does not completely eliminate the need for manual human assessment, it provides valuable suggestions for updating VAA policy statements on an objective, i.e., bias-free, basis.},

The method ﬁrst enumerates data facts of a given dataset, and scores and organizes them. The facts are further assembled, sequenced into a story, with reader input taken into consideration. Finally, visual graphs, transitions, and text descriptions are generated to synthesize the scrollytelling visualization. In this way, non-professionals can easily explore and share interesting perspectives from selected data attributes and fact types.

Our between-subject study (n=85) evaluated these aspects in-the-wild, with results pointing towards some general design considerations to keep in mind when authoring data-driven disease stories. Combining storytelling with interactive new media techniques, narrative medical visualization is a promising approach to communicating topics in medicine to a general audience in an accessible manner. For patients, visual storytelling may help them to better understand medical procedures and treatment options for more informed decisionmaking, boost their confidence and alleviate anxiety, and promote stronger personal health advocacy. Narrative medical visualization provides the building blocks for producing data-driven disease stories, which may be presented in several visual styles. These different styles correspond to different narrative genres, e.g., a Slideshow. Narrative genres can employ different navigational approaches. For instance, a Slideshow may rely on click interactions to advance through a story, while Scrollytelling typically uses vertical scrolling for navigation. While a common goal of a narrative medical visualization is to encourage a particular behavior, e.g., quitting smoking, it is unclear to what extent the choice of genre influences subsequent user behavior. Our study opens a new research direction into choice of narrative genre on user preferences and behavior in data-driven disease stories.},

            Online surveys have the potential to support adaptive questions, where later questions depend on earlier responses. Past work has taken a rule-based approach, uniformly across all respondents. We envision a richer interpretation of adaptive questions, which we call Dynamic Question Ordering (DQO), where question order is personalized. Such an approach could increase engagement, and therefore response rate, as well as imputation quality. We present a DQO framework to improve survey completion and imputation. In the general survey-taking setting, we want to maximize survey completion, and so we focus on ordering questions to engage the respondent and collect hopefully all information, or at least the information that most characterizes the respondent, for accurate imputations. In another scenario, our goal is to provide a personalized prediction. Since it is possible to give reasonable predictions with only a subset of questions, we are not concerned with motivating users to answer all questions. Instead, we want to order questions to get information that reduces prediction uncertainty, while not being too burdensome. We illustrate this framework with two case studies, for the prediction and survey-taking settings. We also discuss DQO for national surveys and consider connections between our statistics-based question-ordering approach and cognitive survey methodology.},

            We discuss an evidence-based approach to guiding real-time design decisions during the course of survey data collection. We call it responsive and adaptive design (RAD), a scientific framework driven by cost-quality tradeoff analysis and optimization that enables the most efficient production of high-quality data. The notion of RAD is not new; nor is it a silver bullet to resolve all the difficulties of complex survey design and challenges. RAD embraces precedents and variants of responsive design and adaptive design that survey designers and researchers have practiced over decades. In this paper, we present the four pillars of RAD: survey process data and auxiliary information, design features and interventions, explicit quality and cost metrics, and a quality-cost optimization tailored to survey strata. We discuss how these building blocks of RAD are addressed by articles published in the 2017 JOS special issue and this special section. It is a tale of the three perspectives filling in each other. We carry over each of these three perspectives to articulate the remaining challenges and opportunities for the advancement of RAD. We recommend several RAD ideas for future research, including survey-assisted population modeling, rigorous optimization strategies, and total survey cost modeling.},

These methods should guarantee fair representation of the participants, as their outcomes may affect the health of the conversation and inform impactful downstream decisions. To that end, we draw on the literature on approval-based committee elections. Our setting is novel in that the approval votes are incomplete since participants will typically not vote on all comments. We prove that this complication renders non-adaptive algorithms impractical in terms of the amount of information they must gather. Therefore, we develop an adaptive algorithm that uses information more efficiently by presenting incoming participants with statements that appear promising based on votes by previous participants. We prove that this method satisfies commonly used notions of fair representation, even when participants only vote on a small fraction of comments. Finally, an empirical evaluation using real data shows that the proposed algorithm provides representative outcomes in practice.},

	abstract = {We explore an augmented democracy system built on off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned to augment data on citizens’ preferences elicited over policies extracted from the government programmes of the two main candidates of Brazil’s 2022 presidential election. We use a train-test cross-validation set-up to estimate the accuracy with which the LLMs predict both: a subject’s individual political choices and the aggregate preferences of the full sample of participants. At the individual level, we find that LLMs predict out of sample preferences more accurately than a ‘bundle rule’, which would assume that citizens always vote for the proposals of the candidate aligned with their self-reported political orientation. At the population level, we show that a probabilistic sample augmented by an LLM provides a more accurate estimate of the aggregate preferences of a population than the non-augmented probabilistic sample alone. Together, these results indicate that policy preference data augmented using LLMs can capture nuances that transcend party lines and represents a promising avenue of research for data augmentation.

	abstract = {We investigate the political bias of a large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, which has become popular for retrieving factual information and generating content. Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and professionpolitics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media. Our findings have important implications for policymakers, media, politics, and academia stakeholders.},

However, rapidly configuring groups and facilitating interactions among strangers can be difficult, especially in co-located settings. We present ProtoTeams, a system that leverages personal mobile devices to support rapid group formation, to facilitate group activities, and to collect data about the potential for future collaboration. We report on a field study where 406 students in eight different project-based classes used ProtoTeams to interact with classmates through multiple rounds of brief discussion activities before selecting teammates for a term project. We found that the system enables groups to form in about one minute, allows for meaningful interactions with a diverse range of peers, and can significantly influence subsequent teammate selection. We discuss design implications and challenges for in-person team dating in classrooms and other contexts.},

Can technology assist with scaling an organized deliberative process? In particular, would those who experience such a process become more deliberative voters? Would their considered judgments from deliberation influence their voting? We draw on a larger than usual experiment with public deliberation and a one-year follow-up in the mid-term U.S. elections to suggest answers to these questions. It has implications for whether spreading an organized deliberative process could, in theory, be used to create more deliberative elections.},

	abstract = {There is growing appreciation for the value of holding enclave dialogue and deliberation among marginalized peoples in their own affinity groups, as one stage in a larger conversation with the broader public or with public officials. These enclaves may be disempowered by enduring political inequalities, or in relation to a particular issue under discussion, or by the act of deliberation itself. Recent research and practice has demonstrated that well-structured dialogue and deliberation in enclaves can increase the inclusion, participation, and influence of members of society who have been excluded from public discourse, while avoiding the dangers of coercion, sectarianism, conformism, error, and illegitimacy. We review normative arguments and empirical evidence for the judicious use of affinity group enclaves to advance equity. We show multiple ways in which enclaves can be incorporated into democratic projects and processes that also include discussion among more representative samples of the public and with government. We offer design principles for affinity group discussion, which are illustrated by a recent series of dialogues on Facing Racism in a Diverse Nation, organized in the U.S. by Everyday Democracy. Finally, we discuss conditions in which enclave deliberation is most likely to be needed to create equity and suggest an agenda for future research.},

This is a novel approach, and makes the assignment phase time complexity O(n3), which is faster than the previous O(k3.5n3.5) time linear programming used in constrained k-means. This enables clustering of bigger datasets of size over 5000 points.},

This chapter describes the common forms of Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) models and the mathematical expressions for MIRT models. It also provides a general conceptual framework for the use of MIRT models. MIRT models are typically models for the relationship between the probability of a response to one item and the location of a person in the coordinate space. The model only contains parameters for the characteristics of one item and the location for one person. The item parameters are assumed to be constant. The probability of correct response to the item changes with the location of the person. The model is not for the sets of items, although a number of items are analyzed at the same time during the estimation of item parameters and tests of fit of the models to item response data. It is always possible to fit a model to the data from one item. The simultaneously fitting of the model to multiple items is a stringent test of the usefulness of the model.}
