\subsection{Renal Pathology Segmentation}
\label{sec:title}
With the rapid advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the standard approach for image segmentation **Badrinarayanan et al., "SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation"**. **Bueno et al., "Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Renal Histopathology Images"** proposed SegNet-VGG 16 to detect glomerular structures through multi-class learning, achieving a high Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). **Lutnick et al., "DeepLab v2: Sembantic Image Segmentation with Deep Residual Learning for Pathological Images"** used DeepLab v2 to detect glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. **Salvi et al., "Multi-Resolution U-Net for Kidney Renal Histopathology Image Segmentation"** designed a network based on a multi-residual U-Net for quantitative analysis of glomeruli and renal tubules. **Bouteldja et al., "A Deep Learning-Based Method for Automatic Multi-Class Segmentation of Renal Pathology in Histopathological Images"** developed a CNN model capable of automatic multi-class segmentation of renal pathology across different mammalian species and experimental disease models. However, most of these methods still face challenges in the fine segmentation of renal vasculature, particularly under limited annotation conditions, including key structures such as inner and outer vessel walls, arteries, and small lesions.

\subsection{Attention Modules}
\label{sec:title}
Unlike natural images, pathological images contain complex cellular structures, dense tissue backgrounds, and significant noise. Attention modules can automatically adjust weights across different scales of feature maps, effectively integrating global and local information, ensuring that the model performs well in segmenting both small lesions and large structures **Oktay et al., "Attention U-Net: Looking at the Right Feature Groups"**. However, modeling the complex spatial relationships and detailed structures in pathological images for segmentation models remains challenging. Several deep learning-based methods have been developed to capture spatial dependencies between pixels in feature maps **Wang et al., "Non-local Neural Networks"**. These studies introduced attention gates and other mechanisms but primarily focused on general features in natural images. In contrast, our method applies a hierarchical soft attention mechanism explicitly designed for pathological contexts, enhancing core vascular feature segmentation by adaptively reducing noise interference.

\subsection{Multi-scale Segmentation}
\label{sec:title}
In renal pathological image segmentation, significant variation in scale among different objects is a key challenge. **Deng et al., "Scale-Aware Dynamic Network for Multi-Scale Image Segmentation"** proposed a scale-aware dynamic network, which employs multiple segmentation networks or multi-head structures to address these diversities. However, such strategies often increase model complexity and lack explicit modeling of spatial relationships, limiting performance. Recent efforts have shown that combining multi-scale skip connections and attention modules can address these issues. For example, **Ronneberger et al., "U-Net++: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Image Segmentation with Nested Skip Connections"** introduced nested skip connections, and **Oktay et al., "Attention U-Net: Looking at the Right Feature Groups"** used attention gates, but these studies did not investigate their combined use. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to integrate full-scale skip connections with hierarchical soft attention gates in a unified framework for renal vasculature segmentation.

In our proposed network, we explicitly designed the architecture with full-scale skip connections, integrating detailed anatomical information and cross-scale contextual semantics. We proposed a full-scale hierarchical learning framework (FH-Seg) that effectively bridges the gap between structural and pathological contexts. Additionally, we implemented a learnable hierarchical soft attention gate that adaptively reduces interference from non-core information, enhancing the focus on critical vascular features.
