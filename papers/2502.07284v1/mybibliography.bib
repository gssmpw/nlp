abstract = {This paper proposes Prism, a secret sharing based approach to compute private set operations (i.e., intersection and union), as well as aggregates over outsourced databases belonging to multiple owners. Prism enables data owners to pre-load the data onto non-colluding servers and exploits the additive and multiplicative properties of secret-shares to compute the above-listed operations in (at most) two rounds of communication between the servers (storing the secret-shares) and the querier, resulting in a very efficient implementation. Also, Prism does not require communication among the servers and supports result verification techniques for each operation to detect malicious adversaries. Experimental results show that Prism scales both in terms of the number of data owners and database sizes, to which prior approaches do not scale.},

In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure computation.",

Unfortunately, a series of works, starting with Naveed et al. (CCS 2015), have shown that when the adversary has a good estimate of the distribution of the data, ORE provides little protection. In this work, we consider the case that the database entries are drawn identically and independently from a distribution of known shape, but for which the mean and variance are not (and thus the attacks of Naveed et al. do not apply). We define a new notion of security for ORE, called parameter-hiding ORE, which maintains the secrecy of these parameters. We give a construction of ORE satisfying our new definition from bilinear maps.",

abstract = {In the last few years, there has been significant interest in developing methods to search over encrypted data. In the case of range queries, a simple solution is to encrypt the contents of the database using an order-preserving encryption (OPE) scheme (i.e., an encryption scheme that supports comparisons over encrypted values). However, Naveed et al. (CCS 2015) recently showed that OPE-encrypted databases are extremely vulnerable to "inference attacks."In this work, we consider a related primitive called order-revealing encryption (ORE), which is a generalization of OPE that allows for stronger security. We begin by constructing a new ORE scheme for small message spaces which achieves the "best-possible" notion of security for ORE. Next, we introduce a "domain extension" technique and apply it to our small-message-space ORE. While our domain-extension technique does incur a loss in security, the resulting ORE scheme we obtain is more secure than all existing (stateless and non-interactive) OPE and ORE schemes which are practical. All of our constructions rely only on symmetric primitives. As part of our analysis, we also give a tight lower bound for OPE and show that no efficient OPE scheme can satisfy best-possible security if the message space contains just three messages. Thus, achieving strong notions of security for even small message spaces requires moving beyond OPE.Finally, we examine the properties of our new ORE scheme and show how to use it to construct an efficient range query protocol that is robust against the inference attacks of Naveed et al. We also give a full implementation of our new ORE scheme, and show that not only is our scheme more secure than existing OPE schemes, it is also faster: encrypting a 32-bit integer requires just 55 microseconds, which is more than 65 times faster than existing OPE schemes.},

abstract="In an order-preserving encryption scheme, the encryption algorithm produces ciphertexts that preserve the order of their plaintexts. Order-preserving encryption schemes have been studied intensely in the last decade, and yet not much is known about the security of these schemes. Very recently, Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) introduced a generalization of order-preserving encryption, called order-revealing encryption, and presented a construction which achieves this notion with best-possible security. Because their construction relies on multilinear maps, it is too impractical for most applications and therefore remains a theoretical result.",

abstract = {Recently, various protocols have been proposed for securely outsourcing database storage to a third party server, ranging from systems with "full-fledged" security based on strong cryptographic primitives such as fully homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM, to more practical implementations based on searchable symmetric encryption or even on deterministic and order-preserving encryption. On the flip side, various attacks have emerged that show that for some of these protocols confidentiality of the data can be compromised, usually given certain auxiliary information. We take a step back and identify a need for a formal understanding of the inherent efficiency/privacy trade-off in outsourced database systems, independent of the details of the system. We propose abstract models that capture secure outsourced storage systems in sufficient generality, and identify two basic sources of leakage, namely access pattern and ommunication volume. We use our models to distinguish certain classes of outsourced database systems that have been proposed, and deduce that all of them exhibit at least one of these leakage sources.We then develop generic reconstruction attacks on any system supporting range queries where either access pattern or communication volume is leaked. These attacks are in a rather weak passive adversarial model, where the untrusted server knows only the underlying query distribution. In particular, to perform our attack the server need not have any prior knowledge about the data, and need not know any of the issued queries nor their results. Yet, the server can reconstruct the secret attribute of every record in the database after about $N^4$ queries, where N is the domain size. We provide a matching lower bound showing that our attacks are essentially optimal. Our reconstruction attacks using communication volume apply even to systems based on homomorphic encryption or oblivious RAM in the natural way.Finally, we provide experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of our attacks on real datasets with a variety of different features. On all these datasets, after the required number of queries our attacks successfully recovered the secret attributes of every record in at most a few seconds.},

abstract = {To protect database confidentiality even in the face of full compromise while supporting standard functionality, recent academic proposals and commercial products rely on a mix of encryption schemes. The recommendation is to apply strong, semantically secure encryption to the "sensitive" columns and protect other columns with property-revealing encryption (PRE) that supports operations such as sorting.We design, implement, and evaluate a new methodology for inferring data stored in such encrypted databases. The cornerstone is the multinomial attack, a new inference technique that is analytically optimal and empirically outperforms prior heuristic attacks against PRE-encrypted data. We also extend the multinomial attack to take advantage of correlations across multiple columns. This recovers PRE-encrypted data with sufficient accuracy to then apply machine learning and record linkage methods to infer columns protected by semantically secure encryption or redaction.We evaluate our methodology on medical, census, and union-membership datasets, showing for the first time how to infer full database records. For PRE-encrypted attributes such as demographics and ZIP codes, our attack outperforms the best prior heuristic by a factor of 16. Unlike any prior technique, we also infer attributes, such as incomes and medical diagnoses, protected by strong encryption. For example, when we infer that a patient in a hospital-discharge dataset has a mental health or substance abuse condition, this prediction is 97\% accurate.},

This makes its performance and functionality very suitable for data outsourcing in cloud computing scenarios, but the security of order-preserving is still debatable. We present a scheme that achieves a strictly stronger notion of security than any other scheme so far. The basic idea is to randomize the ciphertexts to hide the frequency of plaintexts. Still, the client storage size remains small, in our experiments up to 1/15 of the plaintext size. As a result, one can more securely outsource large data sets, since we can also show that our security increases with larger data sets.},

abstract = {The range query on encrypted databases is usually implemented using the order-preserving encryption (OPE) technique which preserves the order of plaintexts. Since the frequency leakage of plaintexts makes OPE vulnerable to frequency-analyzing attacks, some frequency-hiding order-preserving encryption (FH-OPE) schemes are proposed. However, existing FH-OPE schemes require either the large client storage of size O(n) or O(log n) rounds of interactions for each query, where n is the total number of plaintexts. To this end, we propose a FH-OPE scheme that achieves the small client storage without additional client-server interactions. In detail, our scheme achieves O(N) client storage and 1 interaction per query, where N is the number of distinct plaintexts and N ≤ n. Especially, our scheme has a remarkable performance when N ≪ n. Moreover, we design a new coding tree for producing the order-preserving encoding which indicates the order of each ciphertext in the database. The coding strategy of our coding tree ensures that encodings update in the low frequency when inserting new ciphertexts. Experimental results show that the single round interaction and low-frequency encoding updates make our scheme more efficient than previous FH-OPE schemes.},

We present an order-preserving encryption scheme for numeric data that allows any comparison operation to be directly applied on encrypted data. Query results produced are sound (no false hits) and complete (no false drops). Our scheme handles updates gracefully and new values can be added without requiring changes in the encryption of other values. It allows standard databse indexes to be built over encrypted tables and can easily be integrated with existing database systems. The proposed scheme has been designed to be deployed in application environments in which the intruder can get access to the encrypted database, but does not have prior domain information such as the distribution of values and annot encrypt or decrypt arbitrary values of his choice. The encryption is robust against estimation of the true value in such environments.},

Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack IND-CPA is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions PRFs and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look "as-random-as-possible" subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.},

abstract = {Searchable encryption (SE) allows a client to outsource a dataset to an untrusted server while enabling the server to answer keyword queries in a private manner. SE can be used as a building block to support more expressive private queries such as range/point and boolean queries, while providing formal security guarantees. To scale SE to big data using external memory, new schemes with small locality have been proposed, where locality is defined as the number of non-continuous reads that the server makes for each query. Previous space-efficient SE schemes achieve optimal locality by increasing the read efficiency-the number of additional memory locations (false positives) that the server reads per result item. This can hurt practical performance.In this work, we design, formally prove secure, and evaluate the first SE scheme with tunable locality and linear space. Our first scheme has optimal locality and outperforms existing approaches (that have a slightly different leakage profile) by up to 2.5 orders of magnitude in terms of read efficiency, for all practical database sizes. Another version of our construction with the same leakage as previous works can be tuned to have bounded locality, optimal read efficiency and up to 60x more efficient end-to-end search time. We demonstrate that our schemes work fast in in-memory as well, leading to search time savings of up to 1 order of magnitude when compared to the most practical in-memory SE schemes. Finally, our construction can be tuned to achieve trade-offs between space, read efficiency, locality, parallelism and communication overhead.},

abstract = {Blockchains and more general distributed ledgers are becoming increasingly popular as efficient, reliable, and persistent records of data and transactions. Unfortunately, they ensure reliability and correctness by making all data public, raising confidentiality concerns that eliminate many potential uses.In this paper we present Solidus, a protocol for confidential transactions on public blockchains, such as those required for asset transfers with on-chain settlement. Solidus operates in a framework based on real-world financial institutions: a modest number of banks each maintain a large number of user accounts. Within this framework, Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing. To achieve strong confidentiality of this kind, we introduce the concept of a Publicly-Verifiable Oblivious RAM Machine (PVORM). We present a set of formal security definitions for both PVORM and Solidus and show that our constructions are secure. Finally, we implement Solidus and present a set of benchmarks indicating that the system is efficient in practice.},

abstract = {We introduce MatRiCT, an efficient RingCT protocol for blockchain confidential transactions, whose security is based on "post-quantum'' (module) lattice assumptions. The proof length of the protocol is around two orders of magnitude shorter than the existing post-quantum proposal, and scales efficiently to large anonymity sets, unlike the existing proposal. Further, we provide the first full implementation of a post-quantum RingCT, demonstrating the practicality of our scheme. In particular, a typical transaction can be generated in a fraction of a second and verified in about 23 ms on a standard PC. Moreover, we show how our scheme can be extended to provide auditability, where a user can select a particular authority from a set of authorities to reveal her identity. The user also has the ability to select no auditing and all these auditing options may co-exist in the same environment. The key ingredients, introduced in this work, of MatRiCT are 1) the shortest to date scalable ring signature from standard lattice assumptions with no Gaussian sampling required, 2) a novel balance zero-knowledge proof and 3) a novel extractable commitment scheme from (module) lattices. We believe these ingredients to be of independent interest for other privacy-preserving applications such as secure e-voting. Despite allowing 64-bit precision for transaction amounts, our new balance proof, and thus our protocol, does not require a range proof on a wide range (such as 32- or 64-bit ranges), which has been a major obstacle against efficient lattice-based solutions. Further, we provide new formal definitions for RingCT-like protocols, where the real-world blockchain setting is captured more closely. The definitions are applicable in a generic setting, and thus are believed to contribute to the development of future confidential transaction protocols in general (not only in the lattice setting).},

abstract = {Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchanges. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate new large-scale production blockchains.},

In this work, we identify functional and non-functional requirements for a generic IoT data provenance framework, and conceptualise the framework as a layered architecture. Using a proof-of-concept implementation based on Ethereum smart contracts, data provenance can be realised for a wide range of IoT use cases. Benefits of a generic framework include simplified adoption and a more rapid implementation of data provenance for the IoT.},

abstract = {Summary An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of determining provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods (e.g., tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods) has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, interorganizational, often internationally spanning supply chains. Recent adoptions of the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies give promise at better supply-chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain, as many favored use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies, as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.},

abstract = {We present ReproZip, the recommended packaging tool for the SIGMOD Reproducibility Review. ReproZip was designed to simplify the process of making an existing computational experiment reproducible across platforms, even when the experiment was put together without reproducibility in mind. The tool creates a self-contained package for an experiment by automatically tracking and identifying all its required dependencies. The researcher can share the package with others, who can then use ReproZip to unpack the experiment, reproduce the findings on their favorite operating system, as well as modify the original experiment for reuse in new research, all with little effort. The demo will consist of examples of non-trivial experiments, showing how these can be packed in a Linux machine and reproduced on different machines and operating systems. Demo visitors will also be able to pack and reproduce their own experiments.},

abstract = {Network provenance, which records the execution history of network events as meta-data, is becoming increasingly important for network accountability and failure diagnosis. For example, network provenance may be used to trace the path that a message traversed in a network, or to reveal how a particular routing entry was derived and the parties involved in its derivation. A challenge when storing the provenance of a live network is that the large number of the arriving messages may incur substantial storage overhead. In this paper, we explore techniques to dynamically compress distributed provenance stored at scale. Logically, the compression is achieved by grouping equivalent provenance trees and maintaining only one concrete copy for each equivalence class. To efficiently identify equivalent provenance, we (1) introduce distributed event-based linear programs (DELP) to specify distributed network applications, and (2) statically analyze DELPs to allow for quick detection of provenance equivalence at runtime. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach leads to significant storage reduction and query latency improvement over alternative approaches.},

abstract="We generalize the cryptographic notion of Order Revealing Encryption (ORE) to arbitrary functions and we present a construction that allows to determine the (partial) ordering of two vectors i.e., given {\$}{\$}E({\backslash}varvec{\{}x{\}}){\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}E({\backslash}varvec{\{}y{\}}){\$}{\$}it is possible to learn whether {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varvec{\{}x{\}}={\backslash}varvec{\{}y{\}}{\$}{\$}, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varvec{\{}x{\}}>{\backslash}varvec{\{}y{\}}{\$}{\$}, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varvec{\{}x{\}}<{\backslash}varvec{\{}y{\}}{\$}{\$}or whether {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varvec{\{}x{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varvec{\{}y{\}}{\$}{\$}are incomparable. This is the first non-trivial example of a Revealing Encryption (RE) scheme with output larger than one bit, and which does not rely on cryptographic obfuscation or multilinear maps.",
