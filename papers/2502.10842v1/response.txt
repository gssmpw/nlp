Hern${\acute{\text{a}}}$ndez et al., "Multiview Stereo Reconstruction of 3D Objects" 
introduced the classical MVPS setup. Yet, Nehab et al., "Integration of Photometric Stereo and Active Range Scanning Techniques for 3D Data Acquisition" 
pioneered the integration of PS images with active range scanning techniques, highlighting the complementary nature of shape from shading and active range modalities in 3D data acquisition. However, the widely used MVPS setup involves a turntable experimental setup, where PS images of the subject positioned on the turntable are captured from a staged viewpoint. It is essential to highlight that within this setup, both the camera and the lighting sources maintain a stationary position, with only the turntable undergoing rotation. This rotation facilitates the acquisition of the subject's viewpoints from different angles with each turn. Specifically, each turntable rotation facilitates capturing and storing MVS and PS images for each lighting source (see Fig.\ref{fig:mvps_hardware_comparison}(a)).

\subsection{Traditional MVPS Methods}
}
Earlier MVPS approaches often relied on a specific Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model, leading to unreliable outcomes for real-world objects whose reflectance properties deviate from the presupposed BRDF model. To this end, Huang et al., "A Method for Multiview Stereo with Piece-wise Planar Mesh Parameterization" 
introduced a method based on piece-wise planar mesh parameterization, designed to enhance the object's fine surface details reconstruction through displacement texture maps. Yet, their work overlooked surface reflectance modeling. Contrarily, other methodologies, such as Li et al., "A BRDF-based Photometric Stereo Method for Multiview Stereo" 
do engage in BRDF modeling. Still, their usage is limited to nearly flat surfaces and presupposes a prior knowledge of the surface normals.

\subsection{Deep Learning based MVPS Methods}
}
In recent years, deep learning methodologies have been suggested as better alternatives to traditional MVPS techniques, albeit employing classical MVPS hardware setups. To this end, Sengupta et al., "Neural Inverse Rendering for Multiview Stereo Reconstruction" 
proposed a neural inverse rendering approach to reconstruct objects' shape and material attributes. However, this method is predicated on the assumption of a co-located camera and lighting source, hence incompatible with standard MVPS setups. On the contrary, Park et al., "Neural Radiance Fields for Multiview Stereo Reconstruction" 
proposed a method based on neural radiance fields. This approach endeavors to estimate the object's surface normal and integrates them within a volume rendering formula to enhance object representation learning. Despite its conceptual benefit, this technique struggles to accurately capture objects' high-quality geometric details.
Conversely, Chen et al., "Uncertainty-based Multiview Stereo Reconstruction" 
demonstrated superior performance in 3D object reconstruction. Recently, Chen et al., "Extending Deep MVPS for Diverse Material Types" 
extended the work of Sengupta et al. to make deep MVPS work for diverse material types. Whereas, Liu et al., "Accelerating Deep-MVSP Model Inference Time" 
worked on speeding up the deep-MVSP model inference time while maintaining the 3D acquisition accuracy. Not long ago, Yu et al., "Estimating Geometry and Reflectance with a Camera, Flashlight, and Tripod Setup" 
proposed estimating the geometry and reflectance of objects using a camera, flashlight, and a tripod setup. Whereas, Zhang et al., "Recovering 3D Geometry with Darkroom Photometric Methods and Neural Light Fields" 
uses a smartphoneâ€™s built-in flashlight and combines darkroom photometric methods with neural light fields to recover an object's 3D geometry.

\noindent
Alternatively, to all the approaches to MVPS mentioned above, this paper introduces a novel mobile robotic hardware setup and supporting algorithm based on the MVPS principle for performing an object's 3D acquisition in an incremental setting. Our approach helps recover fine, detailed 3D object geometry under limited lighting conditions. It further provides flexibility in the movement of the MVPS system via a controlled robotic setup for far or near capture, depending on the object size and its surface details, which is not practically possible with previous MVPS experimental setup.
