% \subsection{Other DNN Accelerators on FPGAs}

% FlexCNN ____ is another framework specific for CNN model accelerator generation on FPGA. FET-OPU ____ is an FPGA-based overlay for transformer models, which employs an instruction control unit to dispatch executions of a systolic array and a special function unit. The design is only synthesized. DFX ____ is another overlay design for single and multi-FPGA LLM applications. FlightLLM ____ is a vector processor implemented on U280 for Llama model inference. DNNExplorer ____ is a hybrid accelerator that applies dataflow designs for the first few layers and executes the rest of the layers on a generic overlay. CHARM ____ is a framework to generate heterogeneous accelerator on Versal ACAP platform.

% \subsection{Reconfigurable Accelerators}

% Fully pipelined composable architecture (FPCA) ____ allows deploying and reconfiguring for multiple DNN tasks and pipelines the computations to increase resource utilization. Overgen ____ is an overlay generator on FPGA for domain-specific applications. The compute engine is implemented in CGRA. Due to design complexity for generalizability, these accelerators have low clock frequency and low single-task resource efficiency. ____ deploys a reconfigurable systolic array to pipeline part of the attention layer. 

% SET ____ schedules on tiled accelerators using a time-space resource allocation tree. It assumes a very flexible NoC for communication and cannot optimally allocate tasks to every tile at every cycle. FEATHER ____ focuses on intra-task reconfiguration for reduction operations in CNN, which is a local optimization.
