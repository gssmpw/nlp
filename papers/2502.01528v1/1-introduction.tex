% Paragraph 1 - Nearest neighbor search intro
Nearest neighbor search (\textbf{NNS}) is a fundamental task in a wide range of domains including database systems, information retrieval and recommendation systems.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new use cases such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) which have attracted significant attention. 
NNS involves searching a database of $d$-dimensional vectors to find the nearest vectors to a query, with proximity measured by distance functions (e.g., Euclidean, cosine). 
This becomes computationally challenging as dimensionality and dataset size increase. 
High-dimensional similarity search has been studied using various methods, with quantization and proximity graphs being the dominant approaches in practice. 
While early methods focused on exact search \cite{Weber1998VA, Ferhatosmanoglu2000VAPlus}, 
%often relying on scan-based techniques which evaluate each vector as a candidate. However, 
recent methods prioritize approximate nearest neighbor search (\textbf{ANNS}) \cite{Niu2023ResidualVectorProductQuantization, Gao2024RabitQ, Malkov2020HNSW, Jaiswal2022OODDiskANN, Xu2020, Zhao2022, Gao2023DCOs}, %accepting a trade-off between accuracy and runtime,
trading accuracy for performance to handle large high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently.

Recent work extends ANNS to support attribute filtering (AF), where the vector similarity is constrained with filters on additional attributes (e.g., price, reviews) \cite{Gupta2023CAPS, Patel2024ACORN}. 
While hybrid ANNS is gaining attention, scalable solutions which efficiently handle complex filters are still lacking.  
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SQUASH}, a serverless and distributed hybrid vector ANNS system designed as an elastic Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) architecture. SQUASH supports advanced filtering on both continuous and categorical attributes of any cardinality, including complex logical conditions. 

Serverless has been identified as offering a low-cost and performant hosting option for several data-intensive workloads \cite{Muller2020Lambada, Wang2024Starling, Oakley2024FSDInference, Su2024Vexless, Jarachanthan2021AMPS, Oakley2024ForesightPlus, Gillis2021}.
While serverless settings promise cost-effectiveness and elasticity without the overhead of provisioning servers, designing a scalable solution for serverless hybrid vector search involves overcoming significant obstacles. 
These include algorithmic challenges in developing resource-efficient distributed vector indexing for filtered ANNS, as well as systems issues such as memory constraints, cold starts and the runtime limits of FaaS instances. 
Addressing these challenges in a distributed setting is particularly difficult, as we discuss in the paper.

SQUASH is the first serverless and distributed vector search system with native support for hybrid ANNS. 
As part of the indexing approach, we introduce Optimized Scalar Quantization (OSQ), a lightweight and non-uniform quantization method which minimizes FaaS instance load, maximizes parallelism and achieves high compression on vectors, without relying on auxiliary search structures like proximity graphs. 
Our distributed ANNS algorithm retrieves enough vectors to satisfy query predicates in a single parallel pass with minimal communication overhead.
The proposed design enhances both parallelization and compression, which are critical for FaaS environments where high memory usage and limited parallelism hinder scalability.  
In contrast, a graph-based approach would consume substantial memory as well as requiring the partitioning and management of graph structures across instances, increasing overhead and complicating parallelization.  

SQUASH is designed for both vector and attribute data, utilizing dimension-by-dimension quantization to enable effective filtering and parallelism, along with shared segment-based packing of multiple dimensions for improved compression. 
Most existing SQ mechanisms, such as those applied in FAISS \cite{Johnson2021GPUSearch, douze2024faisslibraryivfsq8} and Milvus \cite{Wang2021Milvus}, treat SQ solely as a basic data compressor for individual vector dimensions (e.g., converting 4-byte floats to 1-byte integers). 
In contrast, the proposed non-uniform OSQ approach integrates hybrid search with filtered partition selection, using bitwise operations and accelerated SIMD lookups to prune large portions of vectors early, reducing I/O and avoiding costly distance calculations. 
Unlike prior filtered ANNS approaches, which support basic hybrid search functionality (e.g., single attributes, restricted operators, or low-cardinality tags), we cater for rich filtering for both real-valued and categorical attributes, handling both equality and range queries across multiple attributes with varying selectivity. 

SQUASH achieves fully serverless hybrid search by introducing a number of systems optimizations.
To scale rapidly to thousands of concurrent FaaS instances, a tree-based method is introduced for large-scale invocation with efficient bidirectional data flow via request/response payloads. 
SQUASH identifies retention of relevant data in re-used runtime containers which avoids redundant I/O. Finally, we present a cost model for serverless distributed vector search to inform storage/communication designs and memory/parallelism levels for scalable serverless data-intensive solutions. 
Experiments comparing SQUASH with state-of-the-art serverless vector search solutions and server-based baselines confirm significant performance improvements at a lower cost.
