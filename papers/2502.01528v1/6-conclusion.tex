\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:6-squash-conclusion}

In this paper, we present SQUASH, the first fully serverless high-dimensional hybrid vector search solution. We introduce OSQ, a highly parallelizable quantization-based approach for both vectors and attributes. 
OSQ combines the vector approximations of multiple dimensions into shared segments, significantly increasing compression.
SQUASH leverages a multi-stage search pipeline, including attribute filtering, partition ranking and selection, effective pruning via low-bit OSQ, a minimal set of distance calculations and an optional post-refinement step. 
This workflow is designed to minimize the load on compact FaaS instances. 
SQUASH introduces several novel elements for fully serverless vector search, including a hierarchical tree-based invocation scheme which enables the rapid launch of thousands of concurrent instances. 
SQUASH also introduces data retention exploitation (DRE) in serverless systems, which eliminates redundant I/O, reduces costs and significantly improves performance. Detailed experiments on several large vector data benchmarks confirm that SQUASH achieves significant scalability and cost-effectiveness, with up to 18x higher throughput and 9x cost savings compared to state-of-the-art serverless vector search offerings.
