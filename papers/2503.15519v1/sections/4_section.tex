\section{Results}
Having previous experience with a problem gives an advantage when implementing, so six new problems were chosen. USACO's 2023 December Gold Contest and 2024 January Gold Contest were chosen, to try to normalize difficulty where possible.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
        \hline
         & \textbf{Solo (December)} & \textbf{AI assisted (January)} \\  % Header row
        \hline
        Problem 1 & 23  & 45  \\
        \hline
        Problem 2 & 66  & 21  \\
        \hline
        Problem 3 & 32  & 26  \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example Table}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

This is an average of a 24\% decrease in implementation time. Note that thinking time, in which the human comes up with an algorithm, is not included, since this merely measures the usefulness of AI in implementing such code. 

Longer solutions clearly correlated with longer implementation times. Comparing between the two contests' model solutions, we see similar lengths in solutions, if not shorter for 2023 December.
