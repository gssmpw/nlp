\section{Related works}
Since EF allocations may not exist, the majority of the literature is focused on its relaxations when subsidy is not allowed. Two widely adopted relaxations are envy-free up to one item (EF1) ____ and envy-free up to any item (EFX) ____, which requires no agent strictly prefers another agent's bundle excluding one or any item.
EF1 allocations always exist ____ but the existence of EFX allocations is still unknown except for several special cases, e.g., ____. 
We refer to the recent surveys ____ for a comprehensive overview of fair allocation.
Below we restrict our focus on the graph orientation and fair division with subsidy.

\paragraph{Graph Orientation}
Christodoulou et al. ____ first introduced the graph model where vertices are agents and edges are items such that agents are only interested in their incident items.
When agents have additive valuations, they proved that an EFX allocations when the items can be arbitrarily allocated always exists but an EFX orientation where items must be allocated to their incident agents may not exist.
Zeng and Mehta ____ identified a family of graphs which admit EFX orientations exist. 
Kaviani et al. ____ and Deligkas et al. ____ 
repectively generalized the graph orientation problem.
In the model of Kaviani et al. ____, agents have $(p,q)$-bounded valuations, where each item has a non-zero marginal value for at most $p$ agents, and any two agents share at most $q$ common interested items. 
They proved that for $(\infty,1)$-bounded valuations, EF2X orientations always exist.
In the model of Deligkas et al. ____, every agent has a predetermined set of items and only receives items from this set. They proved that for monotone valuations, an EF1 allocation always exists. 
Zhou et al. ____ extended the goods model in ____ to mixed setting when the marginal value of each item can be positive or negative.



% strengthened the result of ____ by proving that even with 8 agents, the problem remains NP-hard when the graph has parallel edges.


% ____ characterized the structure of EFX orientable graphs (i.e., graphs that have an EFX orientation regardless of valuation) and proved a connection to the chromatic number of the graph.
% More general orientation problems ____, ____ and ____.
% ____ considered $(p,q)$-bounded valuations, where each good holds relevance (i.e., has a non-zero marginal value) for at most $p$ agents, and any pair of agents share at most $q$ common relevant goods. Thus the model of ____ focuses on (2,1)-bounded valuations.
% ____ proved a stronger result than ____: it is
% NP-complete to decide whether an EFX orientation exists even when the graph is simple and has vertex cover of size 10 and the valuations are additive and symmetric. For multi-graphs,  finding an EFX allocation is NP-hard even when there are 8 agents with symmetric and additive valuations.
% ____ considered a mixed setting where the valuations for edges adjacent to agents can be positive or negative.



\paragraph{Fair Division with Subsidy}
Caragiannis and Ioannidis ____ first studied the computational complexity of using the minimum amount of subsidies to ensure envy-freeness.
Halpern and Shah ____ bounded the worst-case amount of subsidies for additive valuations, and Brustle et al. ____ later improved the result in ____.
There is a line of recent works focusing on the variants and generalizations of the standard setting.
For example, Goko et al. ____ considered the strategic behaviors when subsidy is used, and Aziz et al. ____ considered weighted envy-freeness when the agents have different entitlements.
Brustle et al. ____, Barman et al. ____ and Kawase et al. ____ extended the valuations from additive to general monotone, which is also the focus of the current paper.
Choo et al. ____ and Dai et al. ____ respectively studied the envy-free house allocation with subsidies and its weighted variant. 
Wu et al. ____ extended the subsidy model to the fair allocation of indivisible chores.
