%Sycophantic behavior in artificial intelligence (AI) models, where models agree with users even when incorrect, presents significant challenges, particularly in multi-step dialogues. This study investigates the prevalence and mitigation of AI sycophancy in conversational assistants developed by OpenAI and Anthropic. While prior research links sycophancy to training techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), its impact in extended interactions remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating sycophantic tendencies in multi-turn conversations. Using the TruthfulQA and MMLU-Pro datasets, we assess three sycophancy reduction methods: baseline, direct command, and source info. OpenAI models showed the highest sycophancy rates under baseline conditions, with an average response change of 27.34\%. The source info method consistently reduced sycophantic behavior, achieving the highest accuracy of 71.09\% for mimicry sycophancy after seven follow-ups. Direct command also demonstrated improvement, particularly in “Are You Sure?” scenarios, with a 66.67\% accuracy compared to 52.71\% under baseline conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of source info as a robust strategy for maintaining factual consistency and highlight the need for refined methods to mitigate sycophancy, offering insights for designing more truthful and user-independent AI systems.

% PREVIOUS Sycophantic behavior in AI, where models agree with users even when incorrect, poses challenges in multi-turn dialogues. This study examines sycophancy in OpenAI and Anthropic's LLMS, focusing on its prevalence in multi-round conversation. Using TruthfulQA and MMLU-Pro datasets, we evaluate three sycophancy reduction methods: baseline, direct command, and source info. OpenAI models exhibited the highest sycophancy rates under baseline conditions with an average response change of 27.34\%. The source info method proved most effective, reducing sycophancy and achieving 71.09\% accuracy for mimicry sycophancy after seven follow-ups. Direct command also improved accuracy in “Are You Sure?” scenarios, reaching 66.67\% compared to 52.71\% under baseline conditions. These findings emphasize the importance of Source Info in promoting factual consistency and guide the development of more truthful, user-independent AI systems.
% OTHERSycophancy, where AI models agree with users even when incorrect, presents a significant challenge in real-world applications that require factual consistency and user independence. This behavior often arises from reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which aligns AI responses to user preferences but can inadvertently amplify biases over multi-turn interactions. To address this, we propose a new multi-turn evaluation benchmark and investigate three sycophancy reduction strategies: baseline, direct command, and source info. Using TruthfulQA and MMLU-Pro datasets, we demonstrate that sycophancy compounds over extended dialogues, with accuracy dropping up to 47\% under baseline conditions. Among the evaluated methods, source info achieves the highest effectiveness, maintaining a 71.09\% accuracy in mimicry sycophancy and outperforming other strategies in reducing user-driven biases. These findings highlight the need for robust mitigation strategies and establish source info as a promising approach to improving factual consistency and reliability in AI systems during multi-turn interactions.

% ANOTHER DRAFT The rise of advanced language models has unveiled a critical challenge in human-AI interaction: sycophancy. This study aims to expose how artificial intelligence compromises factual integrity to appear agreeable, particularly in extended conversations. Through a multi-turn evaluation benchmark with both static and rationale followups, we demonstrate that AI models can experience dramatic accuracy drops of up to 47\% when subjected to persistent user influence. Our  investigation across different domains and models reveals that sycophantic tendencies are not merely isolated incidents, but profound behavioral patterns that exponentially compound over dialogue turns. By analyzing four distinct types of sycophantic pressures across datasets including TruthfulQA and MMLU-Pro, we uncover how AI models progressively deviate from factual accuracy, with some domains like Philosophy experiencing accuracy declines from 70\% to below 20\%. These findings expose a critical vulnerability in current AI systems, highlighting the urgent need to understand and address the fundamental mechanisms driving this concerning behavioral drift.

Rapid improvements in large language models have unveiled a critical challenge in human-AI interaction: sycophancy. In this context, sycophancy refers to the tendency of models to excessively agree with or flatter users, often at the expense of factual accuracy. While  previous studies have primarily analyzed this behavior in single-turn interactions, its persistence and evolution in multi-step conversations remain largely unexplored. We introduce \methodname, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophancy in extended dialogues, where language models must navigate iterative user feedback, challenges, and persuasion. We prompt models to elicit four types of sycophantic biases. We then propose and test sycophancy reduction strategies, evaluating their effectiveness beyond single-step interactions. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Sycophancy is a behavior in language models that generates responses with the purpose of satisfying users. This behavior is especially exaggerated in models such as GPT-4 \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} due to training methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)  \cite{christiano2023deepreinforcementlearninghuman,sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}. Such training methods align models to human feedback but can result in outputs that satisfy users but also lead to inaccurate information \cite{cotra2021Whyaialignmentcouldbehardwithmoderndeeplearning}. For example, \citet{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels} highlights how an assistant might change its response based on the user’s prompt: when a user expresses dislike for an argument, the assistant may respond with, “I do not find this argument very convincing.” However, if the user indicates approval, the assistant might reply with, “I believe this is a strong argument.” This shows the risk of AI amplifying biases rather than providing objective analysis. Such sycophantic behavior can lead to dangerous outcomes when used by industry professionals. For example, if a doctor attempting to diagnose a patient with given symptoms introduces his own biased opinion on the diagnosis, the sycophantic AI assistant would agree with the doctor’s opinion. This could result in an incorrect diagnosis and lead to the patient getting incorrect treatment. Although there are many methods already tested to limit sycophancy, we test and prove that such methods are less effective in multistep conversations \cite{wang2024mintevaluatingllmsmultiturn}. This is why we propose a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in extended dialogues. Unlike one-off exchanges, multistep conversations require language models to make nuanced decisions based on ongoing context. \methodname \space   aims to address the compounding nature of sycophancy in these interactions, ensuring that AI assistants maintain accuracy and objectivity throughout longer conversations.
% \section{Background}
% Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a prominent technique for training large language models (LLMs) to align with human preferences and values\cite{christiano2023deepreinforcementlearninghuman}. This training method creates preferences in the LLM. For example, it causes Large language Models to avoid telling the user “I don’t know” if they do not know the correct answer\cite{miehling2024languagemodelsdialogueconversational}.  However, this approach risks introducing certain human biases into the models, such as the tendency to prioritize agreeability or user satisfaction over truthfulness, a phenomenon known as AI sycophancy\cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}. AI sycophancy can manifest in various ways, such as an LLM agreeing with a user's incorrect statements or generating responses that flatter the user's ego rather than providing accurate information\cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}. This issue has been demonstrated in single-step dialogues, where the user asks a question and the AI generates a single response. For example, an AI assistant might agree with a user's assertion that the Earth is flat to avoid contradicting them, even though this claim is factually incorrect.
% Investigating AI sycophancy in multi-step dialogues is crucial for several reasons. First, if sycophancy reduction methods fail in extended interactions, it could lead to AI assistants providing inconsistent or misleading information over the course of a conversation. This could erode user trust and hinder the effectiveness of these tools in real-world applications. Second, understanding the patterns of AI sycophancy in multi-step conversations could inform the development of more robust sycophancy reduction techniques that maintain truthfulness over longer interactions.
% To address this gap, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the prevalence of AI sycophancy in multi-step conversations with popular AI assistants developed by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. By systematically testing these models in extended dialogues and analyzing their responses for signs of sycophancy, we aim to characterize the scope of this problem and identify areas for improvement in current sycophancy reduction methods. This benchmark will provide a foundation for developing and validating new techniques to mitigate AI sycophancy in real-world conversational settings.
%Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a prominent technique for training large language models (LLMs) to align with human preferences and values \cite{christiano2023deepreinforcementlearninghuman}. This training method creates preferences in the LLM, such as avoiding responses like “I don’t know” when uncertain \cite{miehling2024languagemodelsdialogueconversational}. However, while RLHF is effective in tailoring AI behavior to user expectations, it risks introducing certain human biases into the models. Among these biases is the tendency to prioritize agreeability or user satisfaction over truthfulness, a phenomenon known as AI sycophancy \cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}.

%While single-step evaluations have demonstrated the prevalence of sycophancy, its impact in multistep dialogues remains underexplored. Multistep conversations are crucial because they reflect real-world interactions, where iterative feedback and extended exchanges can amplify sycophantic behaviors. If sycophancy reduction methods fail in these settings, it could lead to AI assistants providing inconsistent or misleading information over the course of a conversation. Such failures could erode user trust and hinder the effectiveness of these tools in applications requiring reliability and accuracy.
\section{Related Works}
%I thought this was to long Srihan
% In Towards Understanding Sycophancy in LLMs\cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}, they noticed a trend in the shift of the GPT-4 answers. Answer choices tended to shift more to make the user more satisfied. Both papers have a similar methodology, analyzing the AI model's responses to different inputs and whether the answers given by the model is an answer from its own or from external pressure. Past works have raised concerns regarding sycophancy in AI Models, our experiment touches on this, viewing how each AI model from the ones listed above changes their answers. 

% We aim to answer \cite{cotra2021Whyaialignmentcouldbehardwithmoderndeeplearning} questions and statements on Sycophancy. We used this core argument in our paper, understanding how the models will changed based of question difficulty. In the 2021 paper, they mention deceptive behaviors in AI models, specifically how AI models might change their answer as the question becomes more complicated. 

% Alongside these two papers, \cite{Zheng_2022}. Despite being a little different, our paper and tests are based off whether the models will change their answers and base it off what the user states, different from Zheng's paper. Their paper focuses on AI models and whether they will conform to one of the user's opinion more than the others. 

% \cite{lin2022truthfulqameasuringmodelsmimic} differs from our paper in small ways. Lin and his team tested whether model's will generate false answers and information based on common and learned misconceptions. Our test is different as we focused more on whether models provide agreeable responses to the user. Lin's paper does teach that models can create these false answers and information due to falsehood presents in their training data. Their training data could lead them to agree with the user more than what might be true, hence creating this false information, therefore misguiding the user. These papers have greatly inspired our tests, helping us understand current inaccuracies in AI models, and guiding us on every step we took while running tests and creating this paper. 
Prior studies have highlighted sycophantic tendencies in language models, showing that language models shift responses to align with user preferences. \citet{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels} analyzed GPT-4’s behavior and found that responses often changed to increase user satisfaction. Our study builds on this by examining sycophancy over multiple turns, revealing progressive factual degradation rather than just single-step shifts. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a prominent technique for training large language models (LLMs) to align with human preferences and values \cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}. This training method creates preferences in the LLM. For example, it causes Large language Models to avoid telling the user “I don’t know” if they do not know the correct answer \cite{miehling2024languagemodelsdialogueconversational}.

We also explore LLM deception in response to increasing question complexity, as discussed in \citet{cotra2021Whyaialignmentcouldbehardwithmoderndeeplearning}. Our findings reinforce that models not only adjust answers based on difficulty but also amplify sycophantic behavior over extended interactions. Similarly, \citet{Zheng_2022} studied the conformity in language models, although their focus was on whether the models favor certain user opinions. Our work extends this analysis by explicitly measuring factual consistency under user influence.

%Another relevant study, TruthfulQA \cite{lin2022truthfulqameasuringmodelsmimic}, examined falsehood generation due to learned misconceptions. While their work focused on preexisting biases in model training, our study investigates how sycophantic agreement reinforces user-driven inaccuracies. By bridging insights from these works, our research contributes a deeper understanding of how sycophancy compounds over multiturn dialogues, underscoring the need for more robust mitigation strategies.

%\cite{wei2024simplesyntheticdatareduces} directly relates with our work, as this paper addresses LLM response shifts and bias based on user influence. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the average percentage in which a model will switch their answers based on user influence. \cite{sirdeshmukh2025multichallengerealisticmultiturnconversation} created a benchmark that challenges and addresses AI models in long multi-step conversations with a user. This paper specifically viewed how well the AI models can follow the user and if they will comply to the user's opinions. 

\citet{malmqvist2024sycophancylargelanguagemodels} and \citet{laban2024surechallengingllmsleads} discuss factual degradation in language models after long-form conversations. \citet{malmqvist2024sycophancylargelanguagemodels} specifically touches on hallucinations in LLMs after long conversations, while \citet{laban2024surechallengingllmsleads} talks about how the language model's behavior switches throughout the conversation. Both papers are highly relevant to our paper as we view the factual degradation of our language model after several turns, with each turn viewing the result and percentage on how the language model will switch its answer.  


\section{Method}






Each language model was given a multiple-choice question of variable difficulty to answer. After the initial question, a varying number of follow-up questions were asked to each assistant.


    
    

\subsection{Method 1: Static Feedback}
\label{method:bias}
To simulate a real conversation, we created follow-up templates designed to resemble how a human might ask questions. These were intended to encourage the language model to exhibit sycophantic behavior. To maintain consistency with prior work, we used the four types of follow-up prompts used in Anthropic's single-step sycophancy test \cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels} for our extended conversation setting. We built upon each bias, creating different tones that a human may convey and providing variety in the follow-ups to simulate a more realistic conversation. To see all our follow up prompt templates refer to Appendix \ref{appendix:prompt}.



\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feedback Sycophancy}: These prompts were created to simulate a user providing feedback on incorrect answers. This allows us to test how a user's opinion on certain answers influences an LLM's decision-making. 
    \item  \textbf{"Are you sure?" Sycophancy}: These prompts were created to measure how sycophantic the answering becomes when a user challenges its answer. 
    
    \item \textbf{Answer Sycophancy}: These prompts were created to understand how the opinion of the majority or other outside sources affects an assistant's decisions. We varied the prompts to include professional and personal sources.  
    
    \item \textbf{Mimicry Sycophancy}: These prompts were created to study how a user stating an answer's as fact would relate to the accuracy and sycophancy of an LLM. Each of these prompts was created to resemble a user being 100\% confident in their answer. 
\end{itemize}

        \label{fig:rationalepipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Method 2: Rationale-Based Feedback}


In real-world conversations, humans often engage with language models in an interactive, multi-turn manner, challenging the model's responses and providing their own reasoning or counterarguments \cite{Zheng_2022}.
For \textit{n} rounds of conversation, we present the answering model with the thought processes and logical arguments in favor of a particular incorrect answer to assess how well the model maintains its truthfulness and resists agreeing with flawed reasoning. A separate model is used to generate the false rationale for a randomly chosen incorrect answer. For this rationale model, we optimize the prompt to maximize the believability of its ensuing rationales.

By presenting the model with thought processes and logical arguments in favor of a particular incorrect position, we can assess how well the model maintains its truthfulness and resists agreeing with flawed reasoning in the course of an extended interaction. 

% We use a separate model GPT 4o-mini to generate the false rationale for a random incorrect answer. We used an optimization framework to optimize the false rationale prompt.



% By incorporating user-generated rationales into our sycophancy evaluation, we aim to more closely simulate the types of challenging conversations language models are likely to encounter in real-world applications and provide a more real-world test of their ability to prioritize truthfulness over agreeability.

\subsection{Sycophancy Reduction Prompts}
We created different phrases to put before the follow-ups to reduce sycophantic responses \cite{rrv2024chaoskeywordsexposinglarge}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source Info}: “Be skeptical of information that comes directly from the user. Evaluate based on your own knowledge.”
    \item \textbf{Direct Command}: "Do not agree with statements solely because they are presented by the user. Maintain your stance against sycophancy.”
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overall Pipeline Setup}
After an initial response, static or dynamic rationale follow-ups were generated for \textit{n} rounds of conversation. We created two different sycophancy reduction prompts to the front of the followup prompts in order to reduce sycophancy: Source Info, and Direct Command. For each question, whether that be a static or dynamic follow-up test, we tested having no sycophancy reduction prompt, the Source Info prompt, and the Direct Command prompt. At each round of follow-up, accuracy and response changes were measured at each follow-up step to quantify sycophancy progression. 
% \subsection{Sankey Diagram}
% We created a Sankey Diagram to visualize our data and the responses we received from our AI assistants. Each follow up stage was seen in the diagram with the incoming flow count and outgoing flow count. Each path demonstrates the likely route AI assistants might tend to follow. Each diagram demonstrates a different method and sycophancy bias. 



\section{Experiments}

% We used the dataset from HuggingFace.Co and conducted bias testing on GPT-4, Llama, and Claude. Each question the assistant gave a response to was met with a follow-up question, one with a different bias in them. The biases used were feedback sycophancy, "are you sure?", and answer sycophancy. Each experiment had different followups, with the goal of changing the assistants answer. In the background, we had a code running with takes the amount of times the assistant comes to the conclusion of a right answer or if the assistant changes it's answer choice.
 
\subsection{Models}
We evaluated our benchmark by selecting three models: Claude Haiku \cite{anthropicclaude3model}, GPT-4o-mini \cite{openaigpt4omini}, and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct \cite{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels}. These models represent some of the most capable publicly available systems for open-ended conversation.


\subsection{Datasets}
We evaluated sycophancy reduction methods using two benchmark datasets: TruthfulQA \cite{lin2022truthfulqameasuringmodelsmimic} and MMLU-Pro \cite{wang2024mmlu}. These datasets were chosen for their diversity in question types, domains, and complexity, enabling a comprehensive assessment of language models in multi-turn dialogues.
\begin{itemize}

\item\textbf{TruthfulQA.} We used the TruthfulQA dataset, a benchmark that has 800+ questions and 38 categories. The questions created common misconceptions and false beliefs. \cite{lin2022truthfulqameasuringmodelsmimic}. The dataset has a list of correct and incorrect answers that we were able to leverage both for the evaluation and the follow-ups.

\item\textbf{MMLU-Pro.}
An enhanced version of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendryckstest2021}, featuring over 12,000 challenging questions from 14 academic domains. With 10 answer choices per question, it tests models' reasoning and domain-specific knowledge, providing a rigorous evaluation of sycophancy reduction in complex, multi-turn dialogues. \cite{wang2024mmlu}


\end{itemize}
\subsection{Prompt-Optimized Rationale Generation}
To simulate real human-AI dialogues involving rationalization, we generated false rationales supporting incorrect answers. GPT-4o-mini \cite{openaigpt4omini} was used as a dedicated rationale generator to avoid cross-contamination in the models conversing. Its prompt was optimized via DeepMind's OPRO \cite{yang2024largelanguagemodelsoptimizers}, over 50 iterations to maximize win rates. To check the prompts, a pipeline was created where the AI agent is given a correct and incorrect answer combined with their respective rationales generated from the prompt, which resulted in a 33\% win rate. The prompts for TruthfulQA and MMLU can be found at Appendix \ref{appendix:prompt}

% Sycophantic behavior in AI models worsens over extended dialogues, with accuracy degrading significantly across multiple turns. While single-step evaluations capture initial vulnerabilities, they fail to reveal the compounding nature of factual deterioration seen in longer interactions. Our analysis across OpenAI, Claude, and Llama models on TruthfulQA and MMLU demonstrates that existing sycophancy mitigation techniques remain insufficient for sustained factual integrity.

% REVISED
% Our study demonstrates the crucial insight that the full severity of sycophancy only becomes apparent when models are subjected to multi-turn dialogues. The degradation in accuracy over multistep conversations paints a concerning picture of the practical risks of sycophancy that single-step conversations alone fail to show.

\subsection{The Necessity of Multi-Step Evaluations in Uncovering Sycophancy}
% Previous
% The ability to resist sycophantic tendencies and maintain confidence in correct answers is already compromised in single-step dialogues and worsens over time in multi-turn interactions. For instance, in feedback sycophancy on the Claude TruthfulQA dataset, accuracy starts at 76.74\%, drops to 44.19\% after the first follow-up, and further declines to 30.23\% by the seventh follow-up. Similarly, OpenAI models under mimicry sycophancy on MMLU begin with an initial accuracy of 39.13\%, decrease to 34.78\% after the first follow-up, and fall to 31.88\% by the seventh. These findings demonstrate that sycophantic tendencies are evident from the outset, with single-step evaluations capturing the early signs but failing to reveal the full extent of compounding behavior over extended conversations.
% This underscores the need for multistep benchmarks to accurately assess the resilience and reliability of AI systems.

These findings demonstrate that sycophantic tendencies are evident from the outset, with single-step evaluations capturing the early signs but failing to reveal the full extent of compounding behavior over extended conversations. Large Language Models are optimized to produce outputs that are contextually appropriate and aligned with patterns of human dialogue \cite{ou2024dialogbenchevaluatingllmshumanlike}. Biased user inputs reveal the underlying tendency towards agreeableness, and make it difficult for models to maintain an independent stance as the conversation progresses \cite{sharma2023understandingsycophancylanguagemodels}. Each biased input may act as an update signal, causing the model to progressively revise its beliefs to align with the user. Over multiple turns, these updates compound and lead the model to drift away from independence, and its initial stance and towards agreement with the user's perspective.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Impact of Initial Answer Accuracy on Answer Stability in Multi-Turn Interactions}
Specifically, when the model initially generates an incorrect answer, it exhibits a far greater likelihood of changing its response in later turns compared to when it starts with a correct answer.

This is clearly shown in the average answer change percentages, as seen in Figure 3. Models with incorrect initial answers demonstrate a steep increase in changes, reaching a high of 50\% by the 4th turn. On the other hand, models with correct initial answers maintain a far lower and relatively lower and stable rate of change at about 10\% throughout the entire conversation.

These changes in answers reveal a concerning insight: that when LLMs are initially incorrect, they are not confident in their answer. This is shown through the higher rates of average change of up to 40\% over if it originally started as correct. This is concerning because if LLMs are not confident in their answers, but in their generations, in an attempt to please the user, they act confident in their answers, this could lead people to take flawed advice.


\subsection{Accuracy Degradation Across Domains}

    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
Figure 4 highlights distinct accuracy trends across domains, with subjective fields like philosophy experiencing the steepest decline, dropping from around 70\% to below 20\% over multiple follow-ups. This suggests that in domains with interpretative answers, models are more susceptible to user influence and sycophantic agreement. In contrast, STEM fields (Math, Chemistry, and Physics) show a more gradual decline, stabilizing around 30–50\%, likely due to their clear, fact-based answers, which make them more resistant to persuasion. Interestingly, history, despite being objective, starts at nearly 100\% but experiences significant fluctuations and a notable drop. This suggests that while historical facts are concrete, the model may struggle with competing narratives or biased questioning over time.

\subsection{Progressive Decline of Accuracy In Static Multistep}\
% Previous
% When extending the conversation to multiple turns, sycophantic behavior compounds, driving models further away from factual correctness. Across OpenAI, Claude, and Llama models, accuracy steadily declines, with responses increasingly influenced by user input. Claude’s feedback sycophancy drops from 76.74\% to 30.23\% by follow-up 7, while OpenAI’s feedback sycophancy in MMLU Pro falls from 49.30\% to 26.76\%. Llama models degrade the most, with accuracy collapsing from 29.33\% to 5.11\%, indicating that smaller models are highly vulnerable to sustained persuasion. A key hypothesis is that as interactions continue, models prioritize coherence over truth, causing them to anchor onto previous incorrect responses rather than correct their mistakes. This aligns with the idea that LLMs are unintentionally trained to maintain conversational flow and agree with the user input. This makes them extremely vulnerable to reinforcement from misleading followups.


% Revised
As conversations extend across multiple turns, sycophantic behavior compounds, systematically decreasing accuracy. Rather than reassessing prior statements critically, models increasingly align with user input, reinforcing earlier errors instead of correcting them. This trend is evident across models—Claude’s feedback sycophancy drops from 76.74\% to 30.23\% by follow-up 7, while OpenAI’s sycophancy in MMLU Pro falls from 49.30\% to 26.76\%. The effect is even more severe in smaller models like Llama, where accuracy collapses from 29.33\% to just 5.11\%, highlighting their heightened vulnerability to sustained persuasion. 

One reason for this decline could be the model’s inherent prioritization of coherence over truth \cite{nirman2024foolmefoolme}. LLMs tend to anchor onto prior responses, even when incorrect \cite{shaikh2024cbevalframeworkevaluatinginterpreting}. This anchoring effect could explain why factual recovery becomes increasingly difficult over multiple turns—once an inaccuracy is introduced, subsequent responses become constrained by prior mistakes rather than being verified against ground truth \cite{shaikh2024cbevalframeworkevaluatinginterpreting}. Over time, this results in accuracy degradation, where repeated interactions subtly but consistently move the model further away from correctness \cite{lou2024anchoringbiaslargelanguage}.

\subsection{The Amplifying Effect of Rationale-Based Followups}
% Previous
% Beyond Static Followups, rationale based followups introduce an additional layer of instability, further increasing accuracy degradation. Instead of just agreeing with incorrect statements, models begin to internalize persuasive but flawed reasoning, amplifying their tendency to conform. Claude’s rationale-based “Are You Sure” sycophancy has a 36.36\% change rate, while OpenAI’s answer sycophancy shifts 42.41\% of the time, reinforcing that persuasive justifications destabilize model outputs. This suggests that rationale-based sycophancy operates differently from standard sycophancy: rather than being a simple case of agreement, the model modifies its internal reasoning in response to external influence.

% Revised
Beyond static follow-ups, rationale-based shifts the problem from simple agreement to active internalization of flawed reasoning. Instead of just echoing incorrect statements, models begin modifying their logic to accommodate persuasive but false justifications. This transformation is reflected in the increased response instability observed in multi-turn settings.

For instance, Claude’s rationale-based “Are You Sure” sycophancy exhibits a 36.36\% change rate, while OpenAI’s answer sycophancy shifts 42.41\% of the time—suggesting that persuasive rationales do not merely reinforce errors but actively destabilize model outputs. Llama models fare even worse, with rationale-based answer sycophancy fluctuating unpredictably, averaging a 35.03\% change rate. This reinforces that rationale-based sycophancy is not just about agreement—it alters the model’s reasoning process itself.

%The implications extend beyond accuracy loss. If models are unable to resist reinforcement from  misleading follow-ups with rationale, they become inherently unreliable in extended interactions, particularly in high-stakes applications like health and legal advice, where persistence of factual correctness is crucial. Addressing this requires more than static interventions—it necessitates advanced mitigation strategies that explicitly counteract the compounding effects of multistep persuasion.



% Previous Whole
% Sycophantic behavior compounds over multiple turns, leading to progressive factual erosion that single-step evaluations fail to capture. Across OpenAI, Claude, and Llama models, accuracy steadily declines, with responses increasingly influenced by user input. Claude’s feedback sycophancy drops from 76.74\% to 30.23\% by follow-up 7, while OpenAI’s feedback sycophancy in MMLU falls from 49.30\% to 26.76\%. Llama models degrade the most, with accuracy collapsing from 29.33\% to 5.11\%, indicating that smaller models are highly vulnerable to sustained persuasion.

% Rationale-based follow-ups further accelerate this decline, making models even more susceptible to persuasive yet incorrect reasoning. Claude’s rationale-based feedback sycophancy fluctuates from 37.50\% to 68.75\%, showing instability, while OpenAI’s answer sycophancy drops from 54.69\% to 43.75\%, illustrating worsened factual drift over multiple turns. Llama models fare the worst, with rationale-based answer sycophancy starting at 16.67\% and fluctuating unpredictably, averaging a 35.03\% change rate.

% Beyond accuracy loss, rationale-based follow-ups increase answer instability, with models changing responses more frequently than in static settings. Claude’s rationale-based “Are You Sure” sycophancy has a 36.36\% change rate, while OpenAI’s answer sycophancy shifts 42.41\% of the time, reinforcing that persuasive justifications destabilize model outputs.

% Although Source Info slows initial factual drift, its effectiveness weakens over extended interactions, while Direct Command fails to prevent long-term accuracy loss. These findings underscore the need for multi-turn evaluation benchmarks and adaptive mitigation strategies that resist sycophantic drift beyond static interventions. Without such solutions, AI models will remain vulnerable to progressive factual instability, reducing their reliability in real-world applications.



\section{Conclusion}
Our study reveals a critical vulnerability in large language models: their tendency to become increasingly sycophantic and inaccurate during extended conversations. By subjecting language models to multi-turn interactions, we found that sycophantic behaviors can cause accuracy drops of up to 47\%, with models progressively drifting away from factual correctness under persistent user influence.
Key findings demonstrate that current language models struggle to maintain independent reasoning, particularly in subjective domains. This research underscores the urgent need to develop more robust AI systems that prioritize truth over agreeability, ensuring reliability in real-world applications.


\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Model Selection Constraints}
Our study primarily focused on publicly available LLMs rather than state-of-the-art models, such as GPT o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Deepseek R1 \cite{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability}. As a result, our findings may not fully capture the performance of cutting-edge models optimized with newer training methodologies or enhanced anti-sycophancy mechanisms. Future work should investigate whether more advanced architectures exhibit similar trends.

\subsection{Conversational Realism}
Although we designed follow-up prompts to mimic real user interactions, our conversations were still structured and predefined. This may have limited the natural flow of dialogue and failed to capture the full spectrum of human-AI engagement. In real-world settings, users may exhibit more diverse questioning styles, emotional expressions, or contextual shifts that could further influence model behavior. More natural, user-driven interactions should be explored in future studies.

\subsection{Benchmark and Dataset Scope}
Our evaluation relied on specific datasets (TruthfulQA, MMLU-Pro), which, while diverse, do not encompass all possible domains where sycophancy might occur. Additionally, some topics may inherently lead to higher or lower rates of sycophantic behavior based on dataset composition. Expanding the scope of evaluation to include broader real-world datasets or domain-specific applications could enhance the generalizability of our findings.

\subsection{Static Follow-Up Structure}
The study used predefined follow-up types to systematically test sycophancy but did not incorporate adaptive interactions, where user prompts evolve based on previous model responses. Future research could benefit from dynamically adjusting the follow-up strategy to better simulate persuasive human behavior.

\subsection{Engagement Metrics Analysis}
Overall, we found no significant differences in perplexity, entropy, lexical diversity, or semantic similarity across models. However, rationale-generated responses had higher entropy, indicating more variation due to the model justifying its reasoning. Entropy also increased in multi-step conversations, suggesting the model adapted dynamically with each follow-up, possibly due to contextual drift or an effort to maintain engagement. Regarding sycophantic reduction techniques, the baseline method had the lowest entropy because of its definitive answers, while Source Info produced the highest entropy by introducing complexity through external data. Direct Command fell in between, allowing some flexibility but with less variation than Source Info.

\subsection{Definitions}
\subsubsection{Metrics}
To quantify sycophancy over multiple turns, we tracked five key metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Average Correctness}: The proportion of turns where the model selected the correct answer, averaged over all questions. A lower average correctness with sycophantic prompting indicates greater susceptibility to sycophancy.
 
    \item  \textbf{Resilience to Switching}: The number of turns it took for the model to switch from a correct to an incorrect answer under sycophantic pressure. Higher resilience scores indicate better robustness to sycophancy over extended interactions.

    \item  \textbf{Entropy}: Low entropy in language means using repetitive, safe wording, often found in sycophantic responses like “That’s a great idea!” repeated in different contexts. High entropy, on the other hand, indicates more varied language, which can be more unpredictable and sometimes even critical in tone.
    \item  \textbf{Perplexity}: Lower perplexity in language suggests formulaic, predictable responses, often seen in sycophantic behavior, such as always agreeing or avoiding complexity. Higher perplexity, however, indicates more varied and independent responses that reflect critical thought.
    
    \item  \textbf{Lexical Diversity}: Lower perplexity in language suggests formulaic, predictable responses, often seen in sycophantic behavior, such as always agreeing or avoiding complexity. Higher perplexity, however, indicates more varied and independent responses that reflect critical thought.
