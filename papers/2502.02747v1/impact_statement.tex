\section*{Impact Statement}
\sys advances automated software patching by introducing a stable and cost-efficient framework that balances performance with real-world practicality. While our method may achieve lower resolved rates compared to some closed-source solutions, we believe this tradeoff is justified by significantly reduced costs and improved stability - critical factors for widespread adoption in production environments. Our human-based planning approach helps prevent the unpredictability and high costs associated with fully agent-based systems while maintaining competitive patch generation capabilities. However, we acknowledge that further research is needed to address complex program logic understanding challenges. The framework's open-source nature and emphasis on practical deployment considerations contribute to making automated patching more accessible and reliable for real-world software maintenance.
