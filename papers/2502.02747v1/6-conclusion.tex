\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \sys, a stable and cost-efficient patching agent driven by a human-based planning workflow.
We design five important components and each element has its own customized designs.
Our experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of \sys and its individual components.
This work points to a few promising directions for future work. 
First, we can explore combining agent-based planning and human-based planning, which potentially can reach a higher resolved rate with reasonable stability and cost-efficiency. 
Second, as discussed in~\cref{appx:case_study}, a number of failure instances are caused by the fact that LLMs tend to give overly simple patches.
It is worth investigating fine-tuning specialized patching models from SOTA general LLMs which can better understand and reason about the issues and give more comprehensive patches.
