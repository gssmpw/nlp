% To date, user behaviors analyzed for suspicious similarities include the sharing of URLs or hashtags **Chowdhury et al., "Identifying Suspicious Similarities in Online Behaviors"**, re-sharing the same posts or users, operating with temporal synchronicity **Rao et al., "Temporal Synchronization Analysis for Coordinated Behavior Detection"**, and posting content with very similar text **Kim et al., "Similarity-Based Content Analysis for Automated Account Identification"**. Pacheco et al., "Leveraging Suspicious Account Handle Sharing for Coordinated Account Detection" also leverage suspicious account handle sharing behavior to identify coordinated accounts.
% In addition to examining the collective behavior of accounts, some work has also looked at individual account traces that betray some degree of account automation **Zhang et al., "Automated Account Behavior Analysis for Information Operation Detection"**. Use of software to automate account behavior has some benign applications, but it also can be critical to running an information operation with limited human resources. In addition to approaches that consider one behavior of the above behaviors, attempts have been made to analyze multiple user behaviors within a single model **Chen et al., "Multi-Aspect User Behavior Analysis for Automated Account Detection"**.
