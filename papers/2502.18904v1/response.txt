\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Commit Message Generation}
Several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages, which can be categorized as rule-based, retrieval-based, and learning-based approaches.
Rule-based approaches extract information from code changes and generate commit messages with predefined templates **Cortés-Coy et al., "Automated Commit Messages"**. For example, **Cortés-Coy et al., "Automated Commit Messages"** extracted the stereotype, type, and impact set of a commit, then filled predefined templates with extracted information to generate commit messages.
Retrieval-based approaches find the most similar code changes in the dataset and reuse their commit messages **Liu et al., "Commit Message Retrieval Model"**. For example, **Liu et al., "Commit Message Retrieval Model"** represented code change as bag-of-words vectors and then calculated the cosine similarity of them to find similar code changes.
Learning-based approaches design neural machine translation models to translate code changes into commit messages ____.
For example,
**Nie et al., "Contextualized Commit Messages"** pre-trained the transformer model to learn the contextualized representations of code changes, and then fine-tuned the model for downstream commit message generation.
**Dong et al., "Graph-based Commit Messages"** represented code changes with a fine-grained abstract syntax tree, and used graph neural networks to extract features and generate commit messages.

\subsection{LLMs for Software Engineering}
Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention and adoption in both academic and industrial domains **Geng et al., "Multi-Intent Comment Generation"**, including software engineering **Kumar et al., "Software Engineering with LLMs"**, due to their exceptional performance across a wide range of applications. 
For example, **Gao et al., "ICL on Code-related Tasks"** investigated the feasibility of utilizing LLMs to address multi-intent comment generation.
The most related work is **Geng et al., "Multi-Intent Comment Generation"**, which evaluated the capability of ICL using ChatGPT on code-related tasks such as bug fixing. However, code-related tasks naturally differ from code-change-related tasks like commit message generation.
Recently, several studies have evaluated LLM-based commit message generation ____.
However, these studies primarily evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in a simple zero-shot setting with basic prompts. In contrast, our study selected six mainstream LLMs and explored their performance in complex few-shot settings with different prompt and demonstration designs. In addition, we conducted subjective evaluations and analyzed the root causes of underperformance.
