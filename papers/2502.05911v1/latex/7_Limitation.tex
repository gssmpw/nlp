\section*{Limitations}
\label{latex/limitation}
While our work has yielded promising results, it is important to recognize several limitations. First, the \M framework currently treats the training process as static, rather than incorporating the dynamic influence of gradient trajectories throughout the RAIT process. Additionally, the \texttt{idk} and \texttt{ik} sets are divided through a straightforward query of the LLMs; future work could explore ways to leverage \M for more nuanced identification of knowledge boundaries within LLMs for splitting. Finally, although \M has demonstrated strong generalizability across various evaluation datasets, expanding the dataset range to include a more diverse set of high-quality resources could enhance the robustness and versatility of the framework.
