abstract = {The potential of quantum computers to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers has driven advances in hardware fabrication. In practice, the main challenge in realizing quantum computers is that general, many-particle quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which inevitably causes errors in quantum algorithms. Some noise sources are inherent to the current materials platforms. de Leon et al. review some of the materials challenges for five platforms for quantum computers and propose directions for their solution. Science, this issue p. eabb2823 Quantum computing hardware technologies have advanced during the past two decades, with the goal of building systems that can solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. The ability to realize large-scale systems depends on major advances in materials science, materials engineering, and new fabrication techniques. We identify key materials challenges that currently limit progress in five quantum computing hardware platforms, propose how to tackle these problems, and discuss some new areas for exploration. Addressing these materials challenges will require scientists and engineers to work together to create new, interdisciplinary approaches beyond the current boundaries of the quantum computing field.}}

abstract = {There are a number of questions in quantum complexity that have been resolved in the time-bounded setting, but remain open in the space-bounded setting. For example, it is not currently known if space-bounded probabilistic computations can be simulated by space-bounded quantum machines without allowing measurements during the computation, while it is known that an analogous statement holds in the time-bounded case. A more general question asks if measurements during a quantum computation can allow for more space-efficient solutions to certain problems.In this paper we show that space-bounded quantum Turing machines can efficiently simulate a limited class of random processes-random walks on undirected graphs-without relying on measurements during the computation. By means of such simulations, it is demonstrated that the undirected graph connectivity problem for regular graphs can be solved by one-sided error quantum Turing machines that run in logspace and require a single measurement at the end of their computations. It follows that symmetric logspace is contained in the quantum analogue of randomized logspace.},

abstract = {We set the ground for a theory of quantum walks on graphs-the generalization of random walks on finite graphs to the quantum world. Such quantum walks do not converge to any stationary distribution, as they are unitary and reversible. However, by suitably relaxing the definition, we can obtain a measure of how fast the quantum walk spreads or how confined the quantum walk stays in a small neighborhood. We give definitions of mixing time, filling time, dispersion time. We show that in all these measures, the quantum walk on the cycle is almost quadratically faster then its classical correspondent. On the other hand, we give a lower bound on the possible speed up by quantum walks for general graphs, showing that quantum walks can be at most polynomially faster than their classical counterparts.},

abstract = "Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field with the potential to change how we solve previously intractable problems. Emerging hardware is approaching a complexity that requires increasingly sophisticated programming and control. Scaffold is an older quantum programming language that was originally designed for resource estimation for far-future, large quantum machines, and ScaffCC is the corresponding LLVM-based compiler. For the first time, we provide a full and complete overview of the language itself, the compiler as well as its pass structure. While previous works Abhari et al (2015 Parallel Comput. 45 2-17), Abhari et al (2012 Scaffold: quantum programming language https://cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/TR-934-12), have piecemeal descriptions of different portions of this toolchain, we provide a more full and complete description in this paper. We also introduce updates to ScaffCC including conditional measurement and multidimensional qubit arrays designed to keep in step with modern quantum assembly languages, as well as an alternate toolchain targeted at maintaining correctness and low resource count for noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) machines, and compatibility with current versions of LLVM and Clang. Our goal is to provide the research community with a functional LLVM framework for quantum program analysis, optimization, and generation of executable code.",

This chapter focuses on the emergence of constraint satisfaction, with constraint languages, as a new paradigm within artificial intelligence and computer science. It discusses that constraint satisfaction, in its basic form, involves finding a value for each one of a set of problem variables where constraints specify that some subsets of values cannot be used together. Constraint satisfaction problems have been tackled by a dizzying array of methods, from automata theory to ant algorithms, and are a topic of interest in many fields of computer science and beyond. It also focuses on the basic methods involved in the establishment of constraint satisfaction as a branch of artificial intelligence. This new branch of artificial intelligence, together with related work on programming languages and systems that laid the groundwork for the flourishing of interest in constraint programming languages. The chapter reviews the progress that has been made in making even more powerful methods available to the constraint programme. It concludes that constraint programming is still “somewhat of an art”. The challenge is to make constraint programming more of an engineering activity and constraint technology more transparently accessible to the nonprogrammer.}
