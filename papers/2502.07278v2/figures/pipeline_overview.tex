\caption{Pipeline Overview: Given a small collection of multi-view videos belonging to the same category our goal is to learn a category specific part motion by finetuning a multi-view image diffusion model. For this, noisy latents of the multi-view videos are denoised using the UNet blocks. Appearance information is injected into the UNet through conditioning, and controllability in part motion is achieved by injecting part masks into the diffusion process. Once finetuned, we can adapt the model for a new mesh and optimize the motion axis parameters with score distillation loss using the guidance of the diffusion model.}
