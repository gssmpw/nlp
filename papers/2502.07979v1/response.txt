\section{Related work}
In traditional pathology, WSI inspection by pathologists remains the gold standard for clinical diagnosis **Rakhra et al., "Automated Cancer Detection in Whole-Slide Images"**. However, the conventional diagnostic process is labor-intensive and time-consuming ____ , with the shortage of experienced pathologists further exacerbating the challenge. DL-based methods **Li et al., "Patch-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Whole Slide Image Classification"** , which employ biologically-inspired neural networks to utilize the rich information contained in WSIs, are advancing computer-aided pathology diagnosis. In this section, we firstly review DL-based digital pathology methods for cancer diagnosis, and then focus on  methods specific to glioma diagnosis, and finally review methods that integrate histology and molecular markers for precision oncology.


\subsection{Digital pathology for cancer diagnosis}


DL-based digital pathology methods are generally  categorized into low (cell)-level modelling and high (tissue)-level modelling. These approaches address downstream tasks such as cell segmentation **Dou et al., "Automated Segmentation of Nuclei in Histopathological Images"** and tissue phenotyping  ____ , respectively. Specifically, cell segmentation models primarily focus on assigning pixel-level labels for cells and nuclei ____ , further used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. For instance, **Houmani et al., "Deep learning-based automatic classification of breast cancer histopathology images using transfer learning from pre-trained networks"** proposed Hover-Net, which performs simultaneous nuclear segmentation and classification by leveraging the distances of nuclear pixels to the mass centre. Similarly, **Coudray et al., "Classification and mutation prediction from nonâ€“small cell lung cancer whole-slide image histopathology"**  developed a DL-based pipeline to generate an embedded map profiling cell composition,  further utilized to extract texture patterns for tumour and immune cells. 
In contrast to cell-level modelling, tissue-level modelling is more efficient in capturing global phenotype features,  providing a more comprehensive understanding of tissue architecture and pathology that is crucial for accurate and effective clinical assessments. Particularly, recent DL-based approaches  have significantly improved computer-aided classification of various diseases ____ , including membranous nephropathy ____ , interstitial lung disease ____ .

DL-based tissue-level modelling has been widely researched in cancer diagnosis, promising to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cancer classification ____ . For instance, **Huang et al., "ScanNet: A fast and dense scanning framework for breast cancer detection"** devised ScanNet, a fast and dense scanning framework utilizing asynchronous sample prefetching and hard negative mining for efficient breast cancer detection. Additionally, **Wang et al., "Feature Aligned Multi-Scale Convolutional Network (FA-MSCN) for Liver Tumor Diagnosis"** proposed FA-MSCN, a feature aligned multi-scale convolutional network, to achieve liver tumour diagnosis. FA-MSCN integrates features from multiple magnifications to improve the performance by referencing more neighboring information. Similarly, **Chen et al., "Deep learning-based lung cancer classification using weakly supervised deep convolutional networks"** designed an end-to-end, high-generalizable, weakly supervised deep convolutional network, which achieved great performance in lung cancer classification. Despite the success in many cancers, DL-based algorithms still face significant challenges in brain tumors, particularly glioma, due to its remarkable heterogeneity, complex diagnostic criteria and limited samples ____.



\subsection{Automatic glioma grading with WSIs}


In recent years, several models **Li et al., "Mutual Contrastive Low-Rank Learning (MCL) for Glioma Grading"** have been proposed to classify glioma based on WSIs. For instance, **Wang et al., "A novel DL-based classification method for glioma prediction using genomic features and cellularity features"** designed a mutual contrastive low-rank learning (MCL) scheme, where formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-based  and frozen-based WSIs are integrated for better glioma grading performance. Additionally, **Huang et al., "A DL-based method for glioma classification using histology features"** proposed a novel DL-based classification method that fuses genomic features with cellularity features for glioma prediction. However, most existing DL methods are based on the obsolete glioma taxonomy criteria ____ , which only focuses on histology features, such as NMP. Therefore, it is in demand to develop DL-based methods consistent with the latest glioma diagnosis criteria, which jointly concsider histology and molecular markers in the taxonomy pipeline.



Most recently, a few DL-based methods **Chen et al., "A hierarchical vision transformer-based method for glioma classification"** have achieved automatic glioma diagnosis using the up-to-date criteria. For example, **Wang et al., "ResNet-50-based DL structure with patch selection strategy for glioma classification"** proposed a hierarchical vision transformer-based method to separately predict molecular markers and histology features, which are then combined for final diagnosis. Similarly, **Li et al., "A ResNet-50-based DL structure with patch selection strategy for glioma classification"** devised a ResNet-50-based DL structure with a novel patch selection strategy for classifying glioma according to the latest criteria. Despite their potentials, significant limitations remain in existing methods: \textbf{(i)} Current methods are incapable of achieving efficient interaction between the histology features and molecular markers for clinically interpretable diagnosis; \textbf{(ii)} The diagnosis scheme used in existing works are incomplete or inconsistent with the latest criteria. For instance, in **Hollon et al., "Artificial intelligence for glioma classification: a systematic review"** , grade 4 astrocytoma, a newly defined class in WHO 2021 criteria, was ignored in the training process. 
\textbf{(iii)} Most models were trained with a single type of WSIs, i.e., either FFPE or frozen tissue sections, whereas in real-world practice, both FFPE- and   frozen-based WSIs are commonly used for diagnosis in different clinical scenarios. To address these gaps, the proposed M3C2 achieves explicit interaction between histology features and molecular markers aligned with the WHO 2021 criteria and trained on both FFPE and frozen sections.

\subsection{Integration of histology and molecular markers}


\noindent\textbf{Multi-modal learning for precision oncology.}
Recently, joint modeling of multi-modal data of histology and molecular markers has achieved progress in precision oncology, advancing AI towards practical clinical application in various cancers **Wang et al., "CMAT: Cross-Modal Attention Mechanism for Multi-Modal Fusion"**.
Multi-modal algorithms are generally categorized into three types: early, intermediate, and late fusion. Early fusion integrates raw data or extracted features before inputting them into the proposed algorithms. Intermediate fusion ____ modulates multi-modal feature embeddings at specific fusion modules or different layers within the model. Late fusion ____ involves modality-specific models that aggregate predictions from each modality for the final classification. For example, **Li et al., "SURVPATH: Memory-Efficient Multimodal Transformer for Pan-Cancer Survival Prediction"** proposed an intermediate fusion framework (CMAT), which explores intrinsic associations between histopathology images and gene expression profiles through a cross-modal attention module and a modality alignment and fusion module. Similarly,  **Wang et al., "SURVPATH: Memory-Efficient Multimodal Transformer for Pan-Cancer Survival Prediction"** developed a late fusion framework named SURVPATH, a memory-efficient multimodal transformer that integrates gene pathways and histopathology images for pan-cancer survival prediction.



For gliomas, several multi-modal data fusion methods have  been proposed ____ . Specifically, **Li et al., "Pathomic Fusion: Joint Predicting of Survival and Glioma Classification Using Gene Expression and Whole-Slide Images"** introduced the Pathomic Fusion method that integrates gene expression  and WSI for jointly predicting survival and glioma classification. ____ devised a disentangled multi-modal framework that can handle both complete and incomplete samples for glioma diagnosis and prognosis.  Despite the effectiveness, most current multi-modal methods face practical limitations in clinical scenarios, as they  rely on the input of molecular information, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This dependence hampers their applicability and widespread adoption in clinical practice.


To tackle this challenge, ____ proposed a novel discrepancy between DL-based algorithms and histopathological diagnosis methods for glioma classification ____ .
