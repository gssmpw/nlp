%\begin{abstract}
%Aligning language models with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods suffer from reliance on a large number of prohibitively costly human annotations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Stackelberg Game Preference Optimization (SGPO)}, a framework that unifies theoretical guarantees with practical efficiency. Theoretically, we propose SGPO as a two-player Stackelberg game where a policy model (leader) optimizes against worst-case preference distributions generated by an adversarial follower. We prove SGPO converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-bounded regret under $\epsilon$-bounded annotation noise, in contrast to DPO’s linear regret. Practically, we introduce \textbf{ Stackelberg Self-Annotated Preference Optimization (SSAPO)}, an algorithm that instantiates SGPO with minimal human supervision. Starting with only 1/30 of seed human labels (UltraFeedback), SSAPO iteratively generates synthetic preferences via self-annotation while injecting controlled noise to simulate real-world imperfections. Within \textbf{3 iterations}, SSAPO matches SOTA performance on Alpaca Eval 2.0 with \textbf{30X fewer} human labels.

%Aligning language models with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods often rely on prohibitively large amounts of high-quality human annotations. In this paper, we propose \emph{Stackelberg Game Preference Optimization (SGPO)}, a framework that unifies theoretical guarantees with practical efficiency by explicitly modeling alignment as a two-player Stackelberg game. Concretely, a policy model (leader) optimizes against a worst-case preference distribution (follower) within an $\epsilon$-Wasserstein ball, thereby ensuring robustness under moderate annotation noise or distribution shifts.
%Theoretically, we show that SGPO converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-bounded regret under $\epsilon$-bounded annotation noise. In contrast, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can suffer linear regret growth in the size of the distribution mismatch, underscoring SGPO's greater tolerance to labeling errors.
%Practically, we instantiates SGPO with the \emph{Stackelberg Self-Annotated Preference Optimization (SSAPO)} algorithm. Starting with a human labelled seed preference data, SSAPO\footnote{An example code for SSAPO can be found at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SSAPO-6818}{anonymous.4open.science/r/SSAPO-6818}} iteratively self-annotates new preferences using the current policy’s rankings and reweights the synthetic preferences adversarially via distributionally robust optimization. Using only 2K seed preference from UltraFeedback dataset, i.e., 1/30 of human labels of the dataset, SSAPO achieves 35.82~\% GPT4 win-rate with Mistral-7B and 40.12\% GPT4 win-rate on Llama3-8B-Instruct with AlpacaEval~2.0 within three round of SSAPO.
%Despite using \emph{30X fewer} human labels, SSAPO can achieve performance on Alpaca Eval~2.0 competitive with state-of-the-art methods within three self-annotation rounds.%Highlighting a scalable path toward label-efficient preference alignment under realistic data constraints.

Aligning language models with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, but existing methods often require large amounts of high-quality human annotations. Aiming at a data-efficient alignment method, we propose \emph{Stackelberg Game Preference Optimization (SGPO)}, a framework that models alignment as a two-player Stackelberg game, where a policy (leader) optimizes against a worst-case preference distribution (follower) within an $\epsilon$-Wasserstein ball, ensuring robustness to (self-)annotation noise and distribution shifts. SGPO guarantees $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$-bounded regret, unlike Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which suffers from linear regret growth in the distribution mismatch. We instantiate SGPO with the \emph{Stackelberg Self-Annotated Preference Optimization (SSAPO)} algorithm, which iteratively self-annotates preferences and adversarially reweights synthetic annotated preferences. Using only 2K seed preferences, from the UltraFeedback dataset, i.e., 1/30 of human labels in the dataset, our method achieves 35.82\% GPT-4 win-rate with Mistral-7B and 40.12\% with Llama3-8B-Instruct within three rounds of SSAPO.

\section*{Impact Statement}
Our work aims to improve the data efficiency and robustness of language model alignment by formulating preference optimization as a Stackelberg game and introducing a self-annotation mechanism.  By reducing reliance on large-scale human-labeled data, our framework could democratize alignment research and make it more accessible to smaller organizations, labs, and communities (those lack substantial annotation budgets). Moreover, robust optimization against noisy or adversarial preference distributions may help mitigate unintentional bias if the seed data deviate from the true user preference distribution.
