\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

The objective of this case study is to evaluate the impact of various constraints on the solution.
We analyze two datasets, (1) German Credit (German in short) and (2) Stack Overflow (SO in short), each with a corresponding protected group, and assess the rules chosen by \sysName\ under different constraints. We aim to understand how these constraints influence coverage, utility, and disparities (for fairness) between protected and non-protected groups. \revb{We present example chosen rules under different configurations. We chose the rules by randomly picking one from each category (one that favors the protected group, one that favors the non-protected, and another that is more balanced). The full lists of rules are available in \cite{fullversion}.}

We examine two commonly used datasets:
(1) Stack Oveflow (SO)~\cite{stackoverflowreport}, as described in \Cref{example:ex1}. Here, the goal is to increase salary. (2) German Credit~\cite{asuncion2007uci}, which contains details of bank account holders, including demographic and financial information. Here, the goal is to increase the credit score (binary). 
The corresponding 
causal DAG was constructed using  
~\cite{youngmann2023causal}. The datasets' statistics are presented in \cref{tab:datasets}. The protected groups were selected to represent subgroups where the desired outcome was relatively low and sufficiently large to ensure the discovery of statistically significant rules. \revb{The protected group in Stack Overflow is defined as individuals from countries with a low GDP, which constitutes 21.5\% of the data (the GDP attribute is categorical in this dataset). In the German data, the protected group is defined as single females, which constitutes 9.2\% of the data.}

%$1.$ Achieving individual fairness is more challenging than group fairness, regardless of the fairness definition used. This is because most rules are not individually fair.\\
$1.$ Achieving rule coverage is harder than group coverage, as many useful (i.e., high utility) rules apply only to a small fraction of the population. This is not surprising, as it follows from what we proved in Lemma~\ref{lemma:individual_rules}, where we showed that the optimal strategy is to suggest a personalized rule for each individual. \\

The results are shown in \cref{tab:problem_variants}, illustrating the trade-off between utility, coverage, and fairness. Without constraints, the expected utility is substantially higher, but this comes at the expense of greater disparities between protected and non-protected groups (as indicated by the unfairness score --- the difference between the expected utility of protected and non-protected). In the examined scenarios, coverage for both groups was achieved without constraints, but other protected group definitions may require them.

\paratitle{Stack Overflow}
% In the Stack Overflow scenario, the coverage requirements were met even without explicitly imposing coverage constraints. This shows that coverage requirements are not always necessary, as some protected groups can naturally be stratified, ensuring the solution applies to a sufficient number of individuals without enforcement. 
Observe that while the expected utility for both protected and non-protected groups reaches its highest value in the no-constraints variant, the unfairness score is very high. This indicates that achieving SP fairness requires compromising on the expected utility for both protected and non-protected groups. Interestingly, rule coverage and individual fairness are difficult to achieve, as most rules fail to meet these criteria. This leads to lower expected utility for all groups. On the other hand, group coverage and fairness constraints are easier to satisfy, as they offer more flexibility by allowing the selection of some unfair rules alongside those specifically designed for the protected group.

We show above the three example rules selected under group fairness constraint. The first rule $S1_a$ is more advantageous for the non-protected group, the second ($S1_b$) benefits both protected and non-protected groups similarly, while the third rule ($S1_c$) is more beneficial for the protected group. Overall, all these rules together satisfy the group fairness requirement. We also present three example rules selected under individual fairness constraints. In this case, all rules ($S2_a, S2_b, S2_c$) are nearly equally beneficial for both groups, but the overall expected utility is lower. Finally, consider the three example rules selected with no constraints. Here, all rules ($S3_a, S3_b, S3_c$ in the figure below) favor the non-protected group, highlighting the importance of including fairness constraints. %Overall, the rules selected with no constraints have a higher overall utility while fairness constraints ensure that the utility is not biased in favor of only one group.

% In this scenario as well, the coverage requirements were satisfied even without explicitly imposing coverage constraints. 
While the expected utility for both protected and non-protected peaks in the no-constraints variant, the unfairness score is relatively high. This suggests that achieving BGL fairness necessitates compromising utility for both groups. Notably, to reduce the unfairness, it is feasible to impose either a rule coverage constraint or a rule coverage constraint combined with group fairness. 
We show three rules selected under BGL group fairness constraints below.
Since we are focusing on BGL fairness, which considers only the minimal gain for the protected group without regard for the gains of the non-protected group, we still observe a disparity between the two, even with a fairness constraint in place. 
%Since this is a BGL fairness constraint, there are no restrictions on the difference between the expected utility for protected and non-protected, provided that the expected utility for the protected group exceeds a predefined threshold.
