abstract = {We explore the complexity of nucleolus computation in b-matching games on bipartite graphs. We show that computing the nucleolus of a simple b-matching game is NP-hard when b≡3 even on bipartite graphs of maximum degree 7. We complement this with partial positive results in the special case where b values are bounded by 2. In particular, we describe an efficient algorithm when a constant number of vertices satisfy bv=2 as well as an efficient algorithm for computing the non-simple b-matching nucleolus when b≡2.}

title = "On the irreducible core and the equal remaining obligations rule of minimum cost spanning extension problems",
abstract = "Minimum cost spanning extension problems are generalizations of minimum cost spanning tree problems in which an existing network has to be extended to connect users to a source. This paper generalizes the definition of irreducible core to minimum cost spanning extension problems and introduces an algorithm generating all elements of the irreducible core. Moreover, the equal remaining obligations rule, a one-point refinement of the irreducible core ispresented. Finally, the paper characterizes these solutions axiomatically. The classical Bird tree allocation of minimum cost spanning tree problems is obtained as a particular case in our algorithm for the irreducible core.",

abstract = {We consider a recently introduced framework in which fairness is measured by worst-case outcomes across groups, rather than by the more standard differences between group outcomes. In this framework we provide provably convergent oracle-efficient learning algorithms (or equivalently, reductions to non-fair learning) for minimax group fairness. Here the goal is that of minimizing the maximum loss across all groups, rather than equalizing group losses. Our algorithms apply to both regression and classification settings and support both overall error and false positive or false negative rates as the fairness measure of interest. They also support relaxations of the fairness constraints, thus permitting study of the tradeoff between overall accuracy and minimax fairness. We compare the experimental behavior and performance of our algorithms across a variety of fairness-sensitive data sets and show empirical cases in which minimax fairness is strictly and strongly preferable to equal outcome notions.},
