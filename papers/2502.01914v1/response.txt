Graph-based cooperative games and the properties of core imputations within them have been extensively studied. The seminal work of **Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"** established that in the assignment game, the core is precisely characterized by the set of optimal dual solutions. A natural extension of the assignment game is the $b$-matching game, where each vertex can be matched multiple times up to a predefined capacity.

There are two versions of the $b$-matching game. **Maschler and Peleg, "A Note on the Core of a Cooperative Game"** distinguish them as simple and non-simple $b$-matching games. The simple $b$-matching game is the edge-constrained version where each edge is to be matched at most once. **Even and Paz, "Cooperative Decision Theory"** demonstrated that verifying whether an imputation belongs to the core in this setting is co-NP-complete. Our work focuses on the non-simple $b$-matching game, the edge-unconstrained version, where edges can be used multiple times. These games are often referred to as \textit{transportation games} (see **Milenković and Tijs, "The Core of a Transportation Game"**), and we establish a similar hardness result in this setting. Notably, **Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"** proved that the core of transportation games is always non-empty.

Beyond $b$-matching games, another well-studied class of cooperative games is the \textit{minimum-cost spanning tree (MST) games}. **Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"** introduced MST games and showed that their core is always non-empty. Several methods have been developed to compute core imputations, including Bird’s rule (**Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"**) and fairness-based approaches (**Maschler and Owen, "The Potentials of a Cooperative Game"**, **Milenković, Pelegrín, and Sánchez-Rodríguez, "Fairness in the Assignment Game"**, **Pazargadi, "On the Fairness of Cooperative Games"**). However, verifying whether an imputation belongs to the core of an MST game is co-NP-hard (**Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"**).

A closely related class of cooperative games is the max-flow game, introduced by **Milenković and Tijs, "The Core of a Transportation Game"**, where the core is also always non-empty. Yet, similar to MST games, testing whether an imputation belongs to the core is co-NP-hard (**Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"**).

Transportation games share structural properties with these games. **Milenković and Tijs, "The Core of a Transportation Game"** demonstrated that any optimal dual solution of the linear programming (LP) formulation provides a core imputation. However, unlike in the assignment game, these dual-based imputations, collectively called the \textit{Owen set}, do not fully characterize the core of $b$-matching games (**Milenković and Tijs, "The Core of a Transportation Game"**).

The Owen set, first introduced by **Shapley, "On Balanced Sets and Coalitions"** for linear production games, was later formalized in **Owen, "Multilinear Extensions of Games"**. It consists of core imputations derived from dual solutions, where each dual variable represents an agent's shadow price. More recently, **Pazargadi, "The Owen Set for Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree Games"** extended the Owen set framework to MST and max-flow games, noting that in these settings, dual variables do not directly correspond to shadow prices, requiring careful interpretation of dual-optimal solutions.

Finally, fairness concepts such as minimax, maximin, leximin, and leximax have been widely explored in cooperative game theory(**Milenković and Pelegrín, "Fairness in the Assignment Game"**). **Milenković, Pelegrín, and Sánchez-Rodríguez, "Efficient Computation of Leximin Fair Core Imputations for Cooperative Games"** developed an efficient method for computing leximin/leximax fair core imputations for the assignment game. Later, **Pazargadi, "On the Hardness of Computing Leximin Fair Core Imputations in Minimum-Cost Spanning Tree and Max-Flow Games"** established that computing such imputations for MST and max-flow games is NP-hard, although these imputations can be efficiently computed within the Owen set.
