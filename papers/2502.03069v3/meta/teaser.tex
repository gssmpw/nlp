	\caption{In this paper, we explore VR interaction with an object-generating co-creative AI via a Wizard-of-Oz study on how the AI communicates its intent to users. The study investigates the impact of different modes of AI representation (modification highlighting, incremental visualization of changes, and the embodiment of the avatar) on user perception.}
