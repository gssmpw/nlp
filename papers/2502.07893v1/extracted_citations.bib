	abstract = {In the last years, sentiment analysis (SA) has attracted increasing interest in the text mining area. It increasingly becomes a popular research area for opinion mining in education that analyses and understands students’ opinions toward their institutions for improving the quality of decision-making. In this study, a systematic review was conducted to explore the recent application of sentiment analysis in higher education; to classify SA techniques and methods commonly and successfully used in the higher education domains. A systematic mapping review was applied to 840 articles, and 22 related studies are selected based on the study’s criteria. The findings revealed that the prior studies mainly focus on six domains for applying SA in the higher education context and the teaching quality evaluation was the most addressed domain. The study also found that applying specific SA techniques could be the best tool for institutions to solve particular learning problems and a useful tool for improving higher education institutions’ quality and evaluating the teaching process as well as teachers’ performance. This study’s main contribution is the new categorizations of the SA applications techniques in higher education to provide a closely full image of SA-related tools and areas.}

abstract={Sentiment analysis methods have become popular for investigating human communication, including discussions related to software projects. Since general-purpose sentiment analysis tools do not fit well with the information exchanged by software developers, new tools, specific for software engineering (SE), have been developed. We investigate to what extent off-the-shelf SE-specific tools for sentiment analysis mitigate the threats to conclusion validity of empirical studies in software engineering, highlighted by previous research. First, we replicate two studies addressing the role of sentiment in security discussions on GitHub and in question-writing on Stack Overflow. Then, we extend the previous studies by assessing to what extent the tools agree with each other and with the manual annotation on a gold standard of 600 documents. We find that different SE-specific sentiment analysis tools might lead to contradictory results at a fine-grain level, when used off-the-shelf. Conversely, platform-specific tuning or retraining might be needed to take into account differences in platform conventions, jargon, or document lengths.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last decade, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in many domains, including business, social networks and education. Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.},
