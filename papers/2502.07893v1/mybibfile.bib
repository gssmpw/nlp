 abstract = {A recent research trend has emerged to identify developers' emotions, by applying sentiment analysis to the content of communication traces left in collaborative development environments. Trying to overcome the limitations posed by using off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools, researchers recently started to develop their own tools for the software engineering domain. In this paper, we report a benchmark study to assess the performance and reliability of three sentiment analysis tools specifically customized for software engineering. Furthermore, we offer a reflection on the open challenges, as they emerge from a qualitative analysis of misclassified texts.},

 abstract = {Software development---just like any other human collaboration---inevitably evokes emotions like joy or sadness, which are known to affect the group dynamics within a team. Today, little is known about those individual emotions and whether they can be discerned at all in the development artifacts produced during a project. This paper analyzes (a) whether issue reports---a common development artifact, rich in content---convey emotional information and (b) whether humans agree on the presence of these emotions. From the analysis of the issue comments of 117 projects of the Apache Software Foundation, we find that developers express emotions (in particular gratitude, joy and sadness). However, the more context is provided about an issue report, the more human raters start to doubt and nuance their interpretation. Based on these results, we demonstrate the feasibility of a machine learning classifier for identifying issue comments containing gratitude, joy and sadness. Such a classifier, using emotion-driving words and technical terms, obtains a good precision and recall for identifying the emotion love, while for joy and sadness a lower recall is obtained.},

Software development is a collaborative activity as well, yet there is little information on how affectiveness impacts software productivity. As a first measure of this impact, this paper analyzes the relation between sentiment, emotions and politeness of developers in more than 560K Jira comments with the time to fix a Jira issue. We found that the happier developers are (expressing emotions such as JOY and LOVE in their comments), the shorter the issue fixing time is likely to be. In contrast, negative emotions such as SADNESS, are linked with longer issue fixing time. Politeness plays a more complex role and we empirically analyze its impact on developers' productivity.},

A model of how employees will adopt BI apps is advanced based on theoretical foundations and recent thinking regarding how IT artifacts are becoming perceived of as {\textquotedbl}social actors within one's network.{\textquotedbl} The theory cited asserts that individual's resource management instincts impact sentiment. Repeated app usage is clarified as ongoing appropriation. Actual app store review data is used to test the proposition that sentiment analysis can aid in addressing current practice bottlenecks in requirements engineering. A sentiment analysis tool suite is applied to over 5000 reviews of productivity apps as a proof of concept. Findings support that sentiment analysis can address current bottlenecks to requirements engineering, but that certain types of reviews tend to elude algorithmic analysis. Future needs for sentiment analysis algorithms in the space are suggested.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing attention to social aspects of software engineering, including studies of emotions and sentiments experienced and expressed by the software developers. Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to diverging conclusions. Finally, we perform two replications of previously published studies and observe that the results of those studies cannot be confirmed when a different sentiment analysis tool is used.},

@inproceedings{S.Panichella.2015,
 abstract = {App Stores, such as Google Play or the Apple Store, allow users to provide feedback on apps by posting review comments and giving star ratings. These platforms constitute a useful electronic mean in which application developers and users can productively exchange information about apps. Previous research showed that users feedback contains usage scenarios, bug reports and feature requests, that can help app developers to accomplish software maintenance and evolution tasks. However, in the case of the most popular apps, the large amount of received feedback, its unstructured nature and varying quality can make the identification of useful user feedback a very challenging task. In this paper we present a taxonomy to classify app reviews into categories relevant to software maintenance and evolution, as well as an approach that merges three techniques: (1) Natural Language Processing, (2) Text Analysis and (3) Sentiment Analysis to automatically classify app reviews into the proposed categories. We show that the combined use of these techniques allows to achieve better results (a precision of 75{\%} and a recall of 74{\%}) than results obtained using each technique individually (precision of 70{\%} and a recall of 67{\%}).},

abstract={Sentiment analysis methods have become popular for investigating human communication, including discussions related to software projects. Since general-purpose sentiment analysis tools do not fit well with the information exchanged by software developers, new tools, specific for software engineering (SE), have been developed. We investigate to what extent off-the-shelf SE-specific tools for sentiment analysis mitigate the threats to conclusion validity of empirical studies in software engineering, highlighted by previous research. First, we replicate two studies addressing the role of sentiment in security discussions on GitHub and in question-writing on Stack Overflow. Then, we extend the previous studies by assessing to what extent the tools agree with each other and with the manual annotation on a gold standard of 600 documents. We find that different SE-specific sentiment analysis tools might lead to contradictory results at a fine-grain level, when used off-the-shelf. Conversely, platform-specific tuning or retraining might be needed to take into account differences in platform conventions, jargon, or document lengths.},

We also develop a coding scheme on how to quantify politeness for conversational texts found on collaborative platforms. We find that not only do the tools have a low agreement with human ratings on sentiment and politeness, human raters also have a low agreement among themselves.},

 abstract = {Users of the Twitter microblogging platform share a considerable amount of information through short messages on a daily basis. Some of these so-called tweets discuss issues related to software and could include information that is relevant to the companies developing these applications. Such tweets have the potential to help requirements engineers better understand user needs and therefore provide important information for software evolution. However, little is known about the nature of tweets discussing software-related issues. In this paper, we report on the usage characteristics, content and automatic classification potential of tweets about software applications. Our results are based on an exploratory study in which we used descriptive statistics, content analysis, machine learning and lexical sentiment analysis to explore a dataset of 10,986,495 tweets about 30 different software applications. Our results show that searching for relevant information on software applications within the vast stream of tweets can be compared to looking for a needle in a haystack. However, this relevant information can provide valuable input for software companies and support the continuous evolution of the applications discussed in these tweets. Furthermore, our results show that it is possible to use machine learning and lexical sentiment analysis techniques to automatically extract information about the tweets regarding their relevance, authors and sentiment polarity.},

 abstract = {Context: Users can have conflicting opinions and different experiences when using software and user reviews serve as a channel in which users can document their opinions and experiences. To develop and evolve software that is usable and relevant for a diverse group of users, different opinions and experiences need to be taken into account. Goal: In this paper we present DIVERSE, a feature and sentiment centric retrieval approach which automatically provides developers with a diverse sample of user reviews that is representative of the different opinions and experiences mentioned in the whole set of reviews. Results: We evaluated the diversity retrieval performance of our approach on reviews from seven apps from two different app stores. We compared the reviews retrieved by DIVERSE with a feature-based retrieval approach and found that on average DIVERSE outperforms the baseline approach. Additionally, a controlled experiment revealed that DIVERSE can help develop- ers save time when analyzing user reviews and was considered useful for detecting conflicting opinions and software evolution. Conclusions: DIVERSE can therefore help developers collect a comprehensive set of reviews and aid in the detection of conflicting opinions.},

 abstract = {A successful software project is the result of a complex process involving, above all, people. Developers are the key factors for the success of a software development process, not merely as executors of tasks, but as protagonists and core of the whole development process. This paper investigates social aspects among developers working on software projects developed with the support of Agile tools. We studied 22 open-source software projects developed using the Agile board of the JIRA repository. All comments committed by developers involved in the projects were analyzed and we explored whether the politeness of comments affected the number of developers involved and the time required to fix any given issue. Our results showed that the level of politeness in the communication process among developers does have an effect on the time required to fix issues and, in the majority of the analysed projects, it had a positive correlation with attractiveness of the project to both active and potential developers. The more polite developers were, the less time it took to fix an issue.},

abstract = {Issue tracking systems store valuable data for testing hypotheses concerning maintenance, building statistical prediction models and (recently) investigating developer affectiveness. For the latter, issue tracking systems can be mined to explore developers emotions, sentiments and politeness---affects for short. However, research on affect detection in software artefacts is still in its early stage due to the lack of manually validated data and tools.In this paper, we contribute to the research of affects on software artefacts by providing a labeling of emotions present on issue comments.We manually labeled 2,000 issue comments and 4,000 sentences written by developers with emotions such as love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness and fear. Labeled comments and sentences are linked to software artefacts reported in our previously published dataset (containing more than 1K projects, more than 700K issue reports and more than 2 million issue comments). The enriched dataset presented in this paper allows the investigation of the role of affects in software development.},

TITLE = {Sentiment Analysis of Students’ Feedback with NLP and Deep Learning: A Systematic Mapping Study},
JOURNAL = {Applied Sciences},
VOLUME = {11},

ARTICLE-NUMBER = {3986},
ISSN = {2076-3417},
ABSTRACT = {In the last decade, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in many domains, including business, social networks and education. Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.},

	abstract = {In the last years, sentiment analysis (SA) has attracted increasing interest in the text mining area. It increasingly becomes a popular research area for opinion mining in education that analyses and understands students’ opinions toward their institutions for improving the quality of decision-making. In this study, a systematic review was conducted to explore the recent application of sentiment analysis in higher education; to classify SA techniques and methods commonly and successfully used in the higher education domains. A systematic mapping review was applied to 840 articles, and 22 related studies are selected based on the study’s criteria. The findings revealed that the prior studies mainly focus on six domains for applying SA in the higher education context and the teaching quality evaluation was the most addressed domain. The study also found that applying specific SA techniques could be the best tool for institutions to solve particular learning problems and a useful tool for improving higher education institutions’ quality and evaluating the teaching process as well as teachers’ performance. This study’s main contribution is the new categorizations of the SA applications techniques in higher education to provide a closely full image of SA-related tools and areas.}

abstract = {Context:
More than 78 countries have developed COVID contact-tracing apps to limit the spread of coronavirus. However, many experts and scientists cast doubt on the effectiveness of those apps. For each app, a large number of reviews have been entered by end-users in app stores.
Objective:
Our goal is to gain insights into the user reviews of those apps, and to find out the main problems that users have reported. Our focus is to assess the “software in society” aspects of the apps, based on user reviews.
Method:
We selected nine European national apps for our analysis and used a commercial app-review analytics tool to extract and mine the user reviews. For all the apps combined, our dataset includes 39,425 user reviews.
Results:
Results show that users are generally dissatisfied with the nine apps under study, except the Scottish (“Protect Scotland”) app. Some of the major issues that users have complained about are high battery drainage and doubts on whether apps are really working.
Conclusion:
Our results show that more work is needed by the stakeholders behind the apps (e.g., app developers, decision-makers, public health experts) to improve the public adoption, software quality and public perception of these apps.}
