abstract = {Sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives arise naturally in practice and pose unique challenges for research in decision-theoretic planning and learning, which has largely focused on single-objective settings. This article surveys algorithms designed for sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives. Though there is a growing body of literature on this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identify three distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to a single-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to the applicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projects multi-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. We show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which can be a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, we survey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning. Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future work.},

Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our first result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness.}

abstract = {Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) setup naturally arises in many places where an agent optimizes multiple objectives. We consider the problem of MORL where multiple objectives are combined using a non-linear scalarization. We combine the vector objectives with a concave scalarization function and maximize this scalar objective. To work with the non-linear scalarization, in this paper, we propose a solution using steady-state occupancy measures and long-term average rewards. We show that when the scalarization function is element-wise increasing, the optimal policy for the scalarization is also Pareto optimal. To maximize the scalarized objective, we propose a model-based posterior sampling algorithm. Using a novel Bellman error analysis for infinite horizon MDPs based proof, we show that the proposed algorithm obtains a regret bound of ~O(LKDS√A/T) for K objectives, and L-Lipschitz continous scalarization function for MDP with S states, A actions, and diameter D. Additionally, we propose policy-gradient and actor-critic algorithms for MORL. For the policy gradient actor, we obtain the gradient using chain rule, and we learn different critics for each of the K objectives. Finally, we implement our algorithms on multiple environments including deep-sea treasure, and network scheduling setups to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can optimize non-linear scalarization of multiple objectives.},

abstract = {We study fair multi-objective reinforcement learning in which an agent must learn a policy that simultaneously achieves high reward on multiple dimensions of a vector-valued reward. Motivated by the fair resource allocation literature, we model this as an expected welfare maximization problem, for some non-linear fair welfare function of the vector of long-term cumulative rewards. One canonical example of such a function is the Nash Social Welfare, or geometric mean, the log transform of which is also known as the Proportional Fairness objective. We show that even approximately optimal optimization of the expected Nash Social Welfare is computationally intractable even in the tabular case. Nevertheless, we provide a novel adaptation of Q-learning that combines non-linear scalarized learning updates and non-stationary action selection to learn effective policies for optimizing nonlinear welfare functions. We show that our algorithm is provably convergent, and we demonstrate experimentally that our approach outperforms techniques based on linear scalarization, mixtures of optimal linear scalarizations, or stationary action selection for the Nash Social Welfare Objective.},

abstract = {Many real-world problems involve the optimization of multiple, possibly conflicting objectives. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a generalization of standard reinforcement learning where the scalar reward signal is extended to multiple feedback signals, in essence, one for each objective. MORL is the process of learning policies that optimize multiple criteria simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel temporal difference learning algorithm that integrates the Pareto dominance relation into a reinforcement learning approach. This algorithm is a multi-policy algorithm that learns a set of Pareto dominating policies in a single run. We name this algorithm Pareto Q-learning and it is applicable in episodic environments with deterministic as well as stochastic transition functions. A crucial aspect of Pareto Q-learning is the updating mechanism that bootstraps sets of Q-vectors. One of our main contributions in this paper is a mechanism that separates the expected immediate reward vector from the set of expected future discounted reward vectors. This decomposition allows us to update the sets and to exploit the learned policies consistently throughout the state space. To balance exploration and exploitation during learning, we also propose three set evaluation mechanisms. These three mechanisms evaluate the sets of vectors to accommodate for standard action selection strategies, such as ε-greedy. More precisely, these mechanisms use multi-objective evaluation principles such as the hypervolume measure, the cardinality indicator and the Pareto dominance relation to select the most promising actions. We experimentally validate the algorithm on multiple environments with two and three objectives and we demonstrate that Pareto Q-learning outperforms current state-of-the-art MORL algorithms with respect to the hypervolume of the obtained policies. We note that (1) Pareto Q-learning is able to learn the entire Pareto front under the usual assumption that each state-action pair is sufficiently sampled, while (2) not being biased by the shape of the Pareto front. Furthermore, (3) the set evaluation mechanisms provide indicative measures for local action selection and (4) the learned policies can be retrieved throughout the state and action space.},

Organized sharing is a fundamental requirement for large scientific collaborations; responsiveness, the ability to provide good response time, is a fundamental requirement for seamless integration of the large scale computing resources into everyday use. This paper focuses on a model-free resource provisioning strategy supporting both scenarios. The provisioning problem is modeled as a continuous action-state space, multi-objective reinforcement learning problem, under realistic hypotheses; the high level goals of users, administrators, and shareholders are captured through simple utility functions. We propose an implementation of this reinforcement learning framework, including an approximation of the value function through an Echo State Network, and we validate it on a real dataset.},

However, the single reward model overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. Next, we propose to learn a mixture of reward models via an expectation-maximization algorithm and solve a MaxMin alignment objective inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better honor diverse human preferences. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language (with Tulu2-7B)) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general.}

  abstract = 	 {Cardinal objectives serve as intuitive targets in fair machine learning by summarizing utility (welfare) or disutility (malfare) $u$ over $g$ groups. Under standard axioms, all welfare and malfare functions are $w$-weighted $p$-power-means, i.e. $M_p(u;w) = \sqrt[p]{\sum_{i=1}^g w_i u_i^p}$, with $p \leq 1$ for welfare, or $p \geq 1$ for malfare. We show the same under weaker axioms, and also identify stronger axioms that naturally restrict $p$. It is known that power-mean malfare functions are Lipschitz continuous, and thus statistically easy to estimate or learn. We show that all power means are locally Holder continuous, i.e., $|M(u; w)-M(u’ ; w)| \leq \lambda \parallel u - u’\parallel^\alpha$ for some $\lambda$, $\alpha$,$\parallel \cdot \parallel$. In particular, $\lambda$ and $1/\alpha$ are bounded except as $p \rightarrow 0$ or $\min_i w_i \rightarrow 0$, and via this analysis we bound the sample complexity of optimizing welfare. This yields a novel concept of fair-PAC learning, wherein welfare functions are only polynomially harder to optimize than malfare functions, except when $p \approx 0$ or $\min_i w_i$ $\approx$ 0, which is exponentially harder.}
