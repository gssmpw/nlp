\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in identifying implicit suicidal ideation and providing appropriate supportive responses. Through our novel dataset \ourdata. We revealed significant limitations in current LLMs' ability to handle subtle expressions of suicidal intent. Our evaluation framework, examining both identification accuracy and response appropriateness, demonstrated that while LLMs can handle explicit suicidal content, they struggle with implicit expressions, potentially leading to inadequate or harmful responses.
