    \caption{Real-world examples demonstrating LLMs' varying capabilities in handling suicide-related conversations: (a) LLMs can \textcolor{customgreen}{provide appropriate support} when suicide is \textit{explicitly} mentioned, but (b) often fail to recognize \textit{implicit} suicidal ideation and may inadvertently \textcolor{customblue}{worsen users' emotional state through invalidating or inappropriate responses}. (c) Additionally, LLMs can pose risks when used in role-play scenarios, potentially encouraging harmful behaviors.}
