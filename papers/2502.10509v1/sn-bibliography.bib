abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned ledger platform designed to be highly modular and extensible, delivering confidentiality, privacy and scalability to enterprise blockchains. With Fabric's production grade availability in mid-2017, enterprises are experimenting with Fabric for building real-world blockchain applications. In this paper, we characterize the performance and scalability features of the current production release of Fabric (v1.0). This paper takes an experimental approach, where we study the throughput and latency characteristics of Fabric by subjecting it to different sets of workloads. Through a suite of micro-benchmarks, custom-built for Fabric, we tune different transaction and chaincode parameters and study how they affect transaction latencies. Finally, we also conduct experiments to study Fabric's performance characteristics while increasing the number of chaincodes, channels and peers.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the performance interference of blockchain services that run on cloud data centers. As the data centers offer shared computing resources to multiple services, the blockchain services can experience performance interference due to the co-located services. We explore the impact of the interference on Fabric performance and develop a new technique to offer performance isolation for Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform. First, we analyze the characteristics of the different components in Hyperledger Fabric and show that Fabric components have different impacts on the performance of Fabric. Then, we present QiOi, component-level performance isolation technique for Hyperledger Fabric. The key idea of QiOi is to dynamically control the CPU scheduling of Fabric components to cope with the performance interference. We im-plement QiOi as a user-level daemon and evaluate how QiOi mitigates the performance interference of Fabric. The evaluation results demonstrate that QiOi mitigates performance degradation of Fabric by 22% and improves Fabric latency by 2.5 times without sacrificing the performance of co-located services. In addition, we show that QiOi can support different ordering services and chaincodes with negligible overhead to Fabric performance.},

@article{Leal2020,
abstract = {This paper provides a performance evaluation of private blockchain networks based on Ethereum, an open-source blockchain platform. Different sectors with stringent blockchain security, privacy, and auditability requirements have adopted Ethereum private networks to keep their data exclusive within a permission group. However, the concrete performance of private Ethereum networks—i.e., transactions or smart contract interactions—has received limited attention. We have set an Ethereum private network to study the following configuration parameters: (1) distinct transaction complexity; (2) different block sizes; (3) two consensus algorithms, namely Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Authority; and (4) multiple network nodes. Our evaluation has employed time series datasets from the pharma industry, where high levels of security, privacy, and auditability are always required. However, this evaluation approach is domain-agnostic being valid for other fields. We have observed an inverse correlation between the amount of transactions per block and the block period. In this context, we have determined linear models for the simple (low gas limit) and the complex transactions (high gas limit). The model enables to calculate the block period for a specific amount of transactions to be committed in a block. We also include predictive modelling for an optimal configuration taking into account the amount of transactions to commit into a blockchain network.},

abstract = {Smart grids lay the foundation for future communities. Smart homes, smart buildings, smart streets, and smart offices are built when intelligent devices piles on intelligent devices. To reach the maximum capacity, they all must be supported by an intelligent power supply. For optimal and real-time electricity consumption, monitoring and trading, blockchain posses several potential benefits in its application to electricity infrastructure. To analyze the performance of the blockchain-based smart grid, this paper presents a virtual smart grid. A smart grid equipped with smart contracts, capable of executing virtual activities is evaluated and possible strengths and weaknesses are discussed. The paper draws a performance analysis of the blockchain-based smart grid by using the Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric-based implementations.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a technology for storing an immutable history of transactions in a decentralized platform by using cryptographic principles. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain within their IT systems. However, the accessibility, privacy, performance, and scalability aspects of different blockchain-based platforms are still legitimate concerns when designing an enterprise solution. Permissioned blockchain frameworks facilitate a way to immutably store confidential records. Numerous research studies have been carried out on the opportunities, challenges, application areas, and performance analysis of different public and permissioned blockchain-based platforms. However, the implication of blockchain in recent private enterprise solution requires detailed comparative analysis. This paper conducts a performance and scalability analysis of popular private blockchain platforms, including Ethereum (private deployment), Quorum, Corda, and Hyperledger Fabric. Each of these platforms is assessed by varying the workloads (no. of transactions and nodes) and determining the performance evaluation metrics such as throughput and network latency.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation that enables permissioned blockchains, which provide a general blockchain framework with identifiable participants for a variety of business applications. Although many performance issues of Hyperledger Fabric have been alleviated to some extent, its performance is still limited - e.g. 2.2k transactions per second in our experiment that executes two reads and two writes in a transaction. A major performance bottleneck is incurred by accesses to the databases that store the latest key-value pairs in the ledger data, indexes to transactions, and the update history. In this paper, we characterize the performance of database systems used in Hyperledger Fabric to identify optimization opportunities by running a Hyperledger Fabric GoLevelDB (HLF-GLDB) benchmark. We developed HLF-GLDB as a standalone benchmark to simulate database accesses in Hyperledger Fabric. Results of the performance characterization revealed that: (1) the data compression of GoLevelDB is a major performance bottleneck in Hyperledger Fabric, and disabling the compression improved the performance by 54%; (2) the size of a database affects the performance significantly. For example, when the size increased by four times, the performance degraded by 25%; (3) To reduce the database access overhead in chaincode, it is better to combine small values so that they can be represented by a single key.},

@article{Rimba2020,
abstract = {Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. Architecture impacts the non-functional qualities of systems, creating design trade-offs between these qualities. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet little is known about them for blockchain-based systems. How expensive is it to use blockchains compared to conventional execution and storage infrastructure? We investigate this question using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. Besides monetary cost, blockchains like Ethereum limit the complexity of new blocks by capping costs through network-defined limits. For applications using such blockchains, the limit per block, thus, translates into an upper bound on throughput scalability. First, we implement and measure the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for a business process model from a large-scale industrial dataset and an example from literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost. Second, we illustrate how cost models can be used to project the impact of different workload assumptions. Finally, we discuss throughput scalability limits as well as trade-offs between cost and other non-functional qualities in the design of blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is a popular open-source project for deploying permissioned blockchains. Many performance characteristics of the latest Hyperledger Fabric (e.g., performance characteristics of each phase, the impacts of ordering services, bottleneck and scalability) are still not well understood due to the performance complexity of distributed systems. We conducted a thorough performance evaluation on the first long term support release of Hyperledger Fabric. We studied the performance characteristics of each phase, including execute, order, and the validate phase, according to Hyperledger Fabric's new execute-order-validate architecture. We also studied the ordering services, including Solo, Kafka, and Raft. Our experimental results showed some findings as follows. 1) The execution phase exhibited a good scalability under the OR endorsement policy but not with the AND endorsement policy. 2) We were not able to find a significant performance difference between the three ordering services. 3) The validate phase was likely to be the system bottleneck due to the low validation speed of chaincode. Overall, our work helps to understand and improve Hyperledger Fabric.},

abstract = {Blockchain has been one of the most attractive technologies for many modern and even future applications. Fabric, an open-source framework to implement the permissioned enterprise-grade blockchain, is getting increasing attention from innovators. The latency performance is crucial to the Fabric blockchain in assessing its effectiveness. Many empirical studies were conducted to analyze this performance based on different hardware platforms. These experimental results are not comparable as they are highly dependent on the underlying networks. Moreover, theoretical analysis on the latency of Fabric blockchain still receives much less attention. This paper provides a novel theoretical model to calculate the transaction latency under various network configurations such as block size, block interval, etc. Subsequently, we validate the proposed latency model with experiments, and the results show that the difference between analytical and experimental results is as low as 6.1%. We also identify some performance bottlenecks and give insights from the developer's perspective.},
