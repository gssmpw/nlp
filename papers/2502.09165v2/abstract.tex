\Ac{RRE} is an acceleration method typically used to accelerate the iterative solution of nonlinear systems of equations using a fixed-point process.
In this context, the iterates are vectors generated from a fixed-point mapping function.
However, when considering the iterative solution of large-scale matrix equations, the iterates are low-rank matrices generated from a fixed-point process for which, generally, the mapping function changes in each iteration.
To enable acceleration of the iterative solution for these problems, we propose two novel generalizations of \ac{RRE}.
First, we show how to effectively compute \ac{RRE} for sequences of low-rank matrices.
Second, we derive a formulation of \ac{RRE} that is suitable for fixed-point processes for which the mapping function changes each iteration.
We demonstrate the potential of the methods on several numerical examples involving the iterative solution of large-scale Lyapunov and Riccati matrix equations.
