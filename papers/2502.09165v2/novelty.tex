We propose novel extensions of \ac{RRE} for the iterative solution of large-scale sparse matrix equations: I) A scheme to efficiently implement \ac{RRE} for low-rank matrix iterates; and II) A scheme to apply \ac{RRE} for iterates generated by nonstationary fixed-point processes of the form~\eqref{eqn:xi_fp_iteration_dependent}.  % chktex 10
