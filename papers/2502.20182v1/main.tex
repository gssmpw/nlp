\begin{abstract}
It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its {\em{balanced separator number}}: the smallest integer $k$ such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.

As the first result, we prove that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits balanced separators coverable by $k$ balls of radius $r$, then $G$ also admits tree decompositions ${\cal T}_1$ and ${\cal T}_2$ such that:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item in ${\cal T}_1$, every bag can be covered by $\Oh(k\log n)$ balls of radius $r$; and
    \item in ${\cal T}_2$, every bag can be covered by $\Oh(k^2\log k)$ balls of radius $r(\log k+\log\log n+\Oh(1))$.
\end{itemize}
As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that $G$ has doubling dimension at most $m$, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting. Precisely, we prove that for a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ of doubling dimension at most $m$, the following conditions are equivalent, with constants $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,\Delta_3,\Delta_4$ depending on each other and on $m$:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item $G$ admits balanced separators consisting of $k_1$ balls of radius $r$;
    \item $G$ has a tree decomposition with bags coverable by $k_2$ balls of radius $r$;
    \item $G$ has a tree-partition of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_3$ with bags coverable by $k_3$ balls of radius~$r$;
    \item $G$ is quasi-isometric to a graph of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_4$ and tree-partition~width $\leq k_4$.
\end{itemize}
