% more LVLMs
% limited compute, various scales
% more images, western centric
Our work faces three primary limitations. First, although a vast number of LVLMs exist, we selected a representative subset based on key criteria. Specifically, the LVLMs in our study (Qwen2-VL and InternVL, with the exception of Centurio) span a range of parameter counts typical of LLMs. Additionally, we include GPT-4o-mini in the full evaluation and GPT-4o on the subsampled language tiers. Evaluating MVL-SIB across all four tasks \its, \sti, \tts, and \stt (cf. \S\ref{sec:tasks}) at various $k \in \{1,3,5\}$   over 205 languages (i.e., evaluations per model and task, or $2050$, in sum per model) becomes computationally intractable.  This accumulates to $3 \times 205 = 615$ evaluations per model ($205$ for \tts as only $k{=}1$ reference topic exists) or $3 \times 205 + 205 = 2050$ evaluations in total. We therefore both provide subsets of the language tiers to evaluate on and demonstrate that evaluation only requires 1K instances to reliably estimate task performance.
Second, while we strove to choose a diverse set of images to capture the full semantic range of each topic, further diversification is possible by sourcing additional images. However, due to the limited availability of openly licensed images, some topics (e.g., \texttt{politics} and \texttt{entertainment}) are represented predominantly by images that embody the topic in a more Western-centric cultural context. Hand-selecting images by topic for each language or, more broadly, cultural groups would not scale to 205 languages and would hinder the comparability of results. Our results furthermore confirm that models just as well perform on a broad range of languages spanning diverse cultural backgrounds as on English (cf. Figure \ref{fig:intro-img2sent}). At the same time, LVLMs perform best on Western-centric images, mitigating any variation that would originate from using more culture-specific images.
Finally, for the topic \texttt{geography}, we manually selected images that are representative within the context of SIB, as the broader definition of geography is too diffuse to capture visually.
