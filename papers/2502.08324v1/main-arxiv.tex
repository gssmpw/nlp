\section{Introduction}

The structure of supplementary material is as follows:
Section \ref{sec:data_gen} illustrates the generation process of a problem instance.
Section~\ref{sec:centralised_appr} describes an integer linear-programming formulation of the problem, useful to compute optimal solutions in a centralised way, as a benchmark for decentralised approaches.
Section \ref{sec:suppl_dsa} shows the effect of the activation probability $\alpha$ by running experiments with $\alpha=1$, $0.9$ and $0.7$.

Recall from the main text that an instance of dec-rtRTMP can be compactly represented as a pair of graphs $(\mathcal{G}_I, \mathcal{G}_C)$ where $\mathcal{G}_I = (\mathcal{V}_I, \mathcal{E}_I)$ is the \emph{interaction graph}, i.e. a graph whose nodes $\mathcal{V}_I$ are agents and links $\mathcal{E}_I$ represents neighbouring agents, and $\mathcal{G}_C = (\mathcal{V}_C, \mathcal{E}_C)$ is the constraint graph, i.e. a $n$-partite graph whose nodes $\mathcal{V}_C$ are all the possible paths $d \in \bigcup_{D \in \mathfrak{D}} D$ generated by the agents and the links $\mathcal{E}_C$ denote compatible paths. An example of problem instance is reported in Figure \ref{fig:pi_example}.

        \textbf{(A)} Interaction graph $\mathcal{G}_I$.
        \textbf{(B)} Constraint graph $\mathcal{G}_C$.
        \textbf{(C)} Two possible solutions of the problem instance.
        }

%Since a path is an hypothesis formulated by the train about future evolution of railway traffic, from here on we refer to it simply as \emph{hypothesis}.
