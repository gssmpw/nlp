\section{DSA}
\label{sec:suppl_dsa}

We run the DSA algorithm with $\alpha=1, 0.9, 0.7$ and evaluate it performance as in the main text. See Figures \ref{fig:suppl_dsa_ranking}, \ref{fig:suppl_dsa_regret} and \ref{fig:suppl_dsa_convTime}.

    \caption{Ranking of the solutions given by DSA algorithms. Data are grouped by the type of agent, by number of agents $n$ and by minimum number of solutions $n_{sol}$ we require the problem instance to have. Bars with label ``$1$'' represent the fraction of executions that converged to an optimal solution. Bars with label ``$\geq 10$'' represent the fraction of executions that converged to a solution in position greater than 10 in the ranking. Bars with label ``Fail'' represent the fraction of executions that exceeded the upper bound of $10^5$ iterations.}

    Bottom: Average convergence rate to a top-3 solution.}

    \caption{Distribution of convergence times (in terms of number of iterations) per type of agent on problem instances grouped by number of agents $n$ and by minimum number of solutions $n_{sol}$ we require the problem instance to have. For each of the 100 problem instances characterised by $n$ and $n_{sol}$, we performed $100$ executions of DSA algorithm for each agent type. Each execution has an upper bound of $10^5$ iterations, beyond which it fails.}
