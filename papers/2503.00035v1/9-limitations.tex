\section*{Limitations}

Despite the effectiveness of EAC, our current studies still have limitations.
Firstly, similar to previous model editing research, we focus on factual knowledge assessment. However, it is also important to investigate whether editing other types of knowledge will affect general abilities and whether EAC is effective in this situation.
Secondly, our work focuses on sequential editing, where one fact is edited at a time. However, in real-world applications, we may need to change multiple facts in a single edit. Therefore, to enhance the scalability of model editing, batch-sequential settings should be emphasized in future studies.
Finally, to more fully validate the effectiveness of EAC, experiments should be conducted on larger-size models and across more downstream tasks.
