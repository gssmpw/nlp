\section{Conclusion}

This paper focuses on sequential model editing. Statistical and visual analyses reveal that each edit not only updates the desired fact but also introduces non-trivial noise, causing the model to deviate from its original semantic space. The accumulation of this noise negatively impacts the general abilities of LLMs.
To address this issue, a framework termed \textbf{E}diting \textbf{A}nchor \textbf{C}ompression (EAC) is proposed, which constrains edited matrix deviation by reducing the update matrix norm.
Experimental results show that EAC can effectively preserve the general abilities of edited models and the accuracy of editing facts in sequential editing.
For future work, we aim to investigate the impact of complex edits and integrate EAC with other editing methods.
