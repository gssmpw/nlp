\section{Conclusion}

This work addresses the pressing need for enhanced security in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. We investigate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to smart contract vulnerability detection and repair, focusing on Solidity and Move. We introduce \textbf{Smartify}, a novel multi-agent framework that significantly improves LLM performance in this critical domain. The contributions of this work are: (1) \textbf{Smartify}, a novel multi-agent framework that enhances LLM-based smart contract vulnerability detection and repair; (2) a method for encoding language-specific knowledge, valuable for low-resource languages like Move; (3) a scalable, adaptable approach applicable to other programming languages and LLMs; (4) a demonstration of Smartifyâ€™s efficacy on generalized pre-trained LLMs; and (5) a detailed analysis of the challenges inherent in automated code repair.

\textbf{Smartify} represents a significant advancement in automating smart contract security, a crucial concern in the expanding blockchain landscape. Future work will refine the framework, expand its language coverage, particularly within the blockchain domain, and integrate it into real-world blockchain development workflows. This research lays the foundation for AI-powered tools that can bolster the security and reliability of decentralized applications, fostering a more robust and trustworthy blockchain ecosystem.
