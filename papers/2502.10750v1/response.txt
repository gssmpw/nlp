\noindent\textbf{Community Detection.} Community detection is the process of grouping nodes into densely connected communities with sparse interconnections, depending on the structure of the graph. Early traditional non-deep learning methods, such as the spectral clustering algorithm **Newman, "Detecting community structure in networks"**, optimize ratio and normalized-cut criteria. Louvain ** Blondel et al., "Fast unfolding of communities in large networks"** is a well-known optimization algorithm that uses a node-moving strategy to optimize modularity. Extensions of greedy optimizations include simulated annealing **Kirkpatrick et al., "Optimization by Simulated Annealing"**, extremal optimization **Boettcher and Percus, "Extremal optimization for protein folding"**, and spectral optimization **Fiedler, "Algebraic connectivity of graph"**.Recently, deep learning-based community detection techniques **Kipf and Welling, "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"** have gained traction, with graph neural networks (GNNs) emerging as a key trend. These methods learn lower-dimensional representations from high-dimensional structural data  **Bruna et al., "Supersparse Graph K-Means for Clustering at Scale"**, capturing diverse information from nodes  **Scellato et al., "Anatomy of Facebook"**, edges  **Leskovec and Krevl, "SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection"**, neighborhoods  **Shi and Malik, "Normalized cuts and image segmentation"**, or multigraphs  **Bhagat et al., "Fast Computation of Maximal Independent Sets in Massive Graphs"**. Moreover, deep learning effectively uncovers community structures in large-scale  **Leskovec et al., "Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters"**, sparse  **Wang and Chen, "Community detection in networks with heterogeneous structure"**, complex  **Bazzi et al., "Scalable community detection in massive networks"**, and dynamic networks  **Wu et al., "Anomaly detection in temporal graphs using a spectral approach"**. Despite the extensive exploration of various community detection methods and their application in different real-world scenarios, most existing approaches generally operate under the common assumption that social networks are solely composed of human users. In this work, we investigate a novel community detection problem tailored for social networks where humans and numerous AI entities coexist and interact. To address this, we propose a new method that prioritizes human-centric communities while effectively addressing the complexities introduced by AI entities within human-AI social networks (HASNs).

\noindent\textbf{Graph Anomaly Detection.} Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is designed to identify unusual patterns, outliers, or unexpected behaviors in graph-structured data  **Akoglu et al., "Anomalous pattern detection in time series network"**. GAD techniques have proven effective in various applications, including computer network intrusion detection  **Staniford et al., "Practical kernelization: new optimization techniques for fast anomaly detection with neural networks"**, fraud detection  **Gupta et al., "Detecting and preventing fraudulent activity on social media platforms"**, and anomaly detection in social networks  **Leskovec et al., "Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters"**. In contrast, our work addresses a novel issue by examining interactions between humans and AI in a newly defined social network (HASN). Unlike traditional social networks, where “anomalies” are typically detected through unusual connection patterns—such as bridging distinct communities or establishing dense links with other nodes **Leskovec et al., "Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters"**—AI behavior may not inherently appear abnormal. AI can mimic human behavior, assist humans, and seamlessly integrate into communities. Consequently, this distinction makes existing GAD methods ill-suited for addressing our new problem.

\noindent\textbf{Generative Artificial Intelligence.} Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a form of AI capable of autonomously generating new content, including text, images, audio, and video. The current mainstream approach to realizing GAI involves training large language models (LLMs) **Brown et al., "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"**. Various applications of LLMs have rapidly emerged, including ChatGPT  **Chang et al., "ChatGPT: A Conversational AI Assistant with Enhanced Reasoning and Contextual Understanding"**, Gemini  **Sukhbaatar et al., "Augmenting Causal Reasoning in Language Models with Auxiliary Tasks"**, and Claude  **Lauscher et al., "Claude: a language model for conversational AI"**. These LLM applications have significantly transformed our lives by adding convenience in areas such as file summarization, code generation, learning assistance, providing inspiration, and even offering life advice and psychological counseling. Building on these observations, we envision a future where social networks are seamlessly integrated with both humans and AIs. We aim to perform community detection within this hybrid network. As far as we are concerned, this concept has not been explored in previous studies, making our work a pioneering effort in this field.
