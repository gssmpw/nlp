\section{Related Work}
\textbf{LLMs for Code Generation} LLMs have shown exceptional code understanding abilities due to extensive pre-training on code-related corpora. Numerous models like GPT-4o~\cite{gpt4o-blog}, Gemini~\cite{gemini-blog}, Claude-3.5~\cite{claude3p5-blog}, Qwen2.5-Coder~\cite{hui2024qwen2}, and DeepSeek-Coder~\cite{guo2024deepseek} exhibit strong performance on code generation benchmarks. Recently, the release of OpenAI o1~\cite{o1-blog} and DeepSeek-R1~\cite{2025deepseekr1} has spurred a surge in research on deep reasoning LLMs, achieving expert-level performance on competitive programming problems (e.g., CodeForces) and further advancing LLMs in the code domain.

The original data $(x, y)$ is replaced with new data and all the new data form a new dataset $D_{t+1}$. \textbf{(4) Training}: The new model $M_{t+1}$ is fine-tuned using $D_{t+1}$.}

\textbf{Distillation-based Code Fine-Tuning} 
Unlike proprietary models, many studies focus on fine-tuning open-source code pre-trained models, which has greatly contributed to the rapid development of the code generation field. A key technique for achieving this is distilling data from teacher models. Code Alpaca~\cite{codealpaca} introduces Self-Instruct~\cite{wang-etal-2023-self-instruct} to distill GPT-3. Following this, WizardCoder~\cite{luo2024wizardcoder} evolves more complex code instruction data using Evol-Instruct~\cite{xu2024wizardlm}. MagiCoder~\cite{wei2024magicoder} proposes OSS-Instruct, where the model generates instructions and code responses sequentially based on open-source code snippets, thus creating more practical code data. In contrast to OSS-Instruct, InverseCoder~\cite{wu2024inversecoders} reverses the order of instruction and code response generation. WaveCoder~\cite{yu-etal-2024-wavecoder} constructs a multi-task code dataset, enhancing the model's versatility. Besides, OpenCodeInterpreter~\cite{zheng-etal-2024-opencodeinterpreter} builds multi-turn code data, enabling the model to learn from execution feedback and human feedback. However, these methods aim to enable the model to learn by imitating the teacher, overlooking the potential for refinement through self-generated code.
%Additionally, EpiCoder extracts features from code snippets using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), further enhancing code diversity.




\textbf{Iterative Self-Refinement of LLMs} 
Iterative self-refinement refers to LLMs enhancing themselves iteratively by utilizing self-generated responses with the help of external signals. 
One line of research~\cite{huang-etal-2023-large,madaan2023selfrefine,hu-etal-2024-teaching} focuses on enabling self-correction during the inference stage by iteratively calling LLMs and incorporating external signals. In the code domain, CodeT~\cite{chen2023codet}, Self-Debugging~\cite{chen2024teaching}, and LDB~\cite{zhong-etal-2024-debug} follow this approach. However, these prompt engineering methods with external feedback cannot improve the intrinsic capabilities. Another line of research focuses on iteratively training the model using self-generated outputs to enhance its intrinsic capabilities~\cite{dong2024self,yuan2024selfrewarding,kim2025spread}. These methods typically rely on preference learning, such as DPO~\cite{rafailov2023direct}. CodeLutra~\cite{tao2024codelutra} has successfully applied this approach to the code domain, but it heavily depends on golden labels, which limits its applicability. In contrast to the works above, we propose the ACR method, which achieves iterative self-refinement by only using a simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss. This approach is orthogonal to prompt engineering methods like Self-Debugging and is more efficient and generalizable than CodeLutra.
