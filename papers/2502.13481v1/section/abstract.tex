% LLM4Tag: Automatic Extreme Tag Generation Framework inIndustrial Application via Large Language Models

Tagging systems play an essential role in various information retrieval applications such as search engines and recommender systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.
