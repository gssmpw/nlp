\section{conclusion}
In this work, we propose an automatic tagging system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) named LLM4Tag with three key modules, characterized by completeness, continuous knowledge evolution, and quantifiability. Firstly, the graph-based tag recall module is designed to construct a small-scale relevant, comprehensive candidate tag set from a massive tag repository. Next, the knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is proposed to generate accurate tags with knowledge injection. Finally, the tag confidence calibration module is employed to generate reliable confidence tag scores. The significant improvements in offline evaluations have demonstrated its superiority and  LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging.
