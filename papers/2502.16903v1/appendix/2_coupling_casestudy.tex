Figure \ref{fig:casestudy2} shows one of the key considerations we make in constructing the harmful question dataset, namely to remove the questions that couple scenarios with harmful goals, and to stop using keywords such as \emph{illegally} to construct simple illegal contexts.

The emergence of these questions mostly stems from dual-use goals, where the knowledge required may be dangerous but appears legitimate in certain controlled scenario assumptions. Therefore, the harmful questions included in our dataset do not use these tricks and also minimize the questions derived from dual-use goals.
