\caption{Alpaca evaluation results. The conventional approach which selects the response with the highest reward as the chosen response and the response with the lowest reward as the rejected response for DPO fails to improve the performance of models when we increase the number of samples. The x-axis represents the number of samples, while the y-axis shows the score (\%).}
