\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we developed a statistical inference method to quantify the reliability of detected CP locations in the frequency domain. 
%
Our proposed framework contributes to various fields where time-frequency analysis is widely employed, such as condition monitoring of machine systems using vibration, electrical, and acoustic signals, and medical diagnosis based on biosignals.
%
We conducted comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. 
%
The results theoretically confirmed that our method provided an unbiased evaluation based on SI framework and demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing mothods.
%
As future works, we will extend our method to the case of multi-dimensional sequences. 
%
For instance, analyzing different types of time series obtained from multiple sensors would reveal anomalies unattainable through the univariate approach, and reliability guarantee for the detections also provide a valuable future contribution.
