Qualitative results on \scannet: We compare our method with prior SOTA~\cite{huang2023neural} and Ours~(Minkowski)~\cite{choy20194d} that is more comparable as it only differs from ours in the backbone. Our method achieves reconstruction of similar quality to the SOTA. It also \textit{significantly} outperforms Ours~(Minkowski), highlighting the importance of point-based methods.
