\section{Conclusions}
Voxel-based data structures dominate surface reconstruction for large scale point clouds due to their superior time efficiency.
Despite its dominance, voxelization, which collapses multiple points within a cube into a single voxel feature, causes significant information loss, leading to degraded performance in the task of surface reconstruction.
In this work, we propose an efficient \textit{point-based} framework that allows us to use the original point cloud, hence not incurring in any information loss.
The key idea is point cloud serialization, inspired by recent efficient point transformers~\cite{wu2024point, wang2023octformer}, \at{coupled with a simple point-cloud architecture for feature aggregation.}
We show that our method outperforms prior SOTA in both accuracy and time efficiency, enabling point-based representation for surface reconstruction from large scale point clouds.  

\paragraph{Future works}
We would like to explore better strategies for combining the optimal KNN and fast approximate neighborhood function, as this strategy should ideally be adaptive to point cloud size.
We would also be interested in exploring generative modeling of large scale point clouds using these methods.
