{{\bf Overview}}: We map a sparse input point cloud with a point cloud backbone~\cite{wu2024point} into a point feature hierarchy, from which we compute the signed distance of a query.
At each level, we utilize the efficient procedure defined in~\Cref{sec:neighbor_func} to retrieve local neighborhoods of the query. 
We then compute per-level features with the aggregation module defined in~\Cref{sec:aggregation}.
At last, we sum per-level features and convert it into the signed distance with an MLP.
