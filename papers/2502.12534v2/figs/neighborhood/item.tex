    \textbf{Neighborhood function} -- (left) retrieving a local neighborhood with K-nearest neighbor(KNN) or ball-query methods is challenging to implement efficiently on GPU hardware.
    (right) we propose to retrieve a neighborhood from a 1-D ordered list, by serializing points along a Hibert curve~\cite{hilbert1935stetige}, and excluding the impact of points distant from the query~(i.e. remove false positives).
