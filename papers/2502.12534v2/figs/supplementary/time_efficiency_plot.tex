\caption{{\bf Impact of point cloud size on time efficiency} We observe that K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) is more efficient than neighbors based on serialization encoding when the number of points is smaller than 25000. We suspect this is because KNN is highly optimized with a CUDA implementation, while the serialization encoding is purely based on Python.}
