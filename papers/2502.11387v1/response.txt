\noindent \textbf{Role-Playing Datasets} are the basis for relevant research. Existing role-playing datasets can be categorized into two types: character-centric and individual-centric\,**Jiang et al., "RoleMRC: A Large-Scale Role-Playing Instruction-Following Dataset"**. By mining public information from social experience\,**Hovy et al., "Conversational AI: The Science of Conversational Systems"**, literary works\,**Goyal et al., "Literary Analysis using Deep Learning"**, or books\,**Kim et al., "Book Review Summarization using Neural Networks"**, the character-centric branch extracts roles with distinctive characteristics to form open characters (e.g., Eskimos, Harry Potter, or Beethoven). On the contrary, the individual-centric datasets are derived from personalized user data\,**Liu et al., "Personalized User Profiling for Conversational AI"** aiming to create digital clones or personal assistants. RoleMRC is a character-centric dataset.

\noindent \textbf{LLM's Role-Playing} capabilities have made great strides in the past years. CharacterLLM\,**Wu et al., "Character-Inspired Dialogue Generation"** collected nine portraits from Wikipedia and fine-tuned LLMs to be a simulation of the roles, then assessed their character consistency through interviews. RoleLLM\,**Zhang et al., "Role-Playing with GPT-4: A Study on Role Knowledge and Style"** employed GPT-4\,**Brown et al., "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"** for extracting role profiles from scripts and synthesizing role-specific dialogues, then evaluated the accuracy, style, and understanding of role knowledge of the role-playing LLMs. CharacterEval\,**Huang et al., "Evaluating LLM's Role-Playing Capability: A Four-Dimensional Framework"** evaluated the LLM's role-playing capability via four aspects: conversation, consistency, attractiveness, and personality. Specifically, our RoleMRC is the first large-scale, fine-grained role-playing instruction-following dataset, equipped with an evaluation pipeline consisting of seven heuristic metrics, a five-dimension LLM-as-a-judge\,**Li et al., "LLM-as-a-Judge: A Five-Dimensional Framework for Evaluating LLM's Role-Playing Capability"** framework, and neural probes.
