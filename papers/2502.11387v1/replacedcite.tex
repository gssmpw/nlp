\noindent \textbf{Role-Playing Datasets} are the basis for relevant research. Existing role-playing datasets can be categorized into two types: character-centric and individual-centric\,____. By mining public information from social experience\,____, literary works\,____, or books\,____, the character-centric branch extracts roles with distinctive characteristics to form open characters (e.g., Eskimos, Harry Potter, or Beethoven). On the contrary, the individual-centric datasets are derived from personalized user data\,____ aiming to create digital clones or personal assistants. RoleMRC is a character-centric dataset.

\noindent \textbf{LLM's Role-Playing} capabilities have made great strides in the past years. CharacterLLM\,____ collected nine portraits from Wikipedia and fine-tuned LLMs to be a simulation of the roles, then assessed their character consistency through interviews. RoleLLM\,____ employed GPT-4\,____ for extracting role profiles from scripts and synthesizing role-specific dialogues, then evaluated the accuracy, style, and understanding of role knowledge of the role-playing LLMs. CharacterEval\,____ evaluated the LLM's role-playing capability via four aspects: conversation, consistency, attractiveness, and personality. Specifically, our RoleMRC is the first large-scale, fine-grained role-playing instruction-following dataset, equipped with an evaluation pipeline consisting of seven heuristic metrics, a five-dimension LLM-as-a-judge\,____ framework, and neural probes.
