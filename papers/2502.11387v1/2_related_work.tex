\noindent \textbf{Role-Playing Datasets} are the basis for relevant research. Existing role-playing datasets can be categorized into two types: character-centric and individual-centric\,\cite{chen2024persona}. By mining public information from social experience\,\cite{shao2023character,shen2023roleeval,lu-etal-2024-large,dai2024mmrole}, literary works\,\cite{li2023chatharuhi}, or books\,\cite{zhou2023characterglm,chen2024roleinteract,chen-etal-2023-large}, the character-centric branch extracts roles with distinctive characteristics to form open characters (e.g., Eskimos, Harry Potter, or Beethoven). On the contrary, the individual-centric datasets are derived from personalized user data\,\cite{li2021dialogue,ahn-etal-2023-mpchat,agrawal-etal-2023-multimodal,gao-etal-2023-livechat} aiming to create digital clones or personal assistants. RoleMRC is a character-centric dataset.

\noindent \textbf{LLM's Role-Playing} capabilities have made great strides in the past years. CharacterLLM\,\cite{shao2023character} collected nine portraits from Wikipedia and fine-tuned LLMs to be a simulation of the roles, then assessed their character consistency through interviews. RoleLLM\,\cite{wang2023rolellm} employed GPT-4\,\cite{openai2023gpt4} for extracting role profiles from scripts and synthesizing role-specific dialogues, then evaluated the accuracy, style, and understanding of role knowledge of the role-playing LLMs. CharacterEval\,\cite{tu2024charactereval} evaluated the LLM's role-playing capability via four aspects: conversation, consistency, attractiveness, and personality. Specifically, our RoleMRC is the first large-scale, fine-grained role-playing instruction-following dataset, equipped with an evaluation pipeline consisting of seven heuristic metrics, a five-dimension LLM-as-a-judge\,\cite{zheng2024judging} framework, and neural probes.
