Considering the advancements of state understanding and the corresponding decision-making capabilities, we propose a novel pipeline, VDT-Auto, where the state information is encoded geometrically and contextually, conditioning a diffusion Transformer-based action generation. In this paper, we demonstrate the methodology of using powerful VLM such as Qwen2-VL to bridge states and conditions, as well as the connections between conditions and actions via a diffusion policy. The verification of our VDT-Auto was performed using nuScenes open-loop planning evaluation, where our VDT-Auto achieved $0.52$ m on average L2 errors and $21\%$ on average collision rate. In addition, on a real-world driving dataset, our VDT-Auto shows its promising generalizability. \par During our development, we discovered that the distribution of training data had varying influences on the different parts of our VDT-Auto due to the model scales of the VLM and the diffusion model-based network. Therefore, with sufficient computational resources, an end-to-end training approach should be developed to mitigate the influence of data distribution. In our future work, with an end-to-end training pipeline, VDT-Auto will be targeting towards more complex traffic scenarios and a close-loop evaluation. Owing to the rapid evolution of VLMs and robotic policy, VDT-Auto is able to contribute as a cornerstone case in data-driven policy learning tasks.
