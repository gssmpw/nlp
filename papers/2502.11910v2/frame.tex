% ========== What does realigned incentives mean? ======

% --> Not trying to solve the full problem at once (e.g., jailbreaking alignment, which includes a full pipeline of steps, vs constructing better optimization algorithms) --> Currently ppl do that because jailbreaking models is taken as the most relevant progress
% Not focussing on direct progress but thorough evaluations, principled ideas, new insights 
% Valuing academic principles, such as reproducibility, comparability over apparent real-world relevance (e.g., performing attacks on the newest proprietary model)
% Adjusting the role that academia plays in this context in combination with industry. --> large scale experiments are predominantly performed by industry/big research labs. Capability advancements are done by industry, Academia played an important role in the past in proof of concepting new ideas / grassroot research 


% Maybe incentives will realign automatically because industry actually wants to solve the problem

% If you reduce complexity you also loose real world comparably



\begin{abstract}
Misaligned research objectives have considerably hindered progress in adversarial robustness research over the past decade.
For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field.
In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that \textbf{realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment.}
To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs.
Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability.
Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.

\section*{Impact Statement}
Adversarial attacks on LLMs can have considerable consequences in real-world applications. Still, as machine-learning robustness has been an unsolved research problem for the last decade, we believe that the best way to approach this problem is through culminating awareness. Currently, it seems unlikely that the robustness issue can be completely resolved through technical means. Thus, making people aware of the harmful use cases and limitations of these models appears to be necessary to avoid irresponsible deployment of such models for critical applications and to reduce the harm malicious actors can cause. Moreover, this work does not introduce new technical innovations. Instead, it addresses impediments in robustness research and explores potential solutions to accelerate research progress.
