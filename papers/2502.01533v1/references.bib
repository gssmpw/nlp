However, stochastic neural networks rarely use categorical latent variables due to the inability to backpropagate through samples. In this work, we present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the non-differentiable sample from a categorical distribution with a differentiable sample from a novel Gumbel-Softmax distribution. This distribution has the essential property that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution. We show that our Gumbel-Softmax estimator outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks with categorical latent variables, and enables large speedups on semi-supervised classification.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06899v1},
	abstract = {Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous approximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity with respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute efficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained language models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive corrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly accurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks, and for each query, compute the top-\$k\$ scores with respect to the keys. Our approach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input size, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is a drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any corrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings in the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value framework. We evaluate the quality of top-\$k\$ approximation for multi-head attention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers of T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to accuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups including training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.},

We find this behavior to be consistent across three Transformer architectures (BERT, ALBERT, XLNet) and two distinct protein datasets.

	abstract = {The versatile binding properties of antibodies have made them an extremely important class of biotherapeutics. However, therapeutic antibody development is a complex, expensive and time-consuming task, with the final antibody needing to not only have strong and specific binding, but also be minimally impacted by any developability issues. The success of transformer-based language models in protein sequence space and the availability of vast amounts of antibody sequences, has led to the development of many antibody-specific language models to help guide antibody discovery and design. Antibody diversity primarily arises from V(D)J recombination, mutations within the CDRs, and/or from a small number of mutations away from the germline outside the CDRs. Consequently, a significant portion of the variable domain of all natural antibody sequences remains germline. This affects the pre-training of antibody-specific language models, where this facet of the sequence data introduces a prevailing bias towards germline residues. This poses a challenge, as mutations away from the germline are often vital for generating specific and potent binding to a target, meaning that language models need be able to suggest key mutations away from germline.
In this study, we explore the implications of the germline bias, examining its impact on both general-protein and antibody-specific language models. We develop and train a series of new antibody-specific language models optimised for predicting non-germline residues. We then compare our final model, AbLang-2, with current models and show how it suggests a diverse set of valid mutations with high cumulative probability. AbLang-2 is trained on both unpaired and paired data, and is freely available (https://github.com/oxpig/AbLang2.git).},

We analyse pairs of positions with correlated mutations in 67 protein families and show quantitatively that the presence of such positions is a typical feature of protein families. A significant but weak tendency is observed for correlated residue pairs to be close in the three-dimensional structure. With further improvements, methods of this type may be useful for the prediction of residue-residue contacts and subsequent prediction of protein structure using distance geometry algorithms. In conclusion, we suggest a new experimental approach to protein structure determination in which selection of functional mutants after random mutagenesis and analysis of correlated mutations provide sufficient proximity constraints for calculation of the protein fold},

	abstract = {The state-of-the-art to assess the structural quality of docking models is currently based on three related yet independent quality measures: Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS as proposed and standardized by CAPRI. These quality measures quantify different aspects of the quality of a particular docking model and need to be viewed together to reveal the true quality, e.g. a model with relatively poor LRMS ({\textgreater}10Å) might still qualify as 'acceptable' with a descent Fnat ({\textgreater}0.50) and iRMS ({\textless}3.0Å). This is also the reason why the so called CAPRI criteria for assessing the quality of docking models is defined by applying various ad-hoc cutoffs on these measures to classify a docking model into the four classes: Incorrect, Acceptable, Medium, or High quality. This classification has been useful in CAPRI, but since models are grouped in only four bins it is also rather limiting, making it difficult to rank models, correlate with scoring functions or use it as target function in machine learning algorithms. Here, we present DockQ, a continuous protein-protein docking model quality measure derived by combining Fnat, LRMS, and iRMS to a single score in the range [0, 1] that can be used to assess the quality of protein docking models. By using DockQ on CAPRI models it is possible to almost completely reproduce the original CAPRI classification into Incorrect, Acceptable, Medium and High quality. An average PPV of 94\% at 90\% Recall demonstrating that there is no need to apply predefined ad-hoc cutoffs to classify docking models. Since DockQ recapitulates the CAPRI classification almost perfectly, it can be viewed as a higher resolution version of the CAPRI classification, making it possible to estimate model quality in a more quantitative way using Z-scores or sum of top ranked models, which has been so valuable for the CASP community. The possibility to directly correlate a quality measure to a scoring function has been crucial for the development of scoring functions for protein structure prediction, and DockQ should be useful in a similar development in the protein docking field.

The development of robust and reproducible methods for detecting viruses in the environment aids in the tracking and reduction of pathogen transmission. We detected ToBRFV in municipal wastewater influent (WWI) samples, likely due to its presence in human waste, demonstrating a widespread distribution of ToBRFV in WWI throughout Ontario, Canada. To aid in global ToBRFV surveillance efforts, we developed a tiled amplicon approach to sequence and track the evolution of ToBRFV genomes in municipal WWI. Our assay recovers 95.7\% of the 6393 bp ToBRFV RefSeq genome, omitting the terminal 5′ and 3′ ends. We demonstrate that our sequencing assay is a robust, sensitive, and highly specific method for recovering ToBRFV genomes.

In addition to estimating the relative case numbers using quantitative PCR, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA can be extracted from wastewater and sequenced. There are many existing techniques for using the sequenced RNA to determine the relative abundance of known lineages in a sample. However, it is very challenging to predict novel lineages from wastewater data due to its mixed composition and unreliable genomic coverage. In this work, we present a novel technique based on non-negative matrix factorization which is able to reconstruct lineage definitions by analyzing data from across different samples. We test the method both on synthetic and real wastewater sequencing data. We show that the technique is able to determine major lineages such as Omicron and Delta as well as sub-lineages such as BA.5.2.1. We provide a method for determining emerging lineages in wastewater without the need for genomic data from clinical samples. This could be used for routine monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other emerging viral pathogens in wastewater. Additionally, it may be used to determine more full-genome sequences for viruses with fewer available genomes.},

	abstract = {Here, we compare the distributions of main chain (Φ,Ψ) angles (i.e., Ramachandran maps) of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids in three contexts: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Gly-Gly-X-Gly-Gly pentapeptides in water at 298 K with exhaustive sampling, where X = the amino acid in question; (ii) 188 independent protein simulations in water at 298 K from our Dynameomics Project; and (iii) static crystal and NMR structures from the Protein Data Bank. The GGXGG peptide series is often used as a model of the unstructured denatured state of proteins. The sampling in the peptide MD simulations is neither random nor uniform. Instead, individual amino acids show preferences for particular conformations, but the peptide is dynamic, and interconversion between conformers is facile. For a given amino acid, the (Φ,Ψ) distributions in the protein simulations and the Protein Data Bank are very similar and often distinct from those in the peptide simulations. Comparison between the peptide and protein simulations shows that packing constraints, solvation, and the tendency for particular amino acids to be used for specific structural motifs can overwhelm the “intrinsic propensities” of amino acids for particular (Φ,Ψ) conformations. We also compare our helical propensities with experimental consensus values using the host–guest method, which appear to be determined largely by context and not necessarily the intrinsic conformational propensities of the guest residues. These simulations represent an improved coil library free from contextual effects to better model intrinsic conformational propensities and provide a detailed view of conformations making up the “random coil” state.},

        , Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a structural molecular and cellular biology technique that has experienced major advances in recent years. Technological developments in image recording as well as in processing software make it possible to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of macromolecular assemblies at near-atomic resolution that were formerly obtained only by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In parallel, cryo-electron tomography has also benefitted from these technological advances, so that visualization of irregular complexes, organelles or whole cells with their molecular machines in situ has reached subnanometre resolution. Cryo-EM can therefore address a broad range of biological questions. The aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of the principles and current state of the cryo-EM field.},

These documents often contain extensive functional characterisations of the sets of antibodies they describe. However, leveraging these heterogeneous reports, for example to offer insights into the properties of query antibodies of interest, is currently challenging as there is no central repository through which this wide corpus can be mined by sequence or structure. Here, we present PLAbDab (the Patent and Literature Antibody Database), a self-updating repository containing over 150,000 paired antibody sequences and 3D structural models, of which over 65 000 are unique. We describe the methods used to extract, filter, pair, and model the antibodies in PLAbDab, and showcase how PLAbDab can be searched by sequence, structure, or keyword. PLAbDab uses include annotating query antibodies with potential antigen information from similar entries, analysing structural models of existing antibodies to identify modifications that could improve their properties, and facilitating the compilation of bespoke datasets of antibody sequences/structures that bind to a specific antigen. PLAbDab is freely available via Github (https://github.com/oxpig/PLAbDab) and as a searchable webserver (https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/plabdab/).},

	abstract = {Existing protein machine learning representations typically model either the sequence or structure distribution, with the other modality implicit. The latent space of sequence-to-structure prediction models such as ESMFold represents the joint distribution of sequence and structure; however, we find these embeddings to exhibit massive activations, whereby some channels have values 3000× higher than others, regardless of the input. Further, on continuous compression schemes, ESMFold embeddings can be reduced by a factor of 128× along the channel and 8× along the length, while retaining structure information at {\textless}2Å scale accuracy, and performing competitively on protein function and localization benchmarks. On discrete compression schemes, we construct a tokenized all-atom structure vocabulary that retains high reconstruction accuracy, thus introducing a tokenized representation of all-atom structure that can be obtained from sequence alone. We term this series of embeddings as CHEAP (Compressed Hourglass Embedding Adaptations of Proteins) embeddings, obtained via the HPCT (Hourglass Protein Compression Transformer) architecture. CHEAP is a compact representation of both protein structure and sequence, sheds light on information content asymmetries between sequence and structure, democratizes representations captured by large models, and is designed to have flexible downstream applications such as generation, search, and prediction.},

Our manuscript details subsequent enhancements in data archiving, covering successive releases encompassing model organisms, global health proteomes, Swiss-Prot integration, and a host of curated protein datasets. We detail the data access mechanisms of AlphaFold DB, from direct file access via FTP to advanced queries using Google Cloud Public Datasets and the programmatic access endpoints of the database.

We have added more data on specific organisms and proteins related to global health and expanded to cover almost the complete UniProt database, a primary data resource of protein sequences. We also made it easier for our users to access the data by directly downloading files or using advanced cloud-based tools. Finally, we have also improved how users view and search through these protein structures, making the user experience smoother and more informative.

	abstract = {Learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a distinct area in machine learning, but there has yet to emerge a unifying network architecture that simultaneously leverages the geometric and relational aspects of the problem domain. To address this gap, we introduce geometric vector perceptrons, which extend standard dense layers to operate on collections of Euclidean vectors. Graph neural networks equipped with such layers are able to perform both geometric and relational reasoning on efficient representations of macromolecules. We demonstrate our approach on two important problems in learning from protein structure: model quality assessment and computational protein design. Our approach improves over existing classes of architectures on both problems, including state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks.

	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Since our 2012 article describing Pfam, we have also undertaken a comprehensive review of the features that are provided by Pfam over and above the basic family data. For each feature, we determined the relevance, computational burden, usage statistics and the functionality of the feature in a website context. As a consequence of this review, we have removed some features, enhanced others and developed new ones to meet the changing demands of computational biology. Here, we describe the changes to Pfam content. Notably, we now provide family alignments based on four different representative proteome sequence data sets and a new interactive DNA search interface.

	abstract = {A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through the application of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies. Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40 000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem.We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein–protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting cellular locations.Web server: http://deepgo.bio2vec.net, Source code: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgoSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {To deepen our understanding of graph neural networks, we investigate the representation power of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) through the looking glass of graph moments, a key property of  graph topology encoding path of various lengths.
We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions.
We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules.
Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. 
Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width and deeper GCNs are more capable of learning higher order graph moments. 
Additionally, combining  GCN modules with different propagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs.},

Due to the importance of disulfide bonds in protein folding and structural stability, artificial disulfide bonds are often engineered by cysteine mutation to enhance protein structural stability. To facilitate the experimental design, we implemented a method based on neural networks to predict amino acid pairs for cysteine mutations to form engineered disulfide bonds. The designed neural network was trained with high-resolution structures curated from the Protein Data Bank. The testing results reveal that the proposed method recognizes 99\% of natural disulfide bonds. In the test with engineered disulfide bonds, the algorithm achieves similar accuracy levels with other state-of-the-art algorithms in published dataset and better performance for two comprehensively studied proteins with 70\% accuracy, demonstrating potential applications in protein engineering. The neural network framework allows exploiting the full features in distance space, and therefore improves accuracy of the disulfide bond engineering site prediction.

	abstract = {Protein language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various protein function prediction tasks. However, while protein function is intricately tied to structure, most existing PLMs do not incorporate protein structure information. To address this issue, we introduce ProSST, a Transformer-based protein language model that seamlessly integrates both protein sequences and structures. ProSST incorporates a structure quantization module and a Transformer architecture with disentangled attention. The structure quantization module translates a 3D protein structure into a sequence of discrete tokens by first serializing the protein structure into residue-level local structures and then embeds them into dense vector space. These vectors are then quantized into discrete structure tokens by a pre-trained clustering model. These tokens serve as an effective protein structure representation. Furthermore, ProSST explicitly learns the relationship between protein residue token sequences and structure token sequences through the sequence-structure disentangled attention. We pre-train ProSST on millions of protein structures using a masked language model objective, enabling it to learn comprehensive contextual representations of proteins. To evaluate the proposed ProSST, we conduct extensive experiments on the zero-shot mutation effect prediction and several supervised downstream tasks, where ProSST achieves the state-of-the-art performance among all baselines.

	abstract = {As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve, detecting emerging variants early is critical for public health interventions. Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing and/or sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases1–3. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing4,5. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We developed and deployed improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detected emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identified multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our study provides a scalable solution for wastewater genomic surveillance that allows early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and identification of cryptic transmission.},

	abstract = {The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest emphasizes the need for early detection and epidemiological surveillance of novel variants. We used genomic sequencing of 122 wastewater samples from three locations in Switzerland to monitor the local spread of B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. We devised a bioinformatics method named COJAC (Co-Occurrence adJusted Analysis and Calling) that uses read pairs carrying multiple variant-specific signature mutations as a robust indicator of low-frequency variants. Application of COJAC revealed that a local outbreak of the Alpha variant in two Swiss cities was observable in wastewater up to 13 d before being first reported in clinical samples. We further confirmed the ability of COJAC to detect emerging variants early for the Delta variant by analysing an additional 1,339 wastewater samples. While sequencing data of single wastewater samples provide limited precision for the quantification of relative prevalence of a variant, we show that replicate and close-meshed longitudinal sequencing allow for robust estimation not only of the local prevalence but also of the transmission fitness advantage of any variant. We conclude that genomic sequencing and our computational analysis can provide population-level estimates of prevalence and fitness of emerging variants from wastewater samples earlier and on the basis of substantially fewer samples than from clinical samples. Our framework is being routinely used in large national projects in Switzerland and the UK.},

Many methods have been developed to automatically predict protein functions, but effectively exploiting all the axioms in the GO for knowledge-enhanced learning has remained a challenge. We have developed DeepGO-SE, a method that predicts GO functions from protein sequences using a pretrained large language model. DeepGO-SE generates multiple approximate models of GO, and a neural network predicts the truth values of statements about protein functions in these approximate models. We aggregate the truth values over multiple models so that DeepGO-SE approximates semantic entailment when predicting protein functions. We show, using several benchmarks, that the approach effectively exploits background knowledge in the GO and improves protein function prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) is an important epidemiological and public health tool for tracking pathogens across the scale of a building, neighbourhood, city, or region. WBS gained widespread adoption globally during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for estimating community infection levels by qPCR. Sequencing pathogen genes or genomes from wastewater adds information about pathogen genetic diversity, which can be used to identify viral lineages (including variants of concern) that are circulating in a local population. Capturing the genetic diversity by WBS sequencing is not trivial, as wastewater samples often contain a diverse mixture of viral lineages with real mutations and sequencing errors, which must be deconvoluted computationally from short sequencing reads. In this study we assess nine different computational tools that have recently been developed to address this challenge. We simulated 100 wastewater sequence samples consisting of SARS-CoV-2 BA.1, BA.2, and Delta lineages, in various mixtures, as well as a Delta–Omicron recombinant and a synthetic ‘novel’ lineage. Most tools performed well in identifying the true lineages present and estimating their relative abundances and were generally robust to variation in sequencing depth and read length. While many tools identified lineages present down to 1 \% frequency, results were more reliable above a 5 \% threshold. The presence of an unknown synthetic lineage, which represents an unclassified SARS-CoV-2 lineage, increases the error in relative abundance estimates of other lineages, but the magnitude of this effect was small for most tools. The tools also varied in how they labelled novel synthetic lineages and recombinants. While our simulated dataset represents just one of many possible use cases for these methods, we hope it helps users understand potential sources of error or bias in wastewater sequencing analysis and to appreciate the commonalities and differences across methods.},

	abstract = {We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods’ features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-theart results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a proteinprotein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

	abstract = {The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often be signiﬁcantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming over-conﬁdent and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classiﬁcation, language translation and speech recognition. Despite its widespread use, label smoothing is still poorly understood. Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can signiﬁcantly improve beam-search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective. To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing changes the representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of information in the logits about resemblances between instances of different classes, which is necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization or calibration of the model’s predictions.},

Amino acid exchanges in the spike protein are of particular concern as they can render the virus more transmissible or reduce vaccine efficacy. Here, we conducted whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from the Rhine-Neckar district in Germany during January-March 2021. We detected a total of 166 samples positive for a variant with a distinct mutational pattern in the spike gene comprising L18F, L452R, N501Y, A653V, H655Y, D796Y and G1219V with a later gain of A222V. This variant was designated A.27.RN according to its phylogenetic clade classification. It emerged in parallel with the B.1.1.7 variant, increased to {\textgreater}50\% of all SARS-CoV-2 variants by week five. Subsequently it decreased to {\textless}10\% of all variants by calendar week eight when B.1.1.7 had become the dominant strain. Antibodies induced by BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized A.27.RN but with a two-to-threefold reduced efficacy as compared to the wild-type and B.1.1.7 strains. These observations strongly argue for continuous and comprehensive monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 evolution on a population level.},

	abstract = {Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

	abstract = {Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4\${\textbackslash}times\$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40{\textbackslash}\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2\${\textbackslash}times\$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73{\textbackslash}\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72{\textbackslash}\% model FLOPs utilization).},

	abstract = {The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer.},

	abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

We develop relational language models for protein sequences that directly condition on a graph specification of the  target structure. Our approach efficiently captures the complex dependencies in proteins by focusing on those that are long-range in sequence but local in 3D space. Our framework significantly improves in both speed and robustness over conventional and deep-learning-based methods for structure-based protein sequence design, and takes a step toward rapid and targeted biomolecular design with the aid of deep generative models.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction is a grand challenge. Prediction of protein structures via the representations using backbone dihedral angles has recently achieved significant progress along with the on-going surge of deep neural network (DNN) research in general. However, we observe that in the protein backbone angle prediction research, there is an overall trend to employ more and more complex neural networks and then to throw more and more features to the neural networks. While more features might add more predictive power to the neural network, we argue that redundant features could rather clutter the scenario and more complex neural networks then just could counterbalance the noise. From artificial intelligence and machine learning perspectives, problem representations and solution approaches do mutually interact and thus affect performance. We also argue that comparatively simpler predictors can more easily be reconstructed than the more complex ones. With these arguments in mind, we present a deep learning method named Simpler Angle Predictor (SAP) to train simpler DNN models that enhance protein backbone angle prediction. We then empirically show that SAP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on well-known benchmark datasets: for some types of angles, the differences are above 3 in mean absolute error (MAE). The SAP program along with its data is available from the website https://gitlab.com/mahnewton/sap.},

	abstract = {Invariance and equivariance to the rotation group have been widely discussed in the 3D deep learning community for pointclouds. Yet most proposed methods either use complex mathematical tools that may limit their accessibility, or are tied to specific input data types and network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuron representations for creating SO(3)-equivariant neural networks for pointcloud processing. Extending neurons from 1D scalars to 3D vectors, our vector neurons enable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing a framework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- including linear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to their simplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them to process geometry inputs in arbitrary poses. Despite its simplicity, our method performs comparably well in accuracy and generalization with other more complex and specialized state-of-the-art methods on classification and segmentation tasks. We also show for the first time a rotation equivariant reconstruction network.},

However, they are limited to small degrees of equivariant representations due to their computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate whether these architectures can scale well to higher degrees. Starting from Equiformer, we first replace \$SO(3)\$ convolutions with eSCN convolutions to efficiently incorporate higher-degree tensors. Then, to better leverage the power of higher degrees, we propose three architectural improvements -- attention re-normalization, separable \$S{\textasciicircum}2\$ activation and separable layer normalization. Putting this all together, we propose EquiformerV2, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on large-scale OC20 dataset by up to \$9{\textbackslash}\%\$ on forces, \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$ on energies, offers better speed-accuracy trade-offs, and \$2{\textbackslash}times\$ reduction in DFT calculations needed for computing adsorption energies. Additionally, EquiformerV2 trained on only OC22 dataset outperforms GemNet-OC trained on both OC20 and OC22 datasets, achieving much better data efficiency. Finally, we compare EquiformerV2 with Equiformer on QM9 and OC20 S2EF-2M datasets to better understand the performance gain brought by higher degrees.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets.},

In these models, the semantic structure of the dataset emerges from a sequence of transformations between one representation and the next. We characterize the geometric and statistical properties of these representations and how they change as we move through the layers. By analyzing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and neighbor composition, we find that the representations evolve similarly in transformers trained on protein language tasks and image reconstruction tasks. In the first layers, the data manifold expands, becoming high-dimensional, and then contracts significantly in the intermediate layers. In the last part of the model, the ID remains approximately constant or forms a second shallow peak. We show that the semantic information of the dataset is better expressed at the end of the first peak, and this phenomenon can be observed across many models trained on diverse datasets. Based on our findings, we point out an explicit strategy to identify, without supervision, the layers that maximize semantic content: representations at intermediate layers corresponding to a relative minimum of the ID profile are more suitable for downstream learning tasks.},

Meanwhile, protein language models trained on substantial 1D sequences have shown burgeoning capabilities with scale in a broad range of applications. Several preceding studies consider combining these different protein modalities to promote the representation power of geometric neural networks but fail to present a comprehensive understanding of their benefits. In this work, we integrate the knowledge learned by well-trained protein language models into several state-of-the-art geometric networks and evaluate a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including protein-protein interface prediction, model quality assessment, protein-protein rigid-body docking, and binding affinity prediction. Our findings show an overall improvement of 20\% over baselines.

We highlight the advantages of our algorithm compared to standard denoising score matching and implicit score matching, as well as fully learned baselines for a wide range of inverse physics problems.

Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein−protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 Å backbone RMSD).},

It is based on a purely geometric approach and takes advantage of techniques applied in the field of pattern recognition. The algorithm involves an automated procedure including (i) a digital representation of the molecules (derived from atomic coordinates) by three-dimensional discrete functions that distinguishes between the surface and the interior; (ii) the calculation, using Fourier transformation, of a correlation function that assesses the degree of molecular surface overlap and penetration upon relative shifts of the molecules in three dimensions; and (iii) a scan of the relative orientations of the molecules in three dimensions. The algorithm provides a list of correlation values indicating the extent of geometric match between the surfaces of the molecules; each of these values is associated with six numbers describing the relative position (translation and rotation) of the molecules. The procedure is thus equivalent to a six-dimensional search but much faster by design, and the computation time is only moderately dependent on molecular size. The procedure was tested and validated by using five known complexes for which the correct relative position of the molecules in the respective adducts was successfully predicted. The molecular pairs were deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, tRNA synthetase-tyrosinyl adenylate, aspartic proteinase-peptide inhibitor, and trypsin-trypsin inhibitor. A more realistic test was performed with the last two pairs by using the structures of uncomplexed aspartic proteinase and trypsin inhibitor, respectively.

For 13 test systems, docking was performed with the unbound X-ray structures of both the receptor and the ligand.

Our method optimizes desolvation, shape complementarity, and electrostatics using a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. A global search in the rotational and translational space without any knowledge of the binding sites was performed for all proteins except nine antibodies recognizing antigens. For these antibodies, we docked their well-characterized binding site—the complementarity-determining region defined without information of the antigen—to the entire surface of the antigen. For 24 systems, we were able to find near-native ligand orientations (interface Cα root mean square deviation less than 2.5 Å from the crystal complex) among the top 2,000 choices. For three systems, our algorithm could identify the correct complex structure unambiguously. For 13 other complexes, we either ranked a near-native structure in the top 20 or obtained 20 or more near-native structures in the top 2,000 or both. The key feature of our algorithm is the use of target functions that are highly tolerant to conformational changes upon binding.

	abstract = {Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.},

In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM.

	abstract = {The principles of affinity maturation of antibodies (Abs), which underlies B cell-mediated immunity, are still under debate. It is unclear whether the antigen (Ag) binding site is a preferred target for mutations, and what the role of activation-induced deaminase (AID) hotspots is in this process. Here we report a structural analysis of 3495 residues that have been replaced through somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in 196 Abs. We show that there is no correlation between the propensity of an amino acid to be in AID hotspot and the probability that it is replaced during the SHM process. Although AID hotspots may be necessary to enable SHMs, they are not a major driving force in determining which residues are mutated. We identified Ab positions that are highly mutated and significantly affect binding. The effect of mutation on binding energy is a major factor in determining which structural regions of the Ab are mutated. There is a clear preference for mutations at the Ag-binding site. However, positions outside this region that also affect binding are often preferred targets for SHMs. As for amino acid preferences, a general trend during SHM is to make Ab-Ag interfaces more similar to protein-protein interfaces in general. In different regions of the Ab, there are different sets of preferences for amino acid substitution. This mapping improves our understanding of Ab affinity maturation and may assist in Ab engineering.},

	abstract = {In order to produce effective antibodies, B cells undergo rapid somatic hypermutation (SHM) and selection for binding affinity to antigen via a process called affinity maturation. The similarities between this process and evolution by natural selection have led many groups to use phylogenetic methods to characterize the development of immunological memory, vaccination, and other processes that depend on affinity maturation. However, these applications are limited by the fact that most phylogenetic models are designed to be applied to individual lineages comprising genetically diverse sequences, while B cell repertoires often consist of hundreds to thousands of separate low-diversity lineages. Further, several features of affinity maturation violate important assumptions in standard phylogenetic models. Here, we introduce a hierarchical phylogenetic framework that integrates information from all lineages in a repertoire to more precisely estimate model parameters while simultaneously incorporating the unique features of SHM. We demonstrate the power of this repertoire-wide approach by characterizing previously undescribed phenomena in affinity maturation. First, we find evidence consistent with age-related changes in SHM hot-spot targeting. Second, we identify a consistent relationship between increased tree length and signs of increased negative selection, apparent in the repertoires of recently vaccinated subjects and those without any known recent infections or vaccinations. This suggests that B cell lineages shift toward negative selection over time as a general feature of affinity maturation. Our study provides a framework for undertaking repertoire-wide phylogenetic testing of SHM hypotheses and provides a means of characterizing dynamics of mutation and selection during affinity maturation.},

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize nerve growth factor (NGF) have demonstrated analgesic capacity in rodent models, people with osteoarthritis, and dogs with degenerative joint disease. Hypothesis/Objectives This study describes the design and characterization of a fully felinized anti-NGF monoclonal antibody. In vitro potency, pharmacokinetics, and the ability of the antibody to treat pain in a self-resolving, acute inflammation model were investigated in cats. Animals Thirty-eight cats at a research colony at Charles River Laboratories, Ireland. Methods Felinized anti-NGF mAb, NV-02, was produced using a complementary DNA (cDNA)-based method (PETization). Purified NV-02 was tested for affinity, potency, and immunoreactivity in vitro, then for safety and plasma pharmacokinetic distribution in vivo, and analgesic efficacy in a model of kaolin-induced inflammatory pain. Results Anti-NGF mAb, NV-02 neutralized NGF with high affinity and potency and did not bind complement. NV-02-administered SC had a plasma half-life of 7–15 days and was well tolerated at dosages up to 28 mg/kg. A dosage of 2 mg/kg NV-02 SC significantly decreased signs of lameness on day 2 (P = .0027), day 3 (P = .016), day 4, (P = .0063), day 5 (P = .0085), day 6 (P = .0014), and day 7 (P = .0034) after induction of inflammation. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The high affinity, long plasma half-life, safety, and analgesic efficacy of felinized anti-NGF mAb (NV-02) support further investigation of the analgesic potential of this antibody in the cat.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen the development of numerous deep learning-based protein-ligand docking methods. They offer huge promise in terms of speed and accuracy. However, despite claims of state-of-the-art performance in terms of crystallographic root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), upon closer inspection, it has become apparent that they often produce physically implausible molecular structures. It is therefore not sufficient to evaluate these methods solely by RMSD to a native binding mode. It is vital, particularly for deep learning-based methods, that they are also evaluated on steric and energetic criteria. We present PoseBusters, a Python package that performs a series of standard quality checks using the well-established cheminformatics toolkit RDKit. Only methods that both pass these checks and predict native-like binding modes should be classed as having ``state-of-the-art'' performance. We use PoseBusters to compare five deep learning-based docking methods (DeepDock, DiffDock, EquiBind, TankBind, and Uni-Mol) and two well-established standard docking methods (AutoDock Vina and CCDC Gold) with and without an additional post-prediction energy minimisation step using a molecular mechanics force field. We show that both in terms of physical plausibility and the ability to generalise to examples that are distinct from the training data, no deep learning-based method yet outperforms classical docking tools. In addition, we find that molecular mechanics force fields contain docking-relevant physics missing from deep-learning methods. PoseBusters allows practitioners to assess docking and molecular generation methods and may inspire new inductive biases still required to improve deep learning-based methods, which will help drive the development of more accurate and more realistic predictions.},

Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open question. To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another---that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to those of another protein. We built a training dataset, the Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously. We found that these biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on gold-standard data. Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction, the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet). Using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on gold-standard structural data, even when trained on only 3\% of our new dataset.

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

	abstract = {Score-based generative models (SGMs) are a powerful class of generative models that exhibit remarkable empirical performance. Score-based generative modelling (SGM) consists of a ``noising'' stage, whereby a diffusion is used to gradually add Gaussian noise to data, and a generative model, which entails a ``denoising'' process defined by approximating the time-reversal of the diffusion. Existing SGMs assume that data is supported on a Euclidean space, i.e. a manifold with flat geometry. In many domains such as robotics, geoscience or protein modelling, data is often naturally described by distributions living on Riemannian manifolds and current SGM techniques are not appropriate. We introduce here Riemannian Score-based Generative Models (RSGMs), a class of generative models extending SGMs to Riemannian manifolds. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of manifolds, and in particular with earth and climate science spherical data.},

	abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field ({\textbackslash}aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

Our method is the first deep learning-based method that generates antibodies explicitly targeting specific antigen structures and is one of the earliest diffusion probabilistic models for protein structures. The model is a “Swiss Army Knife” capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the quality of both sequences and structures of designed antibodies.

In this paper, we propose a new model called Hierarchical Equivariant Refinement Network (HERN) for paratope docking and design. During docking, HERN employs a hierarchical message passing network to predict atomic forces and use them to refine a binding complex in an iterative, equivariant manner. During generation, its autoregressive decoder progressively docks generated paratopes and builds a geometric representation of the binding interface to guide the next residue choice. Our results show that HERN significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on paratope docking and design benchmarks.},

We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38\% top-1 success rate (RMSD{\textless}2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23\%) and deep learning (20\%) methods. Moreover, while previous methods are not able to dock on computationally folded structures (maximum accuracy 10.4\%), DiffDock maintains significantly higher precision (21.7\%).

The structure of these proteins is critical for understanding their antigen binding properties. Here, we present ImmuneBuilder, a set of deep learning models trained to accurately predict the structure of antibodies (ABodyBuilder2), nanobodies (NanoBodyBuilder2) and T-Cell receptors (TCRBuilder2). We show that ImmuneBuilder generates structures with state of the art accuracy while being far faster than AlphaFold2. For example, on a benchmark of 34 recently solved antibodies, ABodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an RMSD of 2.81Å, a 0.09Å improvement over AlphaFold-Multimer, while being over a hundred times faster. Similar results are also achieved for nanobodies, (NanoBodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an average RMSD of 2.89Å, a 0.55Å improvement over AlphaFold2) and TCRs. By predicting an ensemble of structures, ImmuneBuilder also gives an error estimate for every residue in its final prediction.

	abstract = {The adaptive immune system uses two main types of antigen receptors: T-cell receptors (TCRs) and antibodies. While both proteins share a globally similar β-sandwich architecture, TCRs are specialized to recognize peptide antigens in the binding groove of the major histocompatibility complex, while antibodies can bind an almost infinite range of molecules. For both proteins, the main determinants of target recognition are the complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops. Five of the six CDRs adopt a limited number of backbone conformations, known as the “canonical classes”; the remaining CDR (β3in TCRs and H3 in antibodies) is more structurally diverse. In this paper, we first update the definition of canonical forms in TCRs, build an auto-updating sequence-based prediction tool (available at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/resources) and demonstrate its application on large scale sequencing studies. Given the global similarity of TCRs and antibodies, we then examine the structural similarity of their CDRs. We find that TCR and antibody CDRs tend to have different length distributions, and where they have similar lengths, they mostly occupy distinct structural spaces. In the rare cases where we found structural similarity, the underlying sequence patterns for the TCR and antibody version are different. Finally, where multiple structures have been solved for the same CDR sequence, the structural variability in TCR loops is higher than that in antibodies, suggesting TCR CDRs are more flexible. These structural differences between TCR and antibody CDRs may be important to their different biological functions.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure.

In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ ≥ 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial libraries built with severely restricted chemical diversity have yielded highly functional synthetic binding proteins. Structural analyses of these minimalist binding sites have revealed the dominant role of large tyrosine residues for mediating molecular contacts and of small serine/glycine residues for providing space and flexibility. The concept of using limited residue types to construct optimized binding proteins mirrors findings in the field of small molecule drug development, where it has been proposed that most drugs are built from a limited set of side chains presented by diverse frameworks. The physicochemical properties of tyrosine make it the amino acid that is most effective for mediating molecular recognition, and protein engineers have taken advantage of these characteristics to build tyrosine-rich protein binding sites that outperform natural proteins in terms of affinity and specificity. Knowledge from preceding studies can be used to improve current designs, and thus synthetic protein libraries will continue to evolve and improve. In the near future, it seems likely that synthetic binding proteins will supersede natural antibodies for most purposes, and moreover, synthetic proteins will enable many new applications beyond the scope of natural proteins.},

In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance.

The new database provides both nucleotides and amino acids for every sequence, with additional sequence annotations to make the data Minimal Information about Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire compliant, and comments on potential problems with the sequence.

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

The generated proteins display natural amino acid propensities, while disorder predictions indicate that 88\% of ProtGPT2-generated proteins are globular, in line with natural sequences. Sensitive sequence searches in protein databases show that ProtGPT2 sequences are distantly related to natural ones, and similarity networks further demonstrate that ProtGPT2 is sampling unexplored regions of protein space.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorous experimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

In addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly) as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work, we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations' for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be treated as though they do.

	abstract = {Multiple strategies have been developed to facilitate the efficient production of bispecific IgG (BsIgG) in single host cells. For example, we previously demonstrated near quantitative (≥90\%) formation of BsIgG of different species and isotypes by combining ‘knob-into-hole’ mutations for heavy chain heterodimerization with engineered antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) for preferential cognate heavy/light chain pairing. Surprisingly, in this study we found high yield ({\textgreater}65\%) of BsIgG1
without Fab engineering to be a common occurrence, i.e., observed for 33 of the 99 different antibody pairs evaluated. Installing charge mutations at both CH1/CL interfaces was sufficient for near quantitative yield ({\textgreater}90\%) of BsIgG1 for most (9 of 11) antibody pairs tested with this inherent cognate chain pairing preference. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that a strong cognate pairing preference in one Fab arm can be sufficient for high BsIgG1 yield. These observed chain pairing preferences are apparently driven by variable domain sequences and can result from a few specific residues in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L3 and H3. Transfer of these CDR residues into other antibodies increased BsIgG1 yield in most cases. Mutational analysis revealed that the disulfide bond between heavy and light chains did not affect the yield of BsIgG1. This study provides some mechanistic understanding of factors contributing to antibody heavy/light chain pairing preference and subsequently contributes to the efficient production of BsIgG in single host cells.},

However, currently, protein LMs are limited to encoder- or decoder-only architectures for single sequences while many biological contexts involve protein-protein interactions. Here, we introduce pAbT5, which models antibody chain pairing as forward- and back-translations using a T5-based architecture. We show that pAbT5 accurately reflects chain pairing through sequence generation. Our protein LM generates variable-length sequences and its next-word prediction probability agrees with position-specific scoring matrix from sequence alignment. Like other works in protein LM, pAbT5 performs state-of-the-art unsupervised prediction on experimental measurements. To the best of our knowledge, pAbT5 is the first generative encoder-decoder protein LM for protein-protein interactions.},

	abstract = {Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate adaptive immune system modifies the genome of individual B cells to encode antibodies that bind particular antigens1. In most mammals, antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains that are generated sequentially by recombination of V, D (for heavy chains), J and C gene segments. Each chain contains three complementarity-determining regions (CDR1–CDR3), which contribute to antigen specificity. Certain heavy and light chains are preferred for particular antigens2–22. Here we consider pairs of B cells that share the same heavy chain V gene and CDRH3 amino acid sequence and were isolated from different donors, also known as public clonotypes23,24. We show that for naive antibodies (those not yet adapted to antigens), the probability that they use the same light chain V gene is around 10\%, whereas for memory (functional) antibodies, it is around 80\%, even if only one cell per clonotype is used. This property of functional antibodies is a phenomenon that we call light chain coherence. We also observe this phenomenon when similar heavy chains recur within a donor. Thus, although naive antibodies seem to recur by chance, the recurrence of functional antibodies reveals surprising constraint and determinism in the processes of V(D)J recombination and immune selection. For most functional antibodies, the heavy chain determines the light chain.},

Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database.Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40\% of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.AbLang is a python package available at https://github.com/oxpig/AbLang.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic mAbs must not only bind to their target but must also be free from “developability issues” such as poor stability or high levels of aggregation. While small-molecule drug discovery benefits from Lipinski’s rule of five to guide the selection of molecules with appropriate biophysical properties, there is currently no in silico analog for antibody design. Here, we model the variable domain structures of a large set of post-phase-I clinical-stage antibody therapeutics (CSTs) and calculate in silico metrics to estimate their typical properties. In each case, we contextualize the CST distribution against a snapshot of the human antibody gene repertoire. We describe guideline values for five metrics thought to be implicated in poor developability: the total length of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), the extent and magnitude of surface hydrophobicity, positive charge and negative charge in the CDRs, and asymmetry in the net heavy- and light-chain surface charges. The guideline cutoffs for each property were derived from the values seen in CSTs, and a flagging system is proposed to identify nonconforming candidates. On two mAb drug discovery sets, we were able to selectively highlight sequences with developability issues. We make available the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), a computational tool that builds downloadable homology models of variable domain sequences, tests them against our five developability guidelines, and reports potential sequence liabilities and canonical forms.

Humanization is normally carried out in a largely trial-and-error experimental process. We have built machine learning classifiers that can discriminate between human and non-human antibody variable domain sequences using the large amount of repertoire data now available.Our classifiers consistently outperform the current best-in-class model for distinguishing human from murine sequences, and our output scores exhibit a negative relationship with the experimental immunogenicity of existing antibody therapeutics. We used our classifiers to develop a novel, computational humanization tool, Hu-mAb, that suggests mutations to an input sequence to reduce its immunogenicity. For a set of therapeutic antibodies with known precursor sequences, the mutations suggested by Hu-mAb show substantial overlap with those deduced experimentally. Hu-mAb is therefore an effective replacement for trial-and-error humanization experiments, producing similar results in a fraction of the time.Hu-mAb (humanness scoring and humanization) is freely available to use at opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/humab.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, with an estimated 1031 phages on the planet, finding the right phage to recognize a specific bacterial host is like looking for a needle in a trillion haystacks. The host range of a phage is primarily determined by phage tail fibers (or spikes), which initially mediate reversible and specific recognition and adsorption by susceptible bacteria. Recent significant advances at single-molecule and atomic levels have begun to unravel the structural organization of tail fibers and underlying mechanisms of phage–host interactions. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms and models of the tail fibers of the well-characterized T4 phage’s interaction with host surface receptors. Structure–function knowledge of tail fibers will pave the way for reprogramming phage host range and will bring future benefits through more-effective phage therapy in medicine. Furthermore, the design strategies of tail fiber engineering are briefly summarized, including machine-learning-assisted engineering inspired by the increasingly enormous amount of phage genetic information.},

	abstract = {Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation.},

	abstract = {Germ-line mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been observed in some families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a familial cancer syndrome in which affected relatives develop a diverse set of early-onset malignancies including breast carcinoma, sarcomas, and brain tumors. The analysis of the p53 gene in LFS families has been limited, in most studies to date, to the region between exon 5 and exon 9. In order to determine the frequency and distribution of germ-line p53 mutations in LFS, we sequenced the 10 coding exons of the p53 gene in lymphocytes and fibroblast cell lines derived from 15 families with the syndrome. Germ-line mutations were observed in eight families. Six mutations were missense mutations located between exons 5 and 8. One mutation was a nonsense mutation in exon 6, and one mutation was a splicing mutation in intron 4, generating aberrant shorter p53 RNA(s). In three families, a mutation of the p53 gene was observed in the fibroblast cell line derived from the proband. However, the mutation was not found in affected relatives in two families and in the blood from the one individual, indicating that the mutation probably occurred during cell culture in vitro. In four families, no mutation was observed. This study indicates that germ-line p53 mutations in LFS are mostly located between exons 5 and 8 and that approximately 50\% of patients with LFS have no germ-line mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {One hundred fifty-nine 3-year survivors of childhood soft tissue sarcoma and their relatives were surveyed to determine the frequency of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in patients and cancer in their relatives. The cancer experience of the patients, their offspring, siblings, parents, parental siblings, and grandparents was compared to that expected of the general population based on age-, sex- and calendar year-specific rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. A significant excess of SMNs was observed in the patients (observed expected = 8:0.38). Among 758 first-degree relatives, a significant cancer excess was observed (34:20.68), attributable largely to cancer of soft tissue and bone (6:0.44) and breast (9:3.39) and to cancers occurring before age 35 years (12:4.14). Overall, a significantly lower than expected cancer incidence was confirmed in the 1,693 second-degree relatives (142:178). To identify patient characteristics associated with higher than expected familial cancer risk, kindreds were partitioned by patient age at diagnosis tumor type, tumor site SMN and other factors. A highly significant cancer excess was observed in the relatives of SMN patients (26:12.78). The tumor types occurring in excess in close relatives were also observed as SMNs in the patients. The findings confirm an association among childhood soft tissue sarcoma and cancers of the breast, bone, joint, or soft tissue as SMN in patients and in close relatives and suggest that the risk of a second tumor is associated with a familial predisposition to cancer.},

Malignant disease had occurred in 6 other women whose ages at diagnosis ranged from 33 to 58 years. This was not significantly in excess of expectation. The incidence of cancer among mothers of various sub-groups of children was computed. For breast cancer mothers of: boys, children who were less than the median age at diagnosis, and children who had pelvic tumours had a greater excess risk than the group as a whole. Among those sub-groups of mothers the highest excess risk was 13.5. For other cancers, no sub-group showed an incidence which was significantly above the expected. A high proportion of infiltrating lobular carcinoma was found among the breast cancers, and histological type may indicate familial disease. These findings are consistent with the cancer family syndrome described by Li \& Fraumeni in 1969, but the present results suggest that a higher proportion of childhood soft tissue sarcoma than was hitherto suspected may have a genetic aetiology. Further pedigree and laboratory studies may help to identify familial cases at the time of the child's diagnosis.},

Several genetic modifiers have been implicated to account for the phenotypic variability within and across LFS families; however, efforts to develop predictive algorithms of age of onset and type of cancers in individual patients have not yet found clinical use. Although it is not possible to prevent cancers from forming in LFS patients, novel protocols have been developed for surveillance for early tumor detection, leading to improvements in survival. Comprehensive studies of the genome and epigenome in LFS families in the context of germline TP53 mutations is anticipated to shed light on this intriguing, yet devastating, disease and to transform the clinical management of patients., Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an inherited disorder that greatly increases one’s risk of acquiring cancer.

	abstract = {The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers, and germ-line p53 mutations cause a familial predisposition for cancer. Germ-line or sporadic p53 mutations are usually missense and typically affect the central DNA-binding domain of the protein. Because p53 functions as a tetrameric transcription factor, mutant p53 is thought to inhibit the function of wild-type p53 protein. Here, we studied the possible dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type p53 protein by two different, frequently occurring point mutations. The R270H and P275S mutations were targeted into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells to allow the analysis of the effects of the mutant proteins expressed in normal cells at single-copy levels. In embryonic stem cells, the presence of a heterozygous point-mutated allele resulted in delayed transcriptional activation of several p53 downstream target genes on exposure to gamma irradiation. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was severely affected in the mutant embryonic stem cells compared with wild-type cells. Heterozygous mutant thymocytes had a severe defect in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways after treatment with gamma irradiation or doxorubicin, whereas p53-independent apoptotic pathways were intact. Together these data demonstrate that physiological expression of point-mutated p53 can strongly limit overall cellular p53 function, supporting the dominant-negative action of such mutants. Also, cells heterozygous for such mutations may be compromised in terms of tumor suppression and response to chemotherapeutic agents.},

Examination of the wide spectrum of adult-onset and childhood cancers and the distribution of p53 mutations has led to a greater understanding of cancer genotype-phenotype correlations. However, the complex LFS phenotype is not readily explained by the simple identification of germline p53 mutations in affected individuals. Recent work has identified genetic events that modify the LFS phenotype. These include intragenic polymorphisms, mutations/polymorphisms of genes in the p53 regulatory pathway, as well as more global events such as aberrant copy number variation and telomere attrition. These genetic events may, in part, explain the breadth of tumor histiotypes within and across LFS families, the apparent accelerated age of onset within families, and the range of clinical outcomes among affected family members. This review will examine the clinical and genetic definitions of LFS and offer insight into how lessons learned from the study of this rare disorder may inform similar questions in other familial cancer syndromes.},

Six of the new mutations described here are the same as those previously identified in other Li-Fraumeni families and are missense mutations at codons 245, 248, and 273 (in two families); a nonsense mutation at codon 209; and a mutation at the splice donor site in exon 4. The other five mutations are novel germ-line mutations and include missense mutations at codons 136 and 344, a 2-bp deletion within codon 191, a splice acceptor mutation in intron 3, and a 167-bp deletion of part of exon 1 and intron 1.

These figures are somewhat higher than those previously reported by us and others for the frequency of TP53 mutations in LFS and LFL families.

	abstract = {Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. Omicron (B.1.1.529), the fifth VOC to be described, harbours multiple amino acid mutations in spike, half of which lie within the receptor-binding domain. Here we demonstrate substantial evasion of neutralization by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in vitro using sera from individuals vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. These data were mirrored by a substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that was partially restored by booster vaccination. The Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 did not induce cell syncytia in vitro and favoured a TMPRSS2-independent endosomal entry pathway, these phenotypes mapping to distinct regions of the spike protein. Impaired cell fusion was determined by the receptor-binding domain, while endosomal entry mapped to the S2 domain. Such marked changes in antigenicity and replicative biology may underlie the rapid global spread and altered pathogenicity of the Omicron variant.},

	abstract = {Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom (UK). This B.1.1.7 variant increased rapidly in prevalence among sequenced strains, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency. The UK variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 UK spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant responsible for increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil and South Africa, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with epithelial cell and respiratory system proclivity. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening disease. Due to wide geographic impact affecting an extremely high proportion of the world population it was defined by the World Health Organization as a global public health pandemic. The infection is known to readily spread from person-to-person. This occurs through liquid droplets by cough, sneeze, hand-to-mouth-to-eye contact and through contaminated hard surfaces. Close human proximity accelerates SARS-CoV-2 spread. COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can move beyond the lungs by blood-based dissemination to affect multiple organs. These organs include the kidney, liver, muscles, nervous system, and spleen. The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 mortality is acute respiratory distress syndrome initiated by epithelial infection and alveolar macrophage activation in the lungs. The early cell-based portal for viral entry is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Viral origins are zoonotic with genomic linkages to the bat coronaviruses but without an identifiable intermediate animal reservoir. There are currently few therapeutic options, and while many are being tested, although none are effective in curtailing the death rates. There is no available vaccine yet. Intense global efforts have targeted research into a better understanding of the epidemiology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2. These fields of study will provide the insights directed to curtailing this disease outbreak with intense international impact.,

	abstract = {In this study, we completed the whole genome sequence of a new tobamovirus isolated from tomato plants grown in greenhouses in Jordan during the spring of 2015. The 6393-nt single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome encodes four proteins, as do other tobamoviruses: two replication-related proteins of 126 kDa and 183 kDa, a 30-kDa movement protein (MP) and a 17.5-kDa coat protein (CP). Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus does not group with either the tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) or the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) clades. Instead, it stems from a branch leading to the TMV clade. Analysis of possible recombination events between this virus and representative isolates of closely related tomato-infecting tobamoviruses showed that at least one region originated by recombination. We provide evidence that we have identified a new tobamovirus, for which we propose the name "tomato brown rugose fruit virus".},

	abstract = {Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) was recently found to be the most abundant RNA virus in human feces, and is a plant virus belonging to the genus Tobamovirus in the family Virgoviridae. When in human feces, it is of dietary origin from peppers and their processed products, and is excreted from a large proportion of healthy human populations, but rarely found in animal feces. Over the past decade, this virus has been increasingly attracting research attention as a potential viral indicator for human fecal pollution in aquatic environments and water treatment systems. Results presented in the literature reveal that PMMoV is globally distributed and present in various water sources in greater abundance than human pathogenic viruses, without substantial seasonal fluctuations. Several studies report that increased concentrations of PMMoV tend to be correlated with increased fecal contamination in general, along with more frequent detection of pathogenic enteric viruses. PMMoV also exhibits remarkable stability in water under various environmental conditions. Here, we review recent advancements in our understanding of the occurrence and persistence of PMMoV in natural and engineered water systems and discuss its advantages and limitations as a viral indicator for improved microbial water quality management.},

How the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is folded in the virion remains unknown. To fill the knowledge gap and facilitate structure-based drug development, we develop a virion RNA in situ conformation sequencing technology, named vRIC-seq, for probing viral RNA genome structure unbiasedly. Using vRIC-seq data, we reconstruct the tertiary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and reveal a surprisingly “unentangled globule” conformation. We uncover many long-range duplexes and higher-order junctions, both of which are under purifying selections and contribute to the sequential package of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Unexpectedly, the D614G and the other two accompanying mutations may remodel duplexes into more stable forms. Lastly, the structure-guided design of potent small interfering RNAs can obliterate the SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Overall, our work provides a framework for studying the genome structure, function, and dynamics of emerging deadly RNA viruses.},

Given the complexity of transmission media and plant disease infection mechanisms, the prevention and control of plant viral diseases is a great challenge, and an efficient green pesticide is urgently needed. For this reason, when developing candidate drug leads to regulate plant viruses, pesticide experts have focused on characteristics such as low pesticide resistance, eco-friendliness, and novel mechanism. Researchers have also theoretically investigated the molecular targets of viruses infecting agricultural crops. Antiviral screening models have been constructed based on these molecular targets, and the mechanisms of commercial drugs and high-activity compounds have been extensively investigated. After screening, some compounds have been applied in the field and found to have good commercial prospects; these drugs may be used to create new green antiviral pesticides to control plant viruses. This paper reviews the screening, mode of action, development and application of recently used plant-based antiviral agents.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for
estimating missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for
the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We
implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest
neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods
using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data
sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the
amount of missing data over the range of 1–20\% missing values.
We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and
sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and
both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average
method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report
results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations
and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a
variety of conditions.Availability: The software is available at http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/impute/Contact: russ.altman@stanford.edu*To whom correspondence should be

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large—and will undoubtedly grow many fold—placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization, making it possible to complete the placements under the constraints of real-time contact tracing. Thus, our method addresses an important need for maintaining a fully updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the University of California Santa Cruz SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data.

The rationale is based on the fact that PV-infected individuals, whether presenting with disease symptoms or not, shed large amounts of PV in the faeces for several weeks. As the morbidity:infection ratio of PV infection is very low, this fact contributes to the sensitivity of ENV which under optimal conditions can be better than that of the standard acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. The World Health Organization has included ENV in the new Strategic Plan of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative for years 2010–2012 to be increasingly used in PV surveillance, supplementing AFP surveillance. In this paper we review the feasibility of using ENV to monitor wild PV and vaccine-derived PV circulation in human populations, based on global experiences in defined epidemiological situations.},

Many laboratories add a proxy virus to wastewater samples to determine losses associated with concentration and extraction of viral RNA. While measuring recovery of a proxy virus is an important process control, in this piece, we describe the caveats and limitations to the interpretation of this control, including that it typically does not account for losses during RNA extraction. We recommend reporting the directly measured concentration data alongside the measured recovery efficiency, rather than attempting to correct the concentration for recovery efficiency.

	abstract = {Background
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has become a powerful technique for eukaryotic gene knockdown. siRNA GC-content negatively correlates with RNAi efficiency, and it is of interest to have a convincing mechanistic interpretation of this observation. We here examine this issue by considering the secondary structures for both the target messenger RNA (mRNA) and the siRNA guide strand.

Results
By analyzing a unique homogeneous data set of 101 shRNAs targeted to 100 endogenous human genes, we find that: 1) target site accessibility is more important than GC-content for efficient RNAi; 2) there is an appreciable negative correlation between GC-content and RNAi activity; 3) for the predicted structure of the siRNA guide strand, there is a lack of correlation between RNAi activity and either the stability or the number of free dangling nucleotides at an end of the structure; 4) there is a high correlation between target site accessibility and GC-content. For a set of representative structural RNAs, the GC content of 62.6\% for paired bases is significantly higher than the GC content of 38.7\% for unpaired bases. Thus, for a structured RNA, a region with higher GC content is likely to have more stable secondary structure. Furthermore, by partial correlation analysis, the correlation for GC-content is almost completely diminished, when the effect of target accessibility is controlled.

Conclusion
These findings provide a target-structure-based interpretation and mechanistic insight for the effect of GC-content on RNAi efficiency.},

	abstract = {The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear commonly agreed definition of the term “microbiome.” Moreover, a consensus on best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes might play a key role.},

	abstract = {The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, which makes available drugs ineffective.},

	abstract = {Global seed trade contributed to development and improvement of world agriculture. An adverse effect of global seed trade is reflected in disease outbreaks in new growing areas, countries, and continents. Among the seed-borne viruses, Tobamovirus species are currently considered a peril for crop production around the world. The unique tobamoviral particles confer stability to the RNA genome and preserve their infectivity for years. High titer of Tobamovirus species accumulates in reproductive organs leading to viral particles adsorbed to seed coat, which potentially establish a primary infectious source. Tobamovirus-contaminated seeds show very low virus transmission in grow-out experiments as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Interestingly, in situ immunofluorescence analysis of Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) reveals that the perisperm-endosperm envelope (PEE) is contaminated as well by the Tobamovirus. Indeed, chemical seed disinfection treatments that affect primarily the seed coat surface are efficient for several Tobamovirus species but apparently do not prevent seed transmission of CGMMV to occur. Tobamovirus infection of the seed internal layers, which rarely includes the embryo, may partially follow the direct invasion pathway of Potyviruses such as Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) to pea embryo.},

An update to the V3 primer set was released on 18th June 2021 to address amplicon drop-off observed among the Delta variant of concern. Here, we report on an in-house optimization of a modified version of the ARTIC Network V4 protocol that improves SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery in instances where the original V4 pooling strategy was characterized by amplicon drop-offs.MethodsWe utilized a matched set of 43 clinical samples and serially diluted positive controls that were amplified by ARTIC V3, V4 and optimized V4 primers and sequenced using GridION from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies'.ResultsWe observed a 0.5\% to 46\% increase in genome recovery in 67\% of the samples when using the original V4 pooling strategy compared to the V3 primers. Amplicon drop-offs at primer positions 23 and 90 were observed for all variants and positive controls. When using the optimized protocol, we observed a 60\% improvement in genome recovery across all samples and an increase in the average depth in amplicon 23 and 90. Consequently, ≥95\% of the genome was recovered in 72\% (n = 31) of the samples. However, only 60–70\% of the genomes could be recovered in samples that had {\textless}28\% genome coverage with the ARTIC V3 primers. There was no statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) correlation between Ct value and genome recovery.ConclusionUtilizing the ARTIC V4 primers, while increasing the primer concentrations for amplicons with drop-offs or low average read-depth, greatly improves genome recovery of Alpha, Beta, Delta, Eta and non-VOC/non-VOI SARS-CoV-2 variants.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7. AlphaFold predicts the distances between pairs of residues, is used to construct potentials of mean force that accurately describe the shape of a protein and can be optimized with gradient descent to predict protein structures.},

Most of the current computational domain boundary prediction methods suffer from low accuracy and limitation in handling multi-domain types, or even cannot be applied on certain targets such as proteins with discontinuous domain. We developed an ab-initio protein domain predictor using a stacked bidirectional LSTM model in deep learning. Our model is trained by a large amount of protein sequences without using feature engineering such as sequence profiles. Hence, the predictions using our method is much faster than others, and the trained model can be applied to any type of target proteins without constraint. We evaluated DeepDom by a 10-fold cross validation and also by applying it on targets in different categories from CASP 8 and CASP 9. The comparison with other methods has shown that DeepDom outperforms most of the current ab-initio methods and even achieves better results than the top-level template-based method in certain cases.

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially dangerous features have been identified by the scientific community. Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) was first detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Earlier this year, a variant labeled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. Recently the World Health Organization has raised concern for the variants B.1.617.2 mainly detected in India but now exported worldwide. It is paramount to rapidly develop specific molecular tests to uniquely identify new variants. Using a completely automated pipeline built around deep learning and evolutionary algorithms techniques, we designed primer sets specific to variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.519 respectively. We wish to raise awareness to the variant of interest, B.1.1.519, which contain several mutations of important threat to public health. Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets for each variant. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and are based on 2 mutations or more. In addition, we present an analysis of key mutations for SARS-CoV-2 variants. The presented methodology can be exploited to swiftly obtain primer sets for each new variant, that can later be a part of a multiplexed approach for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Background: The recent development of metagenomic sequencing makes it possible to massively sequence microbial genomes including viral genomes without the need for laboratory culture. Existing reference-based and gene homology-based methods are not efﬁcient in identifying unknown viruses or short viral sequences from metagenomic data. Methods: Here we developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method, DeepVirFinder, for identifying viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep learning. Results: Trained based on sequences from viral RefSeq discovered before May 2015, and evaluated on those discovered after that date, DeepVirFinder outperformed the state-of-the-art method VirFinder at all contig lengths, achieving AUROC 0.93, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.98 for 300, 500, 1000, and 3000 bp sequences respectively. Enlarging the training data with additional millions of puriﬁed viral sequences from metavirome samples further improved the accuracy for identifying virus groups that are under-represented. Applying DeepVirFinder to real human gut metagenomic samples, we identiﬁed 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Ten bins were found associated with the cancer status, suggesting viruses may play important roles in CRC. Conclusions: Powered by deep learning and high throughput sequencing metagenomic data, DeepVirFinder signiﬁcantly improved the accuracy of viral identiﬁcation and will assist the study of viruses in the era of metagenomics.},

	abstract = {The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance—deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

To enable researchers to utilize these networks more easily, we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs on biological sequence data. Sequences are classiﬁed by learning sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize learned motifs along with information about their positional and class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing dataset and cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq binding site sequences, we demonstrate that pysster classiﬁes sequences with higher accuracy than previous methods, such as GraphProt or ssHMM, and is able to recover known sequence and structure motifs.

The frequency and location of mutations can be constrained by specific molecular mechanisms, such as diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs). DGRs have been characterized from cultivated bacteria and bacteriophages, and perform error-prone reverse transcription leading to mutations being introduced in specific target genes. DGR loci were also identified in several metagenomes, but the ecological roles and evolutionary drivers of these DGRs remain poorly understood. Here, we analyze a dataset of {\textbackslash}textgreater30,000 DGRs from public metagenomes, establish six major lineages of DGRs including three primarily encoded by phages and seemingly used to diversify host attachment proteins, and demonstrate that DGRs are broadly active and responsible for {\textbackslash}textgreater10\% of all amino acid changes in some organisms. Overall, these results highlight the constraints under which DGRs evolve, and elucidate several distinct roles these elements play in natural communities.},

To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessh3{\textbackslash}textgreaterIMPORTANCE{\textbackslash}textless/h3{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused millions of deaths around the world as countries struggle to contain infections. The pandemic will not end until herd immunity is reached, that is, when most of the population has either recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern threatens to erase gains. Emerging new variants may re-infect persons who have recovered from COVID-19 or may evade vaccine-induced immunity. However, scaling up SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing to monitor Variants of Concern in communities around the world is challenging. Wastewater-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be used to monitor the presence of emerging variants in large communities to enact control measures to minimize the spread of these variants. We describe here the identification of alleles associated with several variants of concern in wastewater obtained from NYC watersheds.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1\% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.

Our screening of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from several novel CoVs but, more signiﬁcantly, identiﬁed sequences that were closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5= and 3= ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies recombination events involving the S gene were identiﬁed, suggesting that this region may represent a recombination “hot spot” in CoV genomes. Finally, using a combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and subsequently by geographic distances.},

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1−N3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the ﬁrst Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6−30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the ﬁrst cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1−N3 up to 790−2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated signiﬁcantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.},

Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences from sewage were first identified in a sample collected in London on 10th November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to {\textbackslash}textgreater95\% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can potentially detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses also carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity.},

Consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to obtain cDNA, then cloned and sequenced a highly conserved 922 nucleotide region in open reading frame (ORF) 1b of the polymerase (pol) gene from eight coronaviruses. These sequences were compared with published sequences for three additional coronaviruses. In this comparison, it was found that nucleotide substitution frequencies (per 100 nucleotides) varied from 46.40 to 50.13 when viruses were compared among the traditional coronavirus groups and, with one exception (the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E), varied from 2.54 to 15.89 when compared within these groups. (The substitution frequency for 229E, as compared to other members of the same group, varied from 35.37 to 35.72.) Phylogenetic analysis of these pol gene sequences resulted in groupings which correspond closely with the previously described groupings, including recent data which places the two avian coronaviruses— infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens and turkey coronavirus (TCV) — in the same group [Guy, J.S., Barnes, H.J., Smith L.G., Breslin, J., 1997. Avian Dis. 41:583–590]. A single pair of degenerate primers was identiﬁed which amplify a 251 bp region from coronaviruses of all three groups using the same reaction conditions.

To be able to assess the risk of viral escape from neutralization by first-wave antibodies, we leveraged our capability for Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation of the spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and its binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to predict alterations in molecular interactions resulting from the presence of the E484K, K417N, and N501Y variants found in the South African 501Y.V2 strain – alone and in combination. We report here the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y results in the highest degree of conformational alterations of S RBD when bound to hACE2, compared to either E484K or N501Y alone. Both E484K and N501Y increase affinity of S RBD for hACE2 and E484K in particular switches the charge on the flexible loop region of RBD which leads to the formation of novel favorable contacts. Enhanced affinity of S RBD for hACE2 very likely underpins the greater transmissibility conferred by the presence of either E484K or N501Y; while the induction of conformational changes may provide an explanation for evidence that the 501Y.V2 variant, distinguished from the B.1.1.7 UK variant by the presence of E484K, is able to escape neutralization by existing first-wave anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and re-infect COVID-19 convalescent individuals.},

The coronavirus S protein plays a key role in host speciﬁcity by attaching the virus to receptors on the cell membrane. We analyzed 1238 spike sequences for their host speciﬁcity. Spike sequences readily segregate in t-SNE embeddings into clusters of similar hosts and/or virus species. Machine learning with SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest gave high average accuracies, F1 scores, sensitivities and speciﬁcities of 0.95e0.99.

However, ligation of mismatched overhangs leads to erroneous assembly, and low-eﬃciency Watson Crick pairings can lead to truncated assemblies. Using sets of empirically vetted, highaccuracy junction pairs avoids this issue but limits the number of parts that can be joined in a single reaction. Here, we report the use of comprehensive end-joining ligation ﬁdelity and bias data to predict high accuracy junction sets for Golden Gate assembly.

	abstract = {Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARSCoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to proﬁle the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the United States or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identiﬁed in genomes from patients sampled outside California, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.},

	abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Methods: We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARSCoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann–Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. Results: We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2–5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0–3] (p value {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overﬁtting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland.

Eﬀorts have been made to ﬁnd enveloped virus surrogates due to challenges investigating viruses that require biosafety-level 3 or 4 handling. In this study, the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 was evaluated as a surrogate for enveloped waterborne viruses. The persistence of Phi6 was tested in aqueous conditions chosen based on previously published viral persistence studies. Our results demonstrated that the predicted T90 (time for 90\% inactivation) of Phi6 under the 12 evaluated conditions varied from 24 min to 117 days depending on temperature, biological activity, and aqueous media composition. Phi6 persistence was then compared with persistence values from other enveloped viruses reported in the literature. The apparent suitability of Phi6 as an enveloped virus surrogate was dependent on the temperature and composition of the media tested. Of evaluated viruses, 33\%, including all conditions considered, had T90 values greater than the 95\% conﬁdence interval for Phi6. Ultimately, these results highlight the variability of enveloped virus persistence in the environment and the value of working with the virus of interest for environmental persistence studies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused millions of deaths around the world as countries struggle to contain infections. The pandemic will not end until herd immunity is reached, that is, when most of the population has either recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern threatens to erase gains. Emerging new variants may re-infect persons who have recovered from COVID-19 or may evade vaccine-induced immunity. However, scaling up SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing to monitor Variants of Concern in communities around the world is challenging. Wastewater-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be used to monitor the presence of emerging variants in large communities to enact control measures to minimize the spread of these variants. We describe here the identification of alleles associated with several variants of concern in wastewater obtained from NYC watersheds.},

	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, new SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially dangerous features have been identiﬁed by the scientiﬁc community. Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data (GISAID) was ﬁrst detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Even more recently, a variant labeled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. In such a situation, it is paramount to rapidly develop speciﬁc molecular tests to uniquely identify, contain, and study new variants. Using a completely automated pipeline built around deep learning techniques, we design primer sets speciﬁc to variant B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively. Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets in just under 16 hours for each case study. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and do not appear in samples from different viruses, nor in other coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 variants. The presented methodology can be exploited to swiftly obtain primer sets for each independent new variant, that can later be a part of a multiplexed approach for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, since our approach delivers primers able to differentiate between variants, it can be used as a second step of a diagnosis in cases already positive to COVID-19, to identify individuals carrying variants with potentially threatening features.},

	abstract = {Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.},

A convolutional neural network classifier is first trained on 553 sequences from the National Genomics Data Center repository, separating the genome of different virus strains from the Coronavirus family with 98.73\% accuracy. The network’s behavior is then analyzed, to discover sequences used by the model to identify SARS-CoV-2, ultimately uncovering sequences exclusive to it. The discovered sequences are validated on samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data repositories, and are proven to be able to separate SARS-CoV-2 from different virus strains with near-perfect accuracy. Next, one of the sequences is selected to generate a primer set, and tested against other state-of-the-art primer sets, obtaining competitive results. Finally, the primer is synthesized and tested on patient samples (n = 6 previously tested positive), delivering a sensitivity similar to routine diagnostic methods, and 100\% specificity. The proposed methodology has a substantial added value over existing methods, as it is able to both automatically identify promising primer sets for a virus from a limited amount of data, and deliver effective results in a minimal amount of time. Considering the possibility of future pandemics, these characteristics are invaluable to promptly create specific detection methods for diagnostics.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language.

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed millions of lives globally to date. Rapid accumulation of co-occurring mutations has led to the emergence of viral variants which appear to be more transmissible, virulent, or both. Variants of concern (VOC) now include those belonging to the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages. Early detection of VOC and the ability to retrospectively follow their respective, longitudinal prevalence in communities is wanting. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) allows tracking of disease prevalence in the general population using RT-qPCR to detect viral fragments, but ongoing longitudinal studies have yet to differentiate between these variants. Here, we describe and validate a primer extension strategy to amplify and distinguish B.1.1.7-specific, from nonB.1.1.7 alleles by combining new forward, and existing CDC 2019-nCoV\_N1 qPCR probes and reverse primers. This assay can be quickly implemented within a current SARS-CoV-2 WBE framework with minimal cost with the goal of providing early detection of increasing B.1.1.7 transmission in a community prior to identification through clinical testing and confirmation via secondary screening strategies. As such, this assay can provide public health units with an additional and much needed metric to be able to rapidly triangulate B.1.1.7 prevalence.},

	abstract = {Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken is available at http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/.},
