% You probably need different styles for authors. the tech report uses the 
% authblk package to parse the list of authors and format it for both the 
% title page and the list of authors on the first page. There are a number
% of ways of listing authors with this package, but the easiest is to list 
% them one by one. 

% \author{first author} 
% \affil{first author's affiliation}
% \author{second author} 
% \affil{second author's affiliation}

% If more than one author is listed before giving an affiliation, then all
% authors listed before each affiliation will be given that same affiliation.

% \author{first author} 
% \author{second author} 
% \affil{first and second author's affiliations}
% \author{third author} 
% \affil{third author's affiliations}

% Use \thanks to add e-mail addresses if desired
