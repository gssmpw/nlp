abstract = {Entity resolution is central to data integration and data cleaning. Algorithmic approaches have been improving in quality, but remain far from perfect. Crowdsourcing platforms offer a more accurate but expensive (and slow) way to bring human insight into the process. Previous work has proposed batching verification tasks for presentation to human workers but even with batching, a human-only approach is infeasible for data sets of even moderate size, due to the large numbers of matches to be tested. Instead, we propose a hybrid human-machine approach in which machines are used to do an initial, coarse pass over all the data, and people are used to verify only the most likely matching pairs. We show that for such a hybrid system, generating the minimum number of verification tasks of a given size is NP-Hard, but we develop a novel two-tiered heuristic approach for creating batched tasks. We describe this method, and present the results of extensive experiments on real data sets using a popular crowdsourcing platform. The experiments show that our hybrid approach achieves both good efficiency and high accuracy compared to machine-only or human-only alternatives.},

One prominent goal of these approaches is to improve the quality of knowledge graphs by removing errors and adding missing facts. Surprisingly, most embedding techniques have been evaluated on benchmark datasets consisting of dense and reliable subsets of human-curated KGs, which tend to be fairly complete and have few errors. In this paper, we consider the problem of applying embedding techniques to KGs extracted from text, which are often incomplete and contain errors. We compare the sparsity and unreliability of different KGs and perform empirical experiments demonstrating how embedding approaches degrade as sparsity and unreliability increase."

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities. In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.

Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

abstract = {This paper presents a rule based approach to extracting relations from unstructured music text sources. The proposed approach identifies and disambiguates musical entities in text, such as songs, bands, persons, albums and music genres. Candidate relations are then obtained by traversing the dependency parsing tree of each sentence in the text with at least two identified entities. A set of syntactic rules based on part of speech tags are defined to filter out spurious and irrelevant relations. The extracted entities and relations are finally represented as a knowledge graph. We test our method on texts from songfacts.com, a website that provides tidbits with facts and stories about songs. The extracted relations are evaluated intrinsically by assessing their linguistic quality, as well as extrinsically by assessing the extent to which they map an existing music knowledge base. Our system produces a vast percentage of linguistically correct relations between entities, and is able to replicate a significant part of the knowledge base.},

However, the pre-trained language model for entity and relation extraction still faces several challenges. In this paper, we propose a joint model for entity and relation extraction based on BERT called JMEBERT. Specifically, we first design a multi-task learning framework to combine the pre-trained language model and entity and relation extraction tasks. Then, we design an effective fusion method for entity and relation extraction, which can effectively combine the entity and relation extraction results. Finally, we design a training strategy that can effectively train the model. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our proposed model outperforms the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95\%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.},

    abstract = "Automatic construction of large knowledge graphs (KG) by mining web-scale text datasets has received considerable attention recently. Estimating accuracy of such automatically constructed KGs is a challenging problem due to their size and diversity. This important problem has largely been ignored in prior research {--} we fill this gap and propose KGEval. KGEval uses coupling constraints to bind facts and crowdsources those few that can infer large parts of the graph. We demonstrate that the objective optimized by KGEval is submodular and NP-hard, allowing guarantees for our approximation algorithm. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KGEval best estimates KG accuracy compared to other baselines, while requiring significantly lesser number of human evaluations."
