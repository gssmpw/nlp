    abstract = "Can human reading comprehension be assessed from eye movements in reading? In this work, we address this longstanding question using large-scale eyetracking data. We focus on a cardinal and largely unaddressed variant of this question: predicting reading comprehension of a single participant for a single question from their eye movements over a single paragraph. We tackle this task using a battery of recent models from the literature, and three new multimodal language models. We evaluate the models in two different reading regimes: ordinary reading and information seeking, and examine their generalization to new textual items, new participants, and the combination of both. The evaluations suggest that the task is highly challenging, and highlight the importance of benchmarking against a strong text-only baseline. While in some cases eye movements provide improvements over such a baseline, they tend to be small. This could be due to limitations of current modelling approaches, limitations of the data, or because eye movement behavior does not sufficiently pertain to fine-grained aspects of reading comprehension processes. Our study provides an infrastructure for making further progress on this question.",

	abstract = {As readers of a language, we all agree to move our eyes in roughly the same way. Yet might there be hidden within this self-similar behavior subtle clues as to how a reader is understanding the material being read? Here we attempt to decode a reader’s eye movements to predict their level of text comprehension and related states. Eye movements were recorded from 95 people reading 4 published SAT passages, each followed by corresponding SAT questions and self-evaluation questionnaires. A sequence of 21 fixation-location (x,y), fixation-duration, and pupil-size features were extracted from the reading behavior and input to two deep networks (CNN/RNN), which were used to predict the reader’s comprehension level and other comprehension-related variables. The best overall comprehension prediction accuracy was 65\% (cf. null accuracy = 54\%) obtained by CNN. This prediction generalized well to fixations on new passages (64\%) from the same readers, but did not generalize to fixations from new readers (41\%), implying substantial individual differences in reading behavior. Our work is the first attempt to predict comprehension from fixations using deep networks, where we hope that our large reading dataset and our protocol for evaluation will benefit the development of new methods for predicting reading comprehension by decoding gaze behavior.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach for determining learners' second language proficiency which utilizes behavioral traces of eye movements during reading. Our approach provides stand-alone eyetracking based English proficiency scores which reflect the extent to which the learner's gaze patterns in reading are similar to those of native English speakers. We show that our scores correlate strongly with standardized English proficiency tests. We also demonstrate that gaze information can be used to accurately predict the outcomes of such tests. Our approach yields the strongest performance when the test taker is presented with a suite of sentences for which we have eyetracking data from other readers. However, it remains effective even using eyetracking with sentences for which eye movement data have not been previously collected. By deriving proficiency as an automatic byproduct of eye movements during ordinary reading, our approach offers a potentially valuable new tool for second language proficiency assessment. More broadly, our results open the door to future methods for inferring reader characteristics from the behavioral traces of reading.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in language learning concerns the role of a speaker's first language in second language acquisition. We present a novel methodology for studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second language reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for the first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted from their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across native languages. The presented framework complements production studies and offers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism. 1},

This means that reading comprehension and other properties of the text and/or the reader should be possible to infer from eye movements. Consequently, we develop the first neural sequence architecture for this type of tasks which models scan paths in reading and incorporates lexical, semantic and other linguistic features of the stimulus text. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks. These include inferring reading comprehension or text difficulty, and assessing whether the reader is a native speaker of the text’s language. We further conduct an ablation study to investigate the impact of each component of our proposed neural network on its performance.},
