\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced DLFR-VAE, a training-free framework for dynamic latent frame rate adaptation in video generation. By dynamically adjusting the frame rate based on content complexity, DLFR-VAE significantly reduces the number of elements in latent space.
Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness across various resolutions and frame rates, showcasing its potential as a plug-and-play solution for existing video generation models.
