\paragraph{Robustness of Large Language Models.}
%In order to apply LLMs across various scenarios, improving LLMs' robustness is critical.

% ____ assess ChatGPT's robustness, 
% while ____ evaluate LLMs as problem solvers. 
Additionally, ____ focus on generating OOD data by employing semi-fact data augmentation methods. Recently, ____ identify reasoning gaps in LLMs by evaluating math problem pairs, revealing performance disparities in smaller, math-specialized models. ____ introduce cofQA, which targets text-based inference tasks using counterfactual data perturbations. 
Our work is similar in assessing general robustness but differs from the literature in focusing on reasoning tasks, for which OOD tests are more necessary as compared to general tasks.

%The exploration and optimization of PRM show its superior performance in developing high-performance models. However, suitable benchmarks for PRM and test-compute models are lacking. We propose a benchmark for test-time computing models to evaluate PRM's capabilities, unlocking its potential.


% In the past, the training of language models primarily relied on Outcome-based Reinforcement Models (ORM)____. A model proposed by ____ serves as a foundational example of ORM-based models, where the focus is on training evaluators to assess the final correctness of generated answers. This approach provides feedback for model training and plays a significant role. However, ORM has certain limitations, as it concentrates solely on the final outcome, neglecting the various steps involved in the reasoning process.




% To address ORM's oversight of the reasoning process, a few works on Process Reward Model (PRM) have emerged in recent years, offering more granular supervision. For instance, DeepMind____ emphasizes supervising both intermediate reasoning steps and the final result, thereby providing more detailed feedback. OpenAI____ further advances PRM by introducing a high-quality human-annotated process supervision dataset, PRM800K, highlighting the importance of verifying each intermediate step.

% ____ demonstrate the combination of evaluator models with majority voting schemes to enhance the reliability of results. ____ improve the reasoning process in large language models through reinforcement learning, integrating both outcome and process supervision. The recently proposed Generative Reward Model (GenRM)____ gets tons of attention, allowing evaluators to interact with generators in an information-rich manner. This shift reflects a widespread demand for more sophisticated process supervision methods. The recent work____ contributes a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to identify errors in step-by-step mathematical reasoning, focusing on challenging competition-level problems, using a diverse set of annotated solutions to foster research in scalable oversight for reasoning assessment.

% An increasing number of researchers turn to the exploration and optimization of PRM, whose superior performance marks a significant step towards the development of high-performance test-compute models. However, there is still a lack of suitable benchmarks for PRM and test-compute models. We propose a benchmark tailored for test-compute models to measure their performance and robustness, enabling a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of PRM's capabilities, thereby further exploring and unlocking the vast potential of PRM.
