\noindent\textbf{Agents on Interactive Environments} \quad Before the advent of LLMs, agents relied on traditional RL to perform interactions such as clicking and typing____. However, recent advancements have shifted towards leveraging foundation models with in-context learning or fine-tuning across various interfaces, including mobile____, web____, and computer using environments____. Recently, there are emerging methods designing process rewards____ or language RL____ for better performing single agents. 

\noindent\textbf{Interactive Environments for Agents} \quad To effectively evaluate language agents, it is essential to create environments that replicate real-world conditions and deliver accurate rewards____. MiniWoB++____ is a lightweight framework that features small, synthetic HTML pages with parameterized tasks. WebArena____ and its visual counterpart, VisualWebArena____, simulate websites spanning up to distinct domains, while WorkArena____ focuses on enterprise software. For more specialized environments, WebShop____ simulates an e-commerce platform for online shopping. For computer using environment, OSWorld____ provides both a user interface and programmatically generated rewards across different apps.

\noindent\textbf{Prompt-Based Multi-agent Learning} \quad Collaboration among multiple LLM agents has shown effective for various tasks____. However, employing a static architecture without team optimization may restrict the performance and generalization. ____ selects a fixed number of agents from a set of manual prompt candidates via an additional LLM during each round of discussion. %____ adapt a dynamic directed acyclic graph structure with three LLM roles—the proposer, verifier, and reporter—to iteratively propose, validate, and compile reasoning steps into a comprehensive solution. 
____ unify language agent systems by describing them as optimizable computational graphs and develop optimization methods for nodes and edges, enabling automatic improvements of agent prompts and inter-agent orchestration. ____ employ a layered network to formulate the process of LLM-agent collaboration for arbitrary tasks and introduce an unsupervised algorithm to optimize the team of agents by the individual contributions of agent.
