\section{Feasibility Studies}
We conducted human subject evaluations to assess the feasibility of AI-enabled coaching in enhancing collaborative task execution. The IRB-approved experimental protocols were designed to evaluate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Q1.}] Is \coach capable of learning a useful team model?
    \item[\textbf{Q2.}] Is \coach capable of improving team performance?
    \item[\textbf{Q3.}] Is \coach perceived as useful by human users?
\end{itemize}

The evaluations consisted of two studies: training and validation. Both studies involved dyadic teams completing two collaborative tasks. In the training study, we curated a novel dataset of human demonstrations, annotated with intents, to train \coach. In the validation study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial\footnote{Validation Study: The experimental group received coaching from \coach, while the control group completed tasks without any AI-enabled coaching.} to evaluate the objective performance of Socratic and gather subjective feedback from participants regarding AI-enabled coaching.
