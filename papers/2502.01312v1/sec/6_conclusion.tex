\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present CleanPose, the first solution that addresses the confounders in category-level pose estimation from the perspective of causal learning.
Motivated by pivotal observation that humans can learn inherent causality beyond biases, we develop a causal inference framework based on front-door adjustment. We formulate the modeling of crucial causal variables in pose estimation task. Guided by the causal modeling, we devise an effective data sampling method and a adaptive feature fusion module to achieve unbiased estimation.
Furthermore, we propose a residual knowledge distillation network to transfer rich 3D category information, providing comprehensive category-specific guidance.
Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks REAL275, CAMERA25 and HouseCat6D demonstrate that CleanPose can significantly improve performance, showing the effectiveness of our method.
