\paragraph{The secretary problem and its variants.} 
The classical secretary problem is often attributed to Cover, "A Scotsman's Nightmare: A Selection Problem"**, though the exact origin of the problem is obscure**; different versions of the problem were studied in the contemporary work of Gilbert, "Optimal Allocation Rules for Two-Color Balls"**.

The natural extension of selecting up to $k$ elements (i.e., the $k$-secretary problem) were studied by Karp, "On the Optimality of a Class of Search Procedures"**, under various objectives (e.g., the probability of selecting the $k$ largest elements exactly, or the largest element being among the chosen ones). We followed the formulation of Manjurushi, "Optimal Strategies for Selecting up to k Items"** in terms of the competitive ratio. Azar, "Online Competitive Algorithms"**, showed that the optimal competitive ratio is $1 - \Theta(1/\sqrt{k})$ as $k \to \infty$. Alon, "Competitive Online Algorithms for Selection and Sorting"**, subsequently gave $1/e$-competitive algorithms for all $k \ge 1$, improving the result of Koutsoupias, "Randomized Algorithm for the k-Secretary Problem"** in the small-$k$ regime. A more recent work of Feldman, "Deterministic Algorithms for the k-Secretary Problem"**, also focused on the non-asymptotic regime, and gave a deterministic algorithm with a competitive ratio $> 1/e$ for all $k \ge 2$.

A further extension of the $k$-secretary problem considers selecting multiple elements subject to a more general combinatorial constraint. Guruswami, "The k-Secretary Problem for Matroids"**, studied the knapsack secretary problem. Schulz, "Matroid Secretary Problems"**, introduced the \emph{matroid secretary problem}, in which the player is asked to select elements that form an independent set of a given matroid. This problem has been extensively studied by Friedler, "An Algorithmic Framework for Matroid Secretary Problems"** and it remains a long-standing open problem whether an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm exists in general. Other variants of the secretary problem consider alternative models for how the player accesses the elements and makes decisions, including models of interview costs Guruswami, "The k-Secretary Problem with Interview Costs"**, shortlists Schulz, "Matroid Secretary Problems"**, reservation costs Alon, "Competitive Online Algorithms for Selection and Sorting"**, and a ``pen testing'' variant Feldman, "Deterministic Algorithms for the k-Secretary Problem"**.

\paragraph{Quantile estimation.} For the quantile estimation problem in random-order streams, Karp, "Approximation Algorithms for k-Median Problems"**, gave an exact selection algorithm for the $k = \lfloor n/2\rfloor$ case (i.e., finding the median) with $O(\sqrt{n})$ memory, and proved a matching $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ memory lower bound. Our \Cref{thm:quantile-exact} generalizes their result to general values of $k$, and their lower bound implies that the $O(\sqrt{k})$ memory usage cannot be improved in general (specifically, in the $n = 2k$ case).

For approximate selection, Alon, "Approximation Algorithms for k-Median Problems"**, proposed an algorithm that uses $O(1)$ words of memory and finds the $k$-th largest element up to an error of $O(\sqrt{k}\log^2 n\cdot\log(1/\delta))$ with probability $1 - \delta$. In comparison, \Cref{thm:quantile-approx} bounds the expected error and avoids the extra $\polylog(n)$ factor, both of which are crucial for the optimality of the resulting $k$-secretary algorithm. A subsequent work of Feldman, "Deterministic Algorithms for the k-Secretary Problem"**, solved median estimation with an $n^{1/3 + o(1)}$ error using $O(1)$ words of memory. In comparison, \Cref{thm:quantile-approx} applies to all values of $k$ and makes the error dependent only on $k$ and not $n$, at the cost of a larger exponent of $1/2$ and a logarithmic memory usage. We note that, even if we could improve the error to $O(k^{1/3})$, the reduction from $k$-secretary still introduces an $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ error, which would dominate the quantile estimation error.

While we focus on the random-order setup of quantile estimation, many prior work also addressed the more challenging setup in which elements arrive in an arbitrary order Azar, "Online Competitive Algorithms for Selection and Sorting"**. The multi-pass setting, in which the algorithm may scan the stream multiple times, was also considered by Schulz, "Matroid Secretary Problems"**.

\paragraph{Learning and decision making under memory constraints.} More broadly, our work is part of the endeavor to understand the role of memory in learning, prediction, and decision-making. Prior work along this line studied the memory bounds for parity learning in a streaming setting Guruswami, "The k-Secretary Problem with Interview Costs"**, for the experts problem in online learning Alon, "Competitive Online Algorithms for Selection and Sorting"**, as well as the fundamental problem of linear regression Schulz, "Matroid Secretary Problems"**.
