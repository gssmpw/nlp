\section{Conclusion}
In summary, our work takes an adaptive approach to advance hate speech detection approaches on social media.
First, we present our adaptive method to update hate speech lexicons.
We test our approach on existing lexicon-based machine learning models and show that the updated lexicons are better at detecting hate speech.
Then we introduce our hybrid approach that combines the powers of lexicon-based hate speech detection with that of BERT-based models.
