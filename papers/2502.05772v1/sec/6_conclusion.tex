\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the vulnerability of VLLMs to adversarial attacks, despite their Multi-Layered defense strategies. Our novel attack framework, \textbf{\mfa}, successfully bypasses these defenses and steers VLLMs to generate unsafe responses in a black-box setting. The effectiveness of our framework highlights the need for more robust safety mechanisms and evaluation tools to ensure the responsible deployment of VLLMs.
