\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this paper, we propose \textsc{AdaNDV} to address the historically neglected selection dilemma and underexploitation issue of NDV estimators. We propose a complementary perspective of overestimated and underestimated estimators for estimation error correction. Besides, we propose fusing the estimations of the selected estimators to improve the estimation precision through a learned weighted sum, rather than directly estimating NDV. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-life dataset exhibit the superior performance of our method.

We reveal that using existing estimators can bring promising results, however, the representation ability and the implementation paradigm of the estimator selection and fusion may limit the estimator selection precisions. In the future, we plan to develop more powerful feature extraction methods and explore more beneficial model architectures. Moreover, improving the time and space efficiency is another important direction for future work.
