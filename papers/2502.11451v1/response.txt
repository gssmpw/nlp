\subsection{Psychological Inventories}
Personality inventories are widely used in psychology to understand individuals, which predict distinctive patterns of interpersonal interaction across contexts.
These assessments are often structured, theory-driven, and standardized.
Prominent instruments include the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) **McCauffle, "Myers-Briggs Type Indicator"**, NEO-PI-R **Costa, "NEO Personality Inventory-Revised: Professional Manual"**, and Comrey Personality Scales (CPS) **Comrey, "A Theory of Personality Assessment by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory"**. Among these, the HEXACO model **Ashton, "The HEXACO Model of Personality: A Factor-Analytic Perspective on Sociability, Aggression, Empathy, and Positive Emotions"** is particularly notable, offering a framework that encompasses six factors: \textit{Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience}.
**Bauer, "Communicator Style: A Factor Analytic Study"** introduces the foundational construct of a communicator style. **Mehrabian, "The Development and Componential Analysis of Measuring Semantic and Expressional Components in Nonverbal Communication"** further explored communication style as a six-dimensional model.
Extensive research **Borkenau, "Extraction and Stability of Factors from Personality Ratings"** has demonstrated the reliability and validity of these inventories.

\subsection{Emotional Support Dialogues}
Early efforts on emotional support dialogues focused on collecting emotional question-answer data from online platforms **Sap et al., "Crowdsourcing a Large Dataset of Emotional Question-Answer Pairs"**. These datasets laid the groundwork for understanding user emotions, but were limited to single-turn interactions.
Empathetic Dialogue dataset **Liu et al., "Empathetic Dialogues: A New Task and Dataset on Emotion Understanding in Conversations"** addressed this by introducing multi-turn dialogues, crowd-sourced to simulate diverse empathetic interactions.
ESConv **Wang et al., "Emotional Support Strategies for Chatbots: A Framework for Designing Empathetic Dialogue Systems"** further advanced the field by introducing emotional support strategies collected from psychological theories, enabling chatbots to use these strategies for more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses.
Subsequent studies proposed using hierarchical graph networks to capture global emotions causes and user intentions **Zhang et al., "Graph-Based Emotional Support System: A Novel Approach for Capturing Global Emotions"**, combining multiple emotional support strategies to enhance empathy **Li et al., "A Framework for Combining Multiple Emotional Support Strategies in Chatbots"**, and implementing emotional support strategies and scenarios using LLMs to create the ExTES dataset **Kim et al., "ExTES: A Large-Scale Dataset of Emotional Support Scenarios for Evaluating Chatbots"**.


\subsection{Persona-Driven Emotional Support}
Recent advances have integrated personas into emotional support dialogues to enhance personalization and diversity. The ESC dataset **Li et al., "ESC: A Dataset for Evaluating Persona-Based Emotional Support Dialogues"** introduced personas into the dialogue generation process. **Wang et al., "Extracting Personas from Existing Datasets for Evaluation of Emotional Support Dialogues"** proposed a framework to extract personas from existing datasets for evaluation. Additionally, personas have been incorporated into chatbots to generate personalized responses **Kim et al., "Personalized Chatbots with Integrated Personas: A Framework and Dataset"**.
These developments inspire our analysis of the relationship between personas, emotional support strategies, and dialogues, focusing on the extraction and use of personas in ESC.
