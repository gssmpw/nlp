  We present \algname for registration of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) maps, with \emph{zero} access to camera poses, images, and inter-map transforms for initialization or fusion of local submaps. To realize these capabilities, \algname harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, \algname utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, \algname identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where \algname leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of \algname compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, \algname achieves about $90$x smaller rotation errors, $300$x smaller translation errors, and $44$x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle.
  We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.
