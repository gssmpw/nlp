\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present \algname, a semantics-grounded registration algorithm for multi-robot GSplat maps that neither requires access to camera poses or images nor initialization of inter-map relative transforms. \algname harnesses the robustness of semantics to: (a) identify candidate matches between Gaussians across the input maps, (b) compute a coarse transformation aligning both maps from a Gaussian-to-Gaussian registration problem posed as an optimization program, and (c) refine the coarse registration result for high-accuracy fusion of local submaps into a high-fidelity global map. We demonstrate the versatility of \algname across maps constructed by robots of different embodiments, including a quadruped, drone, and manipulator, highlighting the superior performance of \algname compared to GSplat registration algorithms and classical point-cloud registration methods.
