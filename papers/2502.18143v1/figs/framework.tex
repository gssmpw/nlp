	\caption{The overall framework of LightFC-X. It first obtains a spatiotemporal template feature of the target by aggregating the template and the dynamic template features. It then uses the TSAIM module to obtain two single-modality features. Our proposed ECAM module achieves lightweight interaction of template-search area integrated features. The cross-modal integrated feature is concatenated with the search area features from the two modalities and subsequently fed into the prediction head. During training, we first train the model that includes the ECAM module but excludes the STAM module. Afterward, we freeze the model and finetune the STAM module.}
