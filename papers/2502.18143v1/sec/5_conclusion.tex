\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we present a lightweight RGB-X (Thermal, Depth, Event, and Sonar) tracker named LightFC-X, which achieves an optimal balance of parameters, performance, and speed. It includes two novel modules: an efficient cross-attention module (ECAM) and a spatio-temporal template aggregation module (STAM). The ECAM module achieves efficient spatial integration of cross-modal features. The STAM module achieves spatiotemporal aggregation of target appearance templates through module fine-tuning paradigm. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed LightFC-X achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight trackers across several multimodal tracking benchmarks. We expect this work can attract more attention to lightweight multimodal tracking.

\textbf{Limitations.} Although the LightFC-X family achieves a unified lightweight framework, its use of spatiotemporal features remains deficient. With the emerging of sequence-training paradigms, we are interested in how to use the paradigm to enhance the use of spatiotemporal information by lightweight multimodal trackers.
