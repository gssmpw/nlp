As a class of orthogonal design, a number of ZCZ constructions from various aspects have been developed. Typically, one can design ZCZ sequences from perfect sequences (e.g., generalized Chirp-like sequences) as illustrated in \cite{Torii04,Hayashi09,Popovic10}. Hu and Gong \cite{Hu10} presented a general construction of sequence families with zero or low correlation zones using interleaving techniques and Hadamard matrices. Besides, the research works of \cite{Deng00} and \cite{Appuswamy06} showed that complementary sequences \cite{Golay61,Tseng72,Liu13,Liu14} are an useful building component of ZCZ sequences. The algebraic connection between mutually orthogonal complementary sets and ZCZ sequences through generalized Reed-Muller codes was revealed in \cite{Liu14-ITW}. 

Designing multiple ZCZ sets with low inter-set cross-correlation \cite{Tang10} is a challenging task. \cite{Zhou17} pointed out that multiple ZCZ sequence sets with optimal inter-set cross-correlation can also be obtained by extending the method in \cite{Popovic10}. The resultant multiple ZCZ sequence sets have the following properties: 1) each sequence is perfect with zero auto-correlation sidelobes; 2) each ZCZ sequence set meets the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound with equality; and 3) the maximum inter-set cross-correlation of multiple sequence sets meets the Sarwate bound with equality. However, some of the ZCZ sequences obtained in \cite{Popovic10} may be cyclically equivalent, which is not desirable in practical applications \cite{Golomb2005}. To solve this problem, improved multiple ZCZ sets were obtained with the aid of perfect nonlinear functions \cite{Zhou17} and generalized bent functions \cite{Zhang20}. Recently, circular Florentine arrays were employed in \cite{Zhang22} for more ZCZ sequence sets compared to that in \cite{Zhou17},\cite{Zhang20}. The same combinatorial tool was used in \cite{Song21} for sequences with perfect auto-correlation and optimal cross-correlation.
