As a class of orthogonal design, a number of ZCZ constructions from various aspects have been developed. Typically, one can design ZCZ sequences from perfect sequences (e.g., generalized Chirp-like sequences) as illustrated in ____. Hu and Gong ____ presented a general construction of sequence families with zero or low correlation zones using interleaving techniques and Hadamard matrices. Besides, the research works of ____ and ____ showed that complementary sequences ____ are an useful building component of ZCZ sequences. The algebraic connection between mutually orthogonal complementary sets and ZCZ sequences through generalized Reed-Muller codes was revealed in ____. 

Designing multiple ZCZ sets with low inter-set cross-correlation ____ is a challenging task. ____ pointed out that multiple ZCZ sequence sets with optimal inter-set cross-correlation can also be obtained by extending the method in ____. The resultant multiple ZCZ sequence sets have the following properties: 1) each sequence is perfect with zero auto-correlation sidelobes; 2) each ZCZ sequence set meets the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound with equality; and 3) the maximum inter-set cross-correlation of multiple sequence sets meets the Sarwate bound with equality. However, some of the ZCZ sequences obtained in ____ may be cyclically equivalent, which is not desirable in practical applications ____. To solve this problem, improved multiple ZCZ sets were obtained with the aid of perfect nonlinear functions ____ and generalized bent functions ____. Recently, circular Florentine arrays were employed in ____ for more ZCZ sequence sets compared to that in ____,____. The same combinatorial tool was used in ____ for sequences with perfect auto-correlation and optimal cross-correlation.
