abstract = {Graph-based approaches to nearest neighbor search are popular and powerful tools for handling large datasets in practice, but they have limited theoretical guarantees. We study the worst-case performance of recent graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, such as HNSW, NSG and DiskANN. For DiskANN, we show that its "slow preprocessing" version provably supports approximate nearest neighbor search query with constant approximation ratio and poly-logarithmic query time, on data sets with bounded "intrinsic" dimension. For the other data structure variants studied, including DiskANN with "fast preprocessing", HNSW and NSG, we present a family of instances on which the empirical query time required to achieve a "reasonable" accuracy is linear in instance size. For example, for DiskANN, we show that the query procedure can take at least 0.1n steps on instances of size n before it encounters any of the 5 nearest neighbors of the query.},

JOURNAL = {Algorithms},
VOLUME = {14},

NUMBER = {12},

ABSTRACT = {We address the basic question in discrete Morse theory of combining discrete gradient fields that are partially defined on subsets of the given complex. This is a well-posed question when the discrete gradient field V is generated using a fixed algorithm which has a local nature. One example is ProcessLowerStars, a widely used algorithm for computing persistent homology associated to a grey-scale image in 2D or 3D. While the algorithm for V may be inherently local, being computed within stars of vertices and so embarrassingly parallelizable, in practical use, it is natural to want to distribute the computation over patches Pi, apply the chosen algorithm to compute the fields Vi associated to each patch, and then assemble the ambient field V from these. Simply merging the fields from the patches, even when that makes sense, gives a wrong answer. We develop both very general merging procedures and leaner versions designed for specific, easy-to-arrange covering patterns.},

Abacus achieves \\$\\mathcal \\{O\\}(10^\\{-5\\})\\$ median fractional force error at superlative speeds, calculating 70M particle updates per second per node at early times, and 45M particle updates per second per node at late times. The simulation suite totals roughly 60 trillion particles, the core of which is a set of 139 simulations with particle mass \\$2\\times 10^\\{9\\}\\, h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot\\$ in box size \\$2\\, h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{Gpc\\}\\$. The suite spans 97 cosmological models, including Planck 2018, previous flagship simulation cosmologies, and a linear derivative and cosmic emulator grid. A subsuite of 1883 boxes of size \\$500\\, h^\\{-1\\}\\, \\mathrm\\{Mpc\\}\\$ is available for covariance estimation. AbacusSummit data products span 33 epochs from z = 8 to 0.1 and include light cones, full particle snapshots, halo catalogues, and particle subsets sampled consistently across redshift. AbacusSummit is the largest high-accuracy cosmological N-body data set produced to date.}",
