In this paper, we propose \tool, the first LLM-based agent for automated coding environment configuration and Dockerfile generation for Python repositories based on atomic configuration synthesis. With a dual-environment architecture and a Dockerfile generator, \tool~is able to select and change the base image, manage and install dependencies based on action observation and rollback mechanism, and utilize bash commands and existing test suites. Our evaluation of 420 popular Python repositories hosted on GitHub demonstrates the effectiveness of \tool~with an 86.0\% success rate.
