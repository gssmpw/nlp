Research on data filtering strategies for harm reduction has been propelled by the research on biases in LLMs ____ and in pretraining datasets ____. However, critical studies on strategies focused on specific datasets rather than the impact of strategies themselves. ____ analyzed the presence of Hate Speech in the Common Crawl dataset. ____ documented the C4 corpus ____, showing that its filtering correlates with a reduction of terms defining vulnerable groups to discrimination in datasets. ____ tested the correlation between removing toxic contents from pretraining datasets and LLMs performance in toxicity classification, showing that filtering has a negative impact on this task. The survey of ____ on data selection for LLMs provide a marginal and non-systematic analysis of strategies. Finally, the work of ____ on language filtering strategies provide insightful results on the cultural biases embedded in language filters that can determine the exclusion of certain categories of people from pretraining datasets.
