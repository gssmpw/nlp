\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we develop a framework and methodology that allows robots to autonomously explore and navigate unstructured environments to accomplish tasks that are specified using natural language. 
%
Central to our approach is a hierarchical representation built on language-embedded Gaussian splatting that can be run on-board a robot in real time.
We use indoor and outdoor experiments traversing hundreds of meters to show the robustness of our approach and our ability to build large-scale maps and identify semantically relevant objects in diverse environments.
Our method does not rely on the presence of structure or rich semantics in the scene and can be applied in general settings.
In future work, we plan to deploy a distilled LLM on the robot for task decomposition to enable more abstract reasoning of tasks.
While this paper empirically evaluates this method on largely 2D environments, in future work we will consider multi-floor buildings and large environments with elevation changes.
