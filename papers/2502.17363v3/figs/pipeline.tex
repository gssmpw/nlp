    \caption{\textbf{Overview of our proposed KV-Edit.} Given an input image and mask, we separate the image into foreground and background. Here, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ denote intermediate results in inversion and denoising processes respectively. Starting from $\mathbf{x}_0$, we first perform inversion to obtain predicted noise $\mathbf{x}_N$ while caching KV pairs. Then, we choose the input $\mathbf{z}^{fg}_N$ and generate edited foreground content $\mathbf{z}^{fg}_0$ based on a new prompt. Finally, we concatenate it with the original background $\mathbf{x}^{bg}_0$ to obtain the edited image with preserved background.}
