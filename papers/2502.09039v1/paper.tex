\begin{abstract}
While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have demonstrated significant success in image representation, they are often hindered by large training memory and slow decoding speed. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \textbf{L}arge \textbf{I}mages are \textbf{G}aussians (\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduce Large Images are Gaussians (LIG) as a novel representation for large images. LIG is built upon 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) and adopts a variant design for representing Gaussian points. Additionally, we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach to facilitate the optimization of numerous 2D Gaussians. This enables 2DGS-based representation for fitting large images, significantly outperforming existing GS-based methods. While our work primarily focuses on representation and delves deeper into the performance of 2DGS as an image fitter, it is crucial to consider reducing the number of Gaussians for large images to achieve high-quality compression comparable to state-of-the-art Implicit Neural Representations (INRs).
