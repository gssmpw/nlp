\section{Related Work}
Recently, CP, as a method of performing UQ, has been gaining popularity for usage with spatio-temporal data ____. Several works have explored the inductive CP framework for spatial and sequential data ____, including in the operator space ____. In ____, the marginal-CP framework is extended to pre-trained as well as to fine-tuned surrogate models for physical system modelling across an infinite-dimensional setting. Alternatively, error bounds for PDE surrogates have been devised by ____ using set propagation to project the singular value decomposition of the prediction error to the prediction space.

Calibration via marginal and joint conformal prediction yields error bars - pointwise for marginal-CP and domain-wide for joint-CP.}

The usage of PDE residuals under the guise of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) ____ was made popular as an optimisation strategy for Physics-Informed Neural Networks  (PINNs) ____ and has found application in optimising neural operators ____ and soft/hard enforcement of the physical constraints to deep learning models ____. However, they have rarely been used as a tool for providing UQ to the surrogate models, and where they have found application, UQ remained uncalibrated ____. The majority of literature in UQ for neural PDE solvers has been looking at Bayesian methods, such as dropout, Bayesian neural networks, and Monte Carlo methods ____, which lack guarantees or are computationally expensive.
