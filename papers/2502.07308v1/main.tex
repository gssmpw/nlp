\begin{abstract}
We construct a new family of explicit codes that are list decodable to capacity and achieve an optimal list size of $O(\nfrac{1}{\eps})$. In contrast to existing explicit constructions of codes achieving list decoding capacity, our arguments do not rely on algebraic structure but utilize simple combinatorial properties of expander graphs. 
\medskip


% Our construction is based on a celebrated distance amplification procedure due to Alon, Edmonds, and Luby [FOCS'95], and our result can be interpreted as a ``local-to-global'' phenomenon for (a slight strengthening of) the generalized Singleton bound. 
%
Our construction is based on a celebrated distance amplification procedure due to Alon, Edmonds, and Luby [FOCS'95], which transforms any high-rate code into one with near-optimal rate-distance tradeoff. We generalize it to show that the same procedure can be used to transform any high-rate code into one that achieves list decoding capacity. Our proof can be interpreted as a ``local-to-globalâ€™' phenomenon for (a slight strengthening of) the generalized Singleton bound.
%
Using this construction,  for every $R, \eps \in (0,1)$ and $k \in \N^+$, we obtain an \emph{explicit} family of codes $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \Sigma^n$, with rate $R$ such that,\begin{itemize}
	\item They achieve the $\eps$-relaxed generalized Singleton bound: for any $g \in  \Sigma^n$ and any list $\calH$ of at most $k$ codewords, we have, 
\[ \Ex{h \in \calH}{\Delta(g,h)} ~\geq~ \frac{\abs{\calH}-1}{\abs{\calH}} \cdot (1 - R - \eps) \mper
\]

	\item The alphabet size is a constant depending only on $\eps$ and $k$.
	\item They can be list decoded up to radius $\frac{k-1}{k}(1-R-\eps)$, in time $n^{O_{k,\eps}(1)}$.
\end{itemize}
\medskip

As a corollary of our result, we also obtain the first explicit construction of LDPC codes achieving list decoding capacity, and in fact arbitrarily close to the generalized Singleton bound.


\medskip

% The only known explicit construction of codes achieving the generalized Singleton bound are folded Reed--Solomon code and univariate multiplicity codes [Chen, Zhang 2024], both of which require an alphabet size growing with $n$. 


%the alphabet size $\abs{\Sigma}$ of the code $\mathcal{C}$ can be taken to be $2^{(k^k/\eps)^{O(1)}}$.
%
%For any choice $R$, we give an explicit construction of codes with rate $R$, such that  for every fixed list of code $k$, with a constant alphabet size depending only on $\eps$ and $k$. (stuff about ldpc/ additive/linear). Decoding in polynomial time.
