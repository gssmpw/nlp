  \Description{
    The figure shows the five core functionalities of WanderGuide. These functionalities include: Map-less Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance: WanderGuide selects potential waypoint candidates using visual information from the environment. It helps users navigate around obstacles and choose a path to their destination without depending on a pre-existing map. The figure illustrates the robot predicting several possible waypoints, selecting one, and navigating while avoiding a person. Describe Surrounding Environment: WanderGuide communicates details about the environment's layout. In the figure, the system is describing, "This is a long corridor with restaurants on the right. A Chinese restaurant offers dumplings, and further ahead is a Japanese restaurant. There are seats available in the Chinese restaurant, and tall seating on your left. I can also see two chefs preparing dishes." Adjust Detail of Descriptions: Users can adjust the level of detail in descriptions. A concise description might say, "There are Chinese and Japanese restaurants," while a more detailed version could include, "This is a long corridor with restaurants on the right. A Chinese restaurant offers dumplings, and ..." Question and Answering Interaction: WanderGuide allows users to ask questions about their surroundings. In the figure, the user is asking, "What does the Chinese restaurant have?" and WanderGuide could respond, "I can see they have dumplings, but please ask for further menus." "Take-Me-There" Functionality: WanderGuide allows users to request to be guided to a specific location. In the figure, the user is saying, "Take me to the Chinese restaurant," and WanderGuide guides the user to that location.
