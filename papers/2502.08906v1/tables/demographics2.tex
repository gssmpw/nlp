\Description{
The table presents demographic information for participants in the main study, including gender, age, mobility aid used, the age at which they started using the aid, frequency of exploration per year, experiment location, the number of previous visits, and usability and workload metrics (SUS and Raw-TLX). The following describes each participant. P11 is a 59-year-old male who uses a cane, started using it at the age of 29, does not explore per year, participated at the Science Museum with 1 previous visit. P12 is a 59-year-old female who uses a cane, started using it at the age of 43, explores 36 times per year, participated at the Science Museum with 0 previous visits. P13 is a 56-year-old male who uses a cane, started using it at the age of 45, explores 1 time per year, participated at the Science Museum with 0 previous visits. P14 is a 60-year-old female who uses a cane, started using it at the age of 45, explores 48 times per year, participated at the Science Museum with 1 previous visit. P15 is a 59-year-old male who uses a cane, started using it at the age of 24, explores 4 times per year, participated at the Science Museum with 0 previous visits.
