\caption{Error analysis of outputs from MLLM.  We classified the errors into five categories and counted the number of them. Note that a single response could contain multiple errors, so the sum of errors does not match the total output of MLLM.}
\Description{
The table presents an error analysis of outputs from an MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model). The errors are categorized into five types: Wrong Character Recognition, Wrong Object Recognition, Nonexistent Objects and Texts, Misunderstanding User Input, and Inaccurate User Input. It also includes a count of outputs with no errors. The total number of outputs is also provided, and a single response can contain multiple errors. The following describes the findings. For Scene Description, there were 31 instances of Wrong Character Recognition, 6 instances of Wrong Object Recognition, 11 instances of Nonexistent Objects and Texts, no occurrences of Misunderstanding or Inaccurate User Input, 117 outputs with No Error, and a total of 164 outputs. For Q\&A Response, there were 9 instances of Wrong Character Recognition, 6 instances of Wrong Object Recognition, 15 instances of Nonexistent Objects and Texts, 5 instances of Misunderstanding User Input, 1 instance of Inaccurate User Input, 21 outputs with No Error, and a total of 53 outputs.
