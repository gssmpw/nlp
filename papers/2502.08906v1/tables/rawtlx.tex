\caption{Scores for the Raw TLX provided by each participant. Lower total scores indicate a lower workload. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents a lower level, and 10 represents a higher level of Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Effort, and Frustration. For Performance, 1 indicates good performance, and 10 indicates poor performance.}
\Description{
The table presents Raw TLX scores from five participants (P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15), measuring subjective workload across six dimensions: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. Each dimension is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, where higher scores generally indicate higher levels of demand, effort, or frustration, except for Performance, where a higher score indicates poorer performance (1: Good, 10: Poor). Lower total scores signify a lower overall workload.
Participant P11 reported low levels of Mental Demand (2), Physical Demand (2), Temporal Demand (2), and Effort (3). However, they scored higher in Performance (7) and Frustration (8), leading to a total score of 24. Participant P12 had low scores across all dimensions: Mental Demand (2), Physical Demand (2), Temporal Demand (3), Performance (2), Effort (2), and Frustration (4), resulting in the lowest total score of 15. Participant P13 scored higher in Mental Demand (5), Effort (5), and Performance (5), moderate in Physical Demand (3), and low in Temporal Demand (1) and Frustration (1), totaling a score of 20. Participant P14 reported low Mental Demand (3) and Physical Demand (2), but higher Temporal Demand (5), Performance (7), Effort (6), and Frustration (3), culminating in a total score of 26. Participant P15 had low Mental Demand (2) and Temporal Demand (2), but higher Physical Demand (6), Performance (5), Effort (6), and Frustration (7), leading to the highest total score of 28.
