\caption{Rating to seven-point Likert score questions (1: strongly disagree; 4: neutral; 7: strongly agree).}
\Description{The table presents ratings from five participants (P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15) on a set of questions based on a seven-point Likert scale, where 1 indicates "strongly disagree," 4 is "neutral," and 7 is "strongly agree." The median rating for each question is also provided. The following summarizes the responses for each question. For Q1, "I was able to explore the facility," P11 and P13 rated 4, while P12, P14, and P15 rated 6, resulting in a median score of 6. For Q2, "I was able to enjoy the exploration," P11 and P13 rated 4, while P12, P14, and P15 rated 6 or 7, with a median score of 6. For Q3, "I was able to gain an interest in the things around me," P11 rated 4, P13 rated 6, and P12, P14, and P15 rated 6, leading to a median score of 6. For Q4, "The interface of the system was easy to understand," P11, P14, and P15 rated 5, while P12 and P13 rated 6, resulting in a median score of 5. For Q5, "I want to explore where I am familiar with this system," P11, P12, and P14 rated 7, while P13 and P15 rated 6, leading to a median score of 7. For Q6, "I want to explore where I am unfamiliar with this system," P11, P14, and P15 rated 7 or 6, resulting in a median score of 6.}
