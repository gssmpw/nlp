\caption{The statistics of duration time and the count of interactions for each mode (Auto, Conversation, and Manual Control).
The ratio of the duration time is calculated based on the total duration time of the experiment per participant.}
\Description{
The table provides an analysis of the duration ratio (percentage of total time) and the count of interactions for three different modes: Auto, Conversation, and Manual Control. The statistics are presented for five participants: P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15. P11 spent 59.77\% of the time in Auto mode with 25 interactions, spent 37.52\% of the time in Conversation mode with 21 interactions, and spent 2.70\% of the time in Manual Control mode with 4 interactions. P12 spent 91.66\% of the time in Auto mode with 13 interactions, spent 8.16\% of the time in Conversation mode with 9 interactions, and spent 0.18\% of the time in Manual Control mode with 1 interaction. P13 spent 67.88\% of the time in Auto mode with 12 interactions, spent 30.56\% of the time in Conversation mode with 9 interactions, and spent 1.56\% of the time in Manual Control mode with 1 interaction. P14 spent 64.86\% of the time in Auto mode with 17 interactions, spent 33.94\% of the time in Conversation mode with 15 interactions, and spent 1.20\% of the time in Manual Control mode with 1 interaction. P15 spent 58.53\% of the time in Auto mode with 28 interactions, spent 20.03\% of the time in Conversation mode with 19 interactions, and spent 21.44\% of the time in Manual Control mode with 10 interactions.
