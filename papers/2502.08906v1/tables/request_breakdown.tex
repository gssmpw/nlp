\Description{
The table provides a analysis of participants' requests made to the system during conversation mode. Requests are categorized into three types: General Query, Specific Query, and Command Query. The ratio (percentage) and count of each type of request are shown for each participant, along with the total number of requests. The following summarizes the data for each participant: P11 made 11.43\% of their requests as General Queries (4 requests), 45.71\% as Specific Queries (16 requests), and 42.86\% as Command Queries (15 requests), with a total of 35 requests. P12 made 30.00\% of their requests as General Queries (3 requests), 10.00\% as Specific Queries (1 request), and 60.00\% as Command Queries (6 requests), with a total of 10 requests. P13 made 61.54\% of their requests as General Queries (8 requests), 38.46\% as Specific Queries (5 requests), and 0.00\% as Command Queries (0 requests), with a total of 13 requests. P14 made 14.29\% of their requests as General Queries (4 requests), 46.43\% as Specific Queries (13 requests), and 39.29\% as Command Queries (11 requests), with a total of 28 requests. P15 made 8.33\% of their requests as General Queries (2 requests), 25.00\% as Specific Queries (6 requests), and 66.67\% as Command Queries (16 requests), with a total of 24 requests.
