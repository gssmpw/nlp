\Description{
The table presents the usage statistics for different description levels—Concise, Balanced-Length, and Descriptive—by normalizing the duration of each level with respect to the total duration of the experiment for five participants (P11 to P15). P11 used Concise descriptions 0.10\% of the time, Balanced-Length descriptions 76.46\% of the time, and Descriptive descriptions 23.43\% of the time. P12 used Concise descriptions 15.22\% of the time, Balanced-Length descriptions 29.88\% of the time, and Descriptive descriptions 54.91\% of the time. P13 used Concise descriptions 0.19\% of the time, Balanced-Length descriptions 49.14\% of the time, and Descriptive descriptions 50.66\% of the time. P14 used Concise descriptions 0.15\% of the time, Balanced-Length descriptions 87.94\% of the time, and Descriptive descriptions 11.91\% of the time. P15 used Concise descriptions 0.14\% of the time, Balanced-Length descriptions 99.86\% of the time, and Descriptive descriptions 0.00\% of the time.
