\section{Conclusion}  
This paper presents a unified framework for directed link prediction, highlighting the critical role of dual embeddings and decoder design. To address existing limitations, we introduce DirLinkBench, a robust benchmark for evaluating directed link prediction methods. Results on the new benchmark reveal that current methods exhibit inconsistent performance, while our proposed SDGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Based on our findings, we highlight two key open challenges: \textit{1) How can more efficient decoders be developed for complex-valued methods? 2) How can GNNs better preserve in-/out-degree distributions?} We hope this work inspires further advancements in directed link prediction and contributes to the development of more effective and theoretically grounded models.

%This paper presents a unified framework and standardized benchmark for directed graph link prediction, addressing key issues like label leakage, inconsistent dataset splits, and missing baselines. Our analysis highlights the importance of dual embeddings and proper decoder design for accurate predictions. Evaluation results reveal that existing methods struggle to perform consistently across diverse datasets, emphasizing the impact of factors like feature inputs, negative sampling, and decoder design. This work provides a foundation for future research to improve the robustness and generalizability of directed graph link prediction methods.
