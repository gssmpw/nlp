\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper contributes Cyri, a significant advancement in applying AI-driven
solutions for phishing detection and management for human users. 
%Throughout this paper, we addressed the pressing issue of sophisticated phishing attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities through social engineering tactics. Traditional detection methods often fall short in identifying these advanced threats due to their reliance on known patterns and technical indicators. To overcome these limitations, we introduced
Through a systematic collection of semantic features and the tuning of a local LLM to detect them directly in email text, we created a system capable of detecting subtle cues indicative of malicious intent that traditional methods might overlook.
Extensive iterative testing and prompt refinement were conducted to optimize
Cyri's performance. By providing detailed explanations and engaging in conversational interactions through its visual and conversational interface, Cyri helps users understand why an email is potentially malicious and what steps they should take.
This addresses the human factors contributing to phishing success, such as lack of awareness and susceptibility to psychological manipulation.
Cyri achieved good results in detecting and explaining phishing emails and very positive results for efficacy and usability by ten experts and non-expert human users in a task-based evaluation.
In future work, we plan to mitigate the reported limitations of Cyri and explore its use of Cyri not only as a detection tool but also as an educational tool for training and awareness activities.

%with an accuracy of 95.24\%, a precision of 96.8\%, a recall of 93.56\%, and an F1-score of 95.15\%. The model demonstrated exceptional effectiveness in identifying critical phishing features, particularly those fundamental to phishing detection, such as Authority/Impersonation of Trusted Entities, Urgency, and Unsolicited Requests for Personal Information. \\
%A user study involving participants with varying levels of expertise further validated Cyri’s effectiveness. Both experts and non-experts found the application user-friendly and valuable in enhancing their ability to detect phishing emails. Participants noted that Cyri provided information they wouldn’t have noticed on their own, underscoring its educational value.
