\begin{abstract}
Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, exploiting human vulnerabilities through social engineering tactics to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information. Traditional detection methods, such as blacklist-based and heuristic approaches, often fail to identify new or cleverly disguised phishing attempts due to their reliance on known patterns and technical indicators and not on the semantic characteristics of the attack attempt. This work introduces Cyri, an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to support a human user in detecting and analyzing phishing emails by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).\\
Cyri has been designed to scrutinize emails for semantic features used in phishing attacks, such as urgency, authority, impersonation, exclusivity, and undesirable consequences, using an approach that unifies features already established in the literature with others by Cyri features extraction methodology. Cyri can be directly plugged into a client mail or webmail, ensuring seamless integration with the user's email workflow while maintaining data privacy through local processing. By performing all analyses on the user's machine, Cyri eliminates the need to transmit sensitive email data over the internet, reducing security risks associated with external data breaches. 
The Cyri user interface has been designed to reduce habituation effects and enhance user engagement. It employs dynamic visual cues and context-specific explanations to keep users alert and informed while maintaining their experience in using emails.
Additionally, it allows users to explore identified malicious semantic features both through conversation with the agent and visual exploration, obtaining the advantages of both modalities for expert or non-expert users. It also allows users to keep track of the conversation, supports the user in solving additional questions on both computed features or new parts of the mail, and applies its detection on demand.\\
To evaluate Cyri's ability to distinguish between phishing and safe communications, we crafted a comprehensive dataset of 420 phishing emails and 420 legitimate emails. 
%The phishing emails were generated using WormGPT V3.0, guided by carefully designed prompts to embody specific semantic features. Each email underwent meticulous manual review to ensure authenticity and effectiveness.
Through iterative evaluation, Cyri was optimized to reach an accuracy of 95.24\%, a precision of 96.8\%, a recall of 93.56\%, and an F1-score of 95.15\%, demonstrating high effectiveness in identifying critical phishing semantic features fundamental to phishing detection. A user study involving 10 participants, both experts and non-experts, evaluated Cyri's effectiveness and usability in real use, where the participants tested the system on their mail accounts. Results indicated that Cyri significantly aided users in identifying phishing emails and enhanced their understanding of phishing tactics.
%The results underscore the potential of advanced AI models in enhancing cybersecurity measures by not only detecting phishing attempts but also educating users about the tactics employed by attackers. Cyri's integration of detailed explanations and user interaction positions it as both a detection tool and an educational resource, aiming to reduce human error and improve overall resilience against phishing attacks.

%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
%``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If %including 
%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
%``Temperature/K''.

%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section{Topics Used for Phishing Email Generation and Example}
  We generated a total of 420 phishing emails, with 20 emails dedicated to each of
 the 21 identified semantic features. The emails were crafted to cover a wide array of topics relevant to each feature, enhancing the dataset’s heterogeneity.
 In the figure \ref{fig:topicsgenerationemails} are represented the topics utilized for the following features: Authority/Impersonation of Trusted Entities, Instant Gratification(False promise of reward), Exclusivity, Undesirable Consequences, Urgency (Scarcity) and Call to Action.
