\section{Background}
In the following section, we present the key concepts related to this survey: \textbf{(i)}the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), \textbf{(ii)} Neuromorphic Architectures (NMAs) and \textbf{(iii)} Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Furthermore, we propose a Taxonomy for the NMAs, which we argue is necessary, considering the current lack of agreement on how to understand the term \textit{neuromorphic hardware architecture}.
