\subsection{Method}
\label{sec:method}
To identify and select which publications to review in our survey, we adapted systematic and reproducible methods, which are outlined in the steps below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item With the help of the search experts from KTH Royal Institute of Technology library, we crafted a search string aimed at capturing all publications that might be relevant for the study, which we used to search in the Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search string we used was: 
\begin{quote}
    \texttt{( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "spiking model*" OR "spiking neur* model*" OR "spiking network*" OR "Spiking Neur* Network*" OR neuromorphic OR ( ( biological* OR realistic* ) W/3 ( "Neur* Network*" OR "neur* model*" ) ) ) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ( "coarse grained reconfigurable architecture*" OR "coarse grained reconfigurable array*" OR cgra OR fpga OR "field programmable gate array*" OR "reconfigurable architecture*" ) )}
\end{quote}
\item The initial search query yielded more than 2128 results. We filtered and removed any duplicates and also pruned the results by reading all remaining abstracts and discarded publications irrelevant to the study (e.g., targeting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), architectures based on CPUs or GPUs).
\item The remaining 129 publications were read, analyzed in detail, classified according to our proposed taxonomy (see Section \ref{sec:taxonomy}) and included in the survey.
\end{enumerate}
