\subsection{Motivation}

There are many excellent surveys on neuromorphic systems and spiking neural networks (SNNs) from different perspectives, tied to hardware~\cite{schuman2017survey}, specific devices~\cite{davies_advancing_2021} (e.g., Intel Loihi), different models~\cite{shrestha2022survey}, and more. For the prior work surveying FPGAs and SNNs~\cite{maslanka2012survey,mehrabi2024fpga,maguire_challenges_2007}, we found that they are very narrow in scope or outdated and that they do not cover a number of significant areas, including the analysis of trends and projections of where the field would be in the years to come. Hence, this survey is -- to the best of our knowledge -- the most complete review of neuromorphic hardware architectures on FPGAs and includes novel analysis of trends and projections that are not found in any other body of work on the field.
