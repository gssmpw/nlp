\begin{abstract}
Neuromorphic computing is a relatively new discipline of computer science, where the principles of biological brain's computation and memory are used to create a new way of processing information, based on networks of spiking neurons. Those networks can be implemented as both analog and digital implementations, where for the latter, the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a frequent choice, due to their inherent flexibility, allowing the researchers to easily design hardware neuromorphic architecture (NMAs). Moreover, digital NMAs show good promise in simulating various spiking neural networks because of their inherent accuracy and resilience to noise, as opposed to analog implementations. This paper presents an overview of digital NMAs implemented on FPGAs, with a goal of providing useful references to various architectural design choices to the researchers interested in digital neuromorphic systems. We present a taxonomy of NMAs that highlights groups of distinct architectural features, their advantages and disadvantages and identify trends and predictions for the future of those architectures.
