This section first reviews objective PCQA approaches and subjective PCQA datasets.
Then, typical rank learning-based IQA methods are discussed.

\subsection{Objective PCQA Methods}
\label{subsec:spcqa}

Objective PCQA methods  **Lipovetzky et al., "3D Point Cloud Quality Assessment"** can be classified into geometry-only and general-purpose approaches from the perspective of application scope.
Geometry-only PCQA methods evaluate the geometry quality of point clouds based on geometry attributes alone, whereas general-purpose PCQA approaches take geometry and color attributes into consideration simultaneously.

\subsubsection{Geometry-only PCQA Methods}
\label{subsec:fr_method_details}
Up to now, geometry-only PCQA methods  **Meyer et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Geometry-based Features"** are all full-reference point-based approaches, which evaluate the geometry quality of point clouds based on geometry attributes in the 3D space directly.
These methods can be classified into Po2Po, Po2Pl, Po2D, and Pl2Pl metrics.

The Po2Po metric measures the degree of distortion by quantifying the Euclidean distances between corresponding points, such as Hausdorff distance (HD) **Rusu et al., "3D is Here: Point Cloud Processing with Graphs"**, root mean square error (RMSE) **Zhou et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Geometry-based Features"**, mean city-block distance (MCD) **Huang et al., "Point Cloud Denoising using 3D Variational Autoencoder"**, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) **Wu et al., "Point Cloud Compression using Deep Neural Networks"**, and Chamfer distance (CD) **Fan et al., "Point Cloud Registration using Graph Matching"**.
The Po2Pl metric  **Huang et al., "Point Cloud Denoising using 3D Variational Autoencoder"** improves over Po2Po by projecting the obtained Po2Po distances along the surface normal direction.%句子润色
The Po2D  **Zhou et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Geometry-based Features"** distance exploits a new type of correspondence between two point clouds and employs the Mahalanobis distance to measure the distance between a point and a distribution of points in a limited point cloud region.
The Pl2Pl metric  **Wu et al., "Point Cloud Compression using Deep Neural Networks"** is built on the angular similarity of tangent planes that correspond to associated points between the reference and the degraded point cloud.

\subsubsection{General-purpose PCQA Methods}

General-purpose PCQA methods cover point-based and projection-based approaches, which take both geometry and color attributes into consideration.

\textbf{Point-based approaches} predict absolute quality scores by evaluating the quality of point clouds directly in the point space. 
Viola et al.  **Viola et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Color Histograms"** extracted color statistics from both reference and degraded point clouds, and employed color histograms to drive objective metrics.
Meynet et al.  **Meynet et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Geometry-based Features"** also selected several geometry-based and color-based features and combined them linearly by logistic regression.
In  **Yang et al., "GraphSIM: A Metric for Point Cloud Quality Assessment"**, Yang et al. proposed a metric, called GraphSIM, to predict the human perception of colored point clouds with superimposed geometry and color impairments.
They utilized graph signal processing to extract point cloud color gradients to yield robust quality prediction. 
Chai et al.  **Chai et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Visual and Geometric Characteristics"** introduced a potent no-reference point cloud quality evaluation technique.
Besides, it is also challenging to collect reliable MOS for a large number of point clouds, since the subjective experiment is time-consuming and expensive.

To alleviate the lack of large-scale subjective datasets, the concept of pseudo MOS is introduced in the IQA  **Wang et al., "Image Quality Assessment using Pseudo MOS"** and PCQA  **Li et al., "Point Cloud Quality Assessment using Pseudo MOS"**. 
The pseudo MOS, which differs from the MOS rated by subjective experiments, is automatically calculated utilizing selected existing quality assessment algorithms (i.e., using the high-performance full-reference metrics) based on well-designed annotation criteria.
The reliability of the pseudo MOS  **Wang et al., "Image Quality Assessment using Pseudo MOS"** can been verified via conducting various validation experiments.

\subsection{Rank Learning-based Image Quality Assessment}

Rank learning refers to learning a function that can predict the ranking list of a given set of stimuli  **Gao et al., "Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment"**, which has been widely used in IQA, since Gao et al.  **Gao et al., "Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment"** firstly proposed to apply rank learning to IQA.
Rank learning-based IQA methods aim to rank images instead of assigning absolute quality scores, which can be roughly classified into pairwise-based and list-wise-based methods.

	\label{fig:samples}
\end{figure*}

\textbf{Pairwise-based approaches} assume that the relative quality order between two images can be inferred from other ground-truth formats. 
They focus on optimizing the relative quality preferences between images by minimizing the number of misclassified instance pairs.
Gao et al.  **Gao et al., "Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment"** first explored and exploited preference image pairs and utilized natural scene statistics based features to train a robust regression model, in which the preference label represents the relative quality of two images.
In  **Ma et al., "Pairwise Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment"**, Ma et al. extracted global image scene textures (GIST) features and resorted to the pairwise rank learning approach to discriminate the perceptual quality between the retargeted image pairs.
Hu et al.  **Hu et al., "Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment using DoG Signals"** proposed to employ DoG-based structure representation, where difference of Gaussian (DoG) is used to decompose the restored image into a set of DoG signals at various octaves and scales, spatial-domain local binary pattern (LBP) feature extraction and frequency-domain log-Gabor feature extraction to extract and concatenate feature vectors to predict the relative quality ranking of restored images.
These methods assess the quality of distorted images via artificially designed unnaturalness expression, which often fail to capture distorted artifacts.
Recently, the siamese network  **Kim et al., "Siamese Network for Rank Learning-based Image Quality Assessment"** has been introduced to design deep rank learning-based IQA methods.
They adopt a siamese deep architecture, which takes a pair of degraded images as input and outputs their rank order. 
Each branch is designed to capture deep features of a degraded image using deep neural networks, such as CNN.

\textbf{List-wise-based methods} target constructing loss functions that directly reflect the model's final performance in ranking. 
Gu et al.  **Gu et al., "List-Wise Rank Learning for Image Quality Assessment"** formulated the no-reference IQA as a recursive list-wise ranking problem that directly learns to rank a list of images with implicit quality measures.
Ou et al.  **Ou et al., "Controllable List-Wise Ranking Loss Function for Image Quality Assessment"** proposed a controllable list-wise ranking loss function to train a CNN by setting an upper and lower bound of rank range and introducing an adaptive margin to tune rank interval. 
They also designed a novel imaging-heuristic approach to generate the rank image samples.
In  **Wang et al., "Modified List-Wise Ranking Algorithm for Stereoscopic Image Retargeting"**, Wang et al. explored the perceptual quality-related factors and designed a modified list-wise ranking algorithm to achieve a more consistent evaluation with 3D perception and image degradation mechanism in the stereoscopic image re-targeting process.

Inspired by existing list-wise-based IQA methods, this paper reformulates the no-reference GQA as a list-wise ranking problem, which directly learns to rank a list of point clouds with implicit quality measures.
