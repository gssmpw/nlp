abstract = {The top-K problem is an essential part of many important applications in scientific computing, information retrieval, etc. As data volume grows rapidly, high-performance parallel top-K algorithms become critical. We propose two parallel top-K algorithms, AIR Top-K (Adaptive and Iteration-fused Radix Top-K) and GridSelect, for GPU. AIR Top-K employs an iteration-fused design to minimize CPU-GPU communication and device data access. Its adaptive strategy eliminates unnecessary device memory traffic automatically under various data distributions. GridSelect can process data on-the-fly. It adopts a shared queue and parallel two-step insertion to decrease the frequency of costly operations. We comprehensively compare 8 open-source GPU implementations and our methods for a wide range of problem sizes and data distributions. For batch sizes 1 and 100, respectively, AIR Top-K shows 1.98--21.48\texttimes{} and 8.01--574.78\texttimes{} speedup over previous radix top-K algorithm, and 1.44--7.34\texttimes{} and 1.38--31.91\texttimes{} speedup over state-of-the-art methods. GridSelect shows up to 882.29\texttimes{} speedup over its baseline.},
