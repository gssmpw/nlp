\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This work establishes that exact MMS fairness can be guaranteed in settings that permit post facto adjustments to the supply of indivisible items. We obtain tight bounds for general monotone valuations and monotone costs. Our specialized bounds for identically ordered valuations and costs bring forth novel applications of concentration inequalities in the fair division context. The techniques also highlight a distinction between goods and chores in the MMS context -- for the goods case, the problem in the current context corresponds to a vector packing problem. By contrast, in the chores case we have a vector covering problem.   

The framework of adjusted supply provides a meaningful route for bypassing barriers in discrete fair division. In particular, it would be interesting to develop truthful mechanisms for MMS that leverage bounded supply adjustment. Another relevant direction for future work is to consider the framework for achieving envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). Such an approach would complement prior works on EFX with charity (see, e.g., \cite{chaudhury2021little}), which obtain existential guarantees for EFX with disposal, rather than duplication, of goods.
