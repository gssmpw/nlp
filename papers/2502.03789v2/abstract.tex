This work addresses fair allocation of indivisible items in settings wherein it is feasible to create copies of resources (goods) or dispose of tasks (chores). 
We establish that exact maximin share (MMS) fairness can be achieved via limited duplication of goods even under monotone valuations. We also show that, when allocating indivisible chores under monotone costs, MMS fairness is always feasible with limited disposal of chores. Since monotone valuations (and monotone costs) do not admit any nontrivial approximation guarantees for MMS, our results highlight that such barriers for MMS can be circumvented by post facto adjustments in the supply of the given items. 

We prove that, for division of $m$ goods among $n$ agents with monotone valuations, there always exists an assignment of subsets of goods to the agents such that they receive at least their maximin shares and no single good is allocated to more than $3 \log m$ agents. In addition, the sum of the sizes of the assigned subsets---i.e., the total number of goods assigned, with copies---does not exceed $m$. We also address instances with identically ordered valuations. In such instances, the marginal values of the goods conform to a common order across all the agents and the subsets. For identically ordered valuations, we obtain an upper  bound of $O(\sqrt{\log m})$ on the maximum assignment multiplicity across goods and an $m +  \widetilde{O}\left(\frac{m}{\sqrt{n}} \right)$ bound for the total number of goods assigned. Further, for additive valuations, we prove that there always exists an MMS assignment in which no single good is allocated to more than $2$ agents and the total number of goods assigned, with copies, is at most $2m$. 


For fair division of chores, we upper bound the number of chores that need to be discarded for ensuring MMS fairness. We prove that, under monotone costs, there always exists an MMS assignment in which, out of the $m$ given chores, at most $\frac{m}{e}$ remain unassigned. 
For identically ordered costs, we establish that MMS fairness can be achieved while keeping at most $\widetilde{O} \left(\frac{m}{n^{1/4}} \right)$ chores unassigned. We further show that, under additive costs, one can ensure MMS fairness by discarding at most $\frac{2m}{11} + n$ chores. We also prove that the obtained bounds for monotone valuations and monotone costs are essentially tight.
