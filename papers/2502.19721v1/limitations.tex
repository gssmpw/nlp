\section*{Limitations}
Our work studies gender representations in LLMs, specifically through the feminine---masculine spectrum. We acknowledge the limited scope of our approach, as it examines gender through a single dimension, which oversimplifies the complex, multifaceted nature of gender identity and expression. Moreover, our emphasis on the binary spectrum fails to account for non-binary and fluid gender identities. Another critical limitation relates to the phenomenon of \textit{fairness gerrymandering}~\citep{pmlr-v80-kearns18a}, which suggests models may appear to be fair along individual demographic dimensions while exhibiting biases against intersectional subgroups. Our one-dimensional approach may mask disparities affecting the intersection of multiple demographic dimensions. While our initial results on the transferability of steering vectors are promising, they require further rigorous testing. Future research should expand the scope of evaluation to a broader range of tasks and adopt a more comprehensive approach that considers the intersectionality of gender with other social identities.
