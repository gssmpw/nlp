\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces a new method for computing steering vectors to control model outputs related to a specific concept. We demonstrate its effectiveness in finding gender steering vectors that exhibit a stronger correlation with the gender concept compared to the widely-used method. Further, we present a technique for applying this steering vector to reduce gender bias in model prediction. Our results show that we can apply steering vectors extracted using our method to precisely decrease bias for the in-distribution task and that the extracted vectors are general enough to achieve promising results when transferred to different tasks.
