\section{Dataset Construction Details}
\label{app:dataset}
We split the dataset in half into training and validation sets. The results presented in \autoref{sec:extract-results} and \autoref{sec:steering-results} are based on 1600 prompts randomly sampled from the validation split.

\subsection{Target Gender Tokens}
\label{app:gender-tokens}
We construct the target gender tokens based on the following while including tokens of their uppercase and ones added with a prefix space (e.g., ``‚ñÅshe''):

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1cm,parsep=0.1cm]
    \item Female tokens: female, females, feminine, she, her, hers, woman, women, girl, girls, \female
    \item Male tokens: male, males, masculine, he, his, him, man, men, boy, boys, \male
\end{itemize}
