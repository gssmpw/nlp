\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6}
In this paper, we brought out the role of DD domain pulse shaping filters on the individual performance of model-free I/O relation estimation and equalization/detection in Zak-OTFS. The Gaussian and sinc filters reported in the literature were shown to possess complementary strengths with respect to these two receiver tasks, viz., Gaussian pulse shape is good for the I/O relation estimation task but poor for the equalization/detection task, whereas sinc pulse shape is poor for I/O relation estimation but good for equalization/detection. Based on this observation, we proposed a new filter, termed as Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter, which inherited the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter did not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derived closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. Our simulation results with Veh-A fractional DD channels using model-free I/O relation estimation with exclusive and embedded pilot frames showed that the proposed GS filter achieves better BER performance compared to Gaussian and sinc filters (e.g., an SNR gain in excess of 6 dB at a coded BER of $10^{-4}$ in favor of the proposed filter). The GS filter performance in comparison with those of other filters using superimposed/spread pilot (where there will be no pilot/guard regions and consequent loss in throughput) can be investigated as future work.
