We introduced \method, a novel framework for understanding targeted pathways within biological database. \method integrates (1) a protein language model (pLM) for encoding AA-seqs into graph features, (2) \classifier, a hybrid model to capture local and global dependencies, and (3) \explainer, a subgraph learning module that identifies key nodes and edges via trainable pathway masks. 
% Theoretical analysis highlights the framework's expressiveness, and experiments on a curated dataset of 301 bio networks show improvement over baselines, with biological validation confirming retention of known functional interactions. 
We also introduced ML-oriented biological evaluations and a new metric.The experiments involving 301 bio-networks evaluations demonstrated that pathways inferred by \method maintain biological meaningfulness.
We will release all code and curated 301 bio-network data to facilitate reproducibility and enable future research in data-specific bio-network inference.
Future work will expand \method to analyze other types of bio-networks, enabling broader applications in systems biology and medicine.
