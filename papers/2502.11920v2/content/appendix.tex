% \section{Lecture description}\label{sec:training-description}

% The following is a detailed description of the lecture used as training for the study participants. The provided timing indications are approximate, and the total time of the training (without a break) is about 90 min. The training requires a whiteboard (or another means to quickly draw ADTs in front of an audience). 
% %While the alloted lecture time is 105 minutes, this time also needed to include a break and time for questions, the actual lecture time was closer to 75 minutes.

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \setlength{\itemindent}{\qIndent}
%     \item[6 Min.:] Threat modeling in the context of risk management (why threat modeling is used). The main goals of threat modeling (analysis and communication of threats), as well as why threat modeling is valuable.
%     \item[8 Min.:] Short description of some specific threat modeling methods (STRIDE, Cyber Kill Chain) with examples and clarifications in which contexts they apply. 
%     \item[8 Min.:] Introduction to attack graphs. This introduces the idea of graphs (in graph theory) and how they can be used to model attacks.  
%     \item[15 Min.:] Introduction to attack trees (ATs). This includes how they were developed, the core AT components and design rules (nodes, refinements, levels of abstraction, requirements related to the shape of the tree), a short explanation of how they differ from attack graphs, and how they are read. The lunch example from \cite[Fig. 1]{mauwFoundationsAttackTrees2006} is used to demonstrate attack trees. 
%     \item[20 Min.:] 1st interactive activity. Participants work with the people near them to create an attack tree of a scenario of their choice. Volunteers are asked to draw their attack trees on whiteboards at the front of the lecture hall. After these are drawn, the students present their attack trees and then the lecturer discusses the merits, construction issues, and avenues for improvement as a learning exercise. Trees are NOT erased from the whiteboard as they will be used in the next section. At this moment, the lecturer also encourages questions from the audience about the model.
%     \item[10 Min.:] Introduction of defense nodes and ADTs, along with their construction rules (one child node of the opposite type). Examples from \cite{kordyAttackdefenseTrees2014} are used as support material. 
%     \item[15 Min.:] 2nd interactive activity. Participants take their ATs from the previous activity and attach defense nodes to them. Participants are also encouraged to think of attacks against their countermeasures. Countermeasures for the ATs drawn on the whiteboard (from the previous activity) are discussed as a class and drawn by the lecturer.
%     \item[8 Min.:] Overview of ADT expansions. This includes models such as \SAND\ trees (examples from \cite{jhawarAttackTreesSequential2015}) and Bayesian ATs (examples from \cite{meyurBayesianAttackTree2020}). This is not necessary to understand the core concepts of ADTs, but is included to show that ADTs are a flexible tool.
% \end{enumerate}

% To adapt this to the industry context, the lecture could be shortened to remove the description of other threat modeling methods and the overview of ADT expansions. Further, the interactive activities could be tailored to the needs of the audience (using the target systems as scenarios, changing the duration, etc.).

That is to say that children are on a different level of abstraction from their children. Some children may be poorly related, but are representative of a different level of abstraction. No children that are sequential steps are present & There are some nodes with poor relationships to their parents. An example would be a standard attack tree with a child that is a sequential step as opposed to a component (poor abstraction). Further, several poorly related children (that are still correctly abstracted) could also classify here & Many child nodes have poor relationships to their parents. This can include children which should belong on the same level of abstraction as their parent (i.e. not a child) or children that are unrelated to the parent. Significant examples of sequential step children (i.e. kill chains appended to ADT nodes) would be classified here \\
