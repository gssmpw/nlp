\section{Small Study}\label{sec:small-study-q}

%\textbf{Consent.}
%This section consisted of a single question explaining the study goals and the data collected, and asking if participants consented to have their responses included in this study.

\noindent\textbf{ADT 1.}
The ADT for the following questions was created by Buldas~\etal\. It can be found on page four labeled as Figure~1~\cite{buldasAttributeEvaluationAttack2020}.

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemindent}{\qsIndent}
\item[\surveyq{SS-Q2}]  How many leaf nodes are in this ADT?
\item[\surveyq{SS-Q3}]  How many root nodes are in this ADT?
\item[\surveyq{SS-Q4}]  How many different attack vectors are represented by this ADT?
\item[\surveyq{SS-Q5}]  The attack tree is easy to understand
\item[\surveyq{SS-Q6}]  I prefer this attack tree to a written description of this attack
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{ADT 2.}
The ADT for the following questions is shown in Figure~\ref{img:ss-adt2}.

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemindent}{\qsIndent}
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q7}] How many attack leaf nodes are in this ADT?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q8}] How many different attack vectors are represented by this ADT?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q9}] How many attack vectors do not have a defense?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q10}] The attack tree is easy to understand
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q11}] I prefer this attack tree to a written description of this attack
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{ADT 3.}
The ADT for the following questions was created by Mauw and Oostdijk~\cite{mauwRFIDCommunicationBlock}.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemindent}{\qsIndent}
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q12}] How many attack vectors do not have a defense?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q13}] How many different attack vectors are represented by this ADT?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q14}] How many levels of abstraction are present in this ADT?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q15}] The attack tree is easy to understand
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q16}] I prefer this attack tree to a written description of this attack
\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{ADT 4.}
The ADT for the following questions was created by Kordy~\etal\ can be found on page 58 of that work labeled Figure~1~\cite{kordyAttackdefenseTrees2014}.

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemindent}{\qsIndent}
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q17}] Is the overall goal kept? Why or why not?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q18}] How many levels of abstraction are present in this ADT?
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q19}] The attack tree is easy to understand
    \item[\surveyq{SS-Q20}] I prefer this attack tree to a written description of this attack
