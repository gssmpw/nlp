1. structure of bitstream (preemptive reconfiguration, loopbreaker)

2. How much time required during address 'select'?

3. remove ILA from design (so more adders can be accommodated)

70 cycles for the header and next 150 cycles for loading the address



adder# 474 error when 1000 adders are used

when we run 50 times, 37 times adders are getting impacted: attack success =74\%.

100 attempts, 75 faults: attack success=75\%.

200 attempts, 150 faults: attack success=75\%

300, 223 faults, attack success=74.3\%

500, 372 faults, attack success=74.4\%


 Fine-granularity of attacks.

Histogram: (10000)
500 adders: 10 bins, each bin getting attacked. two separate plots for two adder clusters.


Plot:
****
How many times encoder 1 failed?
encoder 2 failed?
adder cluster 1 error?
adder cluster 2 error?

plot with 4 bars 
y-axis: no of times there was an error.

add another aes in CoRQ to increase utilization.
