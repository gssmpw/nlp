\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.1cm}
We have presented FLARE, a novel fault attack that specifically targets the process of partial reconfiguration of a bitstream, and manipulates the configuration address of the bitstream. Experiments on several design modules demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE in causing faulty computation by these modules as well as DoS.  Simultaneously impacting multiple tenants while reducing the chance of detection highlights the severity of FLARE in multi-tenant FPGA environments.
