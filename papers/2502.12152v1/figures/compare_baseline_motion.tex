  \caption{\textbf{Getting up comparison with G1 controller}. 
  G1 controller uses a handcrafted motion trajectory, which can be divided into three phases, while our \ours learns a continuous and more efficient whole-body getting-up motion.
  Our \ours enables the humanoid to get up within 6 seconds, half of the G1 controller's 11 seconds of control.
  (a), (b), and (c) record the corresponding mean motor temperature of the upper body, lower body, and waist, respectively. G1's default controller's execution causes the arm motors to heat up significantly, whereas our policy makes more use of the leg motors that are larger (higher torque limit of 83N as opposed to 25N for the arm motors) and thus able to take more load.
