  \caption{\textbf{Real-world results}. We evaluate \ours (ours) in several real-world setups that span diverse surface properties, including both man-made and natural surfaces, and cover a wide range of roughness (rough concrete to slippery snow), bumpiness (flat concrete to tiles), ground compliance (completely firm concrete to being swampy muddy grass), and slope (flat to about $10^\circ$). We compare \ours with G1's built-in getting-up controller and our \ours w/o posture randomization (PR). \ours succeeds more consistently (78.3\% vs 41.7\%) and can solve terrains that the G1's controller can't.
