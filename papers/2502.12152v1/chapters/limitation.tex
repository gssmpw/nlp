\section{Limitations}
\ours has several limitations: 1) It relies on high-performance physics platforms like IsaacGym~\cite{IsaacGym21} to simulate contact-rich tasks such as getting up and rolling over. 
However, current robotics simulators lag behind those in animation and gaming, limiting the accuracy and efficiency of contact dynamics simulation, advancements like Genesis~\cite{Genesis24} and Mujoco Playground~\cite{MujocoPlayground25} are helpful.
2) The RL process in \ours is a under-specified problem~\cite{TaskSpecificationProblem22,RewardHackingBlog24}, making it difficult to ensure that the learned motion aligns precisely with human-like behavior. 
\eg, our discovered motion tends to raise hands for balance.
