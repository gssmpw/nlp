\noindent \emph{\textbf{Limitations.}} Although we demonstrate our attack's ability to influence the output of ORB-SLAM3 and OpenVINS in ILLIXR, we have not accomplished full control of SLAM systems.
Full control of a SLAM system is difficult because most modern SLAM systems are complicated and hard to reverse engineer. One potential method to improve control is to utilize Neural-SLAM \cite{chaplot2020learning,zhang2017neural,liso2024loopy} to reverse engineer the relationship between the sensor input and output, and then exploit the transferability of attacks to attack targeted SLAM systems. A second limitation of our work is that we did not demonstrate an effective visual effect on a real headset by applying the ultrasonic sound with the gyroscope resonant frequency, although we show this approach's feasibility in ORB-SLAM3 and ILLIXR. This kind of manipulation of gyroscope readings has been demonstrated in acoustic experiments by other related work \cite{trippel2017walnut,son2015rocking,wang2017sonic}.

\noindent \emph{\textbf{Potential Mitigations.}} Here, we propose potential methods to mitigate our acoustic attack for future study. We consider two categories of mitigations: \textbf{(1) Hardware}: A traditional defense against acoustic attacks on IMUs designing and building secure hardware (\eg an LPF that has a transition band that does not overlap the accelerometerâ€™s resonant frequency, an amplifier that can accept the large amplitude inputs that are generated under acoustic interference, acoustic resonant frequencies filtering prior to the amplifier with another LPF or band-stop filter \cite{trippel2017walnut}, ADC-Bank \cite{zhang2023adc}); \textbf{(2) Software}: Some cheaper methods to defend against acoustic attack may exist in the software layer. For example, we can use sampling methods to secure IMU outputs (\eg randomized sampling, 180$^{\circ}$ out-of-phase sampling \cite{trippel2017walnut}). However, to implement this method, a corresponding SLAM algorithm is needed because this kind of sampling method will either slightly change either the IMU readings or the frequency of the IMU readings. Another potential method for mitigating our attack, specifically targets XR systems by utilizing cloud services such as spatial anchors \cite{microsoftSpatialAnchors} to make sure that virtual objects cannot be moved abnormally.
