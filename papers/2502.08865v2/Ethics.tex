\section{Ethics Considerations and Compliance with Open Science Policy}
\label{sec:ethics}

\noindent \textbf{Research ethics.} All experiments in this paper were conducted on a private testbed in the lab, ensuring that no harm was inflicted on external users and no risks were posed to them. Our experiments did not affect any users because the experimental setup with the XR headset placed on the remote-controlled car enabled controlled remote experiments, and eliminated the need for users to be physically present during the acoustic sound playback.
% We have disclosed the findings and associated code to Microsoft.
% \yicheng{Should we mention about IRB approval? Also, we may need to disclose our findings to Microsoft (Yicheng can help it). Since our attack does not work well on Quest, maybe we don't need to disclose to Meta? }

% We have disclosed the findings and associated code to NVIDIA. Additionally, we have started the disclosure process with DRAM manufacturers, Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix, whose products are discussed in this paper. We will adhere to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure protocols to ensure that public disclosure is coordinated with the relevant vendors.



\noindent \textbf{Compliance with Open Science Policy.} 
We are committed to sharing the code and data utilized in this paper, as we have done in prior projects. In full compliance with the Open Science Policy, we recognize the importance of transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in our results.

% However, we also acknowledge that premature disclosure, without private communication with vendors and a comprehensive resolution of the identified vulnerability, could have adverse effects on users of the affected products.
