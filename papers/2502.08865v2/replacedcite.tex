% \textbf{Adversarial Attack}
\textbf{Attacks on SLAM.} 
%With the rise of machine learning, 
The robustness of computer vision systems is being actively investigated. With the emergence of adversarial images in the digital domain by adding optimized noise directly to images____, researchers find that such attacks also exist physically in the real world ____. To fill the gap between attacks in the digital and physical worlds, recent studies have demonstrated that attacks on real-world computer vision systems are practical ____. However, attacks on traditional computer vision methods such as SLAM are relatively less explored. ____ proposes an attack against the scan matching algorithm in LiDAR-based SLAM, while most SLAMs in AR/VR devices rely on different sensors like RGB/depth cameras and IMUs. ____ and ____ mislead visual SLAM by poisoning the images with special patterns, and ____ causes the camera to fail using infrared light. In our work, we demonstrate attacks on Visual-Inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM) by perturbing the IMU readings, rather than cameras, and showing its impact on XR user experience. 

\textbf{Acoustic Injection Attacks.} Among various physical attacks, acoustic injection attacks are attractive due to their low cost. Son~\etal____ were the first to introduce acoustic attacks on MEMS gyroscopes, demonstrating how these attacks could lead to sensor denial-of-service and result in drone crashes. WALNUT____ expanded on this by developing output biasing and control attacks that enable precise manipulation of MEMS accelerometer outputs using modulated sound waves. Wang et al.____ demonstrated a sonic gun, showcasing the vulnerability of various smart devices (\eg drones and self-balancing vehicles) to acoustic attacks. Tu et al. ____ designed side-swing and switching attacks to alter the outputs of MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers. Furthermore, Ji et al. ____ fool the object detectors by applying acoustic attack to the image stabilizers commonly used in modern cameras. However, none of the existing works study the relationship between the acoustic injections and SLAM outputs on recent XR devices.

\textbf{XR Security and Privacy.} 
%Security and privacy concerns in XR systems have gained significant attention. 
For single-user XR systems, researchers have demonstrated various side-channel attacks to extract sensitive information (\eg keystrokes) through video feeds____, head movements____, architectural hints____, power usage____, and EM side-channel leakages____. In multi-user XR systems, Su et al.____ use avatar motion data to infer keystrokes in shared VR environments. Slocum et al.____ reveal vulnerabilities in the shared state frameworks of multi-user AR. Similarly, Lebeck et al.____ highlight risks like deceptive virtual objects and emphasize access control for managing shared physical and virtual spaces. Ruth et al.____ further propose a secure multi-user AR framework focusing on content sharing and permissions.
Chandio et al.____ %introduced a multi-modal spatiotemporal attack that 
simultaneously manipulated visual and inertial sensors to disrupt XR pose estimation. However, their study evaluated the attack using offline datasets and assumed the attacker's capability to manipulate IMU data streams through acoustic means, without real experiments. Ours is the first to demonstrate acoustic injection attacks on recent XR devices, like the Hololens 2, in the real world.
