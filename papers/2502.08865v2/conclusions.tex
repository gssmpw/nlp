\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This work demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting acoustic injection attacks on XR headsets to manipulate the user interface and compromise user experience. By targeting the inherent vulnerabilities of IMU sensors within XR headsets, we establish a novel attack vector that can significantly impact the security and usability of these devices.
Notably, we successfully demonstrate a snapback attack on a real-world Hololens 2 device, showcasing the practical implications of this vulnerability through four proof-of-concept attacks.
Future work includes exposing vulnerabilities of additional headset models and improving XR processing pipelines to mitigate the effects of acoustic attacks on the visual display.
