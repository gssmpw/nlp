% OUTLINE:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Acknowledge out-of-plane vibration (discuss usefulness but mention we ignored it and got good agreement)
%     \item Acknowledge the question of direct drive vs. the indirect drive we had...
%     \item Acknowledge that the gripper worked with varying contact surfaces (plane-plane, plane-line, plane-point + plane-lines)
%     \item Mention that the model seems sufficient to predict motion at a small scale
%     \item Other limitations?
% \end{itemize}
