% Ken's alternate wording
Our research demonstrated a method for achieving vertical transport of grasped parts using vibratory fingertip motions to induce periodic sticking and slipping phases of motion. 
%
A theoretical model of the process was proposed and validated. 
%
It was used to show analytically that large normal forces and rapid achievement of large accelerations are key to realizing vertical transport. 
%
We achieved rapid onset of gripper pad motion by using impact-induced accelerations. 
%
Experiments confirmed our analytical model and a gripper demonstrated the ability of our method to vertically transport a wide variety of parts. 
%
We envision this work being used for robotic in-hand planar manipulation using multiple vibration sources and closed-loop grasp force modulation.
%
A gripper with two planar manipulation capable surfaces and individually controllable finger joints could easily perform holonomic spatial manipulation in a mechanically simple package.
%
Furthermore, in-hand manipulation during a power grasp could be achieved by placing multiple of these surfaces along each phalanx of a multi-fingered, multi-link hand.
