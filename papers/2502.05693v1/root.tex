\addtolength{\textheight}{-18cm}   
% This command serves to balance the column lengths
% on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
% the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
% This command does not take effect until the next page
% so it should come on the page before the last. Make
% sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
