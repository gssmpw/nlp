We consider the following three methods for employing large language models (LLMs) to create Alloy formulas to investigate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in writing Alloy:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf English to Alloy}. We employ LLMs to write complete Alloy formulas in multiple different ways from given natural language descriptions (in English);
\item
{\bf Alloy to Alloy}. We employ LLMs to create multiple alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with respect to given formulas in Alloy; and
\item
{\bf Sketch to Alloy}. We employ LLMs to complete sketches~\cite{SolarLazemaPhD2008,WangETALABZ2018ASketch} of Alloy
formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy
expressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately
represent the desired properties (that are given in natural language).  \end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:workflow} graphically illustrates our approach.
For each synthesis or sketching task, we create an input query for the LLM such that the query contains the target property in natural language or Alloy (depending on the kind of task), run the query, get the LLM's output, and run the Alloy analyzer to validate it with respect to a ground truth formula, which we provide to the analyzer. There are three possible outcomes of running the Alloy analyzer: (1) the LLM's answer is correct (when the analyzer does not find a counterexample to the equivalence of the LLM's answer and ground truth); (2) the LLM's answer has a syntax error (when the analyzer fails to compile the LLM's answer); and (3) the LLM's answer is wrong (when the analyzer finds a counterexample to the equivalence of the LLM's answer and ground truth). Note for "Alloy to Alloy" synthesis tasks, the ground truth formula is the reference formula given as input to the LLM. Note also that for any "English to Alloy" synthesis task and for any "Sketch to Alloy" sketching task, the input to the LLM does not include the ground truth formula.

We employ the LLMs directly as available for public use.  Specifically, we do not fine-tune them.  Moreover, the queries we write are minimalistic in their description of the problem domain and do not provide instructions to the LLM on how to approach solving any given task.

\subsection{Subject tasks}

We use \NumSubjects~well-known properties of graphs and binary relations to create \NumTotalTasks~tasks for the LLMs to answer.  Three of the properties (DAG, Cycle, and Circular) are regarding edge-labeled graphs, and the remaining eight properties (Connex, Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive, Antisymmetric, Irreflexive, Functional, and Function) are regarding binary relations.  In Alloy, in general, we can use one signature $S$ and one binary relation $r: S\times S$ to represent either an edge-labeled graph or a binary relation. However, in view of the specific domain of graphs, we name the signature `\CodeIn{Node}' and the binary relation `\CodeIn{link}' when creating the tasks relating graph properties. For the tasks relating properties of binary relations, we name the signature `\CodeIn{S}' and the relation `\CodeIn{r}'.

For each property, we create 2~kinds of synthesis tasks: (1) create 20~unique Alloy formulas that represent the given natural language description of the property; and (2) create 20~unique Alloy formulas that are equivalent to the given Alloy formula that captures the property, which is also included as a natural language comment in the prompt.  In addition, for each property, we create one sketching task: complete the given sketch of the property with respect to its natural language description that is included as a comment in the prompt.  Thus, for each property, we have a total of 3~tasks for the LLM to answer.

Table~\ref{tab:subjects-synthesis} lists each property, its natural language description, and a reference (ground truth) formula that characterizes it in Alloy. Moreover, Tables~\ref{tab:sketches-1-3}, \ref{tab:sketches-4-8} (Appendix), and \ref{tab:sketches-9-11} (Appendix) list each property, its sketch that defines the corresponding sketching problem. Together these four tables summarize the key elements of our tasks for the LLMs. To illustrate, consider the DAG property.  Figure~\ref{fig:three-tasks-for-DAG} describes the actual prompts we run against each LLM for this property.

In a predicate sketch, certain components of the predicate are placeholder holes~\cite{WangETALABZ2018ASketch}. These holes can be of different forms, e.g., comparison operator holes, expression holes, and quantifier holes.  For all our sketching tasks, we only use two kinds of holes: comparison operator holes and expression holes. A predicate sketch includes a definition of the sets of possible values that each hole can be completed with.  These sets are typically defined using regular expressions~\cite{SolarLazemaPhD2008}.  For our DAG sketching task, the comparison operator hole may be completed with one of four possible values from the set \{ `\CodeIn{=}', `\CodeIn{in}', `\CodeIn{!=}', `\CodeIn{!in}'\}, and each expression hole may be completed with one of six possible values from the set \{ `\CodeIn{Node}', `\CodeIn{n}', `\CodeIn{Node.*link}', `\CodeIn{Node.\^{}link}', `\CodeIn{n.*link}', `\CodeIn{n.\^{}link}' \}.
