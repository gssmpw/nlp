1 & DAG & Directed acyclic graph &

all n: Node | n !in n.^link

\hline
2 & Cycle & Graph with directed cycle &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
some n: Node | n in n.^link

3 & Circular & The number of nodes is equal to the number of edges and the graph has a directed cycle that visits all nodes &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
#Node = #link
all n: Node | one n.link
all m, n: Node | m in n.^link

4 & Connex & For every pair of elements in S, either the first is related to the second or vice versa &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s, t: S |
  s->t in r or t->s in r
\end{lstlisting} \\
\hline
5 & Reflexive & Every element in S is related to itself &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s: S | s->s in r

6 & Symmetric & If element x in S is related to y, then y is also related to x &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s, t: S |
  s->t in r implies t->s in r
\end{lstlisting} \\
\hline
7 & Transitive & If element x in S is related to y and y is related to z, then x is also related to z &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s, t, u: S |
  s->t in r and t->u in r
    implies s->u in r
\end{lstlisting} \\

8 & Antisymmetric & If element x in S is related to y and y is related to x, then x and y are the same element &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s, t: S |
  s->t in r and t->s in r
    implies s = t
\end{lstlisting} \\
\hline
9 & Irreflexive & No element in S is related to itself &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s, t: S |
  s->t in r implies s != t
\end{lstlisting} \\
\hline
10 & Functional & Every element in S is related to at most one element (making r a partial function) &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s: S | lone s.r
\end{lstlisting} \\
\hline
11 & Function & Every element in S is related to exactly one element (making r a total function) &
\begin{lstlisting}[style=AlloyTable]
all s: S | one s.r
