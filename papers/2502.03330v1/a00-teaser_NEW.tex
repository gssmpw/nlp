  We present a diffusion-based approach that allows designers to explore large numbers of GUI designs with low-effort inputs. 
Specifically, our model allows designers to input any combination of A) textual prompts, B) wireframes, and C) visual flow direction controls. The model rapidly explores a high number of low-fidelity GUI design alternatives. Here, we present samples generated from different input combinations.
