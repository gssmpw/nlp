This paper summarizes the SUPPLE project's six years of work analyzing the characteristics of successful adaptive interfaces and developing efficient algorithms for their automatic generation. We conclude that personalized user interfaces, which are adapted to a person's devices, tasks, preferences and abilities, can improve user satisfaction and performance. Further, we demonstrate that automatic generation of these interfaces is computationally feasible.},

  abstract = 	 {Fine-tuning large pretrained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter’s effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to $26$ diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within $0.8%$ of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only $3.6%$ parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains $100%$ of the parameters per task.}

of user interfaces, such as requiring that one window be to the left of another, requiring
that a pane occupy the leftmost third of a window, or preferring that an object be
contained within a rectangle if possible. Previous constraint solvers designed for
user interface applications cannot handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities
efficiently. This is a major limitation, as such systems of constraints arise often
in natural declarative specifications. We describe Cassowary---an incremental algorithm
based on the dual simplex method, which can solve such systems of constraints efficiently.
We have implemented the algorithm as part of a constraint-solving toolkit. We discuss
the implementation of the toolkit, its application programming interface, and its
performance.},

Given an application design consisting of a set of views and their location on the screen, we synthesize a relational layout that when rendered, places the components at that same location.  We present an end-to-end system, called InferUI, that addresses the above challenge in the context of Android. The system is based on the following technical contributions: (i) a formalization of the latest and most efficient ConstraintLayout class, capturing a rich set of relational constraints, (ii) a set of robustness properties designed to prevent common layout generalization errors, (iii) a synthesis algorithm that produces relational layouts that generalize across multiple screen sizes and resolutions, and (iv) a probabilistic model of constraints that guides the synthesizer towards layouts preferred by developers.  Our evaluation shows that InferUI is practically effective: it successfully synthesizes real world complex layouts obtained from top 500 GitHub and top 500 Google Play Store applications, succeeds in 100% of the cases when synthesizing layouts for a single device, and correctly generalizes 92% of the views across multiple devices, all without requiring additional specifications.},

They can be used to maintain consistency between data and a view of the data, to maintain consistency among multiple views, to specify layout, and to specify relations between events and responses for describing animations of interactive systems and event-driven simulations. Object-oriented techniques for constraint representation and satisfaction are presented, and a range of examples that demonstrate the practical use of static and temporal constraints for such purposes is presented. These examples include animations of algorithms and physics simulations, and constructing user-interface elements such as file browsers, views onto statistical data, and an interactive monitor or a simulated operating system.},

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have drawn considerable attention across HCI and related fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, leading to new ML-based user interface approaches. Similarly, significant progress has been made with more traditional optimization- and planning-based approaches to accommodate the need for adapting UIs for screens with different sizes, orientations and aspect ratios, and in emerging domains such as VR/AR and 3D interfaces. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in all kinds of computational approaches for user interfaces across different sectors as a community, including those who develop algorithms and models and those who build applications, to discuss common issues including the need for resources, opportunities for new applications, design implications for human-AI interaction in this domain, and practical challenges such as user privacy.},

abstract = {Building on the success of the first workshop on understanding, generating, and adapting user interfaces at CHI2022, this workshop will advance this research area further by looking at existing results and exploring new research directions. Computational approaches for user interfaces have been used in adapting interfaces for different devices, modalities, and user preferences. Recent work has made significant progress in understanding and adapting user interfaces with traditional constraint/rule-based optimization and machine learning-based data-driven approaches; however, these two approaches remain separate. Combining the two approaches has great potential to advance the area but remains under-explored and challenging. Other contributions, such as datasets for potential applications, novel representations of user interfaces, the analysis of human traces, and models with multi-modalities, will also open up future research options. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in computational approaches for user interfaces to discuss the needs and opportunities for future user interface algorithms, models, and applications.},

abstract = {Peridot is an experimental tool that allows designers to create user interface components without conventional programming. The designer draws pictures of what the interface should look like and then uses the mouse and other input devices to demonstrate how the interface should operate. Peridot generalizes from these example pictures and actions to create parameterized procedures, such as those found in conventional user interface libraries such as the Macintosh Toolbox. Peridot uses visual programming, programming by example, constraints, and plausible inferencing to allow nonprogrammers to create menus, buttons, scroll bars, and many other interaction techniques easily and quickly. Peridot created its own interface and can create almost all of the interaction techniques in the Macintosh Toolbox. Therefore, Peridot demonstrates that it is possible to provide sophisticated programming capabilities to nonprogrammers in an easy-to-use manner and still have sufficient power to generate interesting and useful programs.},

Many of these tools have demonstrated significant productivity gains for programmers, and have become important commercial products. Others have proven less successful at supporting the kinds of user interfaces people want to build. This article discusses the different kinds of user interface software tools, and investigates why some approaches have worked and others have not. Many examples of commercial and research systems are included. Finally, current research directions and open issues in the field are discussed.},

abstract = {One of the most difficult aspects of creating graphical, direct manipulation user interfaces is managing the relationships between the graphical objects on the screen and the application data structures that they represent. Coral (Constraint-based Object-oriented Relations And Language) is a new user interface toolkit under development that uses efficiently-implemented constraints to support these relationships. Using Coral, user interface designers can construct interaction techniques such as menus and scroll bars. More importantly, Coral makes it easy to construct direct-manipulation user interfaces specialized to particular applications. Unlike previous constraint-based toolkits, Coral supports defining constraints in the abstract, and then applying them to different object instances. In addition, it provides iteration constructs where lists of items (such as those used in menus) can be constrained as a group. Coral has two interfaces: a declarative interface that provides a convenient way to specify the desired constraints, and a procedural interface that will allow a graphical user interface management system (UIMS) to automatically create Coral calls.},

abstract = {Layout is fundamental to graphic designs. For visual attractiveness and efficient communication of messages and ideas, graphic design layouts often have great variation, driven by the contents to be presented. In this paper, we study the problem of content-aware graphic design layout generation. We propose a deep generative model for graphic design layouts that is able to synthesize layout designs based on the visual and textual semantics of user inputs. Unlike previous approaches that are oblivious to the input contents and rely on heuristic criteria, our model captures the effect of visual and textual contents on layouts, and implicitly learns complex layout structure variations from data without the use of any heuristic rules. To train our model, we build a large-scale magazine layout dataset with fine-grained layout annotations and keyword labeling. Experimental results show that our model can synthesize high-quality layouts based on the visual semantics of input images and keyword-based summary of input text. We also demonstrate that our model internally learns powerful features that capture the subtle interaction between contents and layouts, which are useful for layout-aware design retrieval.},
