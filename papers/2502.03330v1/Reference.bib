  abstract = 	 {Fine-tuning large pretrained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter’s effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to $26$ diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within $0.8%$ of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only $3.6%$ parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains $100%$ of the parameters per task.}

abstract = {The importance of computational modeling of mobile user interfaces (UIs) is undeniable. However, these require a high-quality UI dataset. Existing datasets are often outdated, collected years ago, and are frequently noisy with mismatches in their visual representation. This presents challenges in modeling UI understanding in the wild. This paper introduces a novel approach to automatically mine UI data from Android apps, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human-like exploration. To ensure dataset quality, we employ the best practices in UI noise filtering and incorporate human annotation as a final validation step. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs-enhanced app exploration in mining more meaningful UIs, resulting in a large dataset MUD of 18k human-annotated UIs from 3.3k apps. We highlight the usefulness of MUD in two common UI modeling tasks: element detection and UI retrieval, showcasing its potential to establish a foundation for future research into high-quality, modern UIs.},

This paper presents Rico, the largest repository of mobile app designs to date, created to support five classes of data-driven applications: design search, UI layout generation, UI code generation, user interaction modeling, and user perception prediction. To create Rico, we built a system that combines crowdsourcing and automation to scalably mine design and interaction data from Android apps at runtime. The Rico dataset contains design data from more than 9.7k Android apps spanning 27 categories. It exposes visual, textual, structural, and interactive design properties of more than 72k unique UI screens. To demonstrate the kinds of applications that Rico enables, we present results from training an autoencoder for UI layout similarity, which supports query- by-example search over UIs.},

abstract = {A new web content structure analysis based on visual representation is proposed in this paper. Many web applications such as information retrieval, information extraction and automatic page adaptation can benefit from this structure. This paper presents an automatic top-down, tag-tree independent approach to detect web content structure. It simulates how a user understands web layout structure based on his visual perception. Comparing to other existing techniques, our approach is independent to underlying documentation representation such as HTML and works well even when the HTML structure is far different from layout structure. Experiments show satisfactory results.},

abstract = {Grid-based page designs are ubiquitous in commercially printed publications, such as newspapers and magazines. Yet, to date, no one has invented a good way to easily and automatically adapt such designs to arbitrarily-sized electronic displays. The difficulty of generalizing grid-based designs explains the generally inferior nature of on-screen layouts when compared to their printed counterparts, and is arguably one of the greatest remaining impediments to creating on-line reading experiences that rival those of ink on paper. In this work, we present a new approach to adaptive grid-based document layout, which attempts to bridge this gap. In our approach, an adaptive layout style is encoded as a set of grid-based templates that know how to adapt to a range of page sizes and other viewing conditions. These templates include various types of layout elements (such as text, figures, etc.) and define, through constraint-based relationships, just how these elements are to be laid out together as a function of both the properties of the content itself, such as a figure's size and aspect ratio, and the properties of the viewing conditions under which the content is being displayed. We describe an XML-based representation for our templates and content, which maintains a clean separation between the two. We also describe the various parts of our research prototype system: a layout engine for formatting the page; a paginator for determining a globally optimal allocation of content amongst the pages, as well as an optimal pairing of templates with content; and a graphical user interface for interactively creating adaptive templates. We also provide numerous examples demonstrating the capabilities of this prototype, including this paper, itself, which has been laid out with our system.},

Besides a fundamental and theoretical approach toward these topics, an overview is presented of the COBATEF system. The COBATEF system is a context-based text formatting system, for which a software, as well as a hardware, implementation is available.A unique feature of the system is its automatic text-element recognition mechanism, which is context based and consequently takes advantage of the implicit structure of text. A predefined layout for each type of text element then opens the way for a fully automatic text-processing system in which user control information can be reduced to an absolute minimum.},

abstract = {Effective resizing of images should not only use geometric constraints, but consider the image content as well. We present a simple image operator called seam carving that supports content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion. A seam is an optimal 8-connected path of pixels on a single image from top to bottom, or left to right, where optimality is defined by an image energy function. By repeatedly carving out or inserting seams in one direction we can change the aspect ratio of an image. By applying these operators in both directions we can retarget the image to a new size. The selection and order of seams protect the content of the image, as defined by the energy function. Seam carving can also be used for image content enhancement and object removal. We support various visual saliency measures for defining the energy of an image, and can also include user input to guide the process. By storing the order of seams in an image we create multi-size images, that are able to continuously change in real time to fit a given size.},

abstract = {A new web content structure analysis based on visual representation is proposed in this paper. Many web applications such as information retrieval, information extraction and automatic page adaptation can benefit from this structure. This paper presents an automatic top-down, tag-tree independent approach to detect web content structure. It simulates how a user understands web layout structure based on his visual perception. Comparing to other existing techniques, our approach is independent to underlying documentation representation such as HTML and works well even when the HTML structure is far different from layout structure. Experiments show satisfactory results.},

To clearly formalize and appropriately implement document layout methods for Web browsers, researchers have proposed an approach that uses constraint programming and solving. However, it is still difficult for existing standard constraint solving techniques to handle Web document layout methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a new algorithm called DuPlex that solves hybrid systems of linear constraints and one-way constraints.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for synthesizing robust relational layouts from examples. Given an application design consisting of a set of views and their location on the screen, we synthesize a relational layout that when rendered, places the components at that same location.  We present an end-to-end system, called InferUI, that addresses the above challenge in the context of Android. The system is based on the following technical contributions: (i) a formalization of the latest and most efficient ConstraintLayout class, capturing a rich set of relational constraints, (ii) a set of robustness properties designed to prevent common layout generalization errors, (iii) a synthesis algorithm that produces relational layouts that generalize across multiple screen sizes and resolutions, and (iv) a probabilistic model of constraints that guides the synthesizer towards layouts preferred by developers.  Our evaluation shows that InferUI is practically effective: it successfully synthesizes real world complex layouts obtained from top 500 GitHub and top 500 Google Play Store applications, succeeds in 100% of the cases when synthesizing layouts for a single device, and correctly generalizes 92% of the views across multiple devices, all without requiring additional specifications.},

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have drawn considerable attention across HCI and related fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, leading to new ML-based user interface approaches. Similarly, significant progress has been made with more traditional optimization- and planning-based approaches to accommodate the need for adapting UIs for screens with different sizes, orientations and aspect ratios, and in emerging domains such as VR/AR and 3D interfaces. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in all kinds of computational approaches for user interfaces across different sectors as a community, including those who develop algorithms and models and those who build applications, to discuss common issues including the need for resources, opportunities for new applications, design implications for human-AI interaction in this domain, and practical challenges such as user privacy.},

Computational approaches for user interfaces have been used in adapting interfaces for different devices, modalities, and user preferences. Recent work has made significant progress in understanding and adapting user interfaces with traditional constraint/rule-based optimization and machine learning-based data-driven approaches; however, these two approaches remain separate. Combining the two approaches has great potential to advance the area but remains under-explored and challenging. Other contributions, such as datasets for potential applications, novel representations of user interfaces, the analysis of human traces, and models with multi-modalities, will also open up future research options. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in computational approaches for user interfaces to discuss the needs and opportunities for future user interface algorithms, models, and applications.},

However, one difficulty with the multi-column model is the need for good automatic placement of floating figures. We identify reasonable aesthetic criteria for their placement, and then give a dynamic-programming-like algorithm for finding an optimal layout with respect to these criteria. We also investigate an A* based approach and give two variants differing in the choice of heuristic. We find that one of the A* based approaches is faster than the dynamic programming approach and, if a "window" of optimization is used, fast enough for moderately sized documents.},

Our adaptive layouts for aggregated documents are inspired by traditional newspaper design. Furthermore, our system allows documents to be interactive so that readers can customize documents as they read them. Our system builds on previous work on adaptive documents, using constraint-based templates to specify content-independent page designs. The new templates we describe are much more flexible in their ability to adapt to different types of content and viewing situations. This flexibility comes from allowing the individual components, or "elements," of the templates to be mixed and matched, according to the content being displayed. We demonstrate our system with two example applications: an interactive news reader for the New York Times, and an Internet news aggregator based on MSN Newsbot.},

This translation is followed by a constraint solving mechanism to create the final layout. Grammatical rules provide the mechanism for mapping from a representation of the content of a presentation to forms that specify the media objects to be realized. These realization forms include sets of spatial and temporal constraints between elements of the presentation. Individual grammars encapsulate the “look and feel” of a presentation and can be used as generators of that style. By making the grammars sensitive to the requirements of the output medium, parsing can introduce flexibility into the information realization process.},

The precise function and nature of layout has not, however, been sufficiently addressed within computational approaches; attention is often restricted to relatively local issues of typography and text-formatting, leaving broader issues of layout unaddressed. In this paper we focus on the selection and function of layout in pages that appropriately combine textual and graphical representation styles to yield coherent presentation designs. We demonstrate that layout offers a rich resource for achieving presentational coherence, alongside more traditional resources such as text-formatting and the text-internal marking of discourse connections. We also introduce an integrated approach to layout, text, and diagram generation. Our approach is developed on the basis of a preliminary empirical investigation of professionally produced layouts, followed by implementation within a prototype information system in the area of art history.},

We first define and detail topological properties as abstract relationships between the document components, independent from the output characteristics, and then describe an XML-based layout language based on these concepts, called TALL.A running engine able to transform topological layouts into actual PDF files, based on XSLT and the DDF framework, is presented as well.},

The upcoming HTML5 and CSS3 standards propose features that can be used to build more flexible web page layouts, but their potential to accommodate a wider range of display environments is currently relatively unexplored. We examine the proposed standards to identify the most promising features and report on experiments with a number of adaptive layout mechanisms that support the required forms of adaptation to take advantage of greater screen real estates, such as automated scaling of text and media. Special attention is given to the effective use of multi-column layout, a brand new feature for web design that contributes to optimising the space occupied by text, but at the same time still poses problems in predominantly continuous vertical-scrolling browsing behaviours. The proposed solutions were integrated in a flexible layout template that was then applied to an existing news web site and tested on users to identify the adaptive features that best support reading comfort and efficiency.},

abstract = {Layout is fundamental to graphic designs. For visual attractiveness and efficient communication of messages and ideas, graphic design layouts often have great variation, driven by the contents to be presented. In this paper, we study the problem of content-aware graphic design layout generation. We propose a deep generative model for graphic design layouts that is able to synthesize layout designs based on the visual and textual semantics of user inputs. Unlike previous approaches that are oblivious to the input contents and rely on heuristic criteria, our model captures the effect of visual and textual contents on layouts, and implicitly learns complex layout structure variations from data without the use of any heuristic rules. To train our model, we build a large-scale magazine layout dataset with fine-grained layout annotations and keyword labeling. Experimental results show that our model can synthesize high-quality layouts based on the visual semantics of input images and keyword-based summary of input text. We also demonstrate that our model internally learns powerful features that capture the subtle interaction between contents and layouts, which are useful for layout-aware design retrieval.},

abstract = {Designing layouts that are perceived as pleasant by the viewer is no easy task: it requires a wide variety of skills, including a sense for aesthetics. When numerous documents with different content need to be created, one of the bottlenecks is to manually create appealing layouts for each document. Thus, automation for aesthetic layout creation is becoming increasingly important. Prerequisite for this automation are algorithms to measure aesthetics. While the literature proposes basic theoretical fundamentals and mathematical formulas as aesthetic measures, researchers have not operationalized these measures yet. This paper presents the challenges associated with and the lessons learned from operationalizing 36 aesthetics measures derived from the literature for the context of marketing brochures. We measured the aesthetics of 744 brochure pages from 10 major retailers and found very strong and highly significant correlations between at least 11 of the aesthetic measures, which represent five latent aesthetic concepts. Still, most of the measures were found to be independent in our sample, and they cover a wide range of different aesthetic concepts. Nevertheless, our results suggest that retailers optimize some of these measures more than others. In terms of the aesthetic measures, retailers seem to design brochure pages in the same way regardless of which category products on this page belong to or if it is the first, last, an odd, or an even page. We propose to consider the quality values of aesthetic measures derived from our analysis of the measured brochures as target values for automated document layout creation for aesthetic marketing brochures.},

abstract = {Grid layouts are used by designers to spatially organise user interfaces when sketching
and wireframing. However, their design is largely time consuming manual work. This
is challenging due to combinatorial explosion and complex objectives, such as alignment,
balance, and expectations regarding positions. This paper proposes a novel optimisation
approach for the generation of diverse grid-based layouts. Our mixed integer linear
programming (MILP) model offers a rigorous yet efficient method for grid generation
that ensures packing, alignment, grouping, and preferential positioning of elements.
Further, we present techniques for interactive diversification, enhancement, and completion
of grid layouts. These capabilities are demonstrated using GRIDS, a wireframing tool
that provides designers with real-time layout suggestions. We report findings from
a ratings study (N = 13) and a design study (N = 16), lending evidence for the benefit
of computational grid generation during early stages of design.},

of user interfaces, such as requiring that one window be to the left of another, requiring
that a pane occupy the leftmost third of a window, or preferring that an object be

user interface applications cannot handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities
efficiently. This is a major limitation, as such systems of constraints arise often
in natural declarative specifications. We describe Cassowary---an incremental algorithm
based on the dual simplex method, which can solve such systems of constraints efficiently.

SUGILITE uses Android's accessibility API to support automating arbitrary tasks in any Android app (or even across multiple apps). When the user gives verbal commands that SUGILITE does not know how to execute, the user can demonstrate by directly manipulating the regular apps' user interface. By leveraging the verbal instructions, the demonstrated procedures, and the apps? UI hierarchy structures, SUGILITE can automatically generalize the script from the recorded actions, so SUGILITE learns how to perform tasks with different variations and parameters from a single demonstration. Extensive error handling and context checking support forking the script when new situations are encountered, and provide robustness if the apps change their user interface. Our lab study suggests that users with little or no programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.},

Prior studies have shown that current repair strategies for these kinds of errors are often ineffective due to: (1) the lack of transparency about the state of the system's understanding of the user's utterance; and (2) the system's limited capabilities to understand the user's verbal attempts to repair natural language understanding errors. This paper introduces SOVITE, a new multi-modal speech plus direct manipulation interface that helps users discover, identify the causes of, and recover from conversational breakdowns using the resources of existing mobile app GUIs for grounding. SOVITE displays the system's understanding of user intents using GUI screenshots, allows users to refer to third-party apps and their GUI screens in conversations as inputs for intent disambiguation, and enables users to repair breakdowns using direct manipulation on these screenshots. The results from a remote user study with 10 users using SOVITE in 7 scenarios suggested that SOVITE's approach is usable and effective.},

To enable data-driven app design applications, we present interaction mining -- capturing both static (UI layouts, visual details) and dynamic (user flows, motion details) components of an app's design. We present ERICA, a system that takes a scalable, human-computer approach to interaction mining existing Android apps without the need to modify them in any way. As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps.},

However, finding such design examples is challenging, especially as current search systems rely on only text-based queries and do not consider the UI structure and content into account. This paper introduces VINS, a visual search framework, that takes as input a UI image (wireframe, high-fidelity) and retrieves visually similar design examples. We first survey interface designers to better understand their example finding process. We then develop a large-scale UI dataset that provides an accurate specification of the interface’s view hierarchy (i.e., all the UI components and their specific location). By utilizing this dataset, we propose an object-detection based image retrieval framework that models the UI context and hierarchical structure. The framework achieves a mean Average Precision of 76.39\% for the UI detection and high performance in querying similar UI designs.},

abstract = {User interfaces (UI) of desktop, web, and mobile applications involve a hierarchy of objects (e.g., applications, screens, view class, and other types of design objects) with multimodal (e.g., textual, visual) and positional (e.g., spatial location, sequence order and hierarchy level) attributes. We can therefore represent a set of application UIs as a heterogeneous network with multimodal and positional attributes. Such a network not only represents how users understand the visual layout of UIs, but also influences how users would interact with applications through these UIs. To model the UI semantics well for different UI annotation, search, and evaluation tasks, this paper proposes the novel Heterogeneous Attention-based Multimodal Positional (HAMP) graph neural network model. HAMP combines graph neural networks with the scaled dot-product attention used in transformers to learn the embeddings of heterogeneous nodes and associated multimodal and positional attributes in a unified manner. HAMP is evaluated with classification and regression tasks conducted on three distinct real-world datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that HAMP significantly out-performs other state-of-the-art models on such tasks. To further provide interpretations of the contribution of heterogeneous network information for understanding the relationships between the UI structure and prediction tasks, we propose Adaptive HAMP (AHAMP), which adaptively learns the importance of different edges linking different UI objects. Our experiments demonstrate AHAMP’s superior performance over HAMP on a number of tasks, and its ability to provide interpretations of the contribution of multimodal and positional attributes, as well as heterogeneous network information to different tasks.},

Through an iterative open coding of 73k UI elements and 720 screens, we contribute a lexical database of 25 types of UI components, 197 text button concepts, and 135 icon classes shared across apps. We use this labeled data to learn code-based patterns to detect UI components and to train a convolutional neural network that distinguishes between icon classes with 94\% accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at scale, we compute semantic annotations for the 72k unique UIs in the Rico dataset, assigning labels for 78\% of the total visible, non-redundant elements.},

Existing GUI semantic representations are limited to encoding either the textual content, the visual design and layout patterns, or the app contexts. Many representation techniques also require significant manual data annotation efforts. This paper presents Screen2Vec, a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is inspired by the word embedding method Word2Vec, but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and incorporates screen- and app-specific metadata. Through several sample downstream tasks, we demonstrate Screen2Vec’s key useful properties: representing between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors, composability, and capability to represent user tasks.},

Unfortunately, many apps do not provide sufficient metadata for accessibility features to work as expected. In this paper, we explore inferring accessibility metadata for mobile apps from their pixels, as the visual interfaces often best reflect an app’s full functionality. We trained a robust, fast, memory-efficient, on-device model to detect UI elements using a dataset of 77,637 screens (from 4,068 iPhone apps) that we collected and annotated. To further improve UI detections and add semantic information, we introduced heuristics (e.g., UI grouping and ordering) and additional models (e.g., recognize UI content, state, interactivity). We built Screen Recognition to generate accessibility metadata to augment iOS VoiceOver. In a study with 9 screen reader users, we validated that our approach improves the accessibility of existing mobile apps, enabling even previously inaccessible apps to be used.},

This allows designers to use familiar desktop applications (e.g. PowerPoint, AfterEffects) to prototype rich interactive behaviours. Astral combines and integrates display mirroring, sensor streaming and input remapping, where designers can exploit familiar desktop applications to prototype, explore and fine-tune dynamic interactive behaviours. With Astral, designers can visually author rules to test real-time behaviours while interactions take place, as well as after the interaction has occurred. We demonstrate Astral’s applicability, workflow and expressiveness within the interaction design process through both new examples and replication of prior approaches that illustrate how various familiar desktop applications are leveraged and repurposed.},

This allows for novel cross-device applications that use the watch as both input device and output display. However, despite the increasing availability of smartwatches, prototyping cross-device watch-centric applications remains a challenging task. Developers are limited in the applications they can explore as available toolkits provide only limited access to different types of input sensors for cross-device interactions. To address this problem, we introduce WatchConnect, a toolkit for rapidly prototyping cross-device applications and interaction techniques with smartwatches. The toolkit provides developers with (i) an extendable hardware platform that emulates a smartwatch, (ii) a UI framework that integrates with an existing UI builder, and (iii) a rich set of input and output events using a range of built-in sensor mappings. We demonstrate the versatility and design space of the toolkit with five interaction techniques and applications.},

For publication, the HCI community typically expects toolkit research to include an evaluation component. The problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what ‘evaluating’ a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. To address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. From our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. We identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. We offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy.},

They can be used to maintain consistency between data and a view of the data, to maintain consistency among multiple views, to specify layout, and to specify relations between events and responses for describing animations of interactive systems and event-driven simulations. Object-oriented techniques for constraint representation and satisfaction are presented, and a range of examples that demonstrate the practical use of static and temporal constraints for such purposes is presented. These examples include animations of algorithms and physics simulations, and constructing user-interface elements such as file browsers, views onto statistical data, and an interactive monitor or a simulated operating system.},

Peridot generalizes from these example pictures and actions to create parameterized procedures, such as those found in conventional user interface libraries such as the Macintosh Toolbox. Peridot uses visual programming, programming by example, constraints, and plausible inferencing to allow nonprogrammers to create menus, buttons, scroll bars, and many other interaction techniques easily and quickly. Peridot created its own interface and can create almost all of the interaction techniques in the Macintosh Toolbox. Therefore, Peridot demonstrates that it is possible to provide sophisticated programming capabilities to nonprogrammers in an easy-to-use manner and still have sufficient power to generate interesting and useful programs.},

abstract = {Searching for relative mobile user interface (UI) design examples can aid interface designers in gaining inspiration and comparing design alternatives. However, finding such design examples is challenging, especially as current search systems rely on only text-based queries and do not consider the UI structure and content into account. This paper introduces VINS, a visual search framework, that takes as input a UI image (wireframe, high-fidelity) and retrieves visually similar design examples. We first survey interface designers to better understand their example finding process. We then develop a large-scale UI dataset that provides an accurate specification of the interface’s view hierarchy (i.e., all the UI components and their specific location). By utilizing this dataset, we propose an object-detection based image retrieval framework that models the UI context and hierarchical structure. The framework achieves a mean Average Precision of 76.39\% for the UI detection and high performance in querying similar UI designs.},

abstract = {Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements detection is critical for many GUI automation and GUI testing tasks. Acquiring the accurate positions and classes of GUI elements is also the very first step to conduct GUI reverse engineering or perform GUI testing. In this paper, we implement a User Iterface Element Detection (UIED), a toolkit designed to provide user with a simple and easy-to-use platform to achieve accurate GUI element detection. UIED integrates multiple detection methods including old-fashioned computer vision (CV) approaches and deep learning models to handle diverse and complicated GUI images. Besides, it equips with a novel customized GUI element detection methods to produce state-of-the-art detection results. Our tool enables the user to change and edit the detection result in an interactive dashboard. Finally, it exports the detected UI elements in the GUI image to design files that can be further edited in popular UI design tools such as Sketch and Photoshop. UIED is evaluated to be capable of accurate detection and useful for downstream works. Tool URL: <a>http://uied.online</a> Github Link: <a>https://github.com/MulongXie/UIED</a>},

  abstract = 	 {We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a <em>differentiable</em> loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011). Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.
