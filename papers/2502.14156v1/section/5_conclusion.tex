\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

Our work presents the \ours{} V2X dataset, created through careful data selection, sensor synchronization and localization, and a strong investment in high quality annotations. 
To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first to support a heterogeneous sensor suite in an out-of-domain left hand side driving country, Australia, providing a diverse dataset addition to the field.
We hope that the release of our dataset will facilitate research into 
complex and realistic settings for V2X perception.
Future directions of research include studying communication protocols that ensure both fast transmission 
and directed communication that targets salient information.
