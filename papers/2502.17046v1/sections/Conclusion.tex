\section{Conclusion and Future work}
\label{Conclusions}
To tackle the challenges of generalization in MARL caused by partial observation, this paper proposes a generalizable framework that makes the first attempt to extend MAE in the context of generalization in MARL. Experimental results and ablation studies verify the extraordinary performance of MA2RL. However, our framework does not consider offline settings more relevant to real-world scenarios, as online interaction can be costly. And our framework is limited to various scenarios within one type of game. In the future, extending MA2RL to create a single generalist agent capable of generalizing across different types of games is a promising direction we hope to explore.
