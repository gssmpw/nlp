\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we present \ourshort, a masked autoregression approach for training action-video dynamics models from heterogeneous data. Towards this direction, we investigate the scaling behavior of video models in heterogeneous pre-training. We explore multiple downstream applications in robotics and demonstrate the generality and efficiency of the framework. We demonstrate that real-time interactive video simulation, much faster than previous works, can be learned. \ourshort is also used to evaluate policy training, generate synthetic data, and act as policies.

 
Limitations include the imperfect controllability of the dynamic models with limited data as well as the limited policy performance for action generation. Future works include studying autoregressive policy performance with real robots and complex setups, generating synthetic data at a large scale, and investigating world models for long-horizon planning and model predictive control. We hope this work will shed some light on building interactive world models for embodied intelligence.
