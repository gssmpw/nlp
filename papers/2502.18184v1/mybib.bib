abstract = {How to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) with the minimum resource cost has become a new problem in cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations. However, the new problem is challenging as the cloud-based MapReduce environment is dynamically changing. As a result, a static resource allocation scheme is not suitable for cloud-based MapReduce as resources may be under-provisioning, which leads to violations in the QoS of cloud-based MapReduce, or over-provisioning, which increases unnecessary resource cost. This paper abstracts the problem of cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations as a dynamical optimization problem, and proposes an event-driven resource provisioning framework to solve that problem. This new event-driven framework has been compared with existing popular static resource provisioning frameworks and periodic resource provisioning frameworks by experiments. The experimental results have shown that the new event-driven resource provisioning framework not only guarantees the QoS of those MapReduce computations, but also reduces the running cost of MapReduce computations by 4.87−21.61 percent compared with those static resource provisioning frameworks, and by 1.70−16.12 percent compared with those periodic resource provisioning frameworks.}

abstract = {Query performance prediction, the task of predicting a query's latency prior to execution, is a challenging problem in database management systems. Existing approaches rely on features and performance models engineered by human experts, but often fail to capture the complex interactions between query operators and input relations, and generally do not adapt naturally to workload characteristics and patterns in query execution plans. In this paper, we argue that deep learning can be applied to the query performance prediction problem, and we introduce a novel neural network architecture for the task: a plan-structured neural network. Our neural network architecture matches the structure of any optimizer-selected query execution plan and predict its latency with high accuracy, while eliminating the need for human-crafted input features. A number of optimizations are also proposed to reduce training overhead without sacrificing effectiveness. We evaluated our techniques on various workloads and we demonstrate that our approach can out-perform the state-of-the-art in query performance prediction.},

For long running queries, such feedback can be very useful, for example, to help decide whether the query should be terminated or allowed to run to completion. Although the above requirement is easy to express, developing a robust indicator of progress for query execution is challenging. In this paper, we study the above problem and present techniques that can form the basis for effective progress estimation. The results of experimentally validating our techniques in Microsoft SQL Server are promising.},

abstract = {Many modern software systems provide progress indicators for long-running tasks. These progress indicators make systems more user-friendly by helping the user quickly estimate how much of the task has been completed and when the task will finish. However, none of the existing commercial RDBMSs provides a non-trival progress indicator for long-running queries. In this paper, we consider the problem of supporting such progress indicators. After discussing the goals and challenges inherent in this problem, we present a set of techniques sufficient for implementing a simple yet useful progress indicator for a large subset of RDBMS queries. We report an initial implementation of these techniques in PostgreSQL.},

abstract = {Cloud-based data warehouses are built to be easy to use, requiring minimal intervention from customers as their workloads scale. However, there are still many dimensions of a workload that they do not scale with automatically. For example, in cloud-managed clusters, large ad-hoc queries and ETL workloads must use the same cluster size provisioned for the rest of the workload, and warehouse size does not automatically grow as the underlying data grows in size, causing queries to slow down. In this paper, we describe RAIS, the latest collection of AI-powered scaling and optimization techniques in Amazon Redshift, released in preview at re:Invent 2023, which enable it to scale both vertically and horizontally to adapt to all types of workload variability. RAIS dynamically provisions compute resources to run heavy queries efficiently and automatically optimizes warehouse size for the customer's workload, even as it shifts over time. We show that, depending on the workload, RAIS improves either cost or average query execution time by up to 7.6\texttimes{} and 14.2\texttimes{}, respectively, over existing baselines.},
