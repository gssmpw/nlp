\textbf{Intra-Query Elasticity}. Currently, the database and big data area mainly use ``dynamic query optimization'' to change resource usage during query execution. It can be categorized into three types: adaptive query processing, adaptive query execution, and query re-planning. Adaptive query processing ____ is primarily applied in traditional standalone relational databases. These methods break down a query into multiple sub-queries, re-optimizing subsequent queries based on the results of earlier ones. Adaptive query execution ____ is more common in distributed environments, such as big data and cloud-native databases, and involves running queries in stages, using intermediate results to re-optimize the remaining query. Query re-planning focuses on adapting queries to new computing environments ____ or execution configurations ____, allowing re-planned queries to continue from a checkpoint. However, these methods typically require materializing intermediate results and halting data processing, making them unsuitable for frequent and efficient parallelism tuning.


\noindent\textbf{Inter-Query (Workload) Elasticity}. Current research in the field of cloud databases predominantly emphasizes the runtime elasticity of query workloads. These studies leverage the auto-scaling capabilities provided by cloud vendors to implement elastic computing. Prominent cloud databases, including Redshift ____, Snowflake ____, BigQuery ____, and Azure SQL Database ____, are well-equipped to efficiently support workload elasticity. In addition, serverless computing technologies ____ enable users to execute computational tasks using cloud functions, offering a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional architectures. In this paper, we extend runtime elasticity research from inter-query to intra-query.


\noindent\textbf{Query optimization and scheduling of cloud databases}. Cloud databases primarily rely on rule-based and cost-based optimizers ____. Various machine learning-based query optimization methods have been proposed ____. ____ uses machine learning to determine a near-optimal DOP for query execution. Most query schedulers ____ aim to optimize workloads. Additionally, numerous machine learning-based query schedulers have been developed ____.  However, these methods typically lack the capability for intra-query runtime optimization and scheduling.
