abstract = {Determining the degree of parallelism (DOP) for query execution is of great importance to both performance and resource provisioning. However, recent work that applies machine learning (ML) to query optimization and query performance prediction in relational database management systems (RDBMSs) has ignored the effect of intra-query parallelism. In this work, we argue that determining the optimal or near-optimal DOP for query execution is a fundamental and challenging task that benefits both query performance and cost-benefit tradeoffs. We then present promising preliminary results on how ML techniques can be applied to automate DOP tuning. We conclude with a list of challenges we encountered, as well as future directions for our work.},

abstract = {How to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) with the minimum resource cost has become a new problem in cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations. However, the new problem is challenging as the cloud-based MapReduce environment is dynamically changing. As a result, a static resource allocation scheme is not suitable for cloud-based MapReduce as resources may be under-provisioning, which leads to violations in the QoS of cloud-based MapReduce, or over-provisioning, which increases unnecessary resource cost. This paper abstracts the problem of cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations as a dynamical optimization problem, and proposes an event-driven resource provisioning framework to solve that problem. This new event-driven framework has been compared with existing popular static resource provisioning frameworks and periodic resource provisioning frameworks by experiments. The experimental results have shown that the new event-driven resource provisioning framework not only guarantees the QoS of those MapReduce computations, but also reduces the running cost of MapReduce computations by 4.87−21.61 percent compared with those static resource provisioning frameworks, and by 1.70−16.12 percent compared with those periodic resource provisioning frameworks.}

abstract = {Cloud-based data warehouses are built to be easy to use, requiring minimal intervention from customers as their workloads scale. However, there are still many dimensions of a workload that they do not scale with automatically. For example, in cloud-managed clusters, large ad-hoc queries and ETL workloads must use the same cluster size provisioned for the rest of the workload, and warehouse size does not automatically grow as the underlying data grows in size, causing queries to slow down. In this paper, we describe RAIS, the latest collection of AI-powered scaling and optimization techniques in Amazon Redshift, released in preview at re:Invent 2023, which enable it to scale both vertically and horizontally to adapt to all types of workload variability. RAIS dynamically provisions compute resources to run heavy queries efficiently and automatically optimizes warehouse size for the customer's workload, even as it shifts over time. We show that, depending on the workload, RAIS improves either cost or average query execution time by up to 7.6\texttimes{} and 14.2\texttimes{}, respectively, over existing baselines.},
