\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model, LCM-LAI, to solve both the LCR and LCM tasks.
On the one hand, LCM-LAI designs a dependent multi-task learning framework to solve the challenge of extracting legal-rational information of cases by adding a sub-task of law article prediction.
Besides, we carry out some theoretical derivation to prove that LCM-LAI is more reasonable than the general multi-task learning framework, which is also confirmed by experiment results.
On the other hand, different from modeling general semantic interaction, LCM-LAI more effectively models the legal-rational correlation between across-case sentences from the perspective of law distribution.
Specifically, LCM-LAI optimizes specifically for the article prediction sub-task with its novel article-aware attention mechanism. 
This feature generates a law attention score vector for each sentence that reflects the law distribution, enabling the computation of legal-rational correlations across case sentences without relying on sentence representations.
Adequate results on two practical tasks on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LCM-LAI.
