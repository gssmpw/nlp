\section*{Impact statement}

Modeling multicellular dynamics is crucial for biology, and accurate computer simulations can contribute to accelerated research on a wide range of biological phenomena. However, it remains imperative to validate the simulation results against experiments, especially when relying on neural simulation models. We do not foresee any potential negative societal consequences other than those associated with general research in machine learning and cell biology.
