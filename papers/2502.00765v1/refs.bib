The dataset includes: (1) 269,648 images and the associated tags from Flickr, with a total of 5,018 unique tags; (2) six types of low-level features extracted from these images, including 64-D color histogram, 144-D color correlogram, 73-D edge direction histogram, 128-D wavelet texture, 225-D block-wise color moments extracted over 5x5 fixed grid partitions, and 500-D bag of words based on SIFT descriptions; and (3) ground-truth for 81 concepts that can be used for evaluation. Based on this dataset, we highlight characteristics of Web image collections and identify four research issues on web image annotation and retrieval. We also provide the baseline results for web image annotation by learning from the tags using the traditional k-NN algorithm. The benchmark results indicate that it is possible to learn effective models from sufficiently large image dataset to facilitate general image retrieval.},

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.},
