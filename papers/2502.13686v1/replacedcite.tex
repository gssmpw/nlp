Our method relies on learning narrowband graph signal prototypes for the reconstruction of graph signals, which bears resemblance to a graph dictionary learning problem. Several previous works have studied graph signal representations over predetermined or learnt graph dictionaries. The  spectral graph wavelet dictionaries (SGWT) proposed in ____ extends the wavelet theory to graph domains in view of their spectral characterization. Other efforts include the learning of parametric graph dictionaries on single graphs ____ and multiple graphs ____, as well as multi-scale graph dictionaries based on Haar wavelets ____. Although our method can be interpreted as a particular type of graph dictionary learning algorithm, it has the following essential differences from the above methods. First, the aforementioned methods are generic dictionary learning algorithms that require fully observed graph signals to train; hence, are not particularly suited to the graph signal reconstruction problem and lack the capability of learning models with only partially observed graph signals. Similarly, they neither  employ any priors on the spectral characteristics of the data, nor present a theoretical understanding of their reconstruction performance. In contrast, our solution actively employs the prior that the signal energy is concentrated in certain bands of the spectrum, thanks to which it involves relatively few model parameters to learn (limited to the center and scale parameters of the kernels fitting to the dominant spectral components), hence, it is particularly tailored to scenarios with severe lack of training data. This feature of our method also makes it favorable against sophisticated but more complex methods such as GNN-based solutions requiring the learning of a large set of model parameters.  Furthermore, we provide an extensive theoretical analysis of the signal reconstruction performance of our method, with a careful justification of when multi-graph learning is advantageous over individual learning.
