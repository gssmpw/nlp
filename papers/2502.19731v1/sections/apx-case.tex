\section{Case Study}\label{sec:apx-case}
In the example in Table~\ref{tab:case2}, \policyl{} demonstrates a deeper level of empathy and personalization. It acknowledges the client’s unique emotional experiences and suggests tailored strategies, such as the “3-4-5” exercise, to directly address their concerns. Additionally, it facilitates self-exploration by asking thoughtful questions about the client’s fears, values, and understanding of self-trust, ultimately promoting autonomy and confidence in decision-making. In contrast, GPT-4o’s response feels more clinical and general.
