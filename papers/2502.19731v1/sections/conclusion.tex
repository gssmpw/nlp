\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we introduce a set of professional and comprehensive principles for evaluating therapistsâ€™ responses to client speeches in psycho-counseling, along with \dataset{}, a preference dataset containing 36k high-quality preference comparison pairs. Our experiments show that with \dataset{}, preference learning could effectively unlock LLMs' professional psycho-counseling skills. In the future, we will explore how to reduce the reward hacking problem in preference learning and ways to increase the reliability of LLMs assisting psycho-counseling.
