# Instructions

## Goal

Based on these settings, you need to consider how to play the game with your partner to achieve a higher score. The agent will automatically prepare the burger order with the least remaining time. You will receive game history and your task is to respond to urgent situations for improving the performance.

## Input Information

**Game History**:
    - A sequence of game scenes that have occurred in the past. Each game scene is consisted of:
        - Remained Timestep: The remained timestep of the game.
        - Score: The current score of the game.
        - Game State: The occurrences of objects, orders, and other players' inventories.
        - Action: Actions taken by your agent and the human-controlled agent.
        - Delivery: The food that have been delivered and the corresponding obtained score.
        - Missed Orders: The orders that have not been completed in time and the obtained punished score.
        {MESSAGE_PROMPT}
**Current Assigned Tasks**:
    - The current actions and orders you assigned to the agent that need to be done urgently.
**Behavior Guidelines**:
    - The behavior guidelines are the suggestions you have given to the agent based on the game history.
{INFERRED_HUMAN_PROMPT}

### Game State

The current state of the game includes various details. Here's a detailed description based on the provided structure:

1. **Objects**:
    - The `objects` dictionary records the number of objects with different statuses. Each entry is a tuple of `(object_name, object_status)` mapped to `object_number`.
    - For example:
        - `("LettuceBurger", "") : 1` indicates that there is 1 `LettuceBurger`.

2. **Orders**:
    - The `orders` list contains the current orders that need to be completed. Each order is a dictionary with:
        - `name`: The name of the order, which can be `BeefBurger`, `LettuceBurger`, or `BeefLettuceBurger`.
        - `remain_time`: The remaining time to complete the order, with smaller remaining time indicating higher urgency.

3. **Inventory of the Other Player**:
    - The `inventory_other_player` dictionary records the objects held by the other player. Each entry maps `other_agent_id` to a tuple of `(object_name, object_status)`.
    - This helps in understanding what the other player is currently holding, allowing for better coordination.

#### Example Game State

Now I will show you a game state example. In this example, there are
- 1 fresh beef, 1 in-progress beef, and 1 overcooked beef. No well-cooked beef.
- 3 unchopped lettuce and 1 chopped lettuce.
- 4 bread prepared in advance.
- No assembled BeefLettuce, BeefBurgers, or BeefLettuceBurgers, but there is 1 LettuceBurger ready.
- 2 empty plates on counters.
- 1 fire extinguisher and no active fire.
- 18 empty counters.
- 2 orders pending: a BeefBurger with 30 seconds remaining and a LettuceBurger with 45 seconds remaining.
- Player 1 holding an empty plate.

Note that you will only receive the json below:

{GAME_STATE_EXAMPLE}

### Assigned Tasks

In this game, the `assigned tasks` are the actions and orders which you assign to the agent that need to **prioritize and complete urgently**.

Assigned tasks can be actions with pre-conditions, and order names.

#### Assigned Actions

Assigned tasks can contains pairs of preconditions and actions. Each pair specifies a condition that must be met and the corresponding action that should be taken when the condition is true. Here's a breakdown of what each element means:

1. **Precondition**:
    - A lambda function that takes `json_state` as an input and returns a boolean value.
    - It indicates whether a specific condition is met in the current game state.
    - For example: When you want to detect whether there are fewer than 3 well-cooked or in-process beefs, you can use `"lambda json_state: json_state['objects'][('Beef', 'Well-cooked')] + json_state['objects'][('Beef', 'In-progress')] < 3"`.

2. **Action**:
    - A tuple containing the action name and the action arguments.
    - The action name is a string, and the action arguments are provided as a dictionary.

#### Assigned Orders

The `assigned_tasks` can also contains the names of the orders that need to be completed in sequence.

- Each order (element) in this list is an order name in string.

#### Example Assigned Tasks

Now I will show you an example of assigned tasks below. In this example, the agent do the following tasks:
- prepare beef if the number of well-cooked or in-process beefs are fewer than the number of requirements.
- prepare a BeefBurger.
- prepare a LettuceBurger.

{ASSIGNED_TASKS_EXAMPLE}

Note that `assigned_tasks` will be executed in sequence **only once**, i.e., the actions will be executed if the preconditions are met and the orders will be prepared. If you want to prioritize some tasks, you can assign them in the head of `assigned_tasks`. Please pay attention to put the most urgent tasks in the head of the list.

**Urgent Needs**: `assigned_tasks` are mainly used for urgent needs you have found according to the latest (current) game state{LATEST_MESSAGE_PROMPT}.
