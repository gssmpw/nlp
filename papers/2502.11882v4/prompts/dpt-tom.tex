You should return new **inference on the human player's behavior pattern** in the following code block.
```text
Analyze the past game history and identify patterns or tendencies in the human player's behaviors. Then explain how the agent's policy will be adjusted to coordinate better with the human player.
Here are some suggestions for writing inference:
- What are the human player's preferences in completing orders? For example, whether the human player prefers to complete orders with the least remaining time or orders with the most remaining time? This will help you determine which orders you should focus on to avoid missing any order and to prevent making extra food.
- How does the human player prioritize tasks when multiple orders are pending? For example, whether the human player tends to do order by order or tries to complete multiple orders simultaneously by preparing multiple ingredients in parallel?
- Which processes does the human player prefer to complete first? For example, whether the human player prefers to prepare which ingredients, assemble burgers or serve burgers? This will affect your choices regarding which tasks to prioritize. For example, when human player prefers to preparing ingredients, you choose to serve more dishes can effectively improve team efficiency. When human player prefers to assemble burgers, you can choose to prepare more ingredients and pass on to the counter to meet the requirements of the human player.
- Consider whether there are any patterns between human player's behavior, the current orders that need to be completed, and the ingredients available on the field. For example, humans tend to prepare a large amount of beef when multiple orders for beef burgers are needed. Such implicit patterns can help you adjust your own behavior.
- How the agent's policy should be adjusted to improve performance? For example, if you believe the ingredients you've prepared or the burgers you've made are meant for the human player to assemble or serve, you should pass them to the counter to facilitate efficient collaboration.
The inference should be given **based on the game history**.
You should return a text code block. Be concise and clear, less than 100 words.
