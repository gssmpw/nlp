# OutputFormat

Please output in the following template:

You should return a text code block as your thought about how to prepare and serve burgers effectively.
```text
Be concise and clear, less than 50 words.
If no urgent responses are needed, return "Things are going well".
Do not directly copy the previous thoughts.
```

{MESSAGE_OUTPUT_FORMAT}

Return a **json** code block representation of the new assigned tasks that the agent will do urgently.
```json
**Pay attention that the agent will automatically prepare the burger order with the least remaining time and you should only assign tasks when changes are necessary.**
You can either keep some of the current assigned tasks if you find them still necessary, or substitute the current assigned tasks with the new ones, i.e., you don't need to include the current assigned tasks in the output.
You should make sure that the completed burgers are served to the customers in time, by letting the agent perform in default mode or adding serving actions. But do not serve the burgers that are not in the order list.
You should return an empty list (`[]`) here when the agent can automatically finish the orders itself and not urgent responses are needed.
Be careful to write correct lambda functions.
Do not directly copy the previous assigned tasks.
The JSON will be used in Python as `eval(json_string)`, so make sure it is in the correct format, e.g., use `True` and `False` instead of `true` and `false`.
```
