# OutputFormat

Please output in the following template:

You should return a text code block as your thought about how to prepare and serve burgers effectively.
```text
Be concise and clear, less than 50 words.
If no urgent responses are needed, return "Things are going well".
Do not directly copy the previous thoughts.
```

Your action should be a **json** code block representation of the new assigned tasks that the agent will do urgently.

```json
You can either keep some of the current assigned tasks if you find them still necessary, or substitute them with the new ones, i.e., you don't have to include the current assigned tasks in the output.
You should make sure that the completed burgers are served to the customers in time, by adding serving actions. But do not serve the burgers that are not in the order list.
You should return enough assigned tasks to keep the agent busy.
Be careful to write correct lambda functions.
Do not directly copy the previous assigned tasks.
The JSON will be used in Python as `eval(json_string)`, so make sure it is in the correct format, e.g., use `True` and `False` instead of `true` and `false`.
```
