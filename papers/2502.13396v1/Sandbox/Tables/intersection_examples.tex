Over the weekend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the scheduled Better Care Act vote would be delayed indefinitely because of McCain's absence.}
Subsequently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also delayed its analysis of the bill.

Moderate Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is also withholding her support because it would slow the rate of growth in spending on Medicaid.}
