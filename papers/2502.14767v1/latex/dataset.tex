\section{Dataset Specifications}
\label{appendix:dataset}
As mentioned earlier, \textsc{Tree-of-Debate}'s dataset contains 100 samples, and Table \ref{tab:dataset} specifies the breakdown. Each sample contains the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Topic: a short, vague description of the theme of the two papers
    \item Paper \#1 arXiv Link
    \item Paper \#1 Title
    \item Paper \#1 Abstract
    \item Paper \#1 Introduction
    \item Paper \#2 arXiv Link
    \item Paper \#2 Title
    \item Paper \#2 Abstract
    \item Paper \#2 Introduction
    \item Method/Task: 0 if the papers differ in methodology (but have the same task) and 1 if the papers differ in the task (but the methodology is generally the same)
    \item Cite/No: 0 if the papers do not cite each other, and 1 if the papers cite each other.
\end{enumerate}

We provide the dataset (as a tab-separated file) in our code repository: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tree-of-debate-5961/dataset/tree_of_debate_dataset.tsv}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tree-of-debate-5961/dataset/tree\_of\_debate\_dataset.tsv}. \ref{tab: dataset_snapshot_in_appendix} contains a few rows from the dataset.
