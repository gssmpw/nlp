\begin{abstract}
With the exponential growth of research facilitated by modern technology and improved accessibility, scientific discoveries have become increasingly fragmented within and across fields. This makes it challenging to assess the significance, novelty, incremental findings, and equivalent ideas between related works, particularly those from different research communities. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, we introduce \textbf{Tree-of-Debate} (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles. Through experiments on scientific literature across various domains, evaluated by expert researchers, we demonstrate that ToD generates informative arguments, effectively contrasts papers, and supports researchers in their literature review.

\section{Conclusion}
Automatic summarization is essential for managing the growing volume of research. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{Tree-of-Debate}}, a structured approach that models papers as personas engaging in a debate to extract their key similarities and differences. Our method organizes debates into a hierarchical structure to produce abstractive and contextualization summaries while preserving their factuality. With thorough domain-expert empirical evaluation and qualitative case studies, we demonstrate that Tree-of-Debate significantly outperforms baselines.


\section{Limitations \& Future Work}
\par We explore some limitations of our work. Within each debate round (each persona presenting their arguments, responding to one another, and revising their arguments), we note that a crucial element to a productive debate round is \textbf{\textit{each persona providing meaningful feedback}} (e.g., doubts, clarifying questions)  within the ``respond'' stage. However, the quality of this critical response may vary based on the difficulty of the task (e.g., a more fine-grained topic that has no presence within the model's existing pre-training dataset) and/or the size of the model.
\par We also observe a \textbf{\textit{slight trade-off between contextualization and factuality}}. Especially in more challenging comparisons where the overlap between the papers may not be explicit (e.g., task-based comparisons), ToD must take more of a leap with respect to its reasoning to identify similarities and differences between the papers, which may lead to further hallucinations. Furthermore, we notice that as a debate path progresses to deeper levels, if certain evidence is not present to support a paper's  fine-grained claims, the personas begin to suggest potential future studies or even new methods (e.g., combining certain strengths of the two methods). While this does introduce some noise (as we can see through our competitive factuality scores, this is minimal) to our output summary, these types of ``hallucinations'' present exciting new paths for research to explore.
\par Tree-of-Debate can be \textbf{\textit{extended to other general, complex reasoning tasks}} which can exploit our tree-based decomposition and debate-based critical feedback. For instance, complex quantitative reasoning problems can often be decomposed into several sub-problems, which can be represented within our tree structure. Each persona can instead represent a different approach to solve that specific sub-problem. We can also consider extending this to a negotiation setting, where there are various aspects to consider when determining the optimal compromise. For example, two parties can negotiate on a price of a car with respect to its make, model, mileage, etc. Each of these can be explored within their own respective subtrees.
