\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present \textit{S-Graphs 2.0}, a multi-layered hierarchical SLAM for large, multi-floor indoor environments. Our approach leverages semantic relationships and a robust floor detection module to assign floor-level information, enabling effective floor-level global and room-level local optimizations as well as reliable loop closures across visually similar areas. We demonstrate a $19.48\%$ increase in accuracy and a $92.2\%$ reduction in computation time compared to the second-best method. Future work will integrate further semantic-relational concepts to enhance floor-based loop closure and optimization.
