% \subsection{Case Studies}
In addition to quantification of the interpretability, we look closer into a few examples of captured features. 

\textbf{Image-dominant neurons capture visual commonalities that are hard-to-describe in words.} We randomly select two \texttt{ImgD} neurons and visualize the top 8 activated images along each neuron in Figure~\ref{fig:act_imgs_imgD}. We find that the top neuron contains repetitive patterns of diverse shapes and colors, and the bottom neuron contains various objects that are partially ocean blue in color.  In contrast, the activated text samples (Table~\ref{tab:act_txts_imgD}) display a more diverse and abstract range of descriptions. Although less cohesive than the images, some patterns do emerge: for instance, two sentences refer to repetitive patterns for feature-647, while two others mention winter-related concepts, such as snow (as seen in the 5-th image for feature-667). These observations suggest that \texttt{ImgD} neurons are more adept at capturing distinct visual features that are not only challenging to express through language but are also more interpretable and intuitive to human perception, aligning with how we naturally understand visual commonalities.

\textbf{Text-dominant neurons capture abstract concepts, especially human emotional feelings.} We randomly select two features and display the top 8 activated texts in Table~\ref{tab:act_txts_TextD}. Feature-34 centers around a sweet and happy atmosphere between couples, with themes like cuddling, embracing, and hugging. Feature-242 focuses on strong human emotions, such as ``never'', ``terrifying'' and exclamation marks. These \texttt{TextD} features generally correspond to abstract human feelings and thoughts, which can be associated with various visual objects (e.g., animals, sinkhole, castle.) This partially explain the diversity of objects in the images activated by feature 242 in Figure~\ref{fig:act_imgs_textD}. Interestingly, the images activated by feature-34 mostly depict couples or people in red attire, somewhat reflecting the joyful mood conveyed in the language. This insight highlights that \texttt{TextD} features can abstract the unique, high-level aspects of language, particularly atmosphere and emotions, as a reflection of human intelligence.

\textbf{Cross-Modality features (the majority features) capture common concepts from both visual and textual perspectives.} Different from the \texttt{TextD} and \texttt{ImgD}, whose activated samples tend to contain modality-exclusive features, \texttt{CrossD} neurons capture common concepts that could be expressed in both visual and language modalities. We randomly select two \texttt{CrossD} features and display their top activated images and texts. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:act_img_crossm} and Table~\ref{tab:act_texts_crossm},
Feature6 mostly activates individuals in different activities, especially outdoor activities, and feature47 activates outdoor scenes. Both kinds of features can be consistently described in both images and languages, representing the common space shared by both modalities, implying that these features are mostly affected by the modality aligned training objectives.

% \paragraph{Interpretability of neurons.} For each neuron, we collect their activated image and text samples. Then, we measure the neuron interpretability using the embedding-based similarity and win rate proposed in \S\ref{subsec:metrics}. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:img_inter_metric} and Table~\ref{tab:txt_inter_metric}. It is expected that the ImageDom neurons can capture vision-specific features, which are not prevalent in text modality, and vice versa. For DualModality neurons, they activate both visionary and textual patterns.
