\subsection{Case Studies}
\vspace{-2mm}
In addition to quantification of the interpretability of neurons dominating different modalities, we look closer to a few examples of captured features. \textbf{ImgD neurons capture both coarse and fine-grained visual features.} Among \texttt{ImgD} neurons, we randomly select two neurons and display the top5 activated images in Figure~\ref{fig:act_imgs_imgD}. The activated images can be concrete concept, i.e., the inner living space, also the patterns and textures that are the basic patterns learnt in the lower layers by image-only model. Moreover, Neuron668 is a monosemantic neuron to blue color. 
\textbf{TextD neurons capture abstract and semantic information that is less prevalent in visual representations.} We randomly select three neurons and display the top4 activated sentences in Table~\ref{tab:act_sents_textd}. Neuron45 focuses on strong emotions by highlighting the text with \textbf{?, !} and strong emotion words. Neuron932 focuses a happy and warm atmosphere, even though there are no common visual concepts.

\textbf{Cross-Modality neurons capture common features between image and text.} Different from the \texttt{TextD} and \texttt{ImgD}, whose activated samples tend to contain modality-exclusive features, \texttt{CrossM} neurons are more capable in capturing common features shared by the two modalities. We randomly select two \texttt{CrossM} neurons and display their top activated images and texts, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:act_img_crossm} and Table~\ref{tab:act_texts_crossm}. It is clear that Neuron6 activate male action related concepts in both modality and Neuron47 activate outdoor scenes.

% \paragraph{Interpretability of neurons.} For each neuron, we collect their activated image and text samples. Then, we measure the neuron interpretability using the embedding-based similarity and win rate proposed in \S\ref{subsec:metrics}. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:img_inter_metric} and Table~\ref{tab:txt_inter_metric}. It is expected that the ImageDom neurons can capture vision-specific features, which are not prevalent in text modality, and vice versa. For DualModality neurons, they activate both visionary and textual patterns.
