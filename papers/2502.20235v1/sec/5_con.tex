\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a unified approach for various visual characteristics transfer tasks, including style/appearance transfer, style-specific image generation, and texture synthesis. The key to the proposed method is a novel attention distillation loss, which calculates the difference between the ideal and current stylization, and gradually modifies the synthesis. Our method overcomes the limitations of previous works, and experiments have validated its superiority.%over existing methods.
