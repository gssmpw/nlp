\begin{abstract}

Cartoon videos have proven to be effective in learning vocabulary to preschool children. However, we have little knowledge about integrating AI into cartoon videos to provide systematic, multimodal vocabulary learning support. This late-breaking work present \name{}, an AI-powered cartoon video system that enables real-time Q\&A, vocabulary review, and contextual learning. Preliminary findings contextualized how families interact with \name{} to support vocabulary learning. Parents appreciated the system for its personalized, engaging experiences, fostering collaboration, and encouraging self-reflection on parenting. This study offers valuable design implications for informing future video systems to support vocabulary learning.

%Art therapy homework is between-session activities that facilitate  reflecting on clients' daily feelings and enhance therapeutic collaboration through art-making and verbal expression in their natural environment.
%However, it is challenging to support clients in self-expression through verbalization and art due to a high threshold and limited guidance from therapists, as well as to support therapists in customizing and tracking homework exercises.
%In HCI, few studies have explored how technology can support addressing these challenges of art therapy homework.
%Thus, we present \name{}, a system consisting of a client application that integrates human-AI co-creative art-making and conversational agents for art therapy homework, and a therapist application that allows for the customization of conversational agents to guide homework and review AI-compiled homework data.
%Over a one-month field deployment, 24 clients engaged with \name{} in their own contexts, under the guidance of 5 therapists. Our findings showed that introducing conversational agents while art-making can guide clients in exploring personal feelings and new meanings behind the artwork. Also, \name{} enables therapists to integrate their professional beliefs and practical experiences into the AI agent, allowing it to reflect their unique personal imprint. Homework images and conversation records also helped therapists offer triggers for deeper discussions and intervention resources during in-session activities.
%Building on these findings, we explore the practical implications of incorporating AI agents into therapy homework on future design.
%Art therapy homework is essential for fostering clients' reflection on daily experiences between sessions. However, current practices present challenges: clients often lack guidance for completing tasks that combine art-making and verbal expression, while therapists find it difficult to track and tailor homework. How HCI systems might support art therapy homework remains underexplored. To address this, we present \name{}, comprising a client-facing application leveraging human-AI co-creative art-making and conversational agents to facilitate homework, and a therapist-facing application enabling customization of homework agents and AI-compiled homework history. A 30-day field study with 24 clients and 5 therapists showed how \name{} supported clients’ homework and reflection in their everyday settings. Results also revealed how therapists infused their practice principles and personal touch into the agents to offer tailored homework, and how AI-compiled homework history became a meaningful resource for in-session interactions. Implications for designing human-AI systems to facilitate asynchronous therapist-client collaboration are discussed.


%can help clients express emotions and find new meanings behind their artwork, even without therapists. Additionally, 

%Therapy homework has been widely used in art therapy practices to enhance clients' therapeutic skills in real world and offer continuity between sessions.
% 
%Yet, few studies explored how AI agents could support clients’ art therapy homework and mediate therapist-client collaboration outside the synchronous art therapy sessions.
%
%To address this, we introduce \name{}, a multi-agent system that combines image-based generative AI with conversational AI agents, empowering clients to engage in art therapy homework in natural environments. It can also support therapists customizing and reviewing therapy homework.
%Through one month field deployments involving 24 clients with five art therapists, our results demonstrated that \name{} helped clients externalize their emotions and create new meanings through conversation and art-making across various contexts, such as home or offices.
%AI multi-agents can act as a mediator, enabling therapists to customize them as an extension of their practice to deliver structured guidance aligned with their professional beliefs, while also supporting the use of homework as intervention resources during art therapy sessions.
