We greatly appreciate the insightful and high-quality comments from all reviewers. We are particularly encouraged that reviewers recognize the generalization capability, scalability, strategy transparency, transferability and simplicity of our proposed method as well as its potential for real-world applications.

We have addressed all questions of reviewers in each individual response. According to the suggestions of reviewers, we also conduct a series of additional experiments and include the results and discussions in the revised paper. Below is a summary of paper updates and new experiments.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
SFT
RL
EPO-SFT
EPO-SFT+RL
\end{itemize}

We hope that the updated results and our responses have addressed the concerns reviewers have. We will release our reasoning models, RL data and code once published. Please let us know if there are any other questions or suggestions.
