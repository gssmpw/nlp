\caption{\textbf{The method's pipeline.} We decompose the appearance color of the scene $\mathbf{c}$ into physical components $\mathbf{c}_{indep}$ and $\mathbf{c}_{ref}$ and sum them to compute the color of the scene at location $\mathbf{x}$ and viewing direction $\mathbf{d}$. We also learn a decomposed feature field for the scene, $\mathbf{f}_{indep}$ and $\mathbf{f}_{ref}$, which enables physically-oriented semantic understanding and editing applications. Please see \cref{sec:method} for more details.
