\subsection{Reward Functions}
\label{sec:append_reward}
The reward functions we used during the training are shown in Table~\ref{tab:reward}, which mainly comes from~\cite{agarwal2023legged, fu2021minimizing, kumar2021rma, margolis2023walk, long2024learninghumanoid}. The corresponding symbols and their descriptions are provided in Table~\ref{tab:symbol}.

\subsection{Terrain Curriculum}
\label{sec:append_curriculum}
The training terrains using curriculum comprises \textit{Stones Everywhere}, \textit{Stepping Stones}, and \textit{Balancing Beams}. The \textit{Stones Everywhere} terrain spans an area of $8m\times8m$, while both \textit{Stepping Stones} and \textit{Balancing Beams} are $2m$ in width and $8m$ in length, with single-direction commands. The depth of gaps relative to the ground is set to $1.0m$, and all stones and beams exhibit height variations within $\pm 0.05m$. The depth tolerance threshold, $\epsilon$, is set to $-0.1 m$.

We define terrain difficulty levels ranging from 0 to 8, denoted as $l$. The specific terrain curriculum at each difficulty level are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Stones Everywhere}: The stone size is $\max\{0.25, 1.5(1-0.1l)\}$, and the stone distance is $0.05\lceil l/2\rceil$.
    \item \textit{Stepping Stones}: The stone sizes follow the sequence $[0.8, 0.65, 0.5, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.2]$, with a maximum stone distance of $0.1 + 0.05l$.
    \item \textit{Balancing Beams}: The stone size is $0.3-0.05\lfloor l/3\rfloor$, with the stone distance in $x$-direction $0.4 - 0.05l$, and in $y$-direction $[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.35, 0.4, 0.2]$. At the highest difficulty level, the terrain forms a single continuous balancing beam.
\end{itemize}
