    \section{Practical Remarks}

\begin{rem}
If one wants to include also input constraints in the problem, a practical possibility is to replace the implementation of the controller via matrix inversion in~\eqref{eq:control} with the solution of the following (convex) optimization problem 
\begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
       \uv^* = \argmin &||\vv - \bv(\xv)-\tilde{\Am}(\xv,\sigma)\uv||_\Wm ^2 \\
       \mathrm{s.t.}& \uv \in \mathcal{U} 
   \end{split} 
\end{equation}
with $\bv(\xv)$ as in \eqref{eq:b}, $\vv$ as in \eqref{eq:v}, $\tilde{\Am}(\xv,\sigma)$  as in \eqref{eq:Atilde} and \textit{eventually} a  positive-definite weight matrix $\Wm$.
