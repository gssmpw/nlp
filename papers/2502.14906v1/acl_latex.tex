\begin{abstract}
Investigating value alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) based on cultural context has become a critical area of research. However, similar biases have not been extensively explored in large vision-language models (VLMs). As the scale of multimodal models continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to assess whether images can serve as reliable proxies for culture and how these values are embedded through the integration of both visual and textual data. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of multimodal model at different scales, focusing on their alignment with cultural values. Our findings reveal that, much like LLMs, VLMs exhibit sensitivity to cultural values, but their performance in aligning with these values is highly context-dependent. While VLMs show potential in improving value understanding through the use of images, this alignment varies significantly across contexts highlighting the complexities and underexplored challenges in the alignment of multimodal models.

\section{Introduction}

Culture is a multifaceted construct that encompasses various identities, including but not limited to language, nationality, region, religion, and gender identity. It serves as a fundamental symbol that reflects the internal values of diverse human communities \citep{hofstede1984culture,tomlinson2018culture}. Cultural bias refers to the tendency to favour specific cultural perspectives, values, and norms, which can lead to subjective outputs that may offend or misrepresent people from other cultures. For example, according to the World Values Survey \citep{haerpfer2022world}, Arabic culture often views men as better political leaders than women, whereas people in the United States generally disagree.

% Culture, encompassing the beliefs, norms, and customs shared by groups, serves as a fundamental symbol that reflects the internal values of diverse human communities (Hofstede, 1984; Mora, 2013; Tomlinson et al., 2014; Gabriel, 2020). This symbolic representation manifests across various domains, including language, cuisine, common practices, architecture, and everyday activities. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there has been a growing interest in examining how cultural aspects are represented and understood within current AI models, particularly those designed for complex tasks (Arora et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023; Huang and Yang, 2023).

% In recent years, cultural probing within language models has gained significant attention, revealing how these models interpret and reflect the diverse cultural cues embedded in human communication. Studies have explored the cultural biases and understandings of prominent language models such as GPT-3 (Johnson et al., 2022) and ChatGPT (Cao et al., 2023), highlighting the challenges of creating systems that interact effectively with speakers from varied cultural backgrounds. While these efforts have predominantly focused on the linguistic domain, there remains a pressing need to extend this exploration to multimodal models, particularly those that integrate visual and linguistic information. 

% Pretrained Vision-Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual tasks (Li et al., 2023a; Geigle et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Khan and Fu, 2023). 

% Understanding and addressing cultural biases in these large models is crucial where implicit cultural cues can reflect deep-seated values and ways of thinking (Nisbett et al., 2001; Almuhailib, 2019; Sun et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022). 

Vision Language Models have shown emergent abilities through large-scale training and have grown in popularity over the years. With the increase in scale, there is a growing interest in investigating cultural gaps and biases in these models. These cultural gaps are manifested in forms like culturally appropriate captions \citep{yun2024cic,liu2021visually}, culturally appropriate image generation \citep{liu2023cultural,jha2024beyond}, norms, values and practices \citep{rao2024normad,ramezani2023knowledge,fraser2022does} go further and evaluate the moral correctness of the
system using existing psychological instruments and argue that it is important to know what – and whose – moral views are being expressed via a so-called “moral
machine. 

As large models scale, it is important not only to build culturally aware models \citep{hershcovich-etal-2022-challenges} but also to evaluate the sensitivity of these large models to cultural awareness. Probing language models, as a method, has gained significant attention due to its ability to help models interpret and reflect the diverse cultural cues embedded in human communication.  While these efforts have predominantly focused on the linguistic domain, there remains a pressing need to extend this exploration to multimodal models, particularly those that integrate visual and linguistic information. The ability of pre-trained vision-language models to align with cultural values and norms using visual contexts has not been extensively studied. \citet{cao2024exploring} conducted preliminary investigations into multicultural understanding using GPT-4V, focusing on cultural case studies rather than quantifiable metrics. This underscores a significant gap in the literature and the cross-cultural sensitivity of these multimodal models for values, remains largely unexplored.

% Pretrained Vision-Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual tasks (Li et al., 2023a; Geigle et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Khan and Fu, 2023).

\end{figure*}

This paper addresses this gap and introduces a comprehensive framework for assessing cultural alignment in multimodal models using human value surveys designed by linguists and benchmarking them across varied image types. We use images as a proxy for culture and probe multimodal models with questions which can give insight into model's inherent response to such cues to such question, with and without images. This benchmark integrates the World Value Survey (WVS) \citep{haerpfer2022world} as a vector for cultural identification offering an approach to incorporating cultural dimensions into our system.

This work makes three key contributions to the understanding of cultural awareness in multimodal large models:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Multimodal cultural values evaluation: We propose a comprehensive evaluation of cultural values using multimodal models (combining text and images) across a diverse set of countries and different kinds of culturally relevant images. This study is one of the first to analyze how multimodal models perform on value-oriented tasks, providing insights into their effectiveness in capturing cultural nuances. Our novelty lies not just in using multimodal models with WVS questions, but in exploring how images prime VLM values — a question not previously addressed.

    \item Understanding impact of model size: We analyze the performance of models with different parameter sizes (13B vs 34B vs 72B parameters) and show that larger multimodal models do not always guarantee better value alignment using culture-specific visual cues, though they might have improved alignment for specific kind of values.

    \item Fine-grained evaluation across topics: We also study model responses in a fine-grained manner across diverse topics from WVS questions (e.g., religion, race, immigration) to assess models' alignment with cultural norms across these topics, offering deeper insights into their performance on nuanced, context-specific tasks.
\end{enumerate}

% Our novelty lies not just in using multimodal models with WVS questions, but in exploring how images prime VLM values—a question not previously addressed.


% Investigating Knowledge Across Entities and Concepts: Different cultures are better represented by different concepts which are universal across cultures. Inspired by the idea of universal concepts, we investigate if certain visual concepts are better cultural proxies than the rest.

% A lot of things here and here and here

\subsection{Cultures in LLMs}
The interplay between language and culture has been a longstanding topic in computational linguistics, where culture is embedded in the linguistic choices people make \citep{kasper2010language}. Studies suggest that the cultural nuances in language must go beyond semantics and consider the cultural context that underpins values, norms, and practices as most tasks for the models focus on universal facts but overlook socio-cultural nuances \citep{huang-yang-2023-culturally, nguyen2023extracting}. With the recent surge in language models, the ease of availability of English data to train models and the ever-increasing size of models, the research community has questioned how skewed are these models for over-represented cultures. \citet{adilazuarda2024towards} provided a comprehensive survey of over 90 recent studies on cultural representation in LLMs and highlighted that most models are heavily biased toward Western, English-speaking norms, which skews their applicability in global, multicultural environments. As culture is multifaceted, often these models ignore linguistic and cultural diversity across non-Western regions \citep{dwivedi2023eticor, hershcovich-etal-2022-challenges, wibowo2023copal}
 
 % \citep{arora-etal-2023-probing} highlighted that pre-trained language models encode cultural values, although they often show weak alignment with established cross-cultural value surveys such as the World Values Survey and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. 
 
  % explored cultural representations across demographic and semantic proxies and show how culture is multifaceted and influences culturally relevant task.
% This linguistic bias could distort the representation of culturally grounded knowledge, which is pivotal in ensuring accurate cross-cultural communication in VLMs(Ventura et al. - 2024 -…).

\subsection{Culture and Image Modality}
Language and culture are intertwined with each other but language is often bound by the bias of its lexicon. 
% TO DO: Add papers on 
Culture is more than words and includes visual nuances in dresses, rituals, and artefacts that carry rich cultural meanings and cannot be fully expressed through language alone. A popular task for evaluating culture using images is the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task where work has been done on creating culture-specific benchmarks, such as \citet{Wang2024CVLUEAN} for Chinese, and \citet{Baek2024EvaluatingVA} for Korean. This linguistic bias could potentially distort the cultural perception in multimodal models \citep{ventura2023navigating}. Studies have shown that bias in visual understanding stems from the under-representation of images from non-Western cultures in training data \citep{shankar2017no}. Recent works have attempted to create culturally inclusive datasets that are not limited in terms of the number of languages and the cultural diversity of the images \citep{romero2024cvqa,bhatia2024local}.

\subsection{Value Alignment of Human Preferences}
Advances in large models have sparked
growing efforts to align these models with human preferences \citep{ganguli2023capacity,scherrer2024evaluating}. \citet{arora-etal-2023-probing} examined value alignment across languages. \citet{durmus2023towards} examined value distributions based on countries. \citet{li2024culture} improved the performance on culture-related datasets by finetuning models on a subset of the WVS.
\citet{zhao2024worldvaluesbench} propose WorlValueBench
(WVB), a globally diverse, large-scale benchmark
dataset for the multicultural value prediction
task base on demographic attributes. Multi-cultural value awareness of large models remains an active area of research as we don't have many large-scale real-world datasets which are about cultural values, and norms and reflect the preferences of the human population.

% World Values Survey (WVS) are referenced to set the framework for measuring cultural differences in LLMs

\section{Task and Model}

\subsection{Task}
We study the cultural value prediction and alignment task, where we probe a multimodal model for value questions from WVS Survey (as shown in \Cref{fig:model_workflow}):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Country prompt: We personify the model as a person of that country by using ``You are someone from {country}..how will you answer the following question \{question\}''
    \item Image prompt: We provide a culture-specific image as a proxy for the culture and prompt the model using ``<image> Guess the demography where the image is from..Answer the following question \{question\}''
\end{enumerate}

The answer options are in the form of multiple choice questions (MCQ) as seen in \Cref{fig:model_workflow}. We chose multiple-choice option-styled prompting inspired by related and recent work on evaluating value alignment in LLMs \cite{moayeri2024worldbench, durmus2023towards}. We then assess the output of the multimodal model and compare it against human responses (discussed below). Template for the exact prompt used can be seen at ~\autoref{lst:prompt_people_income} and ~\autoref{lst:prompt_people_generic_image}. Similar to \citet{durmus2023towards}, we then compute a similarity score to compare model output with human responses. Mathematically, it can be formulated as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each model \( m \in M \) and question \( q \in Q \), we compute the predicted probability distribution over choices \( O_q \):
    \[
    P_m(r_i \mid q), \quad \forall r_i \in O_q
    \]

    We compute \( P_m \) for two cases: a) when our prompt has country name 
    \[
    P_m(r_i \mid q, c), \quad \forall r_i \in O_q, \ c \in C
    \]
    
    and b) when prompt has country country-specific image and not a country name.
    \[
    P_m(r_i \mid q, I_c), \quad \forall r_i \in O_q, I_c \in I
    \] where I is a set of images for all countries.
    
    \item For each country \( c \in C \), our dataset has empirical probability distribution \( P_s(r_i \mid q) \) from survey responses from respondents. We use this and then calculate the similarity \( S_{mc} \) between our model \( m \) and country \( c \) by averaging the Jensen-Shannon similarities across all questions for both country and image-specific cases:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &S_{mc} = \\
    &\frac{1}{N} \sum_{q=1}^{N} \left(1 - \text{JSD}\left(P_m(r_i \mid q,c), P_s(r_i \mid q)\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
    % \[
    % \small
    % S_{mc} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{q=1}^{N} \left(1 - \text{JSD}\left(P_m(r_i \mid q,c), P_s(r_i \mid q)\right)\right)
    % \]
\[
\begin{aligned}
    &S_{mI} = \\
    &\frac{1}{N} \sum_{q=1}^{N} \left(1 - \text{JSD}\left(P_m(r_i \mid q,I_c), P_s(r_i \mid q)\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
    % \[
    % \begin{split}
    % S_{mc} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{q=1}^{N} \left(1 - \text{JSD}\left(P_m(r_i \mid q,c), \right. \\
    %        \left. P_s(r_i \mid q)\right)\right)
    % \end{split}
    % \]
    % \[
    % \begin{split}
    % S_{mI} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{q=1}^{N} \left(1 - \text{JSD}\left(P_m(r_i \mid q,I_c), \right. \\
    %        \left. P_s(r_i \mid q)\right)\right)
    % \end{split}
    % \]
A high similarity score implies better alignment of the model to human responses and \( S_{mI} \) > \( S_{mc} \) would mean that the (for the same question) image cue aligned the model better as compared to the country prompt. 

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Models}
We aim to probe a popular vision language model to get an insight into its understanding of societal values across cultures and if the addition of culture-specific images provides better value alignment as compared to country-specific prompts.  For this purpose, we investigate the current state-of-the-art LLaVA-series \cite{liu-etal-2023-visual, liu2024improved} large vision-language models with varying model sizes, including \textit{LLaVA-1.6-13B} \citep{liu2024improved}, \textit{LLaVA-v1.6-34B} \cite{LLaVA-NeXT:-2024-10-16}.
% and  \textit{LLaVA-NeXT-72B} \cite{LLaVA-NeXT:-2024-10-16}. 
These models are trained on publicly available data and achieve state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of 11 tasks. In general, the architectural framework of these vision-language models comprises a pre-trained visual encoder and a large language model that are interconnected through a two-layer MLP. All models employ CLIP-ViT \cite{radford2021learning} as the visual encoder, while utilizing different large language models: \textit{Vicuna-1.6} \cite{zheng2023judging}, \textit{Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B} \cite{Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B-2024-10-16}, and \textit{Qwen-1.5-72B-Chat} \cite{qwen1.5}, respectively. 
These VLMs are equipped with the ability to perform multilingual tasks due to their training data encompassing diverse languages from various countries, such as ShareGPT \cite{ShareGPT:-2024-10-16}. In addition, some pre-trained LLMs is also trained on multi-language data, such as \textit{Qwen-1.5} \cite{yang2024qwen2}. In our experiments, when we use country prompt, we mask out the vision encoder and only use the language decoder of our model to get model outputs. For culture-image-specific prompts, we use the image encode with the same language decoder as before for accurate comparison. 

% The images a) which are visual representation of a culture b) which represent different economic demographic i.e. rich, medium and low economy.

\section{Dataset Construction}

\subsection{World Value Survey}

Our text data is based on World Value Survey \citep{haerpfer2022world} which is a large-scale, time series, cross-national survey that investigates human values and beliefs. It has around 290 questions which were asked to all participants, and has several modules of country and region-specific questions. We use the version provided by \citet{durmus2023towards}, and similar to their method, used GPT to categorize these questions into 15 broad topics: 1) Social values and attitudes 2) Religion and spirituality, 3) Science and technology, 4) Politics and policy 5) Demographics, 6) International affairs, 7) Gender and LGBTQ, 8) News habits and media, 9) Immigration and migration, 10) Family and relationships, 11) Race and ethnicity, 12) Economy and work, 13) Regions and countries and 14) Methodological research and 15) Security. Examples of sample questions per topic can be seen in \Cref{table:topic-examples}.

\subsection{Image Dataset}

\noindent\textbf{General Image Representation of Culture}:

% It is worth noting that culture as definition is very broad and here we aim to evaluate images as a proxy of culture. 
\noindent Unlike language, where words mirror culture, in the visual world, culture has visual nuances in its representation e.g. food, dress, traditions etc. Motivated by works like \citet{romero2024cvqa}, we choose a culturally specific image for 8 categories for 10 countries. This dataset was manually collected from the internet by searching for category-specific images. E.g. ‘China festivals’. All images selected are non-commercial. The countries chosen varied geographically (e.g. America, Europe, Asia), economically (high and low income) and linguistically (e.g. English, French, Nigerian, Chinese etc). The 8 categories chosen included: Cooking and Food (Food), Sports and Recreation (Sports), Objects, Materials, and Clothing (Objects), Brands and Products (Brands), Geography, Buildings and Landmarks (Geography), Tradition, Art, and History (Tradition), Public Figure and Pop-Culture (Pop Culture). Some examples can be seen in \Cref{fig:italy-china-image}. We were very selective about the images we chose for each category as the goal was for the model to understand the correct demography via the images.\\

We would like to note that our study, which focuses on assessing whether country-classified images and country names in prompts can serve as effective proxies for cultural values, does not aim to exhaustively represent culture but rather to evaluate the degree to which current models can align with broad, identifiable cultural markers. It is an essential first step in understanding multimodal cultural alignment. A similar intervention has also been explored in \cite{li2024land}. While these interventions may not capture the full complexity of cultural values, they are practical and interpretable proxies for studying how models respond to culturally diverse inputs. This choice is motivated by the need for a measurable and reproducible approach to assess contextual sensitivity, considering the inherent challenges of defining "culture" in multimodal contexts. Using country-specific cues, such as images and country names, allows us to test models’ ability to incorporate geographically and culturally relevant context into their responses.

\noindent\textbf{Selection criteria}: To ensure that our model is culturally guided before answering the value questions, it is important to ascertain that the image chosen for each country has strong cultural cues. Hence, as an apriori, we run a country classifier i.e. use LLaVA to predict the countries for these images. A similar method was used by \citet{mukherjee2024crossroads}, who predicted the geographical region represented in the image, as per the United Nations geoscheme. Instead of this geoscheme, we prompt the model to predict in json format. This method helps us get country-image pairs which are consistently correctly classified. The prompt used for classification can be seen in \autoref{lst:prompt_for_cvqa_classification}.\\

\noindent\textbf{People with Income Level Image Representation}

\noindent People look different across countries and socioeconomic status. However, it is hard to categorize people into a country just by the looks of it. One way would be to classify people into income-based demographics rather than predicting specific countries. Hence, we take this approach to evaluate if the image representation of people from different income groups affect the model responses to value questions across our 15 topics.

% Apart from country level analysis, we also wanted to analyze if income level of countries affect the responses of the model.It is hard to find images which represent such attribute solely via images.

For this, we use Dollarstreet \citep{rojas2022dollar}, a dataset collected by a team of photographers that documents homes in various countries. For our work, we selected the ``family snapshots'' and ``family'' categories from the dataset.

% Most of these images are related to people's household e.g. dishwashers, shoes, toys and people themselves. This data also provided income level information for each family in the dataset. 

% However, images of people are hard to understand. Though it is easier to guide a model towards its understanding of culture via image of objects, food etc; it is not the same case with images of people. 

As a first step, we use the same approach as before and run a classifier on the images to predict countries. See \autoref{lst:prompt_for_ds_classification} for the prompt. More details about the classification method can be seen in \Cref{Statisitical_Significance} 
%Appendix A.1. 
Next, we select countries such that we have at least 1 country in high and low-income categories as per WorldBank database \footnote{\url{https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups}}. For simplification, we use high and upper middle category as ``high income'' and ``low middle'' and ``low'' as ``low'' income category. Lastly, we filtered for all the countries where we have at least 5 images from Dollar Street and are correctly classified. This ensures that a single image does not bias the final average result. We finally have the following countries: Brazil (7), Bangladesh (6) India (44), Nigeria (6), Pakistan (8), South Africa (5), United States (7), and China (24). These images are distributed across various incomes as shown in \Cref{fig:ds-income-swarm}.

\subsection{Value Alignment using Diverse Image Representation}

As mentioned in section 3.1, our goal is to compare the similarity metrics of prompts using culture-specific images against country prompts. This is done across 15 topics and 10 image categories, with two LLaVA model sizes: 13B parameters (13B), 34B parameters (34B) and  72B parameters (72B). \Cref{tab:mean-similarity} shows the comparison of mean similarities across different countries when we use only country names in the prompt and when we use culture-specific images in the prompt.

\textbf{Overall Performance Across Models}: We observe that the 13B model shows a slight positive change with the presence of culturally-specific images across most countries, with mean similarity scores increasing from \(0.60\) to \(0.61\) for Brazil and from \(0.60\) to \(0.63\) for France. However, not all countries benefit equally, with Mexico (\(0.60\) to \(0.59\)) and Pakistan (\(0.58\) to \(0.57\)) showing slight declines. On the other hand, the 34B model shows more variability in performance, where some countries benefit from image modality while others show minimal improvements or even stagnation. For instance, the United States and Pakistan both improve slightly (\(0.73\) to \(0.74\)), while France sees a small decline (\(0.73\) to \(0.72\)) with the use of images. The 72B model, despite its size, exhibits limited improvements across most countries (e.g., Brazil: \(0.64\) to \(0.65\), Vietnam: with no change), suggesting diminishing returns or reduced sensitivity to visual cues as models scale. 

\textbf{Topic-Specific Observations}: \Cref{fig:topic_model_heatmap} shows \% change in similarity score when the culture-specific image was used. \% change was computed as (\( S_{mI} \) - \( S_{mc} \)) / \( S_{mc} \) * 100. In the WVS survey, certain questions were directed exclusively to respondents from specific countries, resulting in missing responses for a few country-question pairs in our dataset. Therefore, similarity scores could not be computed for these pairs and are indicated in grey on the heatmap.

Observing of the heatmap reveals that the smaller 13B and 34B models often exhibit more pronounced improvements from image-based prompts on certain culturally sensitive topics than the 72B model. For instance, under the 13B model, ``Social values and attitudes'' sees substantial gains in Brazil (+28.5\%), China (+43.7\%), and Nigeria (+44.0\%), while ``Race and ethnicity'' in the 34B model yields large improvements for Nigeria (+39.8\%) and Italy (+33.2\%). These boosts are not universal, however, as some categories and countries show negative changes: in the 13B model, China experiences a drop of --30.9\% in ``Gender and LGBTQ'' while the 34B model sees Mexico decrease by --15.0\% in ``Immigration and migration.'' Notably, the largest 72B model does not always outperform its smaller counterparts; for example, in ``Family and relationships,'' Vietnam and the United States experience stagnant or slightly negative shifts, and ``Gender and LGBTQ'' sees Mexico decline by over 18\%. Taken together, these observations indicate that while images can help align model responses to nuanced cultural topics, larger parameter sizes do not guarantee uniformly greater gains, and may even yield smaller or inconsistent improvements relative to mid-sized models. 


\textbf{Country-Specific Observations}: Within-country trends suggest that models handle sensitive topics (e.g., ``Race and Ethnicity'', ``Immigration and Migration'', ``Gender and LGBTQ'') differently from societal topics (e.g., ``Social values and attitudes'', ``Family and relationships'', ``Religion and spirituality''). For example, Brazil under the 13B model sees a substantial boost in sensitive areas like ``Gender and LGBTQ'' (+7.0\%) and in ``Race and Ethnicity'' (+23.2\%), highlighting within-country increase in gain among related topics. Similarly, societal topics in Brazil (e.g., ``Social values and attitudes'') register uniformly high gains with the 13B model. China on the other hand shows a slightly different split: the 13B model sees a large jump in ``Social values and attitudes'' (+43.7\%) while simultaneously reducing ``Gender and LGBTQ'' alignment by --30.9\%, but this imbalance diminishes with the 34B model, indicating that mid-sized architectures sometimes moderate extreme shifts. In a Western context like France, gains in sensitive categories (``Race and Ethnicity'' up +39.8\% under the 34B model) coexist with more modest changes in domains like ``Religion'' drifting by only a few percentage points). Meanwhile, the United States sees moderate benefits across both sensitive and societal topics in the 13B and 34B models but experiences occasional plateaus or minor declines in the 72B model. South Asian countries, such as Pakistan, show drop in improvements in sensitive topics like ``Immigration and Migration'' (--1.1\% under 13B), yet minimal changes in ``Family and relationships'', suggesting that not all societal topics respond equally to image-based cues. \\
Overall, these within-country patterns emphasize that while smaller and mid-sized models can yield strong gains in certain areas, particularly sensitive topics, they may also introduce pronounced drops in others; moreover, having more parameters (as in the 72B model) does not necessarily guarantee broader or more consistent improvements.




% \noindent
% In general, while using images as cultural cues often improves alignment in culturally-sensitive topics like \textit{Immigration and Migration} and \textit{Race and Ethnicity}, for instance boosting Brazil’s \textit{Race and Ethnicity} alignment in the 13B model by more than 20\% and raising Nigeria’s score in \textit{Immigration and Migration} by nearly 19\%, these gains do not occur uniformly across all countries or model sizes; the 72B model, for example, exhibits smaller or inconsistent improvements in certain areas and even occasional declines for countries such as Mexico.\\

\textbf{Statistical Significance}: 
We performed statistical significance testing using bootstrapping with 10000 samples to compare the model's responses with and without image inputs. The p-values here indicate whether the inclusion of images leads to a statistically significant difference in the model's alignment with cultural values for each topic and model size. Considering p<0.05 to be statically significant, we find that the inclusion of images resulted in statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) for significant number of topics across all models, indicating that images significantly affect the model's responses. Detailed values are shown in \Cref{tab:pvalues}.

% In general, using images as cultural cues generally improves alignment in culturally sensitive topics such as immigration and race, more significantly in the 13B model. The larger model (34B) does not consistently benefit from the use of images across all topics and shows more pronounced declines in certain areas like family and demographics, suggesting that either the larger models might need a much stronger cultural signal for some topics or that they may not require as much support from visual cues for certain topics.
% - Variability across countries in response to model changes suggests cultural nuances play a significant role in how models interpret visual versus textual information. 




%    - **Race and Ethnicity**: In the 34 billion model, this category saw varied improvements by country, with France showing almost 40% improvement.

% 3. **Country-Specific Outcomes**:
%    - **Vietnam**: Saw only a 2.7% improvement in race and ethnicity.
%    - **Brazil and Pakistan**: Experienced a decrease in value alignment when using the larger model.
%    - **France and Italy**: Saw a decrease in alignment for demographic topics by 17% and 15% respectively.
%    - **Nigeria and South Korea**: Saw nearly a 25% improvement in the demographic category.

% To calculate more precise statistics, we would need numerical data associated with each point (such as the baseline values, the actual improvement percentages, etc.). If you have such data, I can help compute specific statistical metrics like averages, standard deviations, or more detailed comparisons.

\subsection{Value Alignment - People and Income Scale}

In our evaluation of model performance images of people from different income groups, we computed the average similarity score for value alignment with a) country prompt and b) image-only prompt for each of the 15 topics across both high and low-income groups. We observe that where topics are abstract and involve complex, nuanced discussions (like methodology, economics, and security), image and country prompts both align the model similarly. In contrast, topics with more concrete and universally recognized elements (like race, social values and politics) image help in better value alignment as seen in \Cref{fig:demo_race_income}. \Cref{tab:mean-similarity} shows mean similarity for high-income and low-income countries for all topic categories and \Cref{fig:all_income_level} shows this as a comparison across all question categories.\\

\textbf{Overall Performance Across Models}: \Cref{tab:full_data} shows \% change in mean similarity ((mean with image prompt - mean with country prompt)/(mean with image prompt)) for models across income groups for all question categories. High percentages indicate better improvement due to culture-specific images. We observe that the 13B model shows inconsistent performance with notable declines in several categories, particularly in high-income countries. For instance, in \textit{gender and LGBTQ}, the 13B model records a decline of -6.45\% in high-income countries and -14.77\% in low-income countries, compared to gains of 0.01\% (34B) and 0.55\% (72B) in high-income regions and 0.14\% (72B) in low-income regions.

The 34B and 72B models exhibit relatively better performance in culturally sensitive topics like \textit{politics and policy} and \textit{security}, where the 72B model achieves the highest gains in low-income countries: 27.62\% for \textit{politics and policy} and 2.53\% for \textit{security}. Similarly, in high-income regions, the 72B model outperforms the smaller models in these categories, achieving gains of 11.80\% in \textit{politics and policy} and 10.94\% in \textit{security}.

In \textit{social values and attitudes}, the 13B model performs well in high-income countries (33.52\%), while the 34B model achieves moderate gains (9.80\%), and the 72B model lags behind with only a 0.38\% improvement. In low-income regions, the 13B model achieves 25.29\%, whereas the larger models show negligible improvements: 0.77\% (34B) and 0.54\% (72B).

For \textit{immigration and migration}, the 72B model performs better in high-income countries with a gain of 6.31\%, while the 13B model shows 3.97\%. However, the 13B model performs poorly in low-income countries, recording a decline of -2.94\%, while the 72B model shows a small improvement of 2.53\%.

Interestingly, the 72B model shows improvements in \textit{family and relationships} for both high-income (10.94\%) and low-income (7.29\%) countries, outperforming the smaller models. In \textit{race and ethnicity}, the 34B model leads in high-income regions with 14.03\%, followed by the 72B model with -0.61\%, while the 13B model records a decline of -3.78\%.

Overall, the 13B model struggles with consistency, showing larger declines in several categories, particularly in low-income countries. The 34B and 72B models perform better in some categories like \textit{politics and policy} and \textit{security}, but their performance is also topic-dependent. These results suggest that larger models, despite their capacity, may require additional fine-tuning to handle cultural nuances effectively across diverse global contexts.

% In general, our results suggest that the 13B model is better aligned with cultural contexts represented visually via people across a broad range of topics and income groups. Larger models, such as the 34B and 72B, struggle to adapt to these contexts consistently and often exhibit negative performance in several key areas, particularly in low-income regions. These observations suggest that larger models may require additional fine-tuning or more robust cultural signals to perform effectively across diverse global settings.

% Overall our results suggest that when culture is represented solely via people in the visual domain, the 13B model is more adept at handling a broad range of topics across diverse income groups, particularly in culturally and socially complex areas. The 34B model, despite its larger capacity, shows inconsistent improvements and even negative performance in several key areas, particularly in low-income regions. This might also suggest that larger models may require further fine-tuning to handle such visual nuances effectively across diverse global settings.

\section{Conclusion}

We evaluated multimodal models to capture their inherent cultural knowledge and observe their sensitivity to cultural values across diverse global contexts. Our results also show the importance of multimodal inputs — particularly images — in improving cultural sensitivity, especially for certain domains like race ethnicity and religion. This suggests that while working with multimodal models in real-world applications, they must be tailored more carefully to the cultural context of the task at hand. We also identified a significant disparity between value responses when images were represented by people from different economic countries. Our results show in such scenarios, models are biased and align better with high-income countries in general. Biases can have real-world effects \cite{sakib2024risks,liyanage2023ethical,lim2024african} emphasizing the need for diverse datasets and inclusive strategies in model development. We know that culture is a complex system and when using models, these complex interactions between model size, and input modality (image vs. text) can amplify; emphasizing the need for tailored approaches depending on the specific application and target demographic. 

\section{Limitations}

Despite the interesting results we observed across models and our datasets, we acknowledge the size of our dataset. We were very selective in our choices of images as we realized that smaller models need strong guidance when probed about cultural questions. We made our best attempt to generalize across various categories of images (tradition, food etc) to reduce a category bias. Also, models in the 13B–34B range are lighter models and strike a good balance between generalization and specificity, making them ideal for capturing cultural values without being overwhelming in scale. They are also more interpretable than their larger counterparts, giving researchers future possibilities to better explore and understand how the model arrived at a given cultural response. We realize that evaluating cultural values is a complex task as the value of ``a culture'' should not be a broad generalization to all the people of that culture. However, given the rapid commercialization of models at scale, we believe that understanding where these models may be sensitive can help mitigating potential biases, improving cultural alignment, and ensuring ethical deployment across diverse global contexts





% DollarStreet provides us with images of people across different countries. Most of these photographs of people have been shot in their home or right outside their home. Fig <> shows these photographs across different countries. To ensure that our multimodal model has a good understanding of the demography of these images, we first run a demography prediction classifier of all the available images per country. 

% We allowed the model to predict top 3 choices per image and chose the countries for which top2 accuracy was 100\%. We choose top3 because:
% a) we recognize thats its hard to categorize people into countries based on simply how they look; especially images without significant presence of cultural entity e.g. a widely recognized cultural dress 
% b) we observed that top2 countries predicted were pretty close in their demographic and income association e.g. for an image with family in Nigeria, it could predict ‘kenya’ as first choice and ‘Nigeria’ as second and vice versa. We also observed that top3 accuracy was the same as top2 except for Bangladesh, whose images were sometimes being classified as ‘Pakistan’. Given their similarity in demography and economic status, we allow for this flexibility. It is also worth note that since our comparison is across the broad income categories: rich, medium and low income; our final results are not affected.

We observe that \textit{Politics and Policy}, \textit{Demographics}, \textit{Immigration and migration} and \textit{Race and Ethnicity} exhibit statistically significant differences (\( p < 0.05 \)) across all model sizes. In contrast, topics such as \textit{International Affairs} and \textit{News habits and media} only achieve significance in certain models.

\subsection{Income Level Classification Method}

We prompted the model to predict the top 3 choices per image and chose the countries for which top2 accuracy was 100\%. We choose the top 2 because:
a) we recognize that it is hard to categorize people into countries based on simply how they look; especially images without significant presence of cultural entity e.g. a widely recognized cultural dress 
b) we observed that the top 2 countries predicted were pretty close in their demographic and income association e.g. for an image with family in Nigeria, it could predict ‘Kenya’ as the first choice and ‘Nigeria’ as second and vice versa. We also observed that the top 3 accuracy was the same as the top 2 except for Bangladesh, whose images were sometimes classified as ‘Pakistan’. Given their similarity in demography and economic status, we allow for this flexibility. It is also worth noting that since our comparison is across the broad income categories: high and low income; our final results are not affected.
