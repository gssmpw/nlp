\textbf{Data Structure}          & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\textbf{Geometry Representation} & \\
halfEdges                        & 3 half-edges per triangle (start/end, face, next, twin). \\
\hline
\textbf{General}                 & \\
charts                           & List of charts; can hold a user-defined maximal number of charts. \\
visibleTriangles                 & Visible triangle (VT) buffer; one boolean value per triangle indicating whether it is visible. \\
metadata                         & Small metadata buffer for number of charts in this frame and chosen scale factor out of 64. \\
\hline
\textbf{Union-Find}              & \\
triangleToRoot                   & Mapping from each triangle to its "root" in union-find. \\
rootToChart                      & Mapping from each root triangle to its chart index in the charts buffer. \\
vertToChart                      & Mapping from each vertex to its chart index in the charts buffer. \\
\hline
\textbf{Cuckoo Hash Sorting}     & \\
chartCountAndOffsetPerSize       & Two integers per chart height (starting point in even and odd positions). \\
chartIndicesSparse               & Scratch buffer with enough space for $4\times$ the maximal number of charts. \\
chartIndicesCompacted            & Compacted scratch buffer with enough space for $4\times$ the maximal number of charts. \\
sortedCharts                     & Mapping from sorted index to chart index in the charts buffer. \\
\hline
\textbf{Folding and Pushing}     & \\
prefixSum                        & Prefix sum of the sorted chart widths. \\
pivotIndices                     & Index of the last chart in each row, per parallel scale factor. \\
overfillScaleFactor              & One scale per parallel scale factor (the scale required to fit all rows in the atlas width). \\
offsets                          & Intermediate x, y offsets in the atlas for each chart, per parallel scale factor. \\
numPivotsAndOverfill             & Two integers per parallel scale factor (number of folding points and maximum vertical height reached by charts). \\
frontLine                        & Total chart height at each x-position in the atlas during pushing, per parallel scale factor.

\caption{Data structures used in each stage of FastAtlas atlas computation. Our implementation maintains each buffer separately for readability, but we note that in particularly memory-constrained environments, further optimizations are viable by reusing intermediate buffer storage between stages.}
