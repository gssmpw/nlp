\subsection{When There Are Never-Observable Rewards}
\label{appendix:never_obsrv}
Mon-MDPs designed by \citet{parisi2024beyond} do not have non-ergodic monitors, which give rise to unsolvable Mon-MDPs. Hence we introduce \textbf{Bottleneck} to investigate the performance of \thealgo compared to Directed-E$^2$. 

As noted in footnote~\ref{fn:DE2-initialize}, Directed-E$^2$'s performance in these settings depends critically on its reward model initialization.  In order to see minimax-optimal performance from that algorithm, we need to initialize it pessimistically.  Using the recommended random initialization saw essentially no learning in these domains.  The algorithm would believe the never-observable rewards were at their initialized value, and so seek them out rather than treat their value pessimistically.

In Bottleneck the underlying reward of cells marked by $\bot$ is the same as being a snake (-10). In these experiments we use Full-Random monitor since it is more stochastic than Semi-Random to increase the challeng. Results are shown in \cref{fig:result_new_env}. The location of the button is chosen to test deep exploration capabilities of the agents to do a long sequence of costly actions in order to obtain the highest return. As a result the range of returns that the agent obtains with Button monitor is naturally lower than the rest of the Mon-MDPs.

One of the weaknesses of Directed-E$^2$ is the explicit dependency on the size of the state space in its objective. Since it tries to visit every joint state-action pair infinitely often without paying attention to their importance on maximizing the return, as the state space gets larger, the performance of Directed-E$^2$ deteriorates. To highlight this issue we use N-Experts monitor as an extension of Ask monitor; Ask is a special case when $N = 1$. We see in Figure~\ref{fig:result_new_env} Directed-E$^2$'s performance is hindered considerably when the agent faces N-Experts compared to Ask, while \thealgo suffers to a lesser degree.
