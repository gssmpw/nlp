\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
We evaluate our method through editing experiments conducted on two experiments. In \cref{sec:5.1}, we perform a comparison on image-to-image editing across several datasets. In \cref{sec:5.2}, we extend our evaluation to editable Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) \cite{mildenhall2021nerf}.

\subsection{Editing NeRF}
We conduct experiments involving 3D rendering of edited images to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in maintaining structural consistency. This approach is particularly relevant as consistency has an even greater impact on outcomes in 3D environments.

\input{sec/5_2_EditingNeRF}
%To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in maintaining structural consistency during image editing and correcting errors progressively throughout training, we also conduct experiments involving 3D rendering of edited images. This approach is particularly relevant as consistency has an even greater impact on outcomes in 3D environments.
