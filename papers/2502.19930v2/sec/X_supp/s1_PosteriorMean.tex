\section{Posterior mean analysis}
\label{sec:s_postmean}

To investigate how much identity of the original image $\mathbf{z}$ is contained in the text-conditioned score $\epsilon_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}, y, t)$, we conduct the experiment in which the posterior mean is obtained from various timesteps. As shown in the first row of \cref{fig:post_mean3}, more primary information is damaged as the timestep $t$ increases. On the other hand, when using FPR, since the score $\epsilon_\phi(\mathbf{z}, y, t)$ is modified to preserve the identity of $\mathbf{z}$, we can see that it has more information than before, even at large timestep, as described in the second and third row of \cref{fig:post_mean3}. Note that the score $\epsilon_\phi(\mathbf{z}, y, t)$ can be controlled by updating the injection noise $\epsilon$ or the noisy latent $\mathbf{z}_t$. Of the two options, it has been updated for $\mathbf{z}_t$ because it contains more content details.
