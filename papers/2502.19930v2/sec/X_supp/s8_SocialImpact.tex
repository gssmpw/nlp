% simple description
By optimizing for a given image, our method properly mitigates the undesired biases introduced by the generative priors of large text-to-image diffusion models. However, the issue of bias toward target information persists. Furthermore, the method's potential misuse for generating fake content highlights a critical ethical challenge commonly associated with image editing techniques. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement robust safeguards, such as stricter content authentication mechanisms, and ethical guidelines for usage.
