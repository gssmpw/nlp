\section{Metrics for FPR}
\label{sec:s_metricsforfpr}

As defined in \cref{eq:fpr}
%Eq. (6)
, $d(\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2)$ can be any metric to calculate the difference between two inputs. For comparison, we
consider three different strategies: (1) Euclidean loss, (2) L1 loss, and (3) SSIM loss. 
As demonstrated in \cref{fig:sup_loss_abl}, all metrics can be applied to our method for image editing according to text prompts.
Among these, the use of Euclidean loss is particularly notable, as it effectively preserved the original information while producing visually superior results.
