  abstract={Electrocardiography is the gold standard technique for detecting abnormal heart conditions. Automatic detection of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities helps clinicians analyze the large amount of data produced daily by cardiac monitors. As thenumber of abnormal ECG samples with cardiologist-supplied labels required to train supervised machine learning models is limited, there is a growing need for unsupervised learning methods for ECG analysis. Unsupervised learning aims to partition ECG samples into distinct abnormality classes without cardiologist-supplied labels–a process referred to as ECG clustering. In addition to abnormality detection, ECG clustering has recently discovered inter and intra-individual patterns that reveal valuable information about the whole body and mind, such as emotions, mental disorders, and metabolic levels. ECG clustering can also resolve specific challenges facing supervised learning systems, such as the imbalanced data problem, and can enhance biometric systems. While several reviews exist on supervised ECG systems, a comprehensive review of unsupervised ECG analysis techniques is still lacking. This study reviews ECG clustering techniques developed mainly in the last decade. The focus will be on recent machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their practical applications. We critically review and compare these techniques, discuss their applications and limitations, and provide future research directions. This review provides further insights into ECG clustering and presents the necessary information required to adopt the appropriate algorithm for a specific application.},

	abstract = {The prediction of chaotic time series, which constitutes many systems in the field of science and engineering, has recently become the focus of attention of researchers. Chaotic time series prediction is making future predictions about these systems using previously observed data for a nonlinear chaotic system with a known initial condition. Chaotic time series prediction can be applied in many fields such as weather forecasting, finance and stock markets. Many disciplines work on solving time series prediction problem, ranging from forecasting weather events days in advance to traders predicting the future of stocks. In recent studies, it has been observed that hybrid deep neural network methods give better performance in solving time series prediction problems and have gained popularity in order to benefit from the advantages of more than one method in solving such problems. In this study, a hybrid deep neural network architecture is proposed for chaotic time series prediction. The used hybrid approach includes both temporal convolutional network to extract low level features from input and recurrent neural network layers such as long short-term memory and gated recurrent units to capture temporal information. Simulations were carried out on nine different chaotic time series dataset which are obtained from Lorenz, Rössler and a Lorenz-like chaotic equation sets, and twentyone electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients with arrhythmias. In the benchmark study, in which twelve different methods, including classical machine learning, deep neural network and hybrid models were used, the proposed model achieved the best prediction performance with an average rootmean-square error (RMSE) value of 0.0022 for chaotic dataset and 0.0082 for ECG arrhythmia dataset. Performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed hybrid architecture can compete with the models in state-of-the-art studies in chaotic time series prediction.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are some of the primary causes of death; yet the early detection and diagnosis of such diseases have the potential to save many lives. Technological means of detection are becoming increasingly essential and numerous techniques have been created for this purpose, such as forecasting. Of these techniques, the time series forecasting technique seeks to predict future events. The long-term time series forecasting of physiological data could assist medical professionals in predicting and treating patients based on very early diagnosis. This article presents a model that utilizes a deep learning technique to predict long-term ECG signals. The forecasting model can learn signals’ nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and complexity based on a long short-term memory architecture. However, this is not a trivial task as the correct forecasting of a signal that closely resembles the original complex signal’s structure and behavior while minimizing any differences in amplitude continues to pose challenges. To achieve this goal, we used a dataset available on the Physio net database, called MIT-BIH, with 48 ECG recordings of 30 min each. The developed model starts with pre-processing to reduce interference in the original signals, then applies a deep learning algorithm, based on a long short-term memory (LTSM) neural network with two hidden layers. Next, we applied the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics to evaluate the performance of the model and obtained an average RMSE of 0.0070 ± 0.0028 and an average MAE of 0.0522 ± 0.0098 across all simulations. The results indicate that the proposed LSTM model is a promising technique for ECG forecasting, considering the trends of the changes in the original data series, most notably in R-peak amplitude. Given the model’s accuracy and the features of the physiological signals, the system could be used to improve existing predictive healthcare systems for cardiovascular monitoring.},

	abstract = {Early identification of atrial fibrillation (AF) can reduce the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other serious cardiovascular outcomes. However, paroxysmal AF may not be detected even after a two-week continuous monitoring period. We developed a model to quantify the risk of near-term AF in a two-week period, based on AF-free ECG intervals of up to 24 h from 459,889 patch-based ambulatory single-lead ECG (modified lead II) recordings of up to 14 days. A deep learning model was used to integrate ECG morphology data with demographic and heart rhythm features toward AF prediction. Observing a 1-day AF-free ECG recording, the model with deep learning features produced the most accurate prediction of near-term AF with an area under the curve AUC = 0.80 (95\% confidence interval, CI = 0.79–0.81), significantly improving discrimination compared to demographic metrics alone (AUC 0.67; CI = 0.66–0.68). Our model was able to predict incident AF over a two-week time frame with high discrimination, based on AF-free single-lead ECG recordings of various lengths. Application of the model may enable a digital strategy for improving diagnostic capture of AF by risk stratifying individuals with AF-negative ambulatory monitoring for prolonged or recurrent monitoring, potentially leading to more rapid initiation of treatment.},

For every signal we generated 47 descriptors with different signal analysis methods. Then, we performed feature selection using several methods and used selected feature for building predictive models with the help of Random Forest algorithm. Entire modelling procedure was performed within 5-fold cross-validation procedure that was repeated 10 times. Results were stable and repeatable. The results obtained (AUC = 0.82, MCC = 0.45) are statistically significant and show that RR intervals carry information about arrhythmia onset. The sample size used in this study was too small to build useful medical predictive models, hence large data sets should be explored to construct models of sufficient quality to be of direct utility in medical practice.},

	abstract = {Many algorithms have been developed for automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classiﬁcation. Due to the non-stationary nature of the ECG signal, it is rather challenging to use traditional handcraft methods, such as time-based analysis of feature extraction and classiﬁcation, to pave the way for machine learning implementation. This paper proposed a novel method, i.e., the ensemble of depthwise separable convolutional (DSC) neural networks for the classiﬁcation of cardiac arrhythmia ECG beats. Using our proposed method, the four stages of ECG classiﬁcation, i.e., QRS detection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation, were reduced to two steps only, i.e., QRS detection and classiﬁcation. No preprocessing method was required while feature extraction was combined with classiﬁcation. Moreover, to reduce the computational cost while maintaining its accuracy, several techniques were implemented, including All Convolutional Network (ACN), Batch Normalization (BN), and ensemble convolutional neural networks. The performance of the proposed ensemble CNNs were evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrythmia database. In the training phase, around 22\% of the 110,057 beats data extracted from 48 records were utilized. Using only these 22\% labeled training data, our proposed algorithm was able to classify the remaining 78\% of the database into 16 classes. Furthermore, the sensitivity (Sn), speciﬁcity (Sp), and positive predictivity (Pp), and accuracy (Acc) are 99.03\%, 99.94\%, 99.03\%, and 99.88\%, respectively. The proposed algorithm required around 180 µs, which is suitable for real time application. These results showed that our proposed method outperformed other state of the art methods.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semisupervised learning (SSL) based AF classification model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. Our proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on our unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91\% with just 20\% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the primary reason for mortality worldwide. As per WHO survey report in 2019, 17.9 million people died due to CVDs, accounting for 32\% of all global deaths. Among these, heart attacks and strokes were responsible for 85\%, whereas CVDs caused 38\% of the premature deaths (under age of 70) affected by non-communicable diseases. The rate of death can be delayed and may be prevented by efficiently analyzing the ECG signals (i.e., captured by a non-invasive method) at the early stage of the disease. QRS complex in ECG provides pivotal information about the heart diseases. Many researchers have analyzed the ECG signal by traditional approach and machine learning methods for identifying the heart disorders. Performance of these techniques depend on accurate detection of different parameters (such as: P-, Q-, R-, S-, T-waveforms, QRS complex duration, R-peak, PR-interval, and RR-interval) from the ECG signals. This review paper provides a detail discussion and comparison of various ECG analysis techniques along with their pros and cons. It summarizes the ECG capturing method, databases available for disease detection \& classification, and performance measures used by the researchers. Based on these, a future road map is suggested for real time ECG analysis (for identifying the heart related conditions) captured from the wearable devices and suggested the precautionary steps by the artificial system and experts. This method will help in identifying the co-relation of heart disorders with other body organs (such as: retina and brain parts) by analyzing ECG, fundus image, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human brain.},
