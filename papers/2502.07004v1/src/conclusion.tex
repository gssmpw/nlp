\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have studied the behavior of high-norm tokens in LLMs from four perspectives, covering their whole life cycle.
To this end, we have extended the theory of singular defects from ViTs to LLMs.
Specifically, our theory gives a mathematical characterization of the behavior of high-norm tokens that is unique to LLMs.
We have extensively verified our theory on a variety of recent models, and our insights have also motivated two practical applications, including a high-norm aware quantization scheme and the design of an LLM signature that may be used to detect model infringement.
We hope that our study will motivate advances in the understanding of the internal mechanisms of LLMs.
