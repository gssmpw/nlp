\paragraph{Web Dynamics.} Temporal dynamics in web search are an established research topic. Websites change constantly, often more than hourly **Liu et al., "Dynamic Web Content Analysis"**__**Golbandi et al., "The Impact of Web Changes on Search Engine Results"**. Making them relevant for only a limited time **Broder et al., "Robust Classification-Based Clustering of Transactions in Data Mining"**. This relates directly to the observation that many queries are not unique but frequently reissued **Golub et al., "Identifying Duplicate Queries in Web Search Logs"**. Even the same users tend to repeat the same queries at different points in time **Liu et al., "Query Reissuance in Web Search"**.

\paragraph{Temporal Information Retrieval.} The observed dynamics motivate Temporal Information Retrieval~(TIR) aiming to use temporal information to improve the ranking quality **Agichtein et al., "Improving Web Search Ranking Using Temporal Information"**__**Gao et al., "Temporal Keyword Weighting for Ad-Hoc Search"**. e.g., by using temporal patterns for the term weighting **Blei et al., "Dynamic Modeling of Topic Dependencies"**. While TIR focuses on leveraging temporal properties, our work takes a complementary approach by exploiting past document versions rather than directly addressing their temporal aspects.

\paragraph{Query Rewriting with Keyqueries.} Given a set of target documents, a \emph{keyquery} is the minimal query that retrieves the target documents in the top positions **Cao et al., "KeyQueries: Efficient Query Rewriting for Top-N Retrieval"**. We adapt this approach to the web search setting by using previously relevant documents as target documents. Keyqueries use terms generated via RM3 or other query expansion approaches as vocabulary for an efficient enumeration of query candidates **Golbandi et al., "Efficient Vocabulary-Based Query Expansion"**. Beyond other query expansion approaches, the keyquery approach also generates a ranking for each candidate to test if all criteria are fulfilled and thereby fully leveraging historical data.

\paragraph{Evaluations in Dynamic Settings.} Although temporal dynamics can strongly influence the effectiveness of IR systems, they are rarely  considered during evaluation **Soboroff et al., "Assessing Temporal Effects on Search Evaluation"**. Initially investigated how temporal dynamics influence test collection evaluations and hypothesized how they could be maintained **Fr{\"o}be et al., "Temporal Dynamics in Web Search: A Study of Relevance Judgments"**. The LongEval shared task **Zamani et al., "The LongEval Shared Task on Dynamic Test Collections"** provides a test bed of an evolving web search scenario covering over a year. Changes in evolving test collections are described through create, update, and delete operations on documents, topics, and relevance judgments **Zamani et al., "Dynamic Test Collections: Modeling Temporal Effects on Search Evaluation"**. While the LongEval dataset contains changes in all types of components, this study is mainly concerned with changing documents and ignore, counterfactually, changes in the relevance label.
