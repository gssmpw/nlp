    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the study} - the approach to developing a foundation model for head CT and its performance in disease detection tasks. \textbf{a,} Collection of training data and pretraining of the foundation model. \textbf{b,} Query disease labels associated with head CT scans for downstream tasks. \textbf{c,} Evaluation design of the foundation model using both internal and external datasets. \textbf{d,} Application of the foundation model to various downstream disease detection tasks. \textbf{e-g,} The performance comparison among different scenarios: (e) training with and without foundation model, (f) comparison of our CT foundation model vs. other CT foundation models, (g) in-domain finetuning and external validation in transfer learning.}
