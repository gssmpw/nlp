\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential to integrate physical model knowledge for real-world signal interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Wi-Chat, the first LLM-powered Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition system. We demonstrate that LLMs can process raw Wi-Fi signals and infer human activities by incorporating Wi-Fi sensing principles into prompts. Our approach leverages physical model insights to guide LLMs in interpreting Channel State Information (CSI) data without traditional signal processing techniques. Through experiments on real-world Wi-Fi datasets, we show that LLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, achieving zero-shot activity recognition. These findings highlight a new paradigm for Wi-Fi sensing, expanding LLM applications beyond conventional language tasks and enhancing the accessibility of wireless sensing for real-world deployments.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced Wi-Chat, the first LLM-powered Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the sensing potential of wireless signals. Our experimental results on a self-collected Wi-Fi CSI dataset demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs in enabling zero-shot Wi-Fi sensing. These findings suggest a new paradigm for human activity recognition that does not rely on extensive labeled data. We hope future research will build upon this direction, further exploring the applications of LLMs in signal processing domains such as IoT, mobile sensing, and radar-based systems.

\section*{Limitations}
While our work represents the first attempt to leverage LLMs for processing Wi-Fi signals, it is a preliminary study focused on a relatively simple task: Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition. This choice allows us to explore the feasibility of LLMs in wireless sensing but also comes with certain limitations.

Our approach primarily evaluates zero-shot performance, which, while promising, may still lag behind traditional supervised learning methods in highly complex or fine-grained recognition tasks. Besides, our study is limited to a controlled environment with a self-collected dataset, and the generalizability of LLMs to diverse real-world scenarios with varying Wi-Fi conditions, environmental interference, and device heterogeneity remains an open question.

Additionally, we have yet to explore the full potential of LLMs in more advanced Wi-Fi sensing applications, such as fine-grained gesture recognition, occupancy detection, and passive health monitoring. Future work should investigate the scalability of LLM-based approaches, their robustness to domain shifts, and their integration with multimodal sensing techniques in broader IoT applications.
