\section{Conclusion}

We presented FlexControl, a dynamic framework that reimagines controlled diffusion by replacing heuristic block selection with a trainable, computation-aware gating mechanism. By enabling adaptive activation of control blocks during denoising, FlexControl eliminates manual architectural tuning, reduces computational overhead, and maintains or improves output fidelity across diverse tasks and architectures (UNet, DiT). Our experiments demonstrate that flexibility and efficiency need not be mutually exclusive in controllable generationâ€”intelligent, data-driven activation strategies can outperform rigid, handcrafted designs. This work paves the way for future research into lightweight, generalizable control mechanisms for increasingly complex generative pipelines. We also conduct a further investigation on the dynamic activation route, which has been listed in \cref{app:exploration}.
