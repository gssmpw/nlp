\section{Conclusion}
We have presented \textsc{GreT},  a complexity-adaptive model for general temporal tensor decomposition.
\MODEL  can reveal the underlying rank of a temporal tensor with continuously indexed modes while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance and capturing interpretable temporal patterns.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks validate its effectiveness.
