It relies on a variation of the local-ratio theorem, which may be of use for other algorithms in the semi-streaming model as well.},

Our algorithm finds an independent set A such that w(A*)/w(A)≤ d/2 where A* is an independent that maximizes w(A*). The previous best polynomial time approximation algorithm obtained w(A*)/w(A)≤ 2d/3.},

This is in large part due to the non-availability of public designs depicting industrial wiring stacks and other complexities affecting design routability.The aim of the DAC 2012 routability-driven placement contest is to address these issues, by way of the following: (a) release challenging benchmark designs that are derived from modern industrial ASICs, and contain information to perform both placement and routing, (b) present a new congestion metric, as well as an accurate congestion analysis framework to evaluate and compare the routability of various placement algorithms. We hope that a set of challenging benchmarks, along with a standard, publicly available evaluation framework will further advance research in routability-driven placement.},

  abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

However, during the last five years, no new circuits have been introduced that can be used for developing fundamental physical design applications, such as partitioning and placement. The largest circuit in the existing set of benchmark suites has over 100,000 modules, but the second largest has just over 25,000 modules, which is small by today's standards. This paper introduces the ISPD98 benchmark suite which consists of 18 circuits with sizes ranging from 13,000 to 210,000 modules. Experimental results for three existing partitioners are presented so that future researchers in partitioning can more easily evaluate their heuristics.},
