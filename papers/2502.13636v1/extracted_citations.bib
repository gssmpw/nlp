Our algorithm finds an independent set A such that w(A*)/w(A)≤ d/2 where A* is an independent that maximizes w(A*).

  abstract = {We present a simple deterministic single-pass (2+ϵ)-approximation algorithm for the maximum weight matching problem in the semi-streaming model. This improves on the currently best known approximation ratio of (4+ϵ).Our algorithm uses O(nlog2 n) bits of space for constant values of ϵ. It relies on a variation of the local-ratio theorem, which may be of use for other algorithms in the semi-streaming model as well.},
