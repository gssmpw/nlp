\section{Texture Generation}\label{sec:texture}
Thanks to the finely detailed and high-quality 3D geometry generated by \method{}, referring to Meta 3D TextureGen~\cite{bensadoun2024meta}, we can leverage the rendered normal maps as input conditions for existing mature multi-view generation methods to produce consistent multi-view texture images. These multi-view texture images are then projected onto the geometric surface to obtain detailed texture maps. 
Fig.\ref{fig:texture_demo_show} shows the 3D result with texture maps generated by \method{}.
