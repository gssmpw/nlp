\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video generation to unprecedented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data processing, and insufficient exploration of advanced techniques in the 3D domain.
Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capability, and alignment with input conditions.
We present \method{}, a new streamlined shape diffusion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images.
Specifically, we propose: 
1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data.
2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction performance.
3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high-quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D generative models.
Through comprehensive experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled \method{} to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation.
The resulting 3D shapes exhibit enhanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input images.
Moreover, \method{} demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.
To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we open source our model and code at: \href{https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TripoSG}{\textcolor{red}{TripoSG}}.
