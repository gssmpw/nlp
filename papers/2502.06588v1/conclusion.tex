\section{Conclusion}

We have studied several open-source RISC-V cores to understand how to design energy efficient standard-ISA processors for subthreshold operation.
With power simulations, we found that 2-stage pipelined Vex-2 is the most energy efficient of the cores we evaluate.
All the multi-cycle cores perform significantly worse than the pipelined cores due to their high average CPI, which negatively affect execution times and energy. 
Modifying the pipeline from two to five stages, as implemented by Vex-5, was found to have limited effect on execution time in subthreshold.  A significant amount of buffers are necessary to keep timing, and the buffering needs increase when going to five stages.  These buffers lead to limited reduction in cycle times when adding pipeline stages, but the area and power increases significantly. The 5-stage pipelines are, therefore, much less energy efficient than the 2-stage pipelines, and we conclude that the 2-stage pipeline is the sweet spot for  energy efficient subthreshold RISC-V cores.
