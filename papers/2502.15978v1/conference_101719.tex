\begin{abstract}
%Despite multiple interventions, maternal and child health (MCH) in India continues to encounter obstacles that result in subpar healthcare practices, especially in underprivileged populations. This study explores how can we design a culturally relevant chatbot for mothers and children upto 3 years of age. Using a mixed-method approach that blends quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, this study investigates the target population's adoption of technology, communication preferences, and healthcare behaviors. The findings reveal that using a smartphone and WhatsApp is common, a reliance on medical professions and openess to use chatbots and online advice systems. These realizations highlight how crucial it is to create tailored interventions that combine technology and traditional support networks to enhance MCH outcomes. 
Access to health information and services among women continues to be a major challenge in many communities globally. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of chatbots to address this information and access gap. We conducted interviews and focus group discussions with underserved women in urban India to understand their receptivity towards the use of chatbots for maternal and child health, as well as barriers to their adoption. Our findings uncover gaps in digital access and literacies, and perceived conflict with various responsibilities that women are burdened with, which shape their interactions with digital technology. Our paper offers insights into the design of chatbots for community health that can meet the lived realities of women in underserved settings.

\section{Conclusion}

Our study findings highlight the significant challenges and opportunities in using technical tools like chatbots to improve healthcare knowledge and accessibility for women and children. Despite the widespread smartphone and WhatsApp usage, participants face challenges in using technology due to time constraints, household responsibilities, and limited digital literacy.

Gaps in child health care knowledge were also very prominent among our participants. Participants expressed a clear desire for accessible, reliable information through chatbots, especially concerning their children's health and development. Our findings also revealed a preference for audio and visual content over text-based information, as many women faced challenges in reading and typing in Hindi or English. This suggests that future digital health interventions, including chatbots, should incorporate features such as voice messaging and visual aids to improve usability and engagement.

Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of designing culturally sensitive, user-friendly technological solutions that take into account the sociocultural constraints, digital literacy levels, and daily realities of women in these communities. By addressing these factors, chatbots and other digital tools have the potential to significantly improve healthcare access and outcomes for mothers and children.

 

%As we did not have a chatbot prototype to test, we initially planned to use the Wizard-of-Oz method, where participants would ask questions and a human would provide responses from the other side. This approach creates a mock interface where a human controls the responses instead of AI. However, when the first author arrived at the data collection site in India and began conducting interviews, we realized it would be challenging to implement this approach because the second author was in the USA, and the time zone difference made coordination difficult. As a result, we decided to create a sample WhatsApp conversation in Hindi to present to participants as an example and gauge their preferences for technology engagement.

%While most participants were able to read the sample conversation and provide feedback, a few had difficulty reading Hindi. Additionally, after conducting several interviews, we realized that the Wizard-of-Oz approach might not have been ideal, as many participants were either too busy with daily chores and some face difficulty in text based conversations. 


% By addressing these, future studies can improve engagement with target communities and gather richer data that reflects their unique experiences and needs. 


%Our study's findings highlight the potential of a WhatsApp chatbot intervention to be a viable tool for maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes. Given the high rates of smartphone and WhatsApp usage among participants, their interest in receiving health information through chatbots indicates a receptive target audience. Participants showed interest in information about child development and nutrition, indicating these areas could be of key focus for the intervention. However, to fully comprehend the potential of this chatbot, future research must address several limitations. First, digital literacy is a significant barrier; many users may not be familiar with or comfortable using chatbots. Tailored training and support could help bridge this gap. Second, language preference is crucial to ensure that the chatbot can communicate effectively in the preferred languages of the users which in turn increases accessibility and comprehension. 

%These groups may face additional barriers such as limited access to technology or lower levels of education, which could impact their ability to benefit from the intervention. Targeted outreach and support, perhaps including community-based initiatives, could help overcome these challenges. Our study also emphasizes the continued importance of family support in healthcare decisions. Integrating family engagement strategies with chatbot technology could enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. A holistic approach that involves family members in health education and decision-making processes may lead to better health outcomes. 

%By acknowledging these considerations and capitalizing on the strengths of chatbot technology, our research lays the groundwork for the development of a culturally appropriate and user-centered intervention that empowers mothers and caregivers, ultimately contributing to improved MCH outcomes in India.
