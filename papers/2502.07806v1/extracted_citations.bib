	abstract = {Credit ratings are one of the primary keys that reflect the level of riskiness and reliability of corporations to meet their financial obligations. Rating agencies tend to take extended periods of time to provide new ratings and update older ones. Therefore, credit scoring assessments using artificial intelligence has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Successful machine learning methods can provide rapid analysis of credit scores while updating older ones on a daily time scale. Related studies have shown that neural networks and support vector machines outperform other techniques by providing better prediction accuracy. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First, we provide a survey and a comparative analysis of results from literature applying machine learning techniques to predict credit rating. Second, we apply ourselves four machine learning techniques deemed useful from previous studies (Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forest, support vector machine and Multilayer Perceptron) to the same datasets. We evaluate the results using a 10-fold cross validation technique. The results of the experiment for the datasets chosen show superior performance for decision tree based models. In addition to the conventional accuracy measure of classifiers, we introduce a measure of accuracy based on notches called ”Notch Distance” to analyze the performance of the above classifiers in the specific context of credit rating. This measure tells us how far the predictions are from the true ratings. We further compare the performance of three major rating agencies, Standard & Poors, Moody’s and Fitch where we show that the difference in their ratings is comparable with the decision tree prediction versus the actual rating on the test dataset.}

	abstract = {An unsorted database contains N records, of which just one satisfies a particular property. The problem is to identify that one record. Any classical algorithm, deterministic or probabilistic, will clearly take O (N) steps since on the average it will have to examine a large fraction of the N records. Quantum mechanical systems can do several operations simultaneously due to their wave like properties. This paper gives an O (√N) step quantum mechanical algorithm for identifying that record. It is within a constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

@article{Schuld2019,
	abstract = {A basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning, namely, to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large Hilbert space. In this Letter we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyze the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. The kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualize the working principle with two-dimensional minibenchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {A computer is generally considered to be a universal computational device; i.e., it is believed able to simulate any physical computational device with a cost in computation time of at most a polynomial factor: It is not clear whether this is still true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.}
