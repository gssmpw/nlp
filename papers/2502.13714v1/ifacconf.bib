The linearized dynamics of the system have a multivariable zero that is possible to move along the real axis by changing a valve. The zero can be placed in both the left and the right half-plane. In this way the quadruple-tank process is ideal for illustrating many concepts in multivariable control, particularly performance limitations due to multivariable right half-plane zeros. The location and the direction of the zero have an appealing physical interpretation. Accurate models are derived from both physical and experimental data and decentralized control is demonstrated on the process. © 2000 IEEE.},
