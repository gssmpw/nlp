- re-state lemmas 1 to 5 in the details section using the tool of thms 1 to 4.

%- table of results (or other visual form to improve comparison)




- what if $\Delta$ is unknown - could we still simulate our algorithm? we could interleave protocols for $\Delta$ being a power of $2$, but first, we need to assure consistency between them, and second, could we determine termination?

- how to compute short schedules? maybe there is a trade-off between short schedule implementable (even in off-line fashion) on beeping network and the number of rounds to compute such a schedule in a distributed way? check radio networks literature

- Check carefully best beeping solutions to other problems, so that we could really make a long justified list of problems we improve (not only MIS)

- Prove lower bounds for specific problems, eg. MIS; even $\Delta$ could be good, if it distinguishes from randomized solutions (in MIS, randomized is only $\log^3 n$, without any $\Delta$); I thought I have one, but I found a bug and I need to re-think it; we may also try developing lower bounds for other problems

- Can we find an important problem that does not require $\Delta^2$? In other words, it does not need local broadcast in beeping in order to be solved deterministically? This would nicely contrast with our lower bound $\Delta^2/\log^2 n$ for local broadcast

- Could we improve our lower bound? E.g., eliminate assumption on content-oblivious, and if not entirely possible, we could consider bounded local memory (number of states)? Or extend to other problems, e.g., maximal matching (since we use matching as a tool in realization)?

\section{Introduction}

The study of the Beeping Networks (BN) model is simultaneously interesting, challenging, and useful in several respects. 
Even 
%less restrictive ad-hoc multiple (e.g., wireless) networks 
multiple less-restrictive ad-hoc networks (e.g., wireless) 
are frequently the algorithmist delight: a seemingly simple computational problem that becomes challenging under harsh yet realistic conditions.  In terms of communication, Beeping Networks~\cite{cornejo2010deploying} may be the harshest model: network nodes can only \emph{beep} (emit a signal) or \emph{listen} (detect if a signal is emitted in its vicinity). A listening node may distinguish between \emph{silence} (no beeps) and \emph{noise} (at least one beep), but it cannot distinguish between a single beep and multiple. Theoretically, the Beeping model is important since it enables one to study whether distributed tasks can be performed efficiently under minimal conditions,
 \mam{and it is a fundamental model to study communication complexity on channels where signals are superimposed (by applying the OR operator), which makes it more challenging than the basic model in which transmissions on links are independent. Moreover, in a one-hop network,\footnote{\mam{For any given path of links connecting two nodes, the number of \emph{hops} is the number of links in such path.}} \dk{non-adaptive communication schedules in the Beeping model are} equivalent to superimposed codes, which have been widely applied not only to communication problems, but also to text alignments, bio-computing, data pooling, dimensionality reduction, and other~areas.}
%\sk{Beside the wireless networks motivation, Beeping Networks are also motivated by Biologically Inspired Distributed Algorithms; for example, a node may model a body cell, and a beep may be some molecule secreted by neighboring cells \cite{afek2013beeping,navlakhadistributed}.}

%Algorithms designed for Beeping Networks are useful for massive networks because they can be implemented on non-expensive devices with low energy consumption. For example, on Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as Sensor Networks where a massive number of nodes are deployed for monitoring purposes. 
%The model is also useful for studying natural communication in biological networks~\cite{navlakha2014distributed,afek2011biological} (e.g., fireflies or cells). \mm{Indeed, better understanding the power of biological communication processes may lead to better nature-inspired algorithms~\cite{MooreNeuron24}.} 
%The model 

 

In addition to its theoretical importance, 
this model is recognized as useful for studying natural communication in biological networks~\cite{navlakha2014distributed,afek2011biological} (e.g., 
%fireflies or 
cells). A better understanding of the power of biological communication processes may lead to better nature-inspired algorithms~\cite{MooreNeuron24}.  

It has been argued that the model is also a practical tool because algorithms designed for Beeping Networks can be implemented on non-expensive devices with low energy consumption. For example, nodes are deployed (in ad-hoc topologies) for monitoring in Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as Sensor Networks. It should be noted that a mechanism similar in properties to beeping, called ``busy tone,'' has been in wide use in wireless networks but for very limited purposes in channel access algorithms (as opposed to the Beeping model that is intended for general purposes distributed algorithms). See, e.g., \cite{tobagi1975packet,haas2002dual}.  

 



%\mm{A restricted communication model such as Beeping Networks yields}
%However, such a restricted communication model makes 
%the task of designing algorithms very challenging. 
%\sk{I moved this comment of very challenging to the first paragraph. I think this is the main theme there.}

A wealth of successful research on computational problems in Beeping Networks has appeared in the literature (see, for instance \cite{beauquier2018fast,dufoulon2022beeping} and the references therein). Nevertheless, fundamental distributed computing questions 
%in distributed computing 
remain open in the context of Beeping Networks, especially for deterministic algorithms. 
On the other hand, the \congest ~\cite{peleg2000distributed} model has been profusely studied.
%
%The \congest model is a synchronous, message-passing model of communication where, in each round, nodes are limited to send a (possibly different) message of logarithmic size to each neighboring node.
%
A natural question that follows is how to efficiently transform \congest Network algorithms into Beepping Network algorithms. 

 

%and Maximal Independent Set. 
%In the following sub-section, we detail our positive and negative results. 

\vspace*{-1ex}
\subsection{Our Contributions}

%\todo{We refer to "beeping rounds" and "\congest rounds", but these models were barely mentioned before. Is this fine? SOLUTION: Write a short paragraph about models in the introduction before Our Contributions.}

%\todo{Should we present the results in a more concise form? Such as a table? Or a summary of results in bullet points and the end of the section or at the beginning?}

%\todo{Redact this and add before the first paragraph: "We develop tools: Learning neighborhood, .... Then, we use those tools to obtain one of our main results, beeping simulation of \congest round."}

% \todo{Should we switch the order between Our Contributions and Related Work?}
\vspace*{-0.2ex}
The results are detailed and compared to previous work in Table \ref{table:relwork}.
Our main contributions are the near optimal\footnote{Optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor.} deterministic implementations of two simulators.
The main simulator efficiently translates any \congest algorithms \mam{(deterministic or randomized)} to the Beeping model.
Each \congest round is simulated using $O(\Delta ^2 \polylog n \log \Delta )$ rounds, improving the previous result of $O(\Delta^4 \log n)$ of \cite{beauquier2018fast}.
The other simulator translates (more efficiently -
$O(B\Delta^2 \log n)$ for sending $B$ bits)
the more specialized
\emph{local broadcast} operation 
(called ``broadcast \congest'' in \cite{davies2023optimal}) 
%\mm{[[MM: should we call it instead Broadcast \congest simulation as in Davies paper? Either way, we have to point out that simulating Broadcast CONGEST is the same as \emph{concurrent} local broadcast, which is what our algorithm does, or otherwise the comparison with Davies upper bound may be confusing]]} 
where, whenever a node sends a message to its neighbors, it sends all of them the same message. It seems interesting that for the specialized simulator, we managed to employ non-adaptive ``Beeping codes'', 
i.e.,
%that is, 
not needing to know the topology nor to adapt an action based on beeps heard from the channel; \dk{as such, its performance almost matches a lower bound $\Omega(\Delta^2\log_\Delta n)$ for {\em non-adaptive} algorithms~\cite{CLEMENTI2003337}.} 
%(It, in \mam{[[something's wrong here, anyway, do we need this parenthesis? if so, we should refer to sections for the other results as well]]} Sections \ref{sec:primitives} with the details in Section  \ref{sec:prim_details}.)
In contrast, for the more general simulator, we had to develop a technique that may be of interest in itself. We started with more complex codes and added a hierarchical structure. On top of that, we developed an adaptive algorithm that employs a novel three-stage handshake to distinguish between a genuine message and a message the adversary may have composed by colliding~several~transmissions.
  
 % we had to construct an adaptive algorithm using a techniq more complex codes
%  (puting a hifor the general simulator.
  %
% The construction is built hierarchically using the known family of so-called ``avoiding selectors''. On top of the above (intuitively, saying ``when to beep'',) we also add a 
%taken for different parameters. 
 %3-stage adaptive %acknowledgement 
%handshake
%procedure (announcing, responding and confirming) on the top of the code. 
%which is an adaptive part. 
%This procedure is tightly correlated with the hierarchical structure of the code -- higher level code triggers announcing, while the lower level codes trigger responding and confirming.}
We demonstrate the usefulness of the general simulator by improving the known results for the problem most heavily investigated under the Beeping model, namely, the Maximal Independent Set (MIS). We also demonstrate the use of the more specialized simulator (plus some additional machinery) to construct efficient algorithms for other common building blocks of algorithms, such as a node learning its neighborhood (in $O(\Delta^2 \log^2 n)$ beeping rounds), 
learning the whole cluster  ($O(\Delta^2 \log^4 n)$ for clusters of depth $O(\log ^2 n)$) for all the clusters in parallel, 
and Network Decomposition ($O(\Delta^2 \log^8 n)$). 

 

Another set of results concerns whether a gap exists between the complexity of randomized and deterministic algorithms. For the task of a general simulation of \congest algorithms, the time taken by our \emph{deterministic} simulator 
%is 
%
($O(\Delta ^2 \polylog n \log \Delta )$),  
matches the known lower bound ($\Omega(\Delta^2 \log n)$~\cite{davies2023optimal}) up to a poly-logarithmic factor. 
%
The proof of the $\Omega(\Delta^2 \log n)$ lower bound in~\cite{davies2023optimal} is based on requiring each node to transmit a different string of bits to each of its neighbors.\footnote{This problem is 
%in fact 
named local broadcast 
%for the lower bound 
in~\cite{davies2023optimal}.
However, 
if a different message is sent to each neighbor, the reason for calling it broadcast is unclear. 
We reserve the name local broadcast for the classic problem of sending the {\em same message to~all~neighbors}.} If the string of bits could be the same, that is, the much simpler problem known as local broadcast, that lower bound would collapse to $\Omega(\Delta \log n)$.
\dk{Both lower bounds also hold for randomized solutions, which implies no (substantial) gap between randomness and determinism in the case of general \congest simulation algorithms.}
%
\remove{??? On the other hand, for local broadcast, we show a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\min\left\{n,\Delta^2/\log^2 n\right\}\right)$ for deterministic \mam{non-adaptive content-oblivious} beeping algorithms, which to the best of our knowledge is the first (nearly) quadratic \mam{local broadcast (same message for all neighbors)} lower bound in the Beeping model.
%
The complexity of randomized local broadcast is much better - $O(\Delta \log n)$~\cite{davies2023optimal}, establishing a gap for algorithms that use only local broadcasts. (Note that local broadcasts are a common primitive in various models). ???}



\input{table}



\mam{
An interesting generalization is to extend the notion of neighborhood to $h\geq 1$ hops. For the case where each node has a possibly different $B$-bit message to deliver to all nodes in its $h$-hop neighborhood, a problem that we call \emph{$B$-bit $h$-hop simulation}, we show bounds $O(h\cdot B\Delta^{h+2} \polylog n)$ and $\Omega(B\Delta^{h+1})$, 
%even using randomization. 
where the lower bound holds also for randomized solutions. Our algorithm, on the other hand, efficiently ``pipelines'' point-to-point messages, and achieves substantially better complexity (for $h>3$) than a straightforward application of 1-hop simulator $h$ times (which would need $O(\Delta^{2h}\polylog n)$ time).
For the simpler problem when each node has to deliver the same message to all nodes in its $h$-hop neighborhood, which we call \emph{$B$-bit $h$-hop Local Broadcast}, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(B\Delta^h)$ even with randomization.

%To use them as building blocks of our simulator,
%we also study several fundamental problems in Beeping Networks, which are of independent interest. Namely, Local Broadcast, Neighborhood learning,

%As an example of the myriad of graph problems where our simulation can be applied, we show how to apply our simulation to the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. Formal definitions of all the problems studied are included in Section~\ref{sec:model}.}

\sk{COMMENT TO BE REMOVED: We talked today about shortening 1.1 and moving some text from it to other places. I wrote a much shorter 1.1, moved the formal theorem STATEMENT out of 1.1 to 1.2, and shortened it by putting a lot of text here in a "remove" macro. I think some of the text should go to other places, and some are said twice here and elsewhere.


Please feel free to edit if we can afford it or if necessary. 


Another issue: stating the theorems and corollaries both here and elsewhere seems an unjustifiable overuse of space real estate. I would either remove here altogether (delete section 1.2) or, e.g. in section 4, write "proof of theorem 6", but NOT repeat theorem 6.}

\SK{THE FOLLOWING MAY BELONG UNDER A SEPARATE HEADING OF "CHALLENGES", NOT UNDER CONTRIBUTIONS, NOR THEOREM.}
The main challenge is that even if the nodes already learned their neighbors' unique identities (IDs) in the network (using our previously described auxiliary techniques), they still do not know when they have a unique 1 in their code for each neighbor. Intuitively, learning this would require learning 2-hop neighborhoods, but this is inefficient even using our auxiliary methods (which were efficient for learning 1-hop neighborhoods in parallel) and would have resulted in asymptotically $\Delta^4 \polylog n$ beeping rounds.  
Instead, we use general avoiding-selector codes that allow us to ``announce'' some fraction of ``non-realized'' neighbor connections (not yet used) and then realize them using faster codes, i.e., ``avoiding-selectors'' for specific parameters of roughly linear length. Interestingly, such a combination reduces the number of non-realized connections to neighbors by half and requires only $O(\Delta^2 \polylog n)$ beeping rounds. We repeat the above $\log\Delta$ times to get the final result.

We also prove a lower bound for Local Broadcast in the Beeping model in Section~\ref{sec:lower-bound}. To do that, we focus on the Radio Network model with collision detection, which is stronger than the Beeping Network model in the sense that in the beeping model, a listening node is not able to distinguish between a single beep and multiple beeps, whereas in the former, nodes can detect collisions and recognize a uniquely transmitting neighbor (see more details in Section~\ref{sec:model}). Thus, our lower bound for Radio Networks with collision detection also applies to the Beeping model. Our lower bound applies to deterministic adaptive Local Broadcast protocols for Radio Networks with collision detection that are \emph{content-oblivious}, that is, protocols where the content of the messages received is not used to decide future transmissions. \mm{Given that in Beeping Networks the information conveyed by beeps is the same as channel feedback (silence or noise), the lower bound proved applies to general protocols for Beeping Networks.}

\remove{
Our proof of the lower bound relies on the novel techniques of choosing an arbitrary matching and designing a network that postpones the realization of some edges of the matching by a given local broadcast algorithm as much as possible. Network construction starts with a particular random graph and simulates consecutive rounds of the local broadcast algorithm. During the simulation, additional edges can be added to the network to delay the realization of some links in the matching. Still, at the same time, they do not change the beeping feedback (or, more generally, radio network feedback) received by nodes at all previously considered simulation rounds.

In a general \congest round, each node can send different messages to different neighbors. A centralized coordination mechanism does not exist that could tell a node what its neighbors or their neighbors intend to send. 
 
\sk{UNCLEAR: Our beeping schedules combine specific codes, called avoiding selectors, with adaptive mechanisms to encode and decode logarithmic pieces of information at positions where neighboring codes have exclusive 1. } 
\sk{NEIGHBORING CODES? EXCLUSIVE 1?}


\sk{NOT CLEAR TO ME: The main challenge is that even if the nodes already learned the unique identities (ids) of their neighbors in the network (using our previously described auxiliary techniques), they still do not know when they have a unique 1 in their code for each neighbor.} \sk{It is not clear what is a unique 1 and why is it useful. I guess that the idea is (1) that there are rounds as many as the bits in my ID and that when I have 1 in the id bit corresponding to the number of the current slot, I transmit.  this is the meaning of 1 . I think that this meaning is not at all clear to the reader at this point, and (2) a unique 1 means that I am the unique neighbor with 1 at that position of the id. This too , I think is not known to the reader at this point.}


Suppose the nodes use their different identities (IDs) to transmit at different times, distinguishing the messages. For example, suppose that in the $i$th time slot, a node $v$ transmits if it has 1 in the $i$th position of its id. For a neighbor $u$ to notice that a single node ($v$) is transmitted at that time slot, at least the following two conditions must hold. First, $u$ must not be transmitted, that is, have no 1 in that id position. Second, $v$ has to be the only neighbor of $u$ transmitting, that is, the unique neighbor of $u$ who has 1 in that id position. 

Addressing the first condition is relatively easier since we can use our building block (also presented in this paper) of a node to learn its neighbors efficiently. Unfortunately, addressing the second condition seems to require learning 2-hop neighborhoods. This would be inefficient, resulting in asymptotically $\Delta^4 \polylog n$ beeping rounds.  

Instead, we use general avoiding-selector codes that allow us to ``announce'' some fraction of non-realized neighbor connections and then realize them using faster codes, i.e., avoiding-selectors for specific parameters of roughly linear length. Interestingly, such a combination reduces the number of non-realized connections to neighbors by half and requires only $O(\Delta^2 \polylog n)$ beeping rounds. We repeat the above $\log\Delta$ times to get the final result.
