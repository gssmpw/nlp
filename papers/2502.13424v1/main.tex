\section{Simulation of a \congest Round in Beeping Networks}
\label{sec:main-simulation}

%We already showed how to efficiently simulate a single round of a \congest model in a general beeping network, provided each node wants to send the same message to all of its neighbors. It already allows us to simulate many algorithms designed for the \congest model on a beeping network, in a deterministic and distributed way. 
Unfortunately, not all efficient graph algorithms in the \congest networks have the property of always broadcasting the same (short) message to every neighbor, which we exploit in Section~\ref{sec:local-broadcast}.\footnote{%
Note that in the LOCAL model, where the sizes of messages are of second importance (as long as they are polynomial), nodes can combine individual messages into one joint message and send it to all neighbors.}
%
In this section, we present a deterministic distributed algorithm that simulates a round of {\em any algorithm in the \congest model}, even if the algorithm sends different messages to neighbors.
It is only somewhat (polylogarithmically) slower than the more restricted one
(local broadcast, which required a node to send the same message to all its neighbors),
given in Theorem~\ref{th:local_broadcast} and Section~\ref{sec:local-broadcast}, but it is adaptive and uses heavier machinery.
%-- we show later that any non-adaptive solutions (beeping codes) are substantially less efficient and require $\Omega(\Delta^3)$ rounds. \mm{[[MM: do we prove this??]]}
 % we had to construct an adaptive algorithm using a technique for more complex codes
%  (puting a hifor the general simulator.
  %
 The novel construction is built hierarchically using the known family of code called ``avoiding selectors''. This, intuitively, already says ``when to beep.'' However, it is still possible that, for example, when two neighbors of   some node $v$ 
 %each 
 send a (different) message, of multiple bits per message, node $v$ will receive a ``message'' that is a logical OR of the two.
This is efficiently resolved by the new adaptive algorithm by employing a 3-stage handshake procedure, which sends pieces of the code that now serve in identifying what the IDs and messages are; it allows to spot overlapping transmissions from more than one neighbor and successfully decode those that do not overlap. Intuitively, each stage is ``triggered'' by a different level of the code.


%taken for different parameters. 
% 3-stage adaptive  
%handshake
%procedure (announcing, responding and confirming). on the top of the code. 
%which is an adaptive part. 
%This procedure is tightly correlated with the hierarchical structure of the code -- higher level code triggers announcing, while the lower level codes trigger responding and confirming.}

\vspace*{-2ex}
\paragraph{Preliminaries and Challenges.}
Suppose every node has a possibly different message to deliver to each of its neighbors. We could use the algorithm from Section~\ref{sub:neighbourhood} to learn neighbors' IDs first in $O(\Delta^2\log^2 n)$ beeping rounds.
W.l.o.g., assume that each message from a node $v$ to a node $w$ has $O(\log n)$ bits
%; otherwise, we could easily split it into chunks of size $O(\log n)$ and apply our new algorithm to each of them, sequentially 
(otherwise, 
%asymptotic formula on 
the bound on the time complexity is increased by a factor of $\cM/\log n$, where $\cM$ is the maximum size of a single message).
Simulation of a \congest round faces the following challenges.

\noindent
{\em Challenge 1.}
A node could try to compute its beeping schedule to avoid overlapping with other neighbors of the receiving node. However, it requires knowing at least $2$-hop neighborhood, which is costly. 
%(even $1$-hop requires $\Omega(\Delta^2\log n)$ rounds).
%The first main challenge to overcome is that a node $v$ does not know its $2$-hop neighborhood graph. Learning it could have potentially helped $v$ to use the specific differences between the identities to decide on a schedule when a successful transmission to/from each specific neighbor could take place (especially if transmission schedules are fixed, and nodes only decide what message to beep); however, it would require retrieving up to $\Theta(\Delta^2)$ node IDs. 
A node could try to learn first the IDs of its $1$-hop neighbors, and then broadcast them, one after another, using the local broadcast algorithm, 
%from Section~\ref{sec:local-broadcast}, 
but since there could be $\Theta(\Delta)$ such IDs (each represented by $O(\log n)$ bits), the overall time complexity would be $O(\Delta^3 \log^3 n)$, by Theorem~\ref{th:local_broadcast}.
Instead, our algorithm uses specific codes, called avoiding selectors (see Definition~\ref{def:avoid-selector}), to assure partial progress in information exchange in periods that sum up to $\Theta(\Delta^2 \polylog n \log \Delta)$.

\noindent
{\em Challenge 2.}
%Even knowing its $1$-hop neighbors, 
A node has to choose which of its input messages to beep at a time or find a more complex beeping code to encode many of its input messages. 
If it chooses ``wrongly,'' the message could be ``jammed'' by other beeping neighbors of the potential receiver.
To overcome this, avoiding selectors ensures that many nodes ``announce'' themselves successfully (i.e., without interference) to many of their neighbors, and these ``responders'' use avoiding selectors to respond. Once an announcer hears the ID of its responder, the handshaking procedure allows them to fix rounds for their point-to-point, non-interrupted communication.
%Such a chosen message could be arbitrarily ``jammed'' by some $2$-hop neighbors, which are not initially known to the node (see Challenge 1 above). 
%We prove later in Section~\ref{} \textcolor{red}{---------PENDING} that this is indeed a challenge, and any {\em non-adaptive beeping code} requires $\Omega(\Delta^3 \log\Delta n)$ \mm{[[MM: this might be confusing, is it n times log ?? ]]} rounds.
%To overcome it, the avoiding selectors (mentioned above) could be used in an adaptive way with properly chosen parameters to guarantee initiations of beeping communication in many links that are ``isolated'' in the network. We exploit them by designing a system of hand-shaking procedures, organized in three types of longer messages to beep: announcing (a node, called an announcer, beeps that it wants to communicate), responding (a node retrieving a message from an announcer, beeps a message destined to the announcer) and confirming (the announcer beeps a confirmation message destined to the responder). If indeed such links are isolated enough in the graph, we prove that this process guarantees successful message exchange between the announcer and the responder.


%the ad hoc topology and, consequently, 

The abovementioned avoiding selectors for $n$ nodes are parameterized by two numbers, $k,\ell$, corresponding to the number of competing neighbors/responders versus the other (potentially interrupting) neighbors:
%their definition~follows:

\begin{definition}[Avoiding selectors]
\label{def:avoid-selector}
    A family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]$ 
    %of size at most $k$ each 
    is called an \emph{$(n,k,\ell)$-avoiding selector}, where $1\le \ell < k\le n$, if for every non-empty subset $S \in [n]$ such that $|S| \leq k$ and for any subset $R\subseteq S$ of size at most $\ell$, there is an element $a \in S\setminus R$ for which there exists a set $F \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $|F \cap S| = \{a\}$.
\end{definition}


The following fact follows directly from Definition~\ref{def:avoid-selector}, see also \cite{BonisGV05,ChlebusK05}.

\begin{fact}
\label{fact:avoiding-selectors}
Suppose we are given an $(n,k,\ell)$-avoiding selector $\mathcal{F}$ and a set $S$ of size at most $k$.
Then, the number of elements in $S$ not ``selected'' by selector $\mF$ (i.e., for which there is no set in the selector that intersects $S$ on such singleton element) is smaller than $k-\ell$.
\end{fact}


\begin{theorem}[\cite{BonisGV05,ChlebusK05}]
\label{thm:avoiding-selectors}
There exists an $(n,k,\ell)$-avoiding selector of length $O\left(\frac{k^2}{k-\ell}\log n\right)$, and moreover, an $(n,k,\ell)$-avoiding selector of length $O\left(\frac{k^2}{k-\ell}\text{\em\ polylog } n\right)$ can be efficiently deterministically constructed (in polynomial time of $n$) for some polylogarithmic function $\text{\em\ polylog } n$, locally by each~node.
\end{theorem}




%\subsection{Main deterministic distributed algorithm simulating any \congest~round}
\subsection{The \alg Algorithm}
\label{sec:main-general-algorithm}

%The main 
Our simulator algorithm proceeds in epochs $i=1,\ldots\log\Delta $. 
A pseudo-code for an epoch $i$ is provided at the end of this subsection.
In the beginning, each node has all its links not successfully realized -- here by a link $\{v,w\}$ being realized we understand that up to the current round, an input message/ID sent by $v$ (using a sequence of beeps) has been successfully encoded by $w$ and vice versa (note that these are two different messages and were sent/encoded each in a different round); the formal definition of link realization will be given later.
The goal of the algorithm is to preserve the following invariant for epoch $i\ge 1$: 
\begin{quote}
\hspace*{-1em}
At the end of epoch 
$i=1,\ldots,\log \Delta$, 
%At the beginning of epoch 
%$i=1,\ldots,\log_{3/2} \Delta$, 
each vertex has less than 
$\kappa_i= \Delta / 2^{i}$ 
%$\kappa_i= \Delta \cdot (2/3)^{i-1}$ 
incident links not realized. 
\end{quote}
We also set an auxiliary value $\kappa_0=\Delta$, which corresponds to the maximum number of adjacent links per node at the beginning of the computation. For ease of presentation, we assume that node IDs come from the range $[1,n]$. Note that in all the formulas, the number of possible IDs appears only under logarithms, so the algorithm and proof for range $[1,n^c]$ are the same.
%By definition, $\kappa_1\le \Delta$.


\vspace*{-1.5ex}
%\paragraph{Main algorithm for epoch $i$.}
\paragraph{Algorithm for epoch $i$: Preliminaries and main concepts.} 

Epoch $i$ proceeds in subsequent batches of $2\log n$ rounds, each batch is called a \defn{super-round}. In a single super-round, a node can constantly listen or keep beeping according to some 0-1 sequence of length $2\log n$, where 1 corresponds to beeping in the related round and 0 means staying silent. 
The sequences that the nodes use during the algorithm are \defn{extended-IDs}, defined as follows: the first $\log n$ positions contain an ID of some node in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, while the next $\log n$ positions contain the same ID 
%but 
\mamr{with the bits flipped, that is,}
with ones swapped to zeros and vice versa. 
Note that extended-IDs are pairwise different, and each of them contains exactly $\log n$ ones and $\log n$ zeros.
We say that a node $v$ {\em beeps an extended-ID of node $w$ in a super-round} 
%if $v$ keeps beeping exactly in rounds corresponding to the extended-ID of $w$ within this super-round 
\mamr{$s$ if, within super-round~$s$, node $v$ beeps only in rounds corresponding to positions with $1$'s in the extended ID of $w$ } 
($w$ could be a different node id than $v$).
We say that a node $w$ {\em receives an extended-ID of a node $v$ in a super-round} \mamr{$s$} if:
\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$w$ does not beep in super-round \mamr{$s$},
\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\item 
the sequence of 
%beeps received 
\mamr{noise/silence heard by $w$}
in super-round \mamr{$s$} form an extended-ID of $v$.
\end{itemize}


\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\noindent
From the perspective of receiving information in a super-round, all other cases not falling under the above definition of receiving an extended-ID, i.e., when a node is not silent in the super-round or receives a sequence of beeps that does not form any extended-ID, are ignored by the algorithm, in the sense that it could be treated as meaningless information noise. 

%Analogously to extended-ID, each node $w$ creates an {\em extended-message addressed to a neighbor $v$}. Node $w$ does it 
\mamr{Analogously to extended-ID's, nodes create an \defn{extended-message}} by taking the binary representation of the message of logarithmic length and transforming it to a $2\log n$ binary sequence in the same way as an extended-ID is created from the binary ID of a node.
An extended-message, as well as an extended-ID, is easily decodable after being received without interruptions from other neighbors.

%A crucial definition specifies what does it mean to one-to-one communications, as given for free in the \congest model, in beeping networks. 
\mamr{A specification of the conditions to achieve one-to-one communication, which is given ``for free'' in the \congest model, is crucial. An illustration of the following handshake communication procedure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:alg}.}
We say that our algorithm \defn{realizes link $\{v,w\}$} if the following 
%conditions
are~satisfied:
\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] 
there are three consecutive super-rounds (called ``responding'') in which $v$ beeps an extended-ID of itself followed by an extended-ID of $w$ and then by extended-message of $v$ addressed to $w$, and $w$ receives them in these super-rounds; intuitively, it corresponds to the situation when $v$ ``tells'' $w$ that it dedicates these three super-rounds for communication from itself to $w$, and $w$ receives this information;
\vspace*{-3.5ex}
\item[(b)] 
there are three consecutive super-rounds (called ``confirming'') in which $w$ beeps an extended-ID of itself followed by an extended-ID of $v$ and by its extended-message addressed to $v$, and $v$ receives them in these super-rounds; intuitively, it corresponds to the situation when $w$ ``tells'' $v$ that it dedicates these three super-rounds for communication from itself to $v$, and $v$ receives this information;
\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\item[(c)]
there is a super-round, not earlier than the one specified in point (a), at the end of which node $w$ locally marks link $\{v,w\}$ as realized, 
and analogously, 
there is a super-round, not earlier than the one specified in point (b), at the end of which node $v$ locally marks link $\{v,w\}$ as realized.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{-0.8ex}
\noindent
It is straightforward to see that in super-rounds specified in points (a) and (b), a multi-directional communication between $v$ and $w$ takes place -- by sending and receiving both ``directed pairs'' of extended-IDs of these two nodes, each of them commits that the super-rounds specified in points (a) and (b) are dedicated for sending a message dedicated to the other node, and vice versa. Additionally, in some super-round(s) both nodes commit that it has happened (c.f., point (c) above).

\vspace*{-2ex}
\paragraph{Algorithm for epoch $i$: Structure.} 

\input{algorithm}

An epoch $i$ is split into $|\mF_{\Delta,k_i}|$ {\em phases}, for a given $(n,\Delta,\Delta - k_i)$-avoiding selector $\mF_{\Delta,k_i}$ and parameter $k_i=\Delta/2^i$, parameterized by a variable $j$. Each phase starts with one {\em announcing super-round}, in which nodes in set $\mF_{\Delta,k_i}(j)$ beep in pursuit to be received by some of their neighbors. This super-round is followed by $\log k_i$ {\em sub-phases}, parameterized by $a=1,\ldots, \log k_i$. A sub-phase $a$ uses sets from an $(n,k_i/2^{a-2},k_i/2^{a-1})$-avoiding selector $\mF_{k_i/2^{a-2},k_i/2^{a-1}}$ to determine who beeps in which super-round (together with additional rules to decide what extended-ID and extended-message to beep and how to confirm receiving them), and consists of 
%$\sum_{a=1}^{\log k_i} 
$|\mF_{k_i/2^{a-2},k_i/2^{a-1}}|$ %quadruples 
$6$-tuples
of super-rounds ($3$ responding super-rounds and $3$ confirming super-rounds). 
The goal of a phase is to realize links that were successfully received (``announced'') in the first (announcing) super-round of this phase. This is particularly challenging in a distributed setting since many neighbors could receive such an announcement, but the links between them and the announcing node must be confirmed so that one-to-one communication between the announcer and responders could take place in different super-rounds (in one super-round, a node can receive only logarithmic-size information).

\vspace*{-2ex}
\subsection{Analysis of the \alg Algorithm}

Recall that the algorithm proceeds in synchronized super-rounds, each containing a subsequent $2\log n$ rounds. Therefore, our analysis assumes that the computation is partitioned into consecutive super-rounds and, unless stated otherwise, it focuses on correctness and progress in super-rounds. 
Recall also that each node either stays silent (no beeping at all) or beeps an extended ID of some node or an extended message of one node addressed to one of its neighbors in a super-round.
%
The missing proofs 
%from this section 
are deferred to Section~\ref{sec:proofs-main-simulation}.

In the next two technical results, we state and prove the facts that receiving an extended-ID by a node $w$ in a super-round can happen if and only if there is {\em exactly one neighbor} of $w$ has been beeping {\em the same extended-ID} during the considered super-round. 

\begin{fact}[Single beeping]
\label{fact:single-beeping}
If during a super-round, exactly one neighbor of a node $w$ beeps an extended-ID of some $z$, then $w$ receives this extended-ID in this super-round.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
Directly from the definition of receiving an extended-ID. 
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Correct receiving]
\label{lem:correct-receiving}
During the algorithm, if a node $w$ 
%stays silent and 
receives some extended-ID of $z$ in a super-round, then some unique neighbor $v$ of $w$ has been beeping an extended-ID of $z$ in this super-round while all other neighbors of $w$ have been silent. 
%in this super-round. 
The above holds except, possibly, some second responding super-rounds, in which a node can receive an extended-ID of $z$ that has been beeped by more than one neighbor.
\end{lemma}

%\begin{minipage}{1\linewidth}
%\input{algannouncer}
\input{alglistener}
%\end{minipage}


We now prove that link realization implemented by our algorithm is consistent with the definition -- it allocates in a distributed way super-rounds for bi-directional communication of distinct messages.

\begin{lemma}[Correct realization]
\label{lem:correct-realization}
If a node $v$ (locally) marks some link $\{v,w\}$ as realized, which may happen only at the end of a second confirming super-round, the link has been realized by then. 
\end{lemma}



As mentioned earlier in the description of the phase, the goal of a phase $j$ (of epoch $i$) is to assure that any node $v$ that was received by some other nodes $w$ in the announcing super-round, gets all such links $\{v,w\}$ realized by the end of the phase (and vice versa, because the condition on the realization by this algorithm is symmetric).
The next step is conditional progress in a sub-phase $a$ of a phase $j$.

\begin{lemma}[Sub-phase progress]
\label{lem:subphase-progress}
Consider any node $v$ and suppose that in the beginning of sub-phase $a$ of phase $j$, there are at most $\Delta/2^{i+a-2}$ nodes $w$ such that $w$ is $(j,v)$-responsive and it does not mark link $\{v,w\}$ as realized. Then, by the end of the sub-phase, the number of such nodes is reduced to less~than~$\Delta/2^{i+a-1}$.
\end{lemma}



\begin{lemma}[Phase progress]
\label{lem:phase-progress}
Consider a phase $j$ of epoch $i$ and assume that in the beginning, there are at most $2k_i$ non-realized incident links to any node. Every node $w$ that becomes $(j,v)$-responsive in the first (announcing) super-round of the phase, for some $v$, mark locally the link $\{v,w\}$ as realized during this phase. And vice versa, also node $v$ marks locally that link as realized. 
\end{lemma}

The next lemma proves the invariant for epoch $i$, assuming that it holds in the previous epochs. 

\begin{lemma}[Epoch invariant]
\label{lem:epoch-invariant}
The invariant for epoch $i\ge 1$ holds. 
\end{lemma}

simulates any round of any algorithm designed for the \congest networks in $O(\Delta^2 \polylog n \log\Delta)$ beeping rounds, where the $\polylog n$ is the square of the (poly-)logarithm in the construction of avoiding-selectors in Theorem~\ref{thm:avoiding-selectors} multiplied by $\log n$.

%\sk{REPEATING THE THEOREM IN 2 PLACES  SEEMS UNJUSTIFIABLY COSTLY IN TERMS OF SPACE REAL ESTATE. I WOULD START DIRECTLY WITH "PROOF OF THEOREM 6". OR REMOVE IN THE INTRO. tHE SAME GOES WITH THE COROLLARIES GIVEN IN THE INTRO. ALREADY HALF A PAGE SAVING.  }

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:epoch-invariant}, each epoch $i$ reduces by at least half the number of non-realized incident links. 
We next count the number of rounds in each epoch by counting the number of super-rounds and multiplying the result by the $O(\log n)$ length of each super-round.
Recall that link realization means that some triples of responding and confirming super rounds were not interrupted by other neighbors of both end nodes of that link; therefore, the attached extended messages (in the third super-rounds in a row) were correctly received. Thus, the local exchange of messages addressed to specific neighbors took place successfully.

Each sub-phase $a$ has $O(\Delta^2 \polylog n)$ super-rounds, because for each set in of the $(n,k_i/2^{a-1},k_i/2^a)$-avoiding selector $\mF_{k_i/2^{a-1},k_i/2^a}$, there are four super-rounds and the selector itself has $O((k_i/2^a) \polylog n)$ set, by Theorem~\ref{thm:avoiding-selectors}.

Therefore, the total number of super-rounds in all sub-phases executed 
within 
%point~\ref{alg:sub-phase} of the algorithm~
\mamr{the loops in Line~\ref{line:subphaseloopA} of Algorithm~\ref{algC2Bv2A} and Line~\ref{line:subphaseloopL} of Algorithm~\ref{algC2Bv2L}}
is 
\vspace*{-1.3ex}
\[
O(\sum_{a=1}^{\log k_i} (k_i/2^a) \polylog n) \le
O( k_i \polylog n)
\ .
\]

\vspace*{-0.7ex}
\noindent
Within one phase, they are executed as many times as the number of announcing super-rounds. 
The number of announcing super-rounds in a phase is
$|\mF_{\Delta,k_i}|$, which is $O((\Delta^2/k_i)\cdot \polylog n)$ by Theorem~\ref{thm:avoiding-selectors}.
Hence, the total number of super-rounds in a phase is 
%\[
$O( (\Delta^2/k_i)\cdot \polylog n \cdot k_i \polylog n)
\le 
O(\Delta^2 \polylog n)$,
%\ ,
%\]
where the final $\polylog n$ is a square of the (poly-)logarithms from Theorem~\ref{thm:avoiding-selectors}.

Since there are $\log\Delta$ epochs, the total number of super-rounds is $O(\Delta^2 \polylog n \log\Delta)$, which is additionally multiplied by $O(\log n)$ -- the length of each super-round -- if we want to refer the total number of beeping rounds.

\subsection{Cubic Lower Bound for Non-adaptive Beeping Codes}
\label{sec:lower-non-adaptive}

Consider the following simplification of the simulation problem. Each node $v$ is given, as an input, parameters $n,\Delta$ and a vector of numbers in $[n]$ of length $x_v\le \Delta$. The goal is: for any graph $G$ such that $x_v=|N(v)|$, for any node $v$, every $i$th neighbor of $v$ (according to the order of IDs) learns the $i$th number in the vector of $v$, for any $1\le i \le x_v$.
We call this problem {\em local ports' learning}, as we could think about the numbers in the input vectors as (arbitrary) labels of ports from the node to its corresponding neighbor.


\begin{theorem}
Any beeping code solving the local ports' learning problem has length $\Omega(\Delta^3\log n)$.
\end{theorem}
