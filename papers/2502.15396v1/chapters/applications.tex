\section{Bounded Expansion}
In \cite{torunczyk2023flip}, Toruńczyk investigated the bounded speed visible active copwidth to give a new perspective on the fundamental notions of sparsity theory. A class of graphs $C$ is known to have bounded expansion iff for every $s\in \N$ the generalized $s$\=/colouring numbers are bounded. So from the bounds of these variants in the colouring numbers they concluded that the visible active copwidth variant for bounded speed can be used to characterize bounded expansion. \\
Furthermore, they adapted the results of \cite{doi:10.1137/090780006} and added the upper bound by the strong $s$\=/colouring number to infer the same for the visible lazy variant. We now take this a step further by using our results for the robber\-/monotone variants to extend Corollary A.3 from \cite{torunczyk2023flip}:

        The following conditions are equivalent for a graph class $C$:
       \begin{itemize}
        \item $C$ has bounded expansion,
        \item $\vacopwidth{s}<\infty$, for every $s\in \N$,% (old),
        \item $\vlcopwidth{s}<\infty$, for every $s\in \N$,% (old),
        \item $\rmvlcopwidth{s}<\infty$, for every $s\in \N$,% (new),
        \item $\ilcopwidth{s}<\infty$, for every $s\in \N$,% (new),
        \item $\rmilcopwidth{s}<\infty$, for every $s\in \N$.% (new).
    \end{itemize}
\end{restatable}
Planar graphs, every class of bounded maximum degree, classes of bounded tree\-/width and classes that exclude a fixed (topological) minor have bounded expansion, and thereby the above copwidth variants are all bounded on these classes.
