\section{Cop-Monotonicity and the Visible Variants}
From \cite{seymour1993graph}, it is known that $\vacopwidth{\infty}$ has the cop\-/monotonicity property, but we see that this is not the case for $\vacopwidth{s}$ for finite $s \in \N$. The idea is that while searching non\-/monotonously, we can temporarily remove cops if we can guarantee that, because of his speed bound, the vertex is currently not within reach of the robber. Our constructions follow the simple blueprint of a complete $n$\=/ary tree where every node is connected by long paths to each ancestor. Playing classically the cops just need to consider the tree strucure, because they can catch the robber if he moves on a such a path. Monotonously however they need to keep the ancestors in mind, as they would need to move back on them to catch the robber on these paths. An example of such a tree can be found in \cref{fig:ExampleTree}.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{TheoremVisActCopmonotonicity}
For every $s\in\N$ there is a family of graphs $G_n$ with $$\vacopwidth{s}(G_n)=3 \ \ \text{and} \ \ \cmvacopwidth{s}(G_n)=n.$$
\end{restatable}
We can apply the construction with slight modifications to the length of paths to prove the same result for the visible lazy version.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{TheoremVisLazyCopmonotonicity}
 For every $s\in \N$ there is a family of graphs $G_n$ with $$\vlcopwidth{s}(G_n)=3 \ \ \text{and} \ \ \cmvlcopwidth{s}(G_n)=n.$$
