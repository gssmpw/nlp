\section{Conclusion}
While the study of unbounded speed visible active, invisible active and invisible lazy variants of the Cops\-/and\-/Robber game is characterized by monotonicity results like \cite{lapaugh1993recontamination}, the bounded speed variants give a different picture. We have studied three areas of non\-/monotonicity for bounded speed Cops\-/and\-/Robber games. In the first, we saw that cop- and robber\-/monotonicity are hard restrictions for the invisible active variant, and cop\-/monotonicity is a hard restriction for the invisible lazy variant. By that we obtained new characterizations for path\-/width. In the second, we have shown that the visible active and visible lazy variants do not have the cop\-/monotonicity property and that the monotonicity cost is unbounded.
In the third, we discovered the functional equivalence between the lazy variants and their respective robber\-/monotone versions while disproving the exact equivalence.

All of this raises the question which graph structures are captured by these formerly unknown game variants. For example one could study a variation of tree\-/width were the underlying structure is only locally acyclic. These could then further be studied for their algorithmic applications and usefulness as approximations for tree\-/width or the generalized colouring numbers. This mimics the possible use cases for visible lazy games outlined in \cite{doi:10.1137/090780006}. As the visible lazy unbounded speed variant is already known \cite{doi:10.1137/090780006} to be in $\mathbf{P}$ it is interesting which algorithmic speedup our monotonicity result (already conjectured in \cite{doi:10.1137/090780006}) offers.
The picture of the robber\-/monotonicity\-/cost still needs to be completed. For the visible lazy variant, the polynomial bound in $k$ is most probably not strict, and it would be interesting whether there may be an additive bound in terms of $s$, so whether for some function $f$, $\rmvlcopwidth{s}(G) \leq \vlcopwidth{s}(G) + f(s)$ for every graph $G$. Furthermore, the robber\-/monotonicity of both lazy copwidth variants for $s=2,3$ and the bounded speed visible active copwidth variants are open questions.
