\paragraph{Personalized Federated Learning and MOE}
% In the realm of personalized federated learning, methods combining Mixture of Experts____ (MoE), such as PFL-MoE____ and FedMoE____, deploy a local feature extractor model (local expert) and a globally shared feature extractor (global expert) on each client, adjusting the gating network to control the output weights of the local and global experts. PFL-MoE focuses on homogeneous models, adjusting the weights of the two experts through the gating network. In contrast, FedMoE emphasizes model heterogeneity, employing experts with a larger parameter count than the global model to capture local data characteristics. Both approaches utilize simultaneous training of parameters, employing continuous gradient descent to optimize the gating of local and global models.

% In personalized federated learning, methods integrating Mixture of Experts____ (MoE) models, such as PFL-MoE____ and FedMoE____, deploy both local feature extractors (local experts) and globally shared feature extractors (global experts) on each client, with a gating network controlling the output weights of these experts. PFL-MoE primarily addresses homogeneous models, modulating the experts' weights via the gating network. In contrast, FedMoE emphasizes model heterogeneity by incorporating experts with more parameters than the global model to better capture local data characteristics.

\paragraph{Energy-based denoising methods}
% Energy-based models____(EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating scalar energy values with each configuration of the input. EBMs have been applied in various fields, such as generative modeling____, out-of-distribution detection____, open-set classification____, and Incremental Learning____. EBMs can measure relationships between personalized federated learning parameters by using energy as a metric. When selecting personalized experts in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, this approach can filter out experts that offer no gain, effectively denoising the model. However, the application of EBMs in this context, particularly for expert denoising within MoE, remains underexplored.
