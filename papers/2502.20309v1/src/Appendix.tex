Below is a multiple-choice question, 1 correct answer, 4 incorrect distractors, the domain or field of study, and required skills to answer the question. Be very discriminating, only provide high scores where they are earned, it is crucial to be critical of errors or inadequacies to improve.
Here is the json dictionary formatted multiple choice question, skills and domains:
\begin{verbatim}
{
'Question': '{}',
'Answer': '{}',
'Distractors': {},
'Skills': {},
'Domains': {}
}
\end{verbatim}
Your job is to evaluate the complete question, answers, skills and domain on the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Appropriate: Assess whether the question's difficulty aligns with graduate-level knowledge and skills in the subject area. Consider complexity of concepts involved, depth of analysis required, sophistication of language used, application of advanced theories or methodologies. Simple recall from a paper is not sufficiently difficult. Rate the question's appropriateness on a scale of 1--5, where 1 is too basic and 5 is suitably challenging for graduate-level students.
\item Relevant: Evaluate how closely the answer choices relate to the question posed. Consider direct connection between question and answers, absence of extraneous or off-topic information, alignment with the core concept being tested. Score relevance on a scale of 1--5, where 1 indicates poor relevance and 5 indicates high relevance across all answer choices.

\item Complete: Assess whether the answer choices fully address all aspects of the question. Consider coverage of all key elements mentioned in the question, absence of partial or incomplete responses, sufficient detail in each answer choice. There should be one correct answer and four distractors. Rate completeness on a scale of 1--5, where 1 indicates incomplete responses and 5 indicates comprehensive coverage in all answer choices.

\item Correct: Verify that there is only one unambiguously correct answer among the choices. Consider clarity and precision of language in both question and answers, absence of partially correct answers, distinctness of the correct answer from distractors. Score this criterion as either Pass (5) (one clear correct answer) or Fail (0) (multiple correct answers or no correct answer).

\item Controversial: Determine if the correct answer is generally accepted in the field, avoiding contentious or debatable topics. Consider alignment with current academic consensus, avoidance of ongoing debates or unresolved issues, use of well-established facts or theories. Rate the non-controversial nature on a scale of 1-5, where 1 indicates highly controversial and 5 indicates widely accepted, uncontroversial content.

\item Mathematic: Check that the question and answers do not rely on arithmetic calculations. Consider absence of numerical computations, focus on conceptual understanding rather than mathematical operations, use of qualitative rather than quantitative reasoning. Score this criterion as either Pass (no arithmetic required) (5) or Fail (arithmetic is necessary to answer) (0).

\item Skills: Evaluate whether the skills required to answer the question are appropriate for the subject and level. Consider alignment with course learning objectives, relevance to real-world applications in the field, balance of lower-order (recall) and higher-order (analysis, synthesis) thinking skills. Rate the appropriateness of skills on a scale of 1--5, where 1 indicates misaligned skills and 5 indicates perfectly aligned skills for the subject and level.

\item Domains: Assess if the knowledge domains covered by the question are suitable for the subject area. Consider relevance to the course or exam topic, coverage of key subject areas within the field, appropriate breadth and depth of domain knowledge tested. Score the appropriateness of domains on a scale of 1--5, where 1 indicates poorly chosen domains and 5 indicates highly appropriate domains for the subject area.
\end{enumerate}
It is important to be extremely discriminating. Only the best possible questions should receive a maximum score. Correct feedback is vital and preferred over erroneous positivity.
Provide the scores in a json dictionary formatted object with the following fields:
\begin{verbatim}
{
'Appropriate': (score, 'reason'),
'Relevant': (score, 'reason'),
'Complete': (score, 'reason'),
'Correct': (score, 'reason'),
'Controversial': (score, 'reason'),
'Mathematic': (score, 'reason'),
'Skills': (score, 'reason'),
'Domains': (score, 'reason')
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Appendix G: LLM as a judge prompt for field style experiment evaluation}
\begin{figure*}[p]

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!10, colframe=blue!40!black, title=LLM Scientific Reasoning Evaluation Prompt]

\small
You are tasked with analyzing conversation transcripts between humans and a Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the LLM's scientific reasoning capabilities. Your objective is to identify the LLM's strengths and weaknesses in various aspects of scientific thinking, using the following framework as a guide. Provide specific examples from the transcript to support your assessment. If a criteria is not applicable to the problem or question being asked in the transcript, note that it is not applicable. Be critical, do not be overly positive if it is not evidenced.

\textbf{Scientific Reasoning Skills Framework}
\textbf{Core Scientific Principles}
\textit{Understanding of the Scientific Method}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Observation and Questioning:} Does the LLM demonstrate an understanding of how scientific inquiry begins with observation and the formulation of testable questions? Can it identify good vs.\ poorly formed scientific questions?...
\end{itemize}
\textit{Knowledge of Scientific Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Domain Knowledge:} Does the LLM possess accurate knowledge of basic scientific concepts in various fields (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics)? How well is it able to answer questions related to different fields of science?...
\end{itemize}
\textit{Critical Evaluation of Scientific Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Source Credibility:} Does the LLM demonstrate an ability to assess the credibility of scientific sources?...
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Specific Scientific Reasoning Skills}
\textit{Experimental Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Identifying Variables:} Can the LLM identify the independent, dependent, and control variables in a given experimental scenario?...
\end{itemize}
\textit{Data Analysis and Interpretation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Statistical Significance:} Does the LLM understand the concept of statistical significance?...
\end{itemize}
\textit{Causal Reasoning}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Identifying Cause and Effect:} Can the LLM correctly identify cause-and-effect relationships in scientific contexts?...
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Communication of Scientific Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clarity and Precision:} Does the LLM communicate scientific ideas clearly and precisely?...
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scoring Format}

The quantitative assessment should be provided in the following JSON format:

\begin{verbatim}
{
"Core Scientific Principles": {
"Understanding of the Scientific Method": {
"Observation and Questioning": score,
"Hypothesis Formation": score,
"Prediction": score,
"Experimentation": score,
"Data Collection and Analysis": score,
"Conclusion and Theory Formation": score
},
...
}
}
\end{verbatim}


\textbf{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the conversation transcript carefully.
    \item Identify instances where the LLM demonstrates strengths or weaknesses in any of the scientific reasoning skills listed above.
    \item For each identified instance, provide:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The specific skill being assessed (e.g., Hypothesis Formation, Data Analysis: Correlation vs.\ Causation)
        \item A brief description of the context in the conversation
        \item Direct quotes from the transcript that exemplify the LLM's performance (both the user's prompt and the LLM's response)
        \item An assessment of whether this represents a strength or weakness, and a brief explanation of your reasoning
    \end{itemize}
    \item Assign quantitative scores from 1-10 for the criteria as formatted above, if a criteria is not applicable to the transcript give a score of -1.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A score of -1 means the criteria cannot be assessed as it is not applicable to the transcript
        \item A score of 1 means the LLM completely failed at on the criteria
        \item A score of 10 means the LLM could not have possibly responded better, and completely meets the criteria
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
