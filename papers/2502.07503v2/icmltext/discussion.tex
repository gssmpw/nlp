This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of artificial intelligence, specifically in the area of language modeling and multimodal systems. There are many potential societal consequences of advancing AI, both positive, such as improved accessibility to high-quality healthcare and education, and negative, if such systems are misused. Our intention with RINS is to contribute to the ongoing effort to improve the performance and capabilities of these models. While we recognize the general ethical considerations that accompany the advancement of language models and AI, we do not feel that this particular work raises unique or unaddressed ethical concerns beyond the established considerations within the field.
