% \begin{abstract}
% A robust summarization system should be able to capture the gist of the document on unseen test datasets, regardless of the specific word choices or noises in the input.
% % Despite the advancement of summarization systems, their robustness on unseen datasets with the above perturbations has been less explored.
% In this work, we first explore the summarization models' robustness towards perturbations including word-level synonym substitution and noises.
% To create semantic-consistent substitutes, we propose a SummAttacker, which is an efficient approach to generating adversarial samples based on pre-trained language models.
% Experimental results show that state-of-the-art summarization models have a significant decrease in performance on adversarial and noisy test sets.
% Next, we explore how to improve the robustness of summarization systems by data augmentation.
% We combine the benefits of discrete and continuous augmentation methods and propose a multi-view data augmentation method.
% Concretely, we incorporate the discrete augmented cases created by SummAttacker on the encoder side.
% We also create virtual cases by mixing the hidden representations of two decoders, one takes ground truth decoder input, and one uses the predicted summary distribution as soft indicators.
% % from the encoder and decoder side, and propose a Multi-level Continuous data Augmentation (MCA) approach that can augment each training instance with representations that could cover adequate variants of literal expression under the same meaning.
% Experimental results on Gigaword and CNN/DM datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over strong baselines as well as exhibits higher robustness on noisy and attacked datasets\footnote{Our code will be released in the camera-ready version.}.

\appendix

% \section{Appendix}

% \section{Implementation Details}

% We implement our experiments in Huggingface on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and start finetuning based on pretrained models facebook/bart-large-cnn and a1noack/bart-large-gigaword.
% We build our models based on both BART and follow its hyperparameter settings.
% Concretely, there are 12 encoding layers in the encoder and the decoder.
% The activation functions are set to GeLUs and parameters are initialized from $\mathcal{N}(0,0.02)$.
% We use Adam optimizer with $\epsilon$ as 1e-8 and $\beta$ as (0.9, 0.98). 
% We used label smoothing of value 0.1, which is the same value as \citet{vaswani2017attention}.
% Following \citet{xie2021target}, the temperature in Equation 3 is set to 0.1 for CNN/DM and 1 for Gigaword, and the mixup ratio $\lambda$ in Equation 4 is set to 0.7.
% Then attacking candidate number $K$ is set to 10 based on the parameter study in Appendix.
% The learning rate is set to 3e-5.
% The warm-up is set to 500 steps for CNN/DM and 5000 for Gigaword. 
% The batch size is set to 128 with gradient accumulation steps of 2.
% We use the original dataset plus the augmented cases generated by SummAttacker as our training dataset, where we also randomly add 30\% natural human errors on the input document.
% The training process takes about 8 hours and 4 hours for CNN/DM and Gigaword.


% \section{Discussions of SummAttacker}
% \subsection{Ablation Study}

% Our SummAttacker is based on a language model and gradient comparison.
% Since the language model is the main structure of our attacking method, we conduct the ablation study on the gradient calculation part to see its effectiveness.
% From Table~\ref{ablation}, we can see that the gradient calculation is effective.
% Without the gradient component, the performance of BART increases by 1.49 ROUGE-2 score and 0.43 ROUGE-L score.
% This demonstrates that with gradient comparison we choose the word with greater influence on the model performance, attacking the generation model to a greater extent.

\section{Case Study on Chinese Dataset}

We show a representative cases in Figure~\ref{fig:case1} to Figure~\ref{fig:case_last}.
% Firstly, we can see that both the baseline model and our model can generate a relatively good summary based on the clean input article.
% However, the summary generated by the baseline model fails to generate consistent summaries on the attacked article, even though the key information is kept in the attacked input.
% On the contrary, the performance of our model remains good in both cases.

        \textbf{Attacked Article:}  A discovery of stone fossils shaped more than 3.3 million years ago could be the world 's longest tools created by early human ancestors, according to researchers. \hlc[bleudefrance!40]{Theologists have revealed that they have collected 20 square artifacts and anvils - used to help shape the tools - just south of Lac Karai in Kenya.} The stone could dramatically lead the recent estimate of stone intelligence as - if incorrect - the team of the stone weapons is 700,000 times easier than any others put previously. The stone eyes were recovered covered in sediment along the west flank of Unit Tangare above in Kenya. \hlc[bleudefrance!40]{It remains that ancient human ancestors were creating tools hundreds of thousands of years before the appearance of the first 'man ' - the start of our branch of the evolutionary tree known as Homo.} Many experts have long believed that it was the use of stone tools by early species of Homo like Homo habilis and Homo erectus that helped set them apart from other human-like species. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve. 15 million years ago - Hominidae great apes evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon. 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge. 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early proto-human shares traits with chimps and gorillas. 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's. 2.8 million years ago- LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family. 2.7 million years ago- Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing. 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa. 1.8 million years ago- Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record. 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation. 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly. 400,000 years ago- Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia. 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa. 40,0000 years ago- Modern humans reach Europe. Scientists behind the discovery now say ancient species known as Australopithecines - typified by the fossilised skeleton called Lucy - or Kenyanthropus created the tools. Professor Sonia Harmand, a palaeolithic Archaeolog at Stony Brook University in New York who led the team that discovered the tools, said they reached across them by accident. The post had been returning for the scene where a mysterious human relative compared Kenthropus placoops had been studied in 1998. But after finding a bad lead they came across another sand and spotted what looked like stone tools on the sandy surface. Professor Harmand, who was presenting her findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society, said : 'The artifacts were clearly knapped [ created by intentional flaking ] and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks. ' The stones were dug at a site known as Lomekwi 3, just forty of Station Turkana in Kenya. By diggingating down into the sandy soil, the team discovered a series of sharp stone flakes and cores - the rocks the stones are knocked off. They also found anvils that were apparently used to hold the cores as the flakes were struck off. In one case the team were able to fit a flake back to its original core. A further 130 stone tools were discovered on the surface. Each of the stones showed distinctive patterns that suggest they had been struck and shaped by human ancestors. As some tools were locked inside sediment left behind by the receding desert lake, the researchers were able to accurately estimate the time when they were dropped there. By tracking changes in the Earth 's magnetic field recorded in the sediment, the researchers were able to pinpoint the point to 3.3 million years ago. This skull of Kenyanthropus platyops was found close to the site of the stone tools in 1999 close to Lake Turkana in Kenya and may be the species responsible for creating the stone flakes that have been discovered. This stone tool - known as an Olduvai chopper - on display at the British Museum is around 1.8 million years old was thought to be one of the earliest examples of stone that had been used by ancient human ancestors. These early stone tools found in Ethiopia are thought to be around 1.7 million years and were used as choppers. This is close to the date of another piece of controversial evidence found in 2010 that suggested stone tools were used long before the appearance of the Homo species on Earth. Researchers working in Dikika in Ethiopia - where an Australopithecine child was discovered- reported they had found cut marks on animal bones dated to 3.4 million years ago. Their claim that these had been made by human ancestors using tools were hugely controversial. \\
        \hline
          \textbf{Ground truth summary:} Archaeologists have found 20 stones shaped by early humans using'simple techniques' close to the west shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya. The tools are thought to be 500,000 years older than the first Homo species. They are also 700,000 years older than other stone tools found previously. Scientists say it could reshape ideas about how our own species evolved.\\

        \textbf{Clean Article:}  \hlc[bleudefrance!40]{A young cancer sufferer who proposed to his girlfriend hoping surgery would save his life is set to marry in hospital after being told he 's too ill for the operation and has just weeks to live.} Jack Jordan, 23, proposed to his girlfriend Laura Cant last Christmas from his hospital bed while suffering from leukaemia. The pair planned to wed after a bone marrow transplant, which they hoped would have given them a bright future together. Jack Jordan and his girlfriend Laura Cant, who are to marry tomorrow in hospital after being told he had just weeks to live. However, last week Mr Jordan was given the news that he was too ill to undergo the transplant and has just weeks to live. The couple have now quickly moved the wedding forward and are now set to become the first to marry in a ceremony at Torbay Hospital 's chapel. Miss Cant, 24, of Brixham, Devon, said : No amount of drugs or treatment has worked for my Jack and he has now been given just a few weeks to live. 'We just want to be married. Jack didnt want to leave until he was any less than my husband. 'We have the nurses crying and everything. As devastating as this is to both our families, we are all planning on giving Jack the best day of his life. 'He is still my Jack. You would n't think anything was wrong except he is very tired. 'He sleeps all the time. In a very, very odd kind of way Jack was relieved when he was told the news last Friday because he does n't have to fight anymore. Mr Jordan had hoped to undergo a bone marrow transplant to prolong his life but was given the news last week that he was too ill for the surgery. Mr Jordan posted a picture on Facebook of his girlfriend wearing her engagement ring after proposing at Christmas. 'He is absolutely exhausted. I am spending every day and every night in hospital with him. ' I feel very numb. Jack is my strength. He is keeping me going. We are want makes us strong. ' The hospital chapel holds about 80 people and will be full of family and close friends. Leukaemia affects a person 's white blood cells. White blood cells are the important infection-fighting part of the immune system, made in your bone marrow. Patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which 'clog up ' their bone marrow. This stops bone marrow making other blood cells, which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood. Acute leukaemia comes on suddenly, progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently. Chronic leukaemia develops more slowly, over months or years. Common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. It is predicted that 48 \% of men and 44 \% of women will survive the disease for ten years or more. Miss Cant added : 'We have been told it is the first wedding that anybody can remember at the hospital chapel. ' Mr Jordan had planned the proposal during one of his girlfriend 's daily visits to the hospital. She added : 'It could have been in Paris. It was just Jack and me in our own little world. 'When I came in I thought it was odd because he had a new shirt on and shoes on. He was pottering and restless and nervous. 'He told me to sit down and he fumbled around on the other chair. 'As soon as he took the ring box out I burst into tears. He did it properly and got down on one knee even though it hurt. 'He said `` I want you to be my wife. Will you marry me ? '' I was shaking so hard. Now I wake up every day still head over heels. ' Mr Jordan, who has had a two-year battle with cancer, wrote on Facebook after proposing : 'Im so proud to call you my fiance Laura. 'You have made my life so much better since you and Lilly came into it. I love you both with all my heart x. ' The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College and met again around two years later after Laura saw him working in a nearby shop. They got together just after Valentines Day last year. She explained : 'As soon as I saw him in the shop I thought oh my god youve blossomed since school. Then I used to find reasons to go down there every day. The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College but only started a relationship last year. ' I went in one day and they had a collection bucket for Jack who was ill in hospital. I ran home and private messaged him on Facebook. ' Miss Cant was so concerned she decided to make the 120 mile journey to Jacks hospital in Bristol to surprise him. She said : 'He had no idea how much I liked him. 'Its not really been an ordinary relationship since day one. 'Its been hospital appointments and everything we do depends on his blood count.\\

Jack didnt want to leave until he was any less than my husband. 'We have the nurses crying and everything. As devastating as this is to both our families, we are all planning on giving Jack the best day of his life. 'He is still my Jack. You would n't think anything was wrong except he is very tired. 'He sleeps all the time. In a very, very odd kind of way Jack was relieved when he was told the news last Friday because he does n't have to fight anymore. Mr Jordan had hoped to undergo a bone matrix operation to postpone his life but was given the news last week that he was too inc for the surgery. Mr Jordan posted a picture on Facebook of his girlfriend wearing her engagement ring after proposing at Christmas. 'He is absolutely exhausted. I am spending every day and every night in hospital with him. ' I feel very numb. Jack is my strength. He is keeping me going. We are want makes us strong. ' The hospital chapel holds about 80 people and will be full of family and close friends. Leukaemia affects a person 's white blood cells. White blood cells are the important infection-fighting part of the immune system, made in your bone marrow. Patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which 'clog up ' their bone marrow. This stops bone marrow making other blood cells, which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood. Acute leukaemia comes on suddenly, progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently. Chronic leukaemia develops more slowly, over months or years. Common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. It is predicted that 48 \% of men and 44 \% of women will survive the disease for ten years or more. Miss Cant added : 'We have been told it is the first wedding that anybody can remember at the hospital chapel. ' \hlc[bleudefrance!40]{Mr Jordan had planned the proposal during one of his girlfriend 's daily visits to the hospital.} She added : 'It could have been in Paris. It was just Jack and me in our own little world. 'When I came in I thought it was odd because he had a new shirt on and shoes on. He was pottering and restless and nervous. 'He told me to sit down and he fumbled around on the other chair. 'As soon as he took the ring box out I burst into tears. He did it properly and got down on one knee even though it hurt. 'He said `` I want you to be my wife. Will you marry me? '' I was shaking so hard. Now I wake up every day still head over heels. ' Mr Jordan, who has had a two-year battle with cancer, wrote on Facebook after proposing : 'Im so proud to call you my fiance Laura. 'You have made my life so much better since you and Lilly came into it. I love you both with all my heart x. ' The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College and met again around two years later after Laura saw him working in a nearby shop. They got together just after Valentines Day last year. She explained : 'As soon as I saw him in the shop I thought oh my god youve blossomed since school. Then I used to find reasons to go down there every day. The couple were in the same school year at Paignton Community College but only started a relationship last year. ' I went in one day and they had a collection bucket for Jack who was ill in hospital. I ran home and private messaged him on Facebook. ' Miss Cant was so concerned she decided to make the 120 mile journey to Jacks hospital in Bristol to surprise him. She said : 'He had no idea how much I liked him. 'Its not really been an ordinary relationship since day one. 'Its been hospital appointments and everything we do depends on his blood count.\\

\section{Human evaluation of Dual-view Augmentation}


We used human evaluation to assess system output on attacked test set in addition to automatic evaluation.
We employ a question-answer (QA) paradigm that assesses how well summarization algorithms maintain important information from the source text \cite{narayan2018ranking,Liu2019TextSW}.
In accordance with this paradigm, a set of questions is developed based on the gold summary on the presumption that it highlights the most crucial aspects of the document.
Then, without having access to the article, participants are required to read system summaries in order to answer to these questions.
The more questions a system can answer, the more effective it is at providing a comprehensive summary of the document.
Additionally, we evaluated the overall quality of the summaries generated by abstractive systems, considering the summarized content may produce disfluent or ungrammatical output.
Concretely, we ask two PhD students to rate according to the criteria of \textit{Informativeness}, \textit{Fluency}, and \textit{Faithfulness}.
The rating score ranges from 1 to 3, with 3 being the best. 
\cite{narayan2018ranking,Liu2019TextSW} sample 20 samples for evaluation, and we expand the size to 40 to avoid the influence of randomness.

Table~\ref{tab:comp_human_baslines} lists the average scores of each model, showing that our model outperforms other baseline models among all metrics. 
Specifically, our model outperforms BART+SSTIA by 0.38 score in terms of faithfulness and 10.35 score in QA task.
This is in accordance with the QuestEval metric, which demonstrates that our model can give more correct and salient information. 
The kappa statistics are 0.43, 0.51, and 0.49 for Info, Flu, and Faith, respectively, which indicates the moderate agreement between annotators. 
To verify the significance of these results, we also conduct the paired student t-test between our model and Sensation.
We obtain a p-value of $4 \times 10^{-4}$, $2 \times 10^{-7}$, and $6 \times 10^{-6}$ for fluency, consistency, and attractiveness.
