  abstract   = {We address here the construction of wrapped probability densities on Lie groups and quotient of Lie groups using the exponential map. The paper starts by briefly reviewing the different approaches to build densities on a manifold and shows the interest of wrapped distributions. We then construct wrapped densities on SE(n) and discuss their statistical estimation. We conclude by an opening to the case of symmetric spaces.},

In this paper, we consider whether it is possible to distinguish between them in a practical situation. More specifically, given data from a circular distribution which may be either von Mises or wrapped normal, we enquire as to how large a sample is required in order to tell them apart.},

  abstract  = {The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)  is a popular method for learning a generative model and embeddings of the data. Many real datasets are hierarchically structured. However, traditional VAEs map data in a Euclidean latent space which cannot efficiently embed tree-like structures. Hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature can. We therefore endow VAEs with a Poincar{\'e} ball model of hyperbolic geometry as a latent space and rigorously derive the necessary methods to work with two main Gaussian generalisations on that space. We empirically show better generalisation to unseen data than the Euclidean counterpart, and can qualitatively and quantitatively better recover hierarchical structures.}
