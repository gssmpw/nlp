\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

In this work, we propose a novel physics-informed blur learning framework for imaging systems, which significantly improves the accuracy of PSF estimation and achieves excellent deblurring performance in both simulation and real-world capture scenarios. Importantly, it operates independently of lens parameters, enabling seamless integration into the mass production of various imaging devices without requiring prior knowledge of lens characteristics. While we demonstrate its effectiveness in photography applications, this approach can also provide valuable insights for enhancing image quality in other imaging systems, such as microscopes, industrial inspection systems, and autonomous driving applications.

Our work is only the first step towards PSF modeling and estimation for general imaging systems. Recovering a PSF is inherently ill-posed due to information loss during image formation. In our current work, chromatic aberrations in wide field-of-view images have not been fully corrected (see supplementary materials for examples of failed cases), which will be addressed in the future.
