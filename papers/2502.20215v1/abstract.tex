This paper presents
% proposes
a novel topology-aware dimensionality
reduction approach aiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic
patterns present in high dimensional
% input
data.
To that end, we build on the \emph{Topological Autoencoders} (TopoAE) \cite{moor2020topological} formulation.
%This paper revisits the \emph{Topological Autoencoders} (TopoAE)
%\cite{moor2020topological}, a prominent technique
%in topology-aware dimensionality reduction, towards the accurate visualization
%of the cyclic patterns present in the high-dimensional input data.
First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis
of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed
induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions)
for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (\PH{0}) of the Rips
filtration.
We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds
for a naive extension of TopoAE to
\PH{d} for $d\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization
of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology
(\PH{1}), called TopoAE++, for the accurate
generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case.
This generalization is based on
the notion of \emph{cascade  distortion}, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. 
We further
% leverage
introduce
a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of
\PH{} for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding
improved runtimes
% compatible
over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a
better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of
the cycles in low dimensions.

%We provide a fast, asymmetric approximation of this
%loss, yielding runtimes compatible with TopoAE, while improving the preservation

%\PH{1}
%(as measured by the Wasserstein distance between the
%persistence diagrams in high and low dimensions). This efficient approximation
%leverages a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of \PH{1} for Rips
%filtrations in the plane, which is of independent interest.
