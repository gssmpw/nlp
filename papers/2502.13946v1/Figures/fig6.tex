  %\caption{Probing harmfulness features in the residual streams across layers and template positions (from the 5th to the 1st closest to the ending position) of Llama-3-8B-Instruct, measured by the proportion of representations classified as harmful. The background intensity reflects the criticality of each layer's states for safety-related decisions, as aligned with \Cref{fig:temp_patching}.}
