  %\caption{Existing safety-tuned LLMs may have their safety capabilities unintentionally ``anchored'' in the \textit{template} region between inputs and responses. This anchoring causes them to overly rely on information processed in the template region when making safety-related decisions, potentially creating vulnerabilities.}
