In this section, we first introduce the notations in Section~\ref{sec:notations}. Then, we present the general problem formulation in Section~\ref{sec:problem_formulation}.

\subsection{Notations}\label{sec:notations}
For any positive integer $n$, we use $[n]$ to denote the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. We use $\mathbb{N}_+$ to represent the set of all positive integers. For two sets $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$, we denote the set difference as $\mathcal{B} \setminus \mathcal{C}:=\{x\in \mathcal{B}:x\notin\mathcal{C}\}$. For a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, $\Diag(d)$ denotes a diagonal matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, where the diagonal entries satisfy $X_{i,i} = x_i$ for all $i \in [d]$, and all off-diagonal entries are zero. We use $\mathbf{1}_n$ to denote an $n$-dimensional column vector with all entries equal to one.

    Our research objective. This figure presents the goal of our study: creating a more equitable desk-rejection system. Consider Professor A, who has carelessly submitted numerous papers exceeding the submission limit, collaborating with another senior researcher (Professor B) with many submissions, and a young student with only one paper. Our proposed system prioritizes desk-rejecting papers from authors with a large number of submissions first, thereby increasing the studentâ€™s chances of having their paper accepted. This approach aims to mitigate the disparity in the impact of desk rejections and promote fairness.

\subsection{Problem Formulation} \label{sec:problem_formulation}

In this section, we further introduce the actual problem we will investigate in this paper, where we begin with introducing the definition for three kinds of authors that will appear later in our discussion. 


\begin{definition}[Submission Limit Problem]\label{def:submit_limit_problem}
    Let $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ denote the set of $n$ authors, and let $\mathcal{P} = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m\}$ denote the set of $m$ papers. Each author $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$ has a subset of papers $P_i \subseteq \mathcal{P}$, and each paper $p_j \in \mathcal{P}$ is authored by a subset of authors $A_j \subseteq \mathcal{A}$. For each author, $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$, let $C_i$ denote the set of all coauthors of $a_i$ and let $x \in \mathbb{N}_+$ denote the maximum number of papers each author can submit. 

    The goal is to find a subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ of papers (to keep) such that for every $a_i\in\mathcal{A},$
    \begin{align*}
        \underbrace{|\{p_j \in  S : a_i \in A_j\}|}_{\#\mathrm{remained~papers~of~author}~a_i} \leq x.  
    \end{align*}
    or equivalently find a subset $\ov{S} \subseteq \mathcal{P}$ of papers (to reject) such that for every $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$,
        \begin{align*}
        |P_i| - \underbrace{|\{j \in  \ov{S} : i \in A_j\}|}_{\#{\mathrm{rejected~papers~of~author}~}a_i} \leq x.  
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

We now present several fundamental facts related to Definition~\ref{def:submit_limit_problem}, which can be easily verified through basic set theory. 
\begin{fact}
    For any author $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$ and paper $p_j \in \mathcal{P}$, $a_i \in A_j$ if and only if $p_j \in P_i$.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
    For each author $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$, the number of papers submitted by the author can be formulated as:
    \begin{align*}
        |P_i| = |\{p_j \in \mathcal{P} : a_i \in A_j\}|.
    \end{align*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
    For each paper $j \in [m]$, the number of authors of this paper can be formulated as:
    \begin{align*}
        |A_j| = |\{a_i \in \mathcal{A} : p_j \in P_i\}|.
    \end{align*}
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
    For each author $a_i \in \mathcal{A}$, the set of coauthors for author $a_i$ can be formulated as:
    \begin{align*}
        C_i = (\bigcup_{p_j \in P_i} A_j) \setminus \{ a_i \}.
    \end{align*}
\end{fact}
