    \caption{Model architecture of the proposed speech enhancement system. a) System overview. The input dimension of neural blocks/layers are presented before each of them in the form `batch dimension x (dimension of one sample in batch)". b) The online/offline narrow-band block. The solid lines stands for online processing. The solid plus dashed lines stands for offline processing. c) The cross-band block. }
