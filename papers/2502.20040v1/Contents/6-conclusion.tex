\section{Conclusion}
This work proposed a single-channel Mel-spectrogram denoising and dereverberation network, named CleanMel. The learning targets of logMel mapping and ratio mask have been compared, while the former suffers from less residual noise and the latter preserves better the target speech. The adopted network architecture, i.e. interleaved cross-band and narrow-band blocks, has been proven working well for single-channel speech denoising and dereverberation in both the linear-frequency domain and the proposed Mel-frequency domain. The high-quality enhanced Mel-spectrogram can be well transformed to waveform with a neural vocoder and can also be used for boosting the ASR performance. Mel-spectrogram plays a key role in the field of speech processing, so the proposed CleanMel model can be potentially used for many other tasks, such as self-supervised speech pre-training and high-quality speech synthesis.
