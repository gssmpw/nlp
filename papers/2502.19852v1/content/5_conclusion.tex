\section{Conclusion}

This paper recognizes  the need for benchmarks with diverse type of interactions in conversational code generation. To address this gap, we introduced \ours, a novel and reproducible environment designed to assess LLM code generation abilities across nine varied feedback scenarios. %with dynamic user feedback simulation via GPT-4o. 
Additionally, for scenarios where API call costs are prohibitive, we offer \oursstatic, a zero-call benchmark from pre-generated feedback logs, providing a highly correlated evaluation of the conversational code generation capabilities of LLMs with \ours. Our work contributes to a more thorough evaluation of diverse multi-turn evaluation objectives, and
highlights a gap to invite for future models in the new design space.
