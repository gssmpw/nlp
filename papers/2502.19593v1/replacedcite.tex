\section{Related Work}
Using Machine Learning (ML) to process extensive health data has been a long-standing effort, particularly in ICU settings where data is collected from various devices at minute or second intervals ____. Traditional DSS require extensive preprocessing and feature extraction ____. Recurrent models capture temporal relationships but struggle with sparse, asynchronous ICU data due to fixed temporal resolutions and reliance on predefined variable matrices ____.

Advancements in Transformers improved the modeling of longitudinal medical data. BEHRT ____ processes diagnosis codes as tokens within a limited vocabulary, modeling hospital visits as sentences with age encoded in position embeddings and pre-training through Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Building on this, Med-BERT ____ and ExMed-BERT ____ extended the approach by incorporating continuous data and adopting late fusion techniques. Models like Rare-BERT ____ and life2vec ____ further expanded vocabularies to cover broader data types, while ExBEHRT ____ and BRLTM ____ integrated demographic and lab data through additional embedding layers.

Hierarchical approaches such as Hi-BEHRT ____ and graph-based methods like GT-BEHRT ____ addressed challenges with large input sequences by summarizing sets of visits before integrating them into patient profiles. STraTS ____ proposed a triplet embedding scheme for features, values, and time, while DuETT ____ used dual attention to capture time- and event-based representations.

A key challenge remains the lack of standardized benchmarks to compare. YAIB ____ provides a reproducible framework for ICU cohort generation and task evaluation, while EHRSHOT ____ enables model fine-tuning across contexts.

ICU-BERT advances these efforts by capturing the complexity of ICU data through pre-trained embeddings and modeling temporal information at the embedding level. Unlike earlier approaches, it avoids narrow vocabularies, enabling generalization across datasets and achieving competitive performance on YAIB and DuETT tasks.
