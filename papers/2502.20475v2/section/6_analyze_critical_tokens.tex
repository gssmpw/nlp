\section{Analyze Critical Tokens}
\label{6_analyze_critical_tokens}

The causal tracing analysis confirms that both the subject and previous answer tokens are important for handling one-to-many factual queries. To determine whether the subject primarily supports knowledge recall and previous answer tokens drive suppression, we next analyze how attention and MLPs utilize these tokens, as well as the last token that the model uses to predict the next answer.
