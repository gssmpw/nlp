Firstly, our method is not constrained by specific scenarios, meaning it can be applied to more real-world tasks, which is our future work. Secondly, we consider extending this method to other generative methods that require constraints, not just the diffusion model. Finally, in the future, we will explore the possibility of developing a stricter coverage of the safety score that sacrifices less accuracy while still ensuring safety.
