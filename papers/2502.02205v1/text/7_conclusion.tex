In this paper, we have introduced \emph{\underline{Safe} \underline{Diff}usion Models for PDE \underline{Con}trol} (\proj), a novel approach that integrates safety constraints into deep learning-based control of PDE systems. By quantifying safety uncertainty using conformal prediction and introducing a reweighted loss during post-training, our method effectively handles distribution shifts and ensures safety while maintaining competitive control performance. Furthermore, inference-time fine-tuning allows dynamic adjustment of the model to meet specific control targets. The results of experiments on diverse control tasks, including 1D Burgersâ€™ equation, 2D incompressible fluid, and controlled nuclear fusion, demonstrate that \proj reliably satisfies safety constraints and outperforms existing methods. This work paves the way for safer deployment of machine learning techniques in high-stakes real-world applications.
