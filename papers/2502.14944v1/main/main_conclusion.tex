\section{Conclusion}
We introduce a new framework for inference-time reward optimization in diffusion models, utilizing an iterative evolutionary refinement process. We also provide a theoretical guarantee for the framework's effectiveness and demonstrate its superior empirical performance in protein and DNA design, surpassing existing single-shot reward-guided generation algorithms. As future work, we plan to explore its application in small molecule design.
