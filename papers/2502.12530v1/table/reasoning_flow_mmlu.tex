R: Federal subpoenas are designed to compel testimony, the production of documents, and permit inspections related to a case. However, requiring an individual to undergo a physical or mental examination typically falls outside the scope of what a subpoena can mandate. \textbf{Such examinations usually require separate legal processes or warrants, ensuring individuals' rights are adequately protected.}\\
