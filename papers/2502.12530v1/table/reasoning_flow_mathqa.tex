   Q: Below is a multiple-choice question about math problem. Please explain your reasoning without explicitly revealing your selection. The question is: an auction house charges a commission of 18 \% on the first \$50,000 of the sale price of an item, plus 10 \% on the amount of the sale price in excess of \$50,000. what was the price of a painting for which the house charged a total commission of \$24,000? a ) \$115,000, b ) \$160,000, c ) \$ 200,000, d ) \$ 240,000, e ) \$365,000\\

R: \textbf{Say the price of the house was \$ x, then 0.18 * 50,000 + 0.1 * ( x - 50,000 ) = 24,000 $\rightarrow$ x = \$ 200,000} ( 18 \% of \$ 50,000 plus 10 \% of the amount in excess of \$ 50,000, which is x - 50,000, should equal to total commission of \$ 24,000 )\\
