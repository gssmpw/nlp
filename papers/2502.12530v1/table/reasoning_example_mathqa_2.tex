    \textbf{Q} = A pet store regularly sells pet food at a discount of 10 percent to 30 percent from the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. if during a sale, the store discounts an additional 20 percent from the discount price, what would be the lowest possible price of a container of pet food that had a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of \$ 40.00?\\

    \textbf{Decision set $\mathcal{A}$} = [a: \$ 10.00, b: \$ 11.20, \textcolor{outputcolor}{c: \$ 22.40 (Correct)}, d: \$ 16.00, e: \$ 18.00.]\\
    % In the provided trajectory, each ally demonstrates a cautious yet proactive approach to engaging enemies. 
    
    \textbf{{Explanation:}} retail price = manufacturer suggested retail price = \$ 40 first discount price = retail price {\color{red}-10 \% to -30 \% = presence of retail price retrievable.$\boldsymbol{\times}$}   \\
    
    \textbf{{Improved Explanation (Ours):}} retail price =40 first maximum usually discounted price =40 - 30 \% of 40 =40 - 12 =28 price after additional discounting during sale =\textcolor{outputcolor}{28 - 20 \% of 28 =28 - 5.60 =22.40 $\checkmark$} \\
