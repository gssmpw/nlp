    \caption{Line detection performance before and after re-ranking using ground truth. Predicted line segments that are closer to the ground truth are assigned higher scores through re-ranking. With proper ranking, the overall performance of the predicted candidate line segments can be significantly improved. Motivated by this observation, we propose to use a re-ranking module to optimize the predicted confidence scores during inferring and use a ranking loss to supervise confidence score predicting additionally during training.}

\textbf{Line Segment Detection.} Traditional line detection methods such as **Liu, "Line Detection by Improved Sobel Operator"** rely on low-level image features, e.g., image gradients. Based on local edge features, Hough transform is used for line segment detection in **Canny, "A Computational Approach to Edge Detection"**.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved promising results and can be roughly divided into two categories. In junction-based methods, DWP **Wang, "Dense Linelet Voting for Accurate Line Segment Detection"** predicts junction map and edge map in two branches before merging them. PPGNet **Huang, "Point-Pair Graph Network for Line Segment Detection"** uses a point-pair graph to describe junctions and line segments. L-CNN **Li, "Learning CNN Structure for Line Segment Detection"** applies line proposal and LoI pooling to propose candidate lines and verify them. LETR **Zhou, "Learning Edge-Transformed Representations for Line Segment Detection"** models it as object detection and predicts line segments with DETR architecture.
Methods with dense prediction first predict representation map and extract line segments with post-processing. AFM **Chen, "Attraction Field Maps for Line Segment Detection"** proposes attraction field maps to represent the image space and uses a squeeze module to generate line segment maps. HAWP **Wang, "Hybrid Architecture of AFM and L-CNN for Line Segment Detection"** further builds a hybrid model considering AFM and L-CNN. Lin \textit{et al.}, "Deep Hough Transform for End-to-End Line Segment Detection" apply deep Hough transform to the previous detection architectures. TP-LSD **Zhou, "Tri-Points Line Segment Representation for Fast and Accurate Line Detection"** introduces tri-points line segment representation for end-to-end detection. M-LSD **Wang, "Multi-Scale Line Segment Detection Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation Mechanism"** presents SoL augmentation and designs an extremely efficient architecture for fast detection.
In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based line detection method which can get proposals from dense feature maps without bipartite matching.

    \caption{Overview of the proposed RANK-LETR. The process begins by feeding an image into a CNN backbone to extract multi-level feature maps from different layers. These features are then processed by a deformable Transformer encoder to generate candidate line segments. The candidate segments are predicted using high-resolution feature maps for higher prediction accuracy and less ambiguity, with each segment represented by confidence scores and positions. Each feature point is responsible for detecting the line segment whose centroid is nearest to it. Additionally, learnable geometric information is extracted from the multi-level features using a CNN-based geometric information extractor. Finally, the line segments are re-ranked by optimizing their confidence scores with the learnable geometric information.}

\noindent\textbf{Visual Transformer.} 
Transformer-based models have gained significant success in computer vision tasks. Dosovitskiy \textit{et al.}, "An Image is Not a Simple Recurrent Neural Network" propose the Vision Transformer (ViT) which applies transformers to image classification by dividing the image into fixed-size patches. Carion \textit{et al.}, "End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers" introduce transformers into object detection pipeline through bipartite matching, named DETR. Zhu \textit{et al.}, "Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection" further propose deformable DETR whose attention modules only attend to a small set of keys. Xu \textit{et al.}, "End-to-End Line Segment Detection with Transformers" apply DETR architecture in line segment detection with a multi-scale encoder-decoder strategy. 
Tong \textit{et al.}, "Vanishing Point Detection via Clustering and Ranking with Transformers" use Transformer to cluster line segments corresponding with the same vanishing points and further apply Transformer in end-to-end vanishing point detection ____. Transformers are also used in semantic segmentation **Chen, "Semantic Segmentation Using Transformers"**, pose estimation **Sun, "Pose Estimation Using Transformers"**, tracking **Li, "Tracking via Clustering and Ranking with Transformers"**, etc. Our work aims at improving transformer-based line segment detection with matched predicting strategy and presented re-ranking module.

\noindent\textbf{Ranking-based Losses for Object Detectors.} Ranking-based losses have been widely used recently. Average Precision Loss is first proposed **Szeliski, "Average Precision Loss for Object Detection"** to address the imbalance of foreground-background classification problem by framing object detection as a ranking task. Oksuz \textit{et al.}, "Rank & Sort (RS) Loss: Ranking and Sorting Objectness with Transformers" propose Rank \& Sort (RS) Loss that defines a ranking objective between positives and negatives as well as a sorting objective to prioritize positives with respect to their continuous IoUs.
Yavuz \textit{et al.}, "Bucketed Ranking-based (BR) Losses for Efficient Object Detection" apply Bucketed Ranking-based(BR) Losses which group negative predictions into several buckets.
Cetinkaya \textit{et al.}, "Edge-Transformed Representations with Ranking-based Losses for Edge Detection" extend Ranking-based Loss to edge detection. In this work, we propose a line segment ranking loss for ranking the feature point with a higher line segment detection quality a higher confidence score.
