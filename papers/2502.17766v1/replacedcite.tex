    \caption{Line detection performance before and after re-ranking using ground truth. Predicted line segments that are closer to the ground truth are assigned higher scores through re-ranking. With proper ranking, the overall performance of the predicted candidate line segments can be significantly improved. Motivated by this observation, we propose to use a re-ranking module to optimize the predicted confidence scores during inferring and use a ranking loss to supervise confidence score predicting additionally during training.}

\textbf{Line Segment Detection.} Traditional line detection methods such as ____ rely on low-level image features, e.g., image gradients. Based on local edge features, Hough transform is used for line segment detection in ____.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved promising results and can be roughly divided into two categories. In junction-based methods, DWP ____ predicts junction map and edge map in two branches before merging them. PPGNet ____ uses a point-pair graph to describe junctions and line segments. L-CNN ____ applies line proposal and LoI pooling to propose candidate lines and verify them. LETR ____ models it as object detection and predicts line segments with DETR architecture. 
Methods with dense prediction first predict representation map and extract line segments with post-processing. AFM ____ proposes attraction field maps to represent the image space and uses a squeeze module to generate line segment maps. HAWP ____ further builds a hybrid model considering AFM and L-CNN. Lin \textit{et al.} ____ apply deep Hough transform to the previous detection architectures. TP-LSD ____ introduces tri-points line segment representation for end-to-end detection. M-LSD ____ presents SoL augmentation and designs an extremely efficient architecture for fast detection.
In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based line detection method which can get proposals from dense feature maps without bipartite matching.

    \caption{Overview of the proposed RANK-LETR. The process begins by feeding an image into a CNN backbone to extract multi-level feature maps from different layers. These features are then processed by a deformable Transformer encoder to generate candidate line segments. The candidate segments are predicted using high-resolution feature maps for higher prediction accuracy and less ambiguity, with each segment represented by confidence scores and positions. Each feature point is responsible for detecting the line segment whose centroid is nearest to it. Additionally, learnable geometric information is extracted from the multi-level features using a CNN-based geometric information extractor. Finally, the line segments are re-ranked by optimizing their confidence scores with the learnable geometric information.}

\noindent\textbf{Ranking-based Losses for Object Detectors.} Ranking-based losses have been widely used recently. Average Precision Loss is first proposed ____ to address the imbalance of foreground-background classification problem by framing object detection as a ranking task. Oksuz \textit{et al.} ____ propose Rank \& Sort (RS) Loss that defines a ranking objective between positives and negatives as well as a sorting objective to prioritize positives with respect to their continuous IoUs.
Yavuz \textit{et al.} ____ apply Bucketed Ranking-based(BR) Losses which group negative predictions into several buckets.
