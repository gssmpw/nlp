 abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

 abstract = {Soft robots have the potential to significantly change the way that robots interact with the environment and with humans. However, accurately modeling soft robot and soft actuator dynamics in order to perform model-based control can be extremely difficult. Deep neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling systems with complex dynamics such as the pneumatic, continuum joint, six degree-of-freedom robot shown in this paper. Unfortunately it is also difficult to apply standard model-based control techniques using a neural net. In this work, we show that the gradients used within a neural net to relate system states and inputs to outputs can be used to formulate a linearized discrete state space representation of the system. Using the state space representation, model predictive control (MPC) was developed with a six degree of freedom pneumatic robot with compliant plastic joints and rigid links. Using this neural net model, we were able to achieve an average steady state error across all joints of approximately 1 and 2Â° with and without integral control respectively. We also implemented a first-principles based model for MPC and the learned model performed better in terms of steady state error, rise time, and overshoot. Overall, our results show the potential of combining empirical modeling approaches with model-based control for soft robots and soft actuators.},

@article{Jiahao.2024,
 abstract = {Soft robots have many advantages over rigid robots thanks to their compliant and passive nature. However, it is generally challenging to model the dynamics of soft robots due to their high spatial dimensionality, making it difficult to use model-based methods to accurately control soft robots. It often requires direct numerical simulation of partial differential equations to simulate soft robots. This not only requires an accurate numerical model, but also makes soft robot modeling slow and expensive. Deep learning algorithms have shown promises in data-driven modeling of soft robots. However, these algorithms usually require a large amount of data, which are difficult to obtain in either simulation or real-world experiments of soft robots. In this work, we propose KNODE-Cosserat, a framework that combines first-principle physics models and neural ordinary differential equations. We leverage the best from both worlds -- the generalization ability of physics-based models and the fast speed of deep learning methods. We validate our framework in both simulation and real-world experiments. In both cases, we show that the robot model significantly improves over the baseline models under different metrics.

@article{Johnson.2021,
 abstract = {Model-based optimal control of soft robots may enable compliant, underdamped platforms to operate in a repeatable fashion and effectively accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible for soft robots. Unfortunately, developing accurate analytical dynamic models for soft robots is time-consuming, difficult, and error-prone. Deep learning presents an alternative modeling approach that only requires a time history of system inputs and system states, which can be easily measured or estimated. However, fully relying on empirical or learned models involves collecting large amounts of representative data from a soft robot in order to model the complex state space-a task which may not be feasible in many situations. Furthermore, the exclusive use of empirical models for model-based control can be dangerous if the model does not generalize well. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning methods with an existing first-principles model in order to improve overall performance for a sampling-based non-linear model predictive controller. We validate this approach on a soft robot platform and demonstrate that performance improves by 52{\%} on average when employing the combined model.},

 abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

 abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics. One disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box representations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing knowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models, these black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well understood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these principles. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee physically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that combine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate Lagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated models adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The parameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the Euler-Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not require specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can be used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties were only obtained when using system identification techniques that require knowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics models and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body systems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models that can be applied to physical systems for real-time control. Compared to standard deep networks, the physics-inspired models learn better models and capture the underlying structure of the dynamics.},

Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

 abstract = {Feed-forward model-based control relies on models of the controlled plant, e.g., in robotics on accurate knowledge of manipulator kinematics or dynamics. However, mechanical and analytical models do not capture all aspects of a plant's intrinsic properties and there remain unmodeled dynamics due to varying parameters, unmodeled friction or soft materials. In this context, machine learning is an alternative suitable technique to extract non-linear plant models from data. However, fully data-based models suffer from inaccuracies as well and are inefficient if they include learning of well known analytical models. This paper thus argues that feed-forward control based on hybrid models comprising an analytical model and a learned error model can significantly improve modeling accuracy. Hybrid modeling here serves the purpose to combine the best of the two modeling worlds. The hybrid modeling methodology is described and the approach is demonstrated for two typical problems in robotics, i.e., inverse kinematics control and computed torque control. The former is performed for a redundant soft robot and the latter for a rigid industrial robot with redundant degrees of freedom, where a complete analytical model is not available for any of the platforms.},

@article{Tariverdi.2021,
 abstract = {This paper introduces and validates a real-time dynamic predictive model based on a neural network approach for soft continuum manipulators. The presented model provides a real-time prediction framework using neural-network-based strategies and continuum mechanics principles. A time-space integration scheme is employed to discretize the continuous dynamics and decouple the dynamic equations for translation and rotation for each node of a soft continuum manipulator. Then the resulting architecture is used to develop distributed prediction algorithms using recurrent neural networks. The proposed RNN-based parallel predictive scheme does not rely on computationally intensive algorithms; therefore, it is useful in real-time applications. Furthermore, simulations are shown to illustrate the approach performance on soft continuum elastica, and the approach is also validated through an experiment on a magnetically-actuated soft continuum manipulator. The results demonstrate that the presented model can outperform classical modeling approaches such as the Cosserat rod model while also shows possibilities for being used in practice.},

@article{Thuruthel.2017,
 abstract = {The soft capabilities of biological appendages like the arms of Octopus vulgaris and elephants' trunks have inspired roboticists to develop their robotic equivalents. Although there have been considerable efforts to replicate their morphology and behavior patterns, we are still lagging behind in replicating the dexterity and efficiency of these biological systems. This is mostly due to the lack of development and application of dynamic controllers on these robots which could exploit the morphological properties that a soft-bodied manipulator possesses. The complexity of these high-dimensional nonlinear systems has deterred the application of traditional model-based approaches. This paper provides a machine learning-based approach for the development of dynamic models for a soft robotic manipulator and a trajectory optimization method for predictive control of the manipulator in task space. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a learned dynamic model and a derived task space controller for a soft robotic manipulator. The validation of the controller is carried out on an octopus-inspired soft manipulator simulation derived from a piecewise constant strain approximation and then experimentally on a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator. The results indicate that such an approach is promising for developing fast and accurate dynamic models for soft robotic manipulators while being applicable on a wide range of soft manipulators.},

@article{Wang.2021b,
 abstract = {Soft continuum robots have been accepted as a promising category of biomedical robots, accredited to the robots' inherent compliance that makes them safely interact with their surroundings. In its application of minimally invasive surgery, such a continuum concept shares the same view of robotization for conventional endoscopy/laparoscopy. Different from rigid-link robots with accurate analytical kinematics/dynamics, soft robots encounter modeling uncertainties due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which would deteriorate the model-based control performances. However, the trade-off between flexibility and controllability of soft manipulators may not be readily optimized but would be demanded for specific kinds of modeling approaches. To this end, data-driven modeling strategies making use of machine learning algorithms would be an encouraging way out for the control of soft continuum robots. In this article, we attempt to overview the current state of kinematic/dynamic model-free control schemes for continuum manipulators, particularly by learning-based means, and discuss their similarities and differences. Perspectives and trends in the development of new control methods are also investigated through the review of existing limitations and challenges.},

@article{Wang.2024,
 abstract = {Modelling complex deformation for soft robotics provides a guideline to understand their behaviour, leading to safe interaction with the environment. However, building a surrogate model with high accuracy and fast inference speed can be challenging for soft robotics due to the nonlinearity from complex geometry, large deformation, material nonlinearity etc. The reality gap from surrogate models also prevents their further deployment in the soft robotics domain. In this study, we proposed a physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) named PINN-Ray to model complex deformation for a Fin Ray soft robotic gripper, which embeds the minimum potential energy principle from elastic mechanics and additional high-fidelity experimental data into the loss function of neural network for training. This method is significant in terms of its generalisation to complex geometry and robust to data scarcity as compared to other data-driven neural networks. Furthermore, it has been extensively evaluated to model the deformation of the Fin Ray finger under external actuation. PINN-Ray demonstrates improved accuracy as compared with Finite element modelling (FEM) after applying the data assimilation scheme to treat the sim-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduced our automated framework to design, fabricate soft robotic fingers, and characterise their deformation by visual tracking, which provides a guideline for the fast prototype of soft robotics.},
