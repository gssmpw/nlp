To propel the corresponding research areas, a common platform is presented for benchmarking and transferability of results, approaches, and designs among different research groups. The proposed mechanical design including all components is open source, whereas electronics and actuation are off-the-shelf. Research groups are enabled to build up their own system as all relevant CAD-files and assembly instructions are made accessible through GitHub. With that, a fundamental goal in research is achieved and will push continuum joints towards real application scenarios for future soft robots.},

@article{Bell.2022,
 abstract = {As more roboticists are turning to Nature for design inspiration, it is becoming increasingly apparent that multisystem-level investigations of biological processes can frequently lead to unexpected advances in the development of experimental research platforms. Inspired by these efforts, we present here a holistic approach to developing an autonomous starfish-inspired soft robot that embodies a number of key design, fabrication, and actuation principles. These key concepts include integrated and sequentially deployable magnetic tube feet for site-specific and reversible substrate attachment, individually addressable flexible arms, and highly efficient and self-contained fluidic engines. These individual features offer a level of synergistic motion control not previously seen in other starfish-inspired robots. For example, our bistable dome-like tube feet are capable of achieving high adhesion forces to ferrous surfaces and low removal forces. These tube feet are further integrated with a fluidic engine to drive the entire arm while maintaining the ability to accurately control the arm position with a 270° range of motion. Furthermore, the arm and fluidic engine are modular, allowing each of the five arms to be replaced in seconds or enabling the exploration of a variety of limb geometries. Through the incorporation of these different design elements, the ASTER-bot (named for its star-like body plan) is capable of locomotion on ferrous surfaces, above and below water, and on nonplanar surfaces. This article further describes the design, fabrication, and integration strategies and characterizes the energetic and locomotory performance of this pentaradial robotic prototype.},

 abstract = {Endoscopic procedures have transformed minimally invasive surgery as they allow the examination and intervention on a patient's anatomy through natural orifices, without the need for external incisions. However, the complexity of anatomical pathways and the limited dexterity of existing instruments, limit such procedures mainly to diagnosis and biopsies. This paper proposes a new robotic platform: the Intuitive imaging sensing navigated and kinematically enhanced ([Formula: see text])~robot that aims to improve the field of endoscopic surgery. The proposed robotic platform includes a snake-like robotic endoscope equipped with a camera, a light-source and two robotic instruments, supported with a robotic arm for global positioning and for insertion of the [Formula: see text] and a master interface for master-slave teleoperation. The proposed robotic platform design focuses on ergonomics and intuitive control. The control workflow was first validated in simulation and then implemented on the robotic platform. The results are consistent with the simulation and show the clear clinical potential of the system. Limitations such as tendon backlash and elongation over time will be further investigated by means of combined hardware and software solutions. In conclusion, the proposed system contributes to the field of endoscopic surgical robots and could allow to perform more complex endoscopic surgical procedures while reducing patient trauma and recovery time.},

 abstract = {The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, equation parameters, discretizations, etc., in 1D and 2D.

 abstract = {In this paper, we describe the state of the art in continuum robot manipulators and systems intended for application to interventional medicine. Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications. We discuss relevant research in design, modeling, control, and sensing for continuum manipulators, and we highlight how this work is being used to build robotic systems for specific surgical procedures. We provide perspective for the future by discussing current limitations, open questions, and challenges.},

 abstract = {The term {\textquotedbl}hyper-redundant{\textquotedbl} refers to robotic manipulators and mobile robots with a very large, possibly infinite, number of actuatable degrees of freedom. These robots are analogous in morphology and operation to snakes, worms, elephant trunks, and tentacles. This thesis presents a novel kinematic framework for hyper-redundant manipulator motion planning and task implementation. The basis of this formulation is the use of a {\textquotedbl}backbone reference set{\textquotedbl} which captures the essential macroscopic geometric features of hyper-redundant robots. In the analytical part of this work, the backbone representation is developed and used to solve problems in obstacle avoidance, locomotion, grasping, and {\textquotedbl}optimal{\textquotedbl} end effector placement. The latter part of this thesis deals with the design and implementation of a thirty-degree-of-freedom planar hyper-redundant manipulator which is used to demonstrate these novel kinematic and motion planning techniques. Design issues such as robustness with respect to mechanical failure, and design for easy assembly and repair are also addressed. The analytical and design concepts are combined to illustrate tasks for which hyper-redundant robotic mechanisms are well suited.},

@article{Cho.2014,
 abstract = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.

 abstract = {Accurate models of the world are built upon notions of its underlying symmetries. In physics, these symmetries correspond to conservation laws, such as for energy and momentum. Yet even though neural network models see increasing use in the physical sciences, they struggle to learn these symmetries. In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.},

 abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

@misc{Ding.2022,
 abstract = {In multi-body dynamics, the motion of a complicated physical object is described as a coupled ordinary differential equation system with multiple unknown solutions. Engineers need to constantly adjust the object to meet requirements at the design stage, where a highly efficient solver is needed. The rise of machine learning-based partial differential equation solvers can meet this need. These solvers can be classified into two categories: approximating the solution function (Physics-informed neural network) and learning the solution operator (Neural operator). The recently proposed physics-informed neural operator (PINO) gains advantages from both categories by embedding physics equations into the loss function of a neural operator. Following this state-of-art concept, we propose the physics-informed neural operator for coupled ODEs in multi-body dynamics (PINO-MBD), which learns the mapping between parameter spaces and solution spaces. Once PINO-MBD is trained, only one forward pass of the network is required to obtain the solutions for a new instance with different parameters. To handle the difficulty that coupled ODEs contain multiple solutions (instead of only one in normal PDE problems), two new physics embedding methods are also proposed. The experimental results on classic vehicle-track coupled dynamics problem show state-of-art performance not only on solutions but also the first and second derivatives of solutions.

The multi-module arm is composed of three identical units, which are able to move thanks to embedded fluidic actuators that allow omnidirectional bending and elongation, typical movements of the octopus. The use of soft materials makes the arm safe, adaptable and compliant with tissues. In addition, a granular jamming-based stiffening mechanism is integrated in each module with the aim of tuning the stiffness of the manipulator and controlling the interactions with biological structures. A miniaturized camera and a pneumatic gripper have been purposely designed and integrated on the tip of the manipulator making it usable in real working conditions. This work reports the design and the fabrication process of the manipulator, the theoretical and experimental evaluation of the stiffness and the analysis of the motion workspace. Finally, pick and place tests with the fully integrated system are shown.},

 abstract = {Recently, deep learning surrogates and neural operators have shown promise in solving partial differential equations~ (PDEs). However, they often require a large amount of training data and are limited to bounded domains. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed neural operator method to solve parameterized boundary value problems without labeled data. By reformulating the PDEs into boundary integral equations~(BIEs), we can train the operator network solely on the boundary of the domain. This approach reduces the number of required sample points from O(Nd) to O(Nd-1), where d is the domain's dimension, leading to a significant acceleration of the training process. Additionally, our method can handle unbounded problems, which are unattainable for existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators. Our numerical experiments show the effectiveness of parameterized complex geometries and unbounded problems.},

The need to comprehend and predict the dynamics of complex systems have spurred developments in large-scale simulations and a multitude of methods across several disciplines. The goals of understanding and prediction in complex dynamical systems, however, have been hindered by high dimensionality, complexity and chaotic behaviours. Recent advances in data-driven techniques and machine-learning approaches have revolutionized how we model and analyse complex systems. The integration of these techniques with dynamical systems theory opens up opportunities to tackle previously unattainable challenges in modelling and prediction of dynamical systems. While data-driven prediction methods have made great strides in recent years, it is still necessary to develop new techniques to improve their applicability to a wider range of complex systems in science and engineering. This focus issue shares recent developments in the field of complex dynamical systems with emphasis on data-driven, data-assisted and artificial intelligence-based discovery of dynamical systems.

 abstract = {Experiments on physical continuum robot are the gold standard for evaluations. Currently, as no commercial continuum robot platform is available, a large variety of early-stage prototypes exists. These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges.  We address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this letter, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.},

 abstract = {Pneumatically-actuated soft robots have advantages over traditional rigid robots in many applications. In particular, their flexible bodies and gentle air-powered movements make them more suitable for use around humans and other objects that could be injured or damaged by traditional robots. However, existing systems for controlling soft robots currently require dedicated electromechanical hardware (usually solenoid valves) to maintain the actuation state (expanded or contracted) of each independent actuator. When combined with power, computation, and sensing components, this control hardware adds considerable cost, size, and power demands to the robot, thereby limiting the feasibility of soft robots in many important application areas. In this work, we introduce a pneumatic memory that uses air (not electricity) to set and maintain the states of large numbers of soft robotic actuators without dedicated electromechanical hardware. These pneumatic logic circuits use normally-closed microfluidic valves as transistor-like elements; this enables our circuits to support more complex computational functions than those built from normally-open valves. We demonstrate an eight-bit nonvolatile random-access pneumatic memory (RAM) that can maintain the states of multiple actuators, control both individual actuators and multiple actuators simultaneously using a pneumatic version of time division multiplexing (TDM), and set actuators to any intermediate position using a pneumatic version of analog-to-digital conversion. We perform proof-of-concept experimental testing of our pneumatic RAM by using it to control soft robotic hands playing individual notes, chords, and songs on a piano keyboard. By dramatically reducing the amount of hardware required to control multiple independent actuators in pneumatic soft robots, our pneumatic RAM can accelerate the spread of soft robotic technologies to a wide range of important application areas.},

 abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

 abstract = {Soft robots have the potential to significantly change the way that robots interact with the environment and with humans. However, accurately modeling soft robot and soft actuator dynamics in order to perform model-based control can be extremely difficult. Deep neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling systems with complex dynamics such as the pneumatic, continuum joint, six degree-of-freedom robot shown in this paper. Unfortunately it is also difficult to apply standard model-based control techniques using a neural net. In this work, we show that the gradients used within a neural net to relate system states and inputs to outputs can be used to formulate a linearized discrete state space representation of the system. Using the state space representation, model predictive control (MPC) was developed with a six degree of freedom pneumatic robot with compliant plastic joints and rigid links. Using this neural net model, we were able to achieve an average steady state error across all joints of approximately 1 and 2° with and without integral control respectively. We also implemented a first-principles based model for MPC and the learned model performed better in terms of steady state error, rise time, and overshoot. Overall, our results show the potential of combining empirical modeling approaches with model-based control for soft robots and soft actuators.},

@misc{Jacot.2018,
 abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function $f_θ$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function $f_θ$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

@article{Jiahao.2024,
 abstract = {Soft robots have many advantages over rigid robots thanks to their compliant and passive nature. However, it is generally challenging to model the dynamics of soft robots due to their high spatial dimensionality, making it difficult to use model-based methods to accurately control soft robots. It often requires direct numerical simulation of partial differential equations to simulate soft robots. This not only requires an accurate numerical model, but also makes soft robot modeling slow and expensive. Deep learning algorithms have shown promises in data-driven modeling of soft robots. However, these algorithms usually require a large amount of data, which are difficult to obtain in either simulation or real-world experiments of soft robots. In this work, we propose KNODE-Cosserat, a framework that combines first-principle physics models and neural ordinary differential equations. We leverage the best from both worlds -- the generalization ability of physics-based models and the fast speed of deep learning methods. We validate our framework in both simulation and real-world experiments. In both cases, we show that the robot model significantly improves over the baseline models under different metrics.

 abstract = {State estimation is widely used in various automated systems, including IoT systems, unmanned systems, robots, etc. In traditional state estimation, measurement data are instantaneous and processed in real time. With modern systems' development, sensors can obtain more and more signals and store them. Therefore, how to use these measurement big data to improve the performance of state estimation has become a hot research issue in this field. This paper reviews the development of state estimation and future development trends. First, we review the model-based state estimation methods, including the Kalman filter, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc. Particle filters and Gaussian mixture filters that can handle mixed Gaussian noise are discussed, too. These methods have high requirements for models, while it is not easy to obtain accurate system models in practice. The emergence of robust filters, the interacting multiple model (IMM), and adaptive filters are also mentioned here. Secondly, the current research status of data-driven state estimation methods is introduced based on network learning. Finally, the main research results for hybrid filters obtained in recent years are summarized and discussed, which combine model-based methods and data-driven methods. This paper is based on state estimation research results and provides a more detailed overview of model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven approaches. The main algorithm of each method is provided so that beginners can have a clearer understanding. Additionally, it discusses the future development trends for researchers in state estimation.},

 abstract = {Model-based optimal control of soft robots may enable compliant, underdamped platforms to operate in a repeatable fashion and effectively accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible for soft robots. Unfortunately, developing accurate analytical dynamic models for soft robots is time-consuming, difficult, and error-prone. Deep learning presents an alternative modeling approach that only requires a time history of system inputs and system states, which can be easily measured or estimated. However, fully relying on empirical or learned models involves collecting large amounts of representative data from a soft robot in order to model the complex state space-a task which may not be feasible in many situations. Furthermore, the exclusive use of empirical models for model-based control can be dangerous if the model does not generalize well. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning methods with an existing first-principles model in order to improve overall performance for a sampling-based non-linear model predictive controller. We validate this approach on a soft robot platform and demonstrate that performance improves by 52{\%} on average when employing the combined model.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a real-time control framework for a snake robot with hyper-kinematic redundancy under dynamic active constraints for minimally invasive surgery. A proximity query (PQ) formulation is proposed to compute the deviation of the robot motion from predefined anatomical constraints. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to any snake robot represented as a set of control vertices. The proposed PQ formulation is implemented on a graphic processing unit, allowing for fast updates over 1 kHz. We also demonstrate that the robot joint space can be characterized into lower dimensional space for smooth articulation. A novel motion parameterization scheme in polar coordinates is proposed to describe the transition of motion, thus allowing for direct manual control of the robot using standard interface devices with limited degrees of freedom. Under the proposed framework, the correct alignment between the visual and motor axes is ensured, and haptic guidance is provided to prevent excessive force applied to the tissue by the robot body. A resistance force is further incorporated to enhance smooth pursuit movement matched to the dynamic response and actuation limit of the robot. To demonstrate the practical value of the proposed platform with enhanced ergonomic control, detailed quantitative performance evaluation was conducted on a group of subjects performing simulated intraluminal and intracavity endoscopic tasks.},

 abstract = {Modern learning models are characterized by large hyperparameter spaces and long training times. These properties, coupled with the rise of parallel computing and the growing demand to productionize machine learning workloads, motivate the need to develop mature hyperparameter optimization functionality in distributed computing settings. We address this challenge by first introducing a simple and robust hyperparameter optimization algorithm called ASHA, which exploits parallelism and aggressive early-stopping to tackle large-scale hyperparameter optimization problems. Our extensive empirical results show that ASHA outperforms existing state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods; scales linearly with the number of workers in distributed settings; and is suitable for massive parallelism, as demonstrated on a task with 500 workers. We then describe several design decisions we encountered, along with our associated solutions, when integrating ASHA in Determined AI's end-to-end production-quality machine learning system that offers hyperparameter tuning as a service.},

 abstract = {Today's use of large-scale industrial robots is enabling extraordinary achievement on the assembly line, but these robots remain isolated from the humans on the factory floor because they are very powerful, and thus dangerous to be around. In contrast, the soft robotics research community has proposed soft robots that are safe for human environments. The current state of the art enables the creation of small-scale soft robotic devices. In this article we address the gap between small-scale soft robots and the need for human-sized safe robots by introducing a new soft robotic module and multiple human-scale robot configurations based on this module. We tackle large-scale soft robots by presenting a modular and reconfigurable soft robotic platform that can be used to build fully functional and untethered meter-scale soft robots. These findings indicate that a new wave of human-scale soft robots can be an alternative to classic rigid-bodied robots in tasks and environments where humans and machines can work side by side with capabilities that include, but are not limited to, autonomous legged locomotion and grasping.},

 abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

 abstract = {Physics-inspired neural networks are proven to be an effective modeling method by giving more physically plausible results with less data dependency. However, their application in robotics is limited due to the non-conservative nature of robot dynamics and the difficulty in friction modeling. Moreover, these physics-inspired neural networks do not account for complex input matrices, such as those found in underactuated soft robots. This paper solves these problems by extending Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks by including dissipation and a simplified input matrix. Additionally, the loss function is processed using the Runge-Kutta algorithm, circumventing the inaccuracies and environmental susceptibility inherent in direct acceleration measurements. First, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via simulations of soft and rigid robots. Then, the proposed approach is validated experimentally in a tendon-driven soft robot and a Panda robot. The simulations and experimental results show that the modified neural networks can model different robots while the learned model enables decent anticipatory control.},

 abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics. One disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box representations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing knowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models, these black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well understood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these principles. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee physically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that combine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate Lagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated models adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The parameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the Euler-Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not require specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can be used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties were only obtained when using system identification techniques that require knowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics models and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body systems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models that can be applied to physical systems for real-time control. Compared to standard deep networks, the physics-inspired models learn better models and capture the underlying structure of the dynamics.},

 abstract = {Deep learning has achieved astonishing results on many tasks with large amounts of data and generalization within the proximity of training data. For many important real-world applications, these requirements are unfeasible and additional prior knowledge on the task domain is required to overcome the resulting problems. In particular, learning physics models for model-based control requires robust extrapolation from fewer samples - often collected online in real-time - and model errors may lead to drastic damages of the system. Directly incorporating physical insight has enabled us to obtain a novel deep model learning approach that extrapolates well while requiring fewer samples. As a first example, we propose Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) as a deep network structure upon which Lagrangian Mechanics have been imposed. DeLaN can learn the equations of motion of a mechanical system (i.e., system dynamics) with a deep network efficiently while ensuring physical plausibility. The resulting DeLaN network performs very well at robot tracking control. The proposed method did not only outperform previous model learning approaches at learning speed but exhibits substantially improved and more robust extrapolation to novel trajectories and learns online in real-time},

@article{Nabian.2021,
 abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep neural networks that are trained, using automatic differentiation, to compute the response of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The training of PINNs is simulation-free, and does not require any training dataset to be obtained from numerical PDE solvers. Instead, it only requires the physical problem description, including the governing laws of physics, domain geometry, initial/boundary conditions, and the material properties. This training usually involves solving a non-convex optimization problem using variants of the stochastic gradient descent method, with the gradient of the loss function approximated on a batch of collocation points, selected randomly in each iteration according to a uniform distribution. Despite the success of PINNs in accurately solving a wide variety of PDEs, the method still requires improvements in terms of computational efficiency. To this end, in this paper, we study the performance of an importance sampling approach for efficient training of PINNs. Using numerical examples together with theoretical evidences, we show that in each training iteration, sampling the collocation points according to a distribution proportional to the loss function will improve the convergence behavior of the PINNs training. Additionally, we show that providing a piecewise constant approximation to the loss function for faster importance sampling can further improve the training efficiency. This importance sampling approach is straightforward and easy to implement in the existing PINN codes, and also does not introduce any new hyperparameter to calibrate. The numerical examples include elasticity, diffusion and plane stress problems, through which we numerically verify the accuracy and efficiency of the importance sampling approach compared to the predominant uniform sampling approach.},

While it would provide the robotic systems with a high degree of autonomy, its effectiveness is limited by the complexity of this problem and by the necessity of special sensors (six-degrees of freedom force sensors). On the other hand, the control methodologies to be adopted for addressing this problem can be considered mature and well-assessed. All the known interaction control strategies (e.g., impedance, direct force control) are tackled and reshuffled in a geometrically consistent way for simplification of the task specification and enhancement of the execution performance. This book represents the first step towards the application of theoretical results at an industrial level; in fact each proposed control algorithm is experimentally tested here on an industrial robotic setup},

This book provides engineers and scientists in academia and industry with a thorough understanding of the underlying principles of nonlinear system identification. It equips them to apply the models and methods discussed to real problems with confidence, while also making them aware of potential difficulties that may arise in practice. Moreover, the book is self-contained, requiring only a basic grasp of matrix algebra, signals and systems, and statistics. Accordingly, it can also serve as an introduction to linear system identification, and provides a practical overview of the major optimization methods used in engineering. The focus is on gaining an intuitive understanding of the subject and the practical application of the techniques discussed. The book is not written in a theorem/proof style; instead, the mathematics is kept to a minimum, and the ideas covered are illustrated with numerous figures, examples, and real-world applications. In the past, nonlinear system identification was a field characterized by a variety of ad-hoc approaches, each applicable only to a very limited class of systems. With the advent of neural networks, fuzzy models, Gaussian process models, and modern structure optimization techniques, a much broader class of systems can now be handled. Although one major aspect of nonlinear systems is that virtually every one is unique, tools have since been developed that allow each approach to be applied to a wide variety of systems. .},

It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies.},

Furthermore, submersible robots usually do not have configurable components because of the need for sealed electronics and mechanical elements.

Variable stiffness is usually achieved by a jamming mechanism using layers, granules, or chain structures, through vacuum pressure or cable-driven mechanism due to its simple and rapid actuation. However, such jamming mechanisms are not suitable for actual robotic applications that require large supporting forces or drastic changes in stiffness. In this article, a hybrid jamming structure that combines granules and a rigid chain structure is proposed to simultaneously increase the average stiffness change in all directions and the maximum force in a certain direction. The improved performance of the proposed structure was compared to that of conventional granular and chain jamming structures. Based on the analytical model of the proposed structure, the principles for designing the hybrid jamming structure were derived and experimentally verified. Finally, based on the hybrid jamming structures, a multilink hybrid jamming structure was developed as a wearable system to assist the upper limbs and a robotic arm structure.},

The manipulator is composed of two identical modules (each of them can be controlled independently) with multi-directional bending and stiffening capabilities, like an octopus arm. In the authors' previous works, the design of the single module has been addressed. Here a two-module manipulator is presented, with the final aim of demonstrating the enhanced capabilities that such a structure can have in comparison with rigid surgical tools currently employed in MIS. The performances in terms of workspace, stiffening capabilities, and generated forces are characterized through experimental tests. The combination of stiffening capabilities and manipulation tasks is also addressed to confirm the manipulator potential employment in a real surgical scenario.},

However, mechanical and analytical models do not capture all aspects of a plant's intrinsic properties and there remain unmodeled dynamics due to varying parameters, unmodeled friction or soft materials. In this context, machine learning is an alternative suitable technique to extract non-linear plant models from data. However, fully data-based models suffer from inaccuracies as well and are inefficient if they include learning of well known analytical models. This paper thus argues that feed-forward control based on hybrid models comprising an analytical model and a learned error model can significantly improve modeling accuracy. Hybrid modeling here serves the purpose to combine the best of the two modeling worlds. The hybrid modeling methodology is described and the approach is demonstrated for two typical problems in robotics, i.e., inverse kinematics control and computed torque control. The former is performed for a redundant soft robot and the latter for a rigid industrial robot with redundant degrees of freedom, where a complete analytical model is not available for any of the platforms.},

In many important real-world applications, however, the two main modeling approaches often fail to meet requirements: first principles methods suffer from high bias, whereas data-driven modeling tends to have high variance. Additionally, purely data-based models often require large amounts of data and are often difficult to interpret. In this paper, we present physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations (PINODE), a hybrid model that combines the two modeling techniques to overcome the aforementioned problems. This new approach directly incorporates the equations of motion originating from the Lagrange mechanics into a deep neural network structure. Thus, we can integrate prior physics knowledge where it is available and use function approximation---e.g., neural networks---where it is not. The method is tested with a forward model of a real-world physical system with large uncertainties. The resulting model is accurate and data-efficient while ensuring physical plausibility.

With this, we demonstrate a method that beneficially merges physical insight with real data. Our findings are of interest for model-based control and system identification of mechanical systems.},

 abstract = {Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate precise, predictable robotic systems, which are easily modelled as rigid members connected at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials. This Review discusses recent developments in the emerging field of soft robotics.},

@article{Tan.2023,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel vehicle state estimation (VSE) method that combines a physics-informed neural network (PINN) and an unscented Kalman filter on manifolds (UKF-M). This VSE aimed to achieve inertial measurement unit (IMU) calibration and provide comprehensive information on the vehicle's dynamic state. The proposed method leverages a PINN to eliminate IMU drift by constraining the loss function with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, the UKF-M is used to estimate the 3D attitude, velocity, and position of the vehicle more accurately using a six-degrees-of-freedom vehicle model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN method can learn from multiple sensors and reduce the impact of sensor biases by constraining the ODEs without affecting the sensor characteristics. Compared to the UKF-M algorithm alone, our VSE can better estimate vehicle states. The proposed method has the potential to automatically reduce the impact of sensor drift during vehicle operation, making it more suitable for real-world applications.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces and validates a real-time dynamic predictive model based on a neural network approach for soft continuum manipulators. The presented model provides a real-time prediction framework using neural-network-based strategies and continuum mechanics principles. A time-space integration scheme is employed to discretize the continuous dynamics and decouple the dynamic equations for translation and rotation for each node of a soft continuum manipulator. Then the resulting architecture is used to develop distributed prediction algorithms using recurrent neural networks. The proposed RNN-based parallel predictive scheme does not rely on computationally intensive algorithms; therefore, it is useful in real-time applications. Furthermore, simulations are shown to illustrate the approach performance on soft continuum elastica, and the approach is also validated through an experiment on a magnetically-actuated soft continuum manipulator. The results demonstrate that the presented model can outperform classical modeling approaches such as the Cosserat rod model while also shows possibilities for being used in practice.},

@article{Thuruthel.2017,
 abstract = {The soft capabilities of biological appendages like the arms of Octopus vulgaris and elephants' trunks have inspired roboticists to develop their robotic equivalents. Although there have been considerable efforts to replicate their morphology and behavior patterns, we are still lagging behind in replicating the dexterity and efficiency of these biological systems. This is mostly due to the lack of development and application of dynamic controllers on these robots which could exploit the morphological properties that a soft-bodied manipulator possesses. The complexity of these high-dimensional nonlinear systems has deterred the application of traditional model-based approaches. This paper provides a machine learning-based approach for the development of dynamic models for a soft robotic manipulator and a trajectory optimization method for predictive control of the manipulator in task space. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a learned dynamic model and a derived task space controller for a soft robotic manipulator. The validation of the controller is carried out on an octopus-inspired soft manipulator simulation derived from a piecewise constant strain approximation and then experimentally on a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator. The results indicate that such an approach is promising for developing fast and accurate dynamic models for soft robotic manipulators while being applicable on a wide range of soft manipulators.},

 abstract = {We propose an effective and light-weight learning algorithm, Symplectic Taylor Neural Networks (Taylor-nets), to conduct continuous, long-term predictions of a complex Hamiltonian dynamic system based on sparse, short-term observations. At the heart of our algorithm is a novel neural network architecture consisting of two sub-networks. Both are embedded with terms in the form of Taylor series expansion designed with symmetric structure. The key mechanism underpinning our infrastructure is the strong expressiveness and special symmetric property of the Taylor series expansion, which naturally accommodate the numerical fitting process of the gradients of the Hamiltonian with respect to the generalized coordinates as well as preserve its symplectic structure. We further incorporate a fourth-order symplectic integrator in conjunction with neural ODEs' framework into our Taylor-net architecture to learn the continuous-time evolution of the target systems while simultaneously preserving their symplectic structures. We demonstrated the efficacy of our Taylor-net in predicting a broad spectrum of Hamiltonian dynamic systems, including the pendulum, the Lotka--Volterra, the Kepler, and the H{\'e}non--Heiles systems. Our model exhibits unique computational merits by outperforming previous methods to a great extent regarding the prediction accuracy, the convergence rate, and the robustness despite using extremely small training data with a short training period (6000 times shorter than the predicting period), small sample sizes, and no intermediate data to train the networks.},

 abstract = {Recent technological advances in surgery have resulted in the development of a range of new techniques that have reduced patient trauma, shortened hospitalization, and improved diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcome. Despite the many appreciated benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) compared to traditional approaches, there are still significant drawbacks associated with conventional MIS including poor instrument control and ergonomics caused by rigid instrumentation and its associated fulcrum effect. The use of robot assistance has helped to realize the full potential of MIS with improved consistency, safety and accuracy. The development of articulated, precision tools to enhance the surgeon's dexterity has evolved in parallel with advances in imaging and human-robot interaction. This has improved hand-eye coordination and manual precision down to micron scales, with the capability of navigating through complex anatomical pathways. In this review paper, clinical requirements and technical challenges related to the design of robotic platforms for flexible access surgery are discussed. Allied technical approaches and engineering challenges related to instrument design, intraoperative guidance, and intelligent human-robot interaction are reviewed. We also highlight emerging designs and research opportunities in the field by assessing the current limitations and open technical challenges for the wider clinical uptake of robotic platforms in MIS.},

 abstract = {Recent technological advances in surgery have resulted in the development of a range of new techniques that have reduced patient trauma, shortened hospitalization, and improved diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcome. Despite the many appreciated benefits of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) compared to traditional approaches, there are still significant drawbacks associated with conventional MIS including poor instrument control and ergonomics caused by rigid instrumentation and its associated fulcrum effect. The use of robot assistance has helped to realize the full potential of MIS with improved consistency, safety and accuracy. The development of articulated, precision tools to enhance the surgeon's dexterity has evolved in parallel with advances in imaging and human-robot interaction. This has improved hand-eye coordination and manual precision down to micron scales, with the capability of navigating through complex anatomical pathways. In this review paper, clinical requirements and technical challenges related to the design of robotic platforms for flexible access surgery are discussed. Allied technical approaches and engineering challenges related to instrument design, intraoperative guidance, and intelligent human-robot interaction are reviewed. We also highlight emerging designs and research opportunities in the field by assessing the current limitations and open technical challenges for the wider clinical uptake of robotic platforms in MIS.},

 abstract = {Snakes are a remarkable source of inspiration for mobile search-and-rescue robots. Their unique slender body structure and multiple modes of locomotion are well-suited to movement in narrow passages and other difficult terrain. The design, manufacturing, modeling, and control techniques of soft robotics make it possible to imitate the structure, mechanical properties, and locomotion gaits of snakes, opening up new possibilities in robotics research. Building on our track record of contributions in this area, this article presents a soft robotic snake made of modules that can actively deform in three-dimensional (3D) and rigorously studies its performance under a range of conditions, including gait parameters, number of modules, and differences in the environment. A soft 3D-printed wave spring sheath is developed to support the robot modules, increasing the snake's performance in climbing steps threefold. Finally, we introduce a simulator and a numerical model to provide a real-time simulation of the soft robotic snake. With the help of the real-time simulator, it is possible to develop and test new locomotion gaits for the soft robotic snake within a short period of time, compared with experimental trial and error. As a result, the soft robotic snake presented in this article is able to locomote on different surfaces, perform different bioinspired and custom gaits, and climb over steps.},

 abstract = {Modeling complex physical dynamics is a fundamental task in science and engineering. Traditional physics-based models are sample efficient, and interpretable but often rely on rigid assumptions. Furthermore, direct numerical approximation is usually computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise, and many real-world systems do not have fully-known governing laws. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, its predictions do not necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL, with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems. We also discuss the fundamental challenges and emerging opportunities in the area.},

@article{Wang.2021b,
 abstract = {Soft continuum robots have been accepted as a promising category of biomedical robots, accredited to the robots' inherent compliance that makes them safely interact with their surroundings. In its application of minimally invasive surgery, such a continuum concept shares the same view of robotization for conventional endoscopy/laparoscopy. Different from rigid-link robots with accurate analytical kinematics/dynamics, soft robots encounter modeling uncertainties due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which would deteriorate the model-based control performances. However, the trade-off between flexibility and controllability of soft manipulators may not be readily optimized but would be demanded for specific kinds of modeling approaches. To this end, data-driven modeling strategies making use of machine learning algorithms would be an encouraging way out for the control of soft continuum robots. In this article, we attempt to overview the current state of kinematic/dynamic model-free control schemes for continuum manipulators, particularly by learning-based means, and discuss their similarities and differences. Perspectives and trends in the development of new control methods are also investigated through the review of existing limitations and challenges.},

 abstract = {Modelling complex deformation for soft robotics provides a guideline to understand their behaviour, leading to safe interaction with the environment. However, building a surrogate model with high accuracy and fast inference speed can be challenging for soft robotics due to the nonlinearity from complex geometry, large deformation, material nonlinearity etc. The reality gap from surrogate models also prevents their further deployment in the soft robotics domain. In this study, we proposed a physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) named PINN-Ray to model complex deformation for a Fin Ray soft robotic gripper, which embeds the minimum potential energy principle from elastic mechanics and additional high-fidelity experimental data into the loss function of neural network for training. This method is significant in terms of its generalisation to complex geometry and robust to data scarcity as compared to other data-driven neural networks. Furthermore, it has been extensively evaluated to model the deformation of the Fin Ray finger under external actuation. PINN-Ray demonstrates improved accuracy as compared with Finite element modelling (FEM) after applying the data assimilation scheme to treat the sim-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduced our automated framework to design, fabricate soft robotic fingers, and characterise their deformation by visual tracking, which provides a guideline for the fast prototype of soft robotics.},

@misc{Yang.2018,
 abstract = {We consider the application of deep generative models in propagating uncertainty through complex physical systems. Specifically, we put forth an implicit variational inference formulation that constrains the generative model output to satisfy given physical laws expressed by partial differential equations. Such physics-informed constraints provide a regularization mechanism for effectively training deep probabilistic models for modeling physical systems in which the cost of data acquisition is high and training data-sets are typically small. This provides a scalable framework for characterizing uncertainty in the outputs of physical systems due to randomness in their inputs or noise in their observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a canonical example in transport dynamics.
