The state of the art for black-box learning is summarized, followed by an overview of hybrid-learning directions with a focus on physics-informed ML for (soft) robots. 
Our contributions and claims complete this section.
\subsection{Black-Box Learning}
Within soft robotics, data-driven approaches for control are still in their infancy**Raissi et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Arising in Biology and Medicine"**, with much progress having been made in recent years. 
In**Lagarde et al., "Control of a soft continuum robot using a feedforward neural network"**, \textit{feedforward neural networks} (NNs) were first applied to feedforward control of soft extensible continuum manipulators. 
Many works also use feedforward NNs for MPC, e.g., of a soft actuator with one degree of freedom (DoF)**Li et al., "Deep learning-based model predictive control for flexible robots"**, **Dianat et al., "Model Predictive Control for Soft Robots using Recurrent Neural Networks"** ,  and a six-DoF soft robot**Chu et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Network for Soft Robot Control: A Comparative Study"**.
In**MÃ¼ller et al., "Gaussian process regression for learning-based position and stiffness feedforward control of a soft actuator"**, Gaussian processes are trained to realize learning-based position and stiffness feedforward control of a soft actuator.

Nonlinear material behavior and friction cause hysteresis effects that can be captured using \textit{recurrent neural networks}**Hogan et al., "Learning the direct dynamics of a soft manipulator with nonlinear autoregressive exogenous models"**. 
These are used in**Dianat et al., "Model Predictive Control for Soft Robots using Recurrent Neural Networks"** to learn the direct dynamics of a soft manipulator with a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model. 
Only an open-loop predictive control policy was implemented, which was further developed in**Li et al., "Deep learning-based model predictive control for flexible robots"** for closed-loop control.
Data-driven MPC was successfully realized for a single actuator by using long short-term memory (LSTM) units**Ghosh et al., "Model predictive control of a soft robot using LSTM networks"** and for the ASR from Fig.~\ref{fig:cover}(b) via gated recurrent units (GRUs)**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"**.

Recording real-world data requires a lot of effort, and trained networks only achieve \textit{good accuracy within the seen data space}.
In case of system changes, training must be repeated with new data due to\textit{ poor extrapolation}. 
In addition, convergence is more difficult for high-dimensional NNs required to model multi-DoF robots. 
For this reason, the prediction of the entire state vector was not possible with the chosen network architecture and the existing data in**Lagarde et al., "Control of a soft continuum robot using a feedforward neural network"**.
Thus, only the velocity at the tip of the robot was predicted.
The authors of**Dianat et al., "Model Predictive Control for Soft Robots using Recurrent Neural Networks"** propose a method to model the entire state vector.

The authors of**Li et al., "Deep learning-based model predictive control for flexible robots"** use transfer learning to improve the performance of their network.
In this work, we extend existing work on PINNs for control to consider system changes after training, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cover}(b).

The authors of**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"** use GRUs to model the dynamics of a soft robot.
Their network is trained with data from only one domain and tested on unseen test domains.

In this work, we perform a systematic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) during the PINN training, which is often neglected due to excessive training times of several days.

Our work \textit{contributes} to this field: 
\textbf{1)}~A first-principles model of our ASR is derived and identified, which is very accurate, but the forward simulation requires significant computing time. 
This justifies the need for an alternative model approach with low computational cost during inference.
\textbf{2)}~For the first time, the original form of physics-informed neural networks -- introduced by Raissi et al.**Raissi et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Arising in Biology and Medicine"**, formulated for state-space modeling in**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"** -- is applied to a real multi-DoF soft robot.
This is especially relevant for model-based estimation/control, where \textit{models with low computational cost and high accuracy even for changed dynamics} are required.
\textbf{3)}~Generalizability is achieved by extending existing work on PINNs for control**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"** to consider system changes after training.
We perform a systematic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) during the PINN training, which is often neglected due to excessive training times of several days.
\textbf{4)}~Two hours of experimental data of the soft robot are used for evaluation, whereby the dynamics of the robot are changed. 
The proposed model is compared against the gold standard of both modeling worlds, namely a hyperparameter-optimized RNN**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"**, and an identified FP model, regarding prediction speed and accuracy.
\textbf{5)}~For the first time, learning-based MPC with PINNs is realized for multi-DoF soft robots and validated in several dynamic real-world experiments, including comparison with a baseline controller.
\textbf{6)}~The whole codebase for learning and control is published as open source**Falotico et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Control: A Perspective"**, for possible applications beyond soft robotics. 
All datasets are also available to enable reproducibility.

In sum, we make \textit{three claims}: 
First, our surrogate model outperforms an accurate physics-driven model in terms of prediction speed by orders of magnitude with only slightly reduced accuracy.
Second, by incorporating physical knowledge during training, the PINN achieves higher prediction accuracies and generalization to out-of-distribution data compared to a recurrent neural network**Kumar et al., "Soft Robotics Using Gated Recurrent Units"**.
Throughout this article, all models receive data from only one domain during training/identification and are tested in unseen test domains, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cover}(b).
Third, accurate learning-based nonlinear MPC with PINNs is enabled for different soft-robot dynamics without the need of retraining the system model or retuning the controller.
This is intended to represent one practical scenario with high demands on prediction speed and accuracy. 
All claims are proven experimentally.
