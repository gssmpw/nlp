\textbf{[User]:}\\

Please split the following math problem-solving text according to logical 
steps, generating a JSON object where each step is an independent key-value 
pair in the format `\{\{ "Step X": "Content of the step" \}\}`, where `X` is the step number. Note:\\

\# Rules:\\
1. Retain the original text for each step without any modifications, additions, or deletions, only splitting based on logical steps.\\
2. If the text does not contain explicit step indications, split the steps according to the logical flow of the content. Each step should have a conclusion progression relative to the previous step and represent a complete intermediate conclusion (e.g., equations, intermediate results, planning thoughts, etc.).\\
3. The final output should be a JSON object containing each logical step.\\
