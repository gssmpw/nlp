\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various areas, such as text generation and code synthesis. However, the reliability of performance evaluation has come under scrutiny due to data contamination—the unintended overlap between training and test datasets. 
%This overlap is inclined to artificially inflate model metrics given that LLMs are trained on vast publicly scraped datasets, which are prone to overlap with test benchmarks. 
This overlap has the potential to artificially inflate model performance, as LLMs are typically trained on extensive datasets scraped from publicly available sources. These datasets often inadvertently overlap with the benchmarks used for evaluation, leading to an overestimation of the models' true generalization capabilities.
In this paper,
%benchmarks and lifecycle, 
we first examine the definition and impacts of data contamination. 
%and explore the consequences it has on the evaluation of LLMs. 
Secondly, we review methods for contamination-free evaluation, focusing on three strategies: data updating-based methods, data rewriting-based methods, and prevention-based methods. Specifically, we highlight dynamic benchmarks and LLM-driven evaluation methods. Finally, we categorize contamination detecting methods based on model information dependency: white-Box, gray-Box, and black-Box detection approaches. Our survey highlights the requirements for more rigorous evaluation protocols and proposes future directions for addressing data contamination challenges.

\section{Limitations}
While we extensively cover various forms of data contamination, it is possible that new contamination mechanisms or models may not be fully captured in our analysis. Additionally, our focus is primarily on data contamination within the context of LLMs, and we may not have fully incorporated previous research on data contamination in other areas of machine learning.
