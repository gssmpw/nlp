\caption{Parallels Between Survey Responses and LLM Behavior}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.3\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Survey Phenomenon} & \textbf{LLM Parallel} & \textbf{Satisficing Interventions} \\
\hline
Response order effects (primacy, recency) in visual or oral surveys & 
Position/token bias when the model is repeatedly presented with the same label ordering & 
Option randomization to vary the sequence of answer choices \\
\hline
Attention checks and reverse-coded items to ensure consistency & 
Checking consistency across rephrased or negated prompts to detect ``lazy'' or contradictory LLM outputs & 
Reverse validation: Require logical coherence despite altered wording \\
\hline
Framing/context effects: subtle shifts in question wording & 
LLMs can exhibit sensitivity to small changes in prompt context, often yielding superficial or inconsistent answers & 
Position randomization to disrupt any fixed interpretation route \\
