received the Graduate degree in computer sciences from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in biorobotics with the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA), Pisa, Italy, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in cognitive sciences from the University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France, in 2013.
He is currently an Assistant Professor with The BioRobotics Institute, SSSA, Pontedera, Italy. He is the author or coauthor of more than 100 international peer-reviewed papers and he regularly serves as a reviewer for more than ten international ISI journals. He served as PI for SSSA in EU-funded projects (Human Brain Project, Proboscis, Growbot), focusing on the development of brain-inspired algorithms for robot control and on machine learning models for soft robot control. His research interests focus on neurorobotics, i.e., the implementation of brain models from neuroscience in robots.
