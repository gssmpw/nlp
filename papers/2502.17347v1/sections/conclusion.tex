This work presented a novel perspective on modeling \acp{CSR} by leveraging the Fourier transform within the framework of \ac{CRT}. By treating the backbone of the robot as a spatial signal, we provided a compact and efficient representation of its deformation, offering a unifying approach to existing modeling strategies. The application of the Fourier transform enhances the understanding of traditional heuristic methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of a data-driven methodology for selecting the optimal model in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

The proposed framework was validated through both numerical simulations and real-world experiments, confirming its effectiveness in reducing the degrees of freedom while preserving accuracy.

For future work, the spatial spectrum can be applied to both model-based and learning-based controllers as a dense representation of the robot's deformation. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the system's frequency response could lead to the development of an identification algorithm.
