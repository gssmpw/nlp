As outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:spatial_ft} and \ref{sec:space_time_ft}, meaningful insights into the strain field can be derived from both the spatial \eqref{eq:continous_spatial_fourier_transform} and space-time \eqref{eq:space_time_ft} spectra.
This section presents a data-driven approach for extracting the \ac{SFT} and \ac{STFT}, directly from the real-world robots. 
This method only requires knowledge of the robot's length and is independent of its physical parameters.
The proposed procedure consists of the steps exposed below and summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:procedure}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Sensorization}: The first step is to sensorize the \ac{CSR}, in order to measure the samples $\bm{\xi}(n \lambda_s)$. The choice of $\lambda_s$ is crucial as it determines the maximum spatial frequency of the sampled spectrum, i.e., $\nu_s / 2$.
    
    \item \textit{Motor Babbling}: Standard signals are applied to the actuators $\bm{\tau}(t)$. Common signals in identification literature include step, chirp, and white noise, thanks to their properties in frequency.
    As a result, samples $\bm{\xi}(n \lambda_s, \, m T_s)$ are obtained, where $T_s$ represents the sampling period of the sensing framework.

    \item \textit{Compute Spectra}: From the samples $\bm{\xi}(n \lambda_s, \, m T_s)$, we compute a time-series of the \ac{SFT} and \ac{STFT} using the \acf{FFT} algorithm. Before this, preprocessing techniques like zero-padding can be applied to improve the resolution of the \ac{FFT}.

    \item \textit{Spectrum Analysis}: From $\bm{\Xi}(jk, \, j \omega)$ we can identify $k_{\textnormal{max}}$ and the shape of the spatial spectrum, which aids in selecting the optimal basis functions. 
    Furthermore, we can derive key dynamic characteristics of the system, such as resonance or anti-resonance phenomena.
    
    \item \textit{Modeling}: 
    Based on the information gathered, the user can determine the minimum number of sections into which the robot can be divided, thereby reducing the need for extensive sensorization ($k_{\textnormal{max}} < \frac{k_s}{2}$). 
    Additionally, optimal basis functions can be extracted using well-established signal processing algorithms such as \ac{MP} \cite{mallat1993matching} or \ac{BPD} \cite{chen2001atomic}.
\end{enumerate}

Viewing strain as a signal offers new insights into the frequency domain of motor babbling \cite{george2020first}. Since standard signals (e.g., white noise) can sample all frequencies in the spectrum, motor babbling can be interpreted as a method for exploring the robot's space-time spectrum. This aligns with the classic definition of motor babbling, where random actuations are applied to the robot to sample its workspace \cite{george2020first}.
