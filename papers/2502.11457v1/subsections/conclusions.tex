\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we target ESL learners as audiences for text simplification aiming to facilitate the learning process of the foreign language. 
Referring to the input hypothesis and frequency effect theory in L2 learning, we propose a reinforcement learning method on LLM to control the simplification model to generate outputs that satisfy the vocabulary and sentence level constraints. 
Experiment results show that the proposed method can increase the target vocabulary coverage in the generated simplifications, and human evaluation results confirmed that the simplified texts generally preserve the targeted CEFR levels. 

In practice, different individuals have varied levels of knowledge for the language. 
We plan to extend the method to generate individual learner-targeted personalized simplifications in the future.
