\subsection{Encoding heuristic cost function as HUBO}\label{subsection:heuristic_cost_function}

While constructing the cost objective that encodes the optimal solution for the left-deep join order selection problem adds valuable precision, it can require computational resources as complexity increases. Thus, we have modified the cost function generation. We have included a greedy heuristic in the HUBO construction process (Alg.~\ref{alg:hubo_term_construction}) to include only those higher-order terms that are likely to introduce the most negligible cost to the total cost function.

The idea behind the heuristic is the following. First, we again include all the rank $0$ terms. When we start including rank $1$ terms, we consider only those rank $0$ terms whose cardinality (i.e., the coefficient in the HUBO objective) is minimal. We have included a tunable hyperparameter $n$ that selects $n$ terms with the smallest coefficients. Then, the HUBO construction continues with the selected subset of terms. With this heuristic, the size of the optimization problem is reduced remarkably, although we lose the guarantee of finding the optimal plan. 

The algorithm for this generation is almost identical to Alg.~\ref{alg:hubo_term_construction} except that line 7 should be changed from the current version to include only those table configurations with the minimum coefficient in the cost HUBO. In other words, we change line 7 to be ''$n$ many tables associated with rank $r - 1$ variable with the smallest coefficients''. We will later prove that this formulation produces at least as good a plan as the classical greedy algorithm and likely produces better for larger values $n$.
