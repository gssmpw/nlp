\subsection{Cost-function independent validity}\label{subsubsection:cost_function_independent}

Although validity constraint \eqref{eq:hubo_combinations} is theoretically correct, it produces higher-degree terms due to exponentiation to the power of two, which we might want to avoid. Hence, we develop join tree validity constraints independently from the cost function. Notably, these validity constraints are often quadratic, i.e., QUBOs, and automatically supported by many solvers. Because we develop the theory considering the query graph's structure, we have slightly different constraints depending on the query graphs.
