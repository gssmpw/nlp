\section{Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms}

The dynamic programming and greedy algorithms implemented here are based on \cite{Neumann_course}. Dynamic programming for join order selection comprises a general class of approaches to optimize the join order selection. In our work, we have fixed the cost function (Eq.~\eqref{eq:cost_function}) and employed the dynamic programming algorithm with and without cross-products. The algorithm without cross-products is presented in Alg.~\ref{alg:dp-join-order}. It relies on functions that create left-deep trees for trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ and return costs for join trees based on the cost function in Eq.~\eqref{eq:cost_function}.

The algorithm that computes the dynamic programming result without cross-products is similar except that for a query graph $G$, we change line 6: \textbf{for} connected subgraph $\subset G$ such that $|\text{subgraph}| = s - 1$ \textbf{do}. Then, the algorithm proceeds with the connected subgraphs of size $s - 1$ instead of all subsets of size $s - 1$.

The greedy algorithm is the other standard algorithm to optimize join order selection, and we represent it in Alg.~\ref{alg:greedy-join-order}. Similarly to the dynamic programming algorithm, we can consider only solutions without cross-products so that we iterate only over tables connected to one of the tables already joined. In other words, at each step, we compute a value called adjacent\_tables which contains those tables $R_i$ so that if edge $(R_i, R_j) \in G$ in the query graph $G$, then we require that $R_i \notin \text{joined\_tables}$ but $R_j \in \text{joined\_tables}$.
