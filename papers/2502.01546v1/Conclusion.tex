\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a constrained RL-based controller for dynamically moving and reorienting objects with a mobile manipulator. The controller was extensively tested on hardware and was found to solve the task successfully. The generated motion behaviors are characterized by online contact switching and robustness concerning unknown objects of different mass, size, and shape on a high friction floor. The rate of toppled objects is reduced through an appropriate object balance constraint. By only relying on object pose information, the controller changes the object pushing location to lower for thin objects that may topple. Future directions include adding memory to the policy architecture and using an on-board solution for the perception of the objects.
