\title{OCCULT: Evaluating Large Language Models for Offensive Cyber Operation Capabilities}

% \begin{abstract}
% Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable aptitude for synthesizing knowledge, analyzing code and employing software, leading to concerns about potential misuse in enabling autonomous or AI-assisted offensive cyber operations (OCO).

\section{Introduction}
 \label{sec:introduction}
 
The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in synthesizing knowledge, analyzing code, and utilizing software have raised concerns about their potential for misuse in various critical domains when in service to their users. One concern is that LLMs may enable autonomous or AI-assisted offensive cyber operations. Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) have often historically required highly educated computer operators, multidisciplinary teams, mature targeting and development processes, and a heavily resourced sponsoring organization to viably execute at scale and to a mission effect. This is due to the nature of OCO, in that it is vast, extremely interdisciplinary, non-static, and often more of an art than a science.
% Offensive cyber tactics, techniques \& procedures (TTPs) are often evolving, transitory, and multi-faceted. This operating reality had previously restricted the use of AI in OCO to only smaller tasks or sub-components. Recently, with the ongoing advancement of LLM development (with no end in sight) as well as the growth of novel LLM/AI enabled OCO systems, keen cyber defenders and policy makers are wondering if LLMs are the game changer required to enable autonomous OCO in real-world cyber-attacks.
Offensive cyber tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are often evolving, transitory, and multi-faceted. This operating reality, which had previously restricted the use of AI in OCO to smaller tasks or sub-components, is changing with the advancement of LLM development and the growth of novel LLM/AI-enabled OCO systems. Today, cyber defenders and policy makers are wondering if LLMs are the game changer that will enable autonomous OCO in real-world cyber-attacks.

To mitigate the potential risk that autonomous and even semi-autonomous AI-enabled OCO systems could pose, we must be able to evaluate the true capabilities of any emerging OCO AI rigorously and swiftly. As with any field with the depth and breadth of cyber security, simply testing knowledge recall or memory is insufficient \cite{li2024wmdpbenchmarkmeasuringreducing, roberts2020much}. Instead, the application of OCO capabilities requires knowledge and domain models, information synthesis, perception of environment/state, action and solution spaces, and use of tools and intelligence generalization. In short, rigorous testing for OCO capability that currently poses a real risk is not a trivial task. This has been repeatedly shown in many existing efforts aimed at soliciting and measuring OCO capabilities in LLMs (see\textbf{~\ref{sec:related_work} Related Work} section). Existing assessments frequently fall short in accurately estimating and quantifying OCO risks as they tend to focus on evaluating model performance using general cyber security tasks, simple knowledge retrieval, or ambiguous offensive scenarios that do not fully capture the offensive cyber landscape. Furthermore, the effective tests that do exist offer piecemeal testing, asymmetrically probing for only a fraction of the total spectrum of OCO capabilities. While this is to be expected, given the large size of the OCO domain, a comprehensive methodology is needed to organize and contextualize any LLM test under one framework.
 
Our research team has created just such a light methodology and evaluation framework (known as OCCULT) for designing rigorous and repeatable evaluations that can quantify the unique, plausible cyber security risks associated with an LLM used in OCO. The following provides a general outline of the paper and our key contributions:

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

%While many open-source LLM benchmarks exist today relating to the cybersecurity domain, including Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges \cite{tann2023CTF}, Hack-the-Box, Penetration Testing, and certification/accreditation exams \cite{alam2024ctibench}, these LLM cyber tests largely evaluate a model's ability to be little more than a knowledge source of current cyber defense knowledge and cyber threat intelligence. While testing that a given LLM can reliably produce meaningful cyber domain knowledge when implemented as a resource for cyber workforce training or question and answer "copilots", these evaluations lack the comprehensiveness to methodically evaluate offensive cyber capabilities that are grounded in real-world scenarios and well quantified.

%Benchmarks also often tend to use other LLMs as the basis for evaluation of a test (CyberSecEval 1\&2\&3, etc.) which is not a clear indicator of the usefulness or risk of the LLM from a cyber operator perspective - we would rather see clearly defined metrics that are meaningful to an operator that map back to a taxonomy such as ATT\&CK i.e pinpointing exact risks of an OCO capability such as understanding of an APT’s suite of preferred tactics.

%Project Naptime most closely aligns with our evaluation ideology: to include high-fidelity simulation and emulation, where open-source tools (give example) can be utilized by the LLM with interactivity from the environment that is near equivalency to real-world expected outputs. Some open-source simulation tools like CyBench \cite{zhang2024cybench} incorporate structured CTF-style evaluations where the LLM acts as an operator on a terminal, however, these types of simulations lack the operational flow, courses of action and toolkit selection that real operators leverage for offensive cyber operations. Additionally, our simulation and emulation platforms provide the flexibility and fidelity for an LLM to iteratively reason to and through an environment as a human operator would.


\subsection{Capture-the-Flag (CTF) Evaluations and Benchmarks for LLMs} 

To date, the most widely used approach to evaluate LLMs for OCO, cyber-attack, red teaming, or penetration testing capabilities is the use of cyber security Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges or tasks. System architectures and integration details vary, but the core approach is to interface the LLM under test (through its prompt API) to CTF challenge environments and ask the LLM to complete the given challenge by interacting (via terminal or shell connection) with the challenge environment. This evaluation approach is highly attractive as CTF challenge corpuses are large and widely available, are highly codified and measurable, and have a (relatively) strong analog to real OCO when compared to other evaluation approaches. \textit{PentestGPT} \cite{deng2023pentestgpt}, \textit{CyberSecEval 3} \cite{wan2024cyberseceval}, Google DeepMind's LLM evaluations \cite{phuong2024evaluating}, \textit{PenHeal} \cite{huang2024penheal}, \textit{AutoAttacker} \cite{xu2024autoattacker}, \textit{Cybench} \cite{zhang2024cybenchframeworkevaluatingcybersecurity}, \textit{EnIGMA} \cite{abramovich2024enigma}, \textit{InterCode-CTF} \cite{yang2023language}, \textit{3CB} \cite{anurin2024catastrophic}, and others \cite{shao2024empirical} \cite{tann2023CTF} use CTF benchmarks as a means for LLM evaluation. Some efforts, notably \textit{CyberSecEval 3} \cite{wan2024cyberseceval}, also use CTFs to evaluate OCO operator uplift, i.e., evaluating whether a human operator,  when given an LLM as a tool/resource, performs better at the CTF challenge. In our view, and as detailed in later sections, this form of ``copilot" test is a more appropriate evaluation given an attacker profile/paradigm.

It must be noted that not all the challenges from CTFs are universally accepted as accurate comparisons to real-world OCO environments. Some challenges are more realistic than others and thus have more important real-world implications for cyber security. For example, aspects of gamification, discrete state transitions, and scoped boundaries often preclude challenges from being a true analog to real environments. There have been efforts to further reduce this gap in evaluation. In \cite{happe2024llms} and \cite{ happe2024got}, an explicitly scoped benchmark for Linux privilege escalation (priv-esc) vulnerabilities is established. The benchmark is relatively small (15 tasks), but each priv-esc task is the exact analog of a real-world priv-esc vulnerability. Additionally, the evaluation environment is stripped of any explicit gamification. In \textit{CyberSecEval 3} \cite{wan2024cyberseceval}, a larger cyber range evaluation is created to allow for a more end-to-end ransomware emulation scenario to play out via the attacking LLM agent. End-to-end cyber-attack evaluation scenarios are generally more difficult and resource intensive, hence their lower occurrence in existing efforts.


\subsection{Multiple Choice and Free Response Tests}

In addition to the use of CTFs, one approach frequently seen in the research community is the use of benchmarks consisting of multiple-choice questions. Cyber benchmarking directly taken from general LLM benchmark approaches \cite{chang2024survey} is attractive. Not only is it measurable, but it also allows for the synthetic generation of question corpuses, providing greater scale. \textit{CyberSecEval} \cite{bhatt2023purple}, \textit{CyberMetric} \cite{tihanyi2024cybermetric}, \textit{SecEval} \cite{li2023comprehensive}, \textit{SecQA} \cite{liu2023secqa}, and \cite{tann2023CTF} all use multiple choice question benchmarks. Approaches to question generation and question subject/domains may vary among efforts. For example, \textit{CyberSecEval} \cite{bhatt2023purple} generates questions via templating and combinatorial expansions of pre-made cyber security question fragments and generative LLM augmentation. \textit{SecEval} \cite{li2023comprehensive} uses an LLM with prompts from textbooks, system documentation, technology guidelines, and industrial standards to generate multiple choice questions. However, attention must be given to the actual content and validity of the benchmark questions, whether generated or not. For example, in the \textit{CyberMetric} \cite{tihanyi2024cybermetric} CyberMetric-2000 benchmark, a stated cyber security benchmark, there are out-of-scope questions concerning contract law and the motivations of terrorism, as well as an incorrect question/answer pair that assert the ``ideal approach to securing an infrastructure" is ``developing a plan to address the business needs of the organization" over the clearly more correct answers of ``implementing a hierarchical strategy to identify assets and threats" and ``identifying vulnerabilities, threats, and countermeasures."

Alternatively, \textit{CyberSecEval} \cite{bhatt2023purple} uses free response question benchmarks where LLM responses are free form text. For evaluation of this benchmark, \textit{CyberSecEval} uses an additional LLM (not the one under test) to evaluate whether responses are effectively malicious (i.e., respond effectively to a question prompt for aiding with a malicious cyber-attack request/question). As the authors note, this metric is not perfect and is indicative of the challenge of deterministically evaluating free response benchmarks at scale.


In short, there are two major concerns with multiple choice question benchmarks. First, there is the challenge of creating multiple choice question benchmarks that contain effective questions that cannot be memorized or gamified and are related to the actual domain of evaluation. Second, with regards to evaluating LLMs for OCO capabilities, there is the debate on whether multiple choice questions serve as an appropriate proxy or indication of real offensive cyber capabilities. In later sections we detail a novel improvement for OCO multiple choice benchmarks that addresses some of these concerns.


\subsection{Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation}

Although vulnerability identification and exploitation are often included within individual challenges in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions, they are increasingly emerging as a distinct benchmark category. The purpose of these evaluations is to assess whether LLMs can demonstrate performance in analyzing static code or running software for vulnerabilities. Some efforts take this evaluation further and when a vulnerability is found, proceed to challenge the LLM to then create exploit implementations for exploiting the vulnerability for effect. \textit{CyberSecEval 2} \cite{bhatt2024cyberseceval} and \textit{Project Naptime} \cite{glazunov2024project} uses \textit{CyberSecEval 2}'s synthetic code samples, which contain vulnerabilities, for evaluating LLMs. \textit{Project Naptime} \cite{glazunov2024project} augments LLM's under test with additional tooling integrations to include a code browser, Python interpreter, and debugger to evaluate for improved performance against the benchmark. Google DeepMind's frontier model evaluation effort \cite{phuong2024evaluating} tests for classifying security patches and identifying vulnerable code/functions. \textit{eyeballvul} \cite{chauvin2024eyeballvul} consists of a continuously updated benchmark of a large repository of open-source software versions and known vulnerabilities, which can be used to evaluate LLM’s against. The scalability and breadth of these approaches is promising.

Alternatively to static code analysis benchmarks, \textit{LLM Agents can Autonomously Exploit One-day Vulnerabilities} \cite{fang2024llm_od} and \textit{LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites} \cite{fang2024llm}  emulate vulnerable websites and applications for targeting by LLMs under test. These benchmarks are smaller, but the test cases are live systems and applications. While not a benchmark or evaluation suite, \textit{Vulnhuntr} \cite{vulnhuntr} is an LLM-enabled system that analyzes Python code (and function tracing) for vulnerabilities in open-source code bases; to date, it has found dozens of exploitable vulnerabilities. Lastly, there is the ongoing DARPA Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) \cite{aixcc} competition to create LLM-enabled systems for finding and patching vulnerable code at scale. To our knowledge, the evaluation approaches that the performers (i.e., the project teams that execute the research and development) are using to test their systems have not been made public as the competition is still ongoing at time of publication.


The primary challenges to vulnerability identification and exploit benchmarks are determining whether the LLM under test is memorizing versus reasoning and generalizing when they do actually find vulnerabilities. The latter indicates a much greater risk.


\subsection{LLM/AI Systems} 

By necessity, each of the aforementioned evaluation efforts have developed an LLM-enabled system (or as more generally referred to, an AI system) to actuate and evaluate the model under test. Some of these systems are very lightweight, designed to merely support the action and observation loop between the LLM agent and the evaluation: examples include \textit{Cybench}\cite{zhang2024cybenchframeworkevaluatingcybersecurity} and \textit{InterCode-CTF} \cite{yang2023language}. Other LLM systems maintain a moderate set of scaffolding and integrated functionality, to include \textit{Vulnhuntr} \cite{vulnhuntr} and \textit{AutoAttacker} \cite{xu2024autoattacker}. And, in line with a natural progression, are heavy weight LLM systems that may have extensive technology or tool interfaces, i.e., Agent Computer Interfaces (ACIs) \cite{yang2024swe}; multiple LLMs/models for different functionality purposes; larger sub-components for observation parsing \& summarizing, reasoning/planning over action selection and sequences; and ad-hoc human feedback. \textit{PentestGPT} \cite{deng2023pentestgpt}, \textit{Project Naptime} \cite{glazunov2024project}, \textit{EnIGMA} \cite{abramovich2024enigma}, and most recently the multi-stage attack LLM interface, \textit{Incalmo} \cite{incalmo}, are examples of these growing and larger LLM agent systems. Furthermore, \textit{Project Naptime} \cite{glazunov2024project} and \textit{EnIGMA} \cite{abramovich2024enigma} are examples of what will become the paradigm in LLM systems: having standard, effective, and tight integrations with programming interpreters, debuggers, code analyzers, web APIs and task management.


\subsection{OCCULT Goals}

In the context of existing OCO LLM evaluation efforts, the goal of this work is to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Inform on and unify the methodology for effective and scalable OCO LLM testing,  providing hard evidentiary results that ultimately lead to clear, open-source risk implications. 
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Evolve testing towards breadth of coverage on OCO capability areas that are most concerning to the community and/or represent large remaining gaps in coverage. \
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Improve standardization, shareability, and tooling of LLM OCO evaluation benchmarks. \
\end{itemize}

In our view, without meaningful progress on these points, OCO LLM evaluations will remain fragmented, non-comprehensive, and incapable of keeping pace with the exponential creation and proliferation of LLMs.
The OCCULT methodology aims to provide a more realistic and standardized testing, which allows for better comparisons across models, training datasets, and user approaches. Our work also strives to assess how LLMs compare not just to each other, but to the humans that currently perform in the roles those models aim to replace.


\section{LLM Evaluation Methodology}

This section is broken down into two parts. First, we detail the core tenets of our evaluation philosophy, which drove the design of the evaluation methodology. Then we define our evaluation methodology.

\subsection{Evaluation Philosophy}

Given our team's analysis of the moving state-of-the-art and near-peer research efforts with respect to evaluating LLM's for OCO capabilities, we have formed a set of tenets that we believe must drive the development of any test or framework for serious and useful LLM evaluation \footnote{We have found that our tenets are similar in philosophy and have some overlap with \textit{Project Naptime}'s proposed principles \cite{glazunov2024project}.}:\newline

\textbf{Tenet 1: Tests must be grounded in open-source OCO capability categories and LLM use cases.}
\newline

Any test for determining the presence of a given OCO capability in an LLM must be for a \textit{true} OCO capability and apply a \textit{real} use case of the LLM. Our team found a proliferation of ``LLM cyber tests" that have only a vague declaration of the OCO capability under test and/or an unfounded LLM use case offensive cyber scenario. Our team perceives that such tests are simply easier to implement and avoid niche, and often sensitive, OCO use cases. However, there is a distinct difference between standard cyber defense practices from that of OCO practices. A strong example of a well-scoped benchmark for a real-world OCO capability area is \cite{happe2024llms, happe2024got} where the benchmark is solely for Linux privilege escalation exploits.\newline


\textbf{Tenet 2: Tests that lend themselves to more dynamic problem sets, less memorization, and multi-step action/decision sequences are inherently more valuable than static, low-context, retrieval styled problem sets for evaluating the true OCO risk of a LLM.}
\newline

A corollary directly following from Tenet 1 and the nature of the OCO domain is that testing for OCO capabilities is hard. OCO, as a domain, is vast, interdisciplinary, and non-static. Offensive cyber TTPs are often evolving, transitory, and multi-faceted. If tests for LLMs can operate within those (hard) parameters, they will be more indicative of real OCO capability and have a longer utility half-life.\newline

\textbf{Tenet 3: Test metrics that codify a progressive spectrum of OCO performance and can track the evolution of specific OCO capabilities of an LLM under test are of significantly more utility to informing cyber defense than binary (i.e. success/fail) metrics; especially when the test is an advanced use case.}
\newline

In short, test performance metrics that allow for tracking progression of an OCO capability, as well as mapping directly to corresponding implications for cyber defense practices, are ideal. The latter aspect is necessary for test results to be interpreted and applied for actual defensive effect. A metric should inform defensive operators as to what specifically the LLM can \textit{do} with respect to real-world OCO TTPs. A strong example of a test metric that shows progression is the subtask performance metric found in \textit{Cybench’s} Capture-the-Flag (CTF) LLM evaluations (found in Table 7 of that paper), especially when compared to the binary (pass/fail) metrics (in Table 6 of that paper) of the same evaluations \cite{zhang2024cybench}. Furthermore, \textit{Cybench} uses guidance to help solicit and measure partial LLM performance at OCO tasks. As outlined in later sections, some of our tests also critically use guidance to be able to measure progressive LLM performance.\newline

\textbf{Tenet 4: Where possible, the evaluation API must be standardized, modular, and scalable.}
\newline

This tenet is critical to mitigate the vastness of the OCO capability domain and the speed at which the OCO domain evolves, as well as the exponential proliferation of LLMs. In our view, the current landscape of LLM OCO evaluation is so fragmented that testing and benchmarks are not prone to modularity, interchangeability, and continuous execution. In the long term, our industry needs to unify and standardize OCO benchmarking to allow for the scale and efficiency required to meet the needs of  the cyber security community at large. \newline


\subsection{Methodology}

Our high-level evaluation methodology is aimed at driving and encompassing OCO evaluation tests for LLMs. In our methodology, all tests fall along three dimensions that clarify their target purpose and associated performance implications. The dimensions are \textit{OCO Capability Areas}, \textit{LLM Use Cases} and \textit{Reasoning Power}. The conceptual view of the OCCULT LLM Evaluation Methodology can be seen in  \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:method_concept}}.

\begin{figure*}

\includegraphics[width=11cm, height=8cm]{images/shrike_method_concept.png}
\caption{Conceptual view of the OCCULT LLM Evaluation Methodology for OCO.}
\label{fig:method_concept}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{OCO Capability Areas}

The first dimension of the OCCULT evaluation methodology is the OCO capability area (i.e. skill or competency) of any given test. Simply put, any test for capabilities found in an LLM must be specific as to what exact OCO capabilities are being solicited and evaluated for. When creating a test for an OCO capability, it should: (1) explicitly identify the capability of OCO being evaluated, (2) ensure that the OCO capability under test is an actual, real-world OCO capability/skill area, and (3) map/catalogue tests to cyber security frameworks, where possible.

Cyber security, and specifically the domain of OCO, has grown into a vast discipline, constituting dozens of different disciplines and sub-disciplines. The ATT\&CK\textsuperscript{\textregistered} \cite{strom2018mitre} knowledge base, while not designed to be a 100\% match for all OCO disciplines and sub-disciplines as it is oriented to defensive operators, provides for a large percentage of coverage and currently maintains 14 offensive cyber tactics and over 200 offensive cyber techniques. Thus, any OCO test for an LLM should detail and scope to the specific OCO capability under test. Furthermore, the OCO capability the test is evaluating should be a \textit{real} OCO capability area, or a close proxy. Often, the TTPs of OCO, cyber red/blue/purple teaming, penetration testing, security control validation, and compliance checking are all conflated and taken to be interchangeable. While there is overlap among these sibling domains, they are not the same. For example, a hypothetical OCO test for LLMs that allows for a penetration testing style scenario, where stealth and noisiness of the actions is not incorporated into the performance metric, is not a realistic analog to real-world OCO.

Lastly, given the current paradigm of cyber defense in which common and standardized practice calls for highly structured cyber threat intelligence, attacker TTP modeling, security control mapping, and extensive vulnerability codification, it would be incongruous to provide OCO results from LLM evaluations without some form of link to cyber defense practice and application. As mentioned previously, and as is noted in later sections, our team frequently uses ATT\&CK by default for labeling the OCO capability categories of tests. For some test cases, aligning to existing cyber security frameworks may not be a perfect fit; however, effort should be taken to make any test result directly consumable and applicable to cyber defense practices. For an explicit example of mapping to OCCULT tests/benchmarks to a cyber security framework, see \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:TACTL}}. Another cyber-attack framework is the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain \cite{lockeedCKC}. Categories of OCO capabilities may also be drawn from other sources, to include  offensive cyber security curriculum. For example, an informal enumeration of OCO categories can be extracted from the widely respected offensive cyber courses offered by OffSec, see \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:offsec_oco}}. However, here again one must be careful that the category is a direct analog to real-world OCO, or very close proxy. 


\subsubsection{LLM Use Cases}

As described in \textit{Tenet 1}, any OCO evaluation for an LLM should test the LLM in a real-world use case, that is, in a manner that an LLM could be used to enable, assist, or execute an offensive cyber operation. To that effect, our team currently tracks three distinct use cases for LLMs in OCO: \textit{Knowledge Assistant, Co-orchestration}, and \textit{Autonomous}. Our team lists these use cases with the caveats that they are not mutually exclusive (i.e., an LLM can serve in multiple use cases in the same scenario) and that the use cases will continue to evolve.

\textbf{Use Case 1: Knowledge Assistant}. In the first OCO use case we define, the LLM serves as an OCO knowledge assistant, a support role assisting the human operator with researching, planning, and/or executing an offensive cyber operation or attack. In this use case, the LLM is not directly performing the actions or integrated into the execution of the OCO — it is solely interfacing with the human operator while the operator executes the OCO. This use case is already quite common and one of the primary scenarios LLMs are evaluated for, as seen in \textit{CyberSecEval 3} \cite{wan2024cyberseceval}. 

\textbf{Use Case 2: Co-Orchestration}. In the next use case, the LLM serves as a peer co-agent in an OCO. In this use case, the LLM is paired or integrated with one or more additional co-agents that together carry out researching, planning, and/or executing an offensive cyber operation. By agent (or co-agent), we mean a system, tool/platform or human that makes operational decisions or executes the actions of the OCO. This use case may at first appear theoretical; however, it directly stems from real-world examples. For example, an LLM can be paired with the MITRE Caldera\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} adversary emulation platform \cite{MITRE_Corporation_MITRE_Caldera_A_2024}, where the LLM may act as the controlling, decision-making agent of the OCO and \textit{Caldera} is used as the actuation system. In addition to being the actuator, \textit{Caldera} also provides strong guidance to the LLM through its OCO action space knowledge (e.g., it can prune OCO actions if missing preconditions). In this scenario, the LLM and \textit{Caldera} are co-agents with a symbiotic relationship that may lead to greater OCO capability, than if used separately. This co-orchestration is one example of potential co-agent pairings between LLMs and OCO tools, software, and systems. Our team has found this use case to be the least reported on in existing work despite our view that it will be a primary OCO use case for LLMs. Generalizing beyond OCO, we find the co-orchestration use case to be in line with the predicted utility and growth of compound AI systems, as defined by Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) \cite{compound-ai-blog}.

\textbf{Use Case 3: Autonomous}. In the third use case, an LLM is tasked to independently research, plan, and/or execute an OCO with near complete autonomy. In this use case, the term ``agent" is frequently used, and is consistent with the common definition of an AI agent: a system that can perceive its environment, take actions autonomously to achieve goals, and can potentially learn and improve over time based on its experiences.  It has autonomy in both making decisions about which actions to execute and the execution of those actions. For obvious reasons, this use case is generally viewed as the greatest cyber security risk if it comes to fruition and can be fielded for effect. Given its major cyber security implications, much of the nascent LLM evaluation work has opted to target this OCO use case for LLMs. A common evaluation method for testing for the autonomous use case is to integrate LLMs into CTF challenge environments (e.g. \textit{CyberSecEval 3} \cite{wan2024cyberseceval}, \textit{PentestGPT} \cite{deng2023pentestgpt}, Google DeepMind's frontier model evaluation effort \cite{phuong2024evaluating}, and \cite{tann2023CTF}) or specialized target systems (e.g. \textit{AutoAttacker} \cite{xu2024autoattacker} and \cite{fang2024llm}), letting the LLM \textit{play} the challenges. To date, no published evaluation of the autonomous use case has demonstrated the capability of near complete autonomy as we define it above.

\textbf{Use Cases and their associated risk.} These use cases can be viewed from different perspectives when assessing risk. For example, in one view, the use cases act as a direct proxy for the progressive level of sophistication of OCO capabilities of a given LLM. That is, there is a general capability progression (primarily speed, flexibility and scalability of an executing OCO) implied in the progressive use cases from \textit{Knowledge Assistant}, to \textit{Co-orchestration}, to \textit{Autonomous}. However, from another perspective, certain use cases have a much higher associated cost/level-of-effort in fielding them, potentially leading to reduced overall risk despite absolute performance found in a given use case. For example, fielding LLMs for the \textit{Co-Orchestration} use case requires a significantly greater level of resources, technology and knowledge than using LLMs for the \textit{Knowledge Assistant} use case. In short, the associated risk for an LLM is multifaceted and complex, and outright OCO performance in any evaluation may not equate to realized risk.

% \subsubsection{A Preface on Reasoning - \textbf{ORIGINAL}}

% ``Reasoning" is an overloaded term, particularly with respect to LLMs. Its use spans a variety of well defined but not always commensurate areas of the literature. Moreover, discourse around LLMs has grown outside research channels and includes far more amorphous, difficult to pin down concepts and dialogues. So what do we mean by `reasoning'? Formally, reasoning can imply mathematical reasoning, semantic or first-order logic, classical planning etc. while the lay use tends towards vague notions like common sense or basic deductive inferencing. While it is generally accepted that reasoning denotes acting (that is, taking actions) effectively in a given environment for a particular objective, the slight differences in meaning lead to researchers and engineers often talking past each other and working on different problems. While classical planning is probably the closest type of reasoning we would equate to ``OCO reasoning", it ultimately doesn't capture the full suite of behaviors we would characterize as reasoning.  Consequently, because we have difficulty defining reasoning, we also cannot hope to measure it, which is our primary objective to begin with. As what we really care about is risk, and to get to risk implications we have to have a good working and measurable definition of reasoning applied to OCO as it informs us of how capable and ultimately dangerous an LLM is.

% Alternate draft:

``Reasoning" is an overloaded term, particularly with respect to LLMs. Its use spans a variety of well-defined but not always commensurate, areas of the literature. Moreover, discourse around LLMs has proliferated outside of published research channels and grown to include more amorphous, difficult to pin down concepts and dialogues. 

What does ``reasoning" refer to? Formally, reasoning can imply mathematical reasoning, semantic or first-order logic, or classical planning (discrete search). Informal definitions tend towards vague notions like common sense or basic deductive inferencing. Classical planning, generally presenting as discrete search over domain-model search spaces, is probably the closest type of reasoning in prior literature that would equate to OCCULT ``OCO reasoning." However, discrete search ultimately doesn't capture the full suite of behaviors that relate to the reasoning picture as relevant for understanding cyber reasoning capacity. Here, we provide a measurable, working definition of reasoning within the OCO domain. The OCCULT objective is ultimately about understanding the cyber operation capacity of an AI system, and quantifying performance in these dimensions of cyber reasoning can provide insight into that.

In the remainder of this section our team proposes a work-in-progress theory to quantify broad levels of reasoning power as applied to the OCO domain. The theory is first drawn from a concept map where concepts of OCO reasoning are identified and then refined into four major categories. From those categories, general definitions are given, broad evaluation criteria are extracted, and OCO specific examples are provided.

\subsubsection{Reasoning Power}

To arrive at a workable evaluation model for reasoning power, our team first generated an OCO Reasoning Concept Map shown in \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:reason_concept_map}} that enumerates the indivisible concepts of what, in our view, constitutes reasoning power of an AI system, when applied against an OCO environment or task. In the OCO Reasoning Concept Map, these concepts are the non-emphasized (i.e. white) boxes. One can see that these OCO reasoning concepts align with what is usually, when discussed in the context of human intelligence, more formally defined as problem-solving, knowledge and intelligence. Succinctly, we define these as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textbf{\textit{Problem-Solving}} - the process of systematically searching and evaluating sequences of discrete actions to obtain a desired environmental state or objective. \cite{russell2016artificial}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textbf{\textit{Knowledge}} - facts, information, relationships and ontologies of quantifiable domains.
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textbf{\textit{Intelligence}} - ``(of a system) is a measure of its skill-acquisition efficiency over a scope of tasks, with respect to priors, experience, and generalization difficulty." \cite{chollet2019measure}
\end{itemize}


With regards to the OCO Reasoning Concept Map, we emphasize that OCO reasoning concepts have notable overlap and can rarely be expressed purely as either problem-solving, knowledge or intelligence. Given the many OCO reasoning concepts, we further categorize the concepts into four primary reasoning components. The following subsections detail these OCO reasoning components with explicit definitions and OCO domain examples for what constitutes cases of strong and weak evidence for each. The four primary reasoning components are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{Planning sequences of high- and low-level OCO actions and subroutines}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{Perception of OCO environment and task space}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{OCO action creation, modification and iteration}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{OCO task and solution generalization}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Planning sequences of high-level and low-level OCO actions and subroutines}

The first OCO reasoning component can be summarized as planning and solution generation for \textit{known} OCO tasks/objectives. Here, ``known" denotes that the model or system under test has either \textbf{1)} been given knowledge via other models, \textbf{2)} has had previous experience through training, or \textbf{3)} has generalized from other tasks sufficiently to define and deconstruct an OCO task/objective into an achievable sequence of actions. The process includes searching over an existing knowledge base (i.e., manifest) of OCO actions and subroutines to execute successively to achieve an intermediate or ultimate objective. Minimally, to plan over an action space, pre and post conditions of actions must be codified, a planning algorithm must be applied, and the model or system must have working memory. To maximize planning performance, high-fidelity action pre and post conditions, action abstraction levels and hierarchies, and modern hybrid AI planning algorithms (e.g., AlphaZero \cite{silver2017mastering}) are considered necessary. Of note, it is still an open debate on whether LLMs have shown evidence of AI classical planning capabilities \cite{kambhampati2024llms}. The TACTL use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:TACTL}} and the  \textit{CyberLayer} use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:CL}} detail tests for this competency.

\label{tab:reason1}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Perception of OCO environment and task space} 

The second reasoning component is OCO environment perception. The OCO environment can be extremely complex, depending on the task and objective of the cyber operation. In effect, the OCO environment or task space may be (environment characteristic definitions are from \cite{russell2016artificial}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{partially or fully observable} - OCO is primarily marked by partially observable spaces, however discrete tasks or subtasks may be fully observable in their local spaces
    \item \textit{single or multi agent} - OCO environments are clearly multi-agent but, again, discrete tasks or subtasks may be single agent in nature
    \item \textit{deterministic or non-deterministic} - some actions and tasks may have deterministic successive states; however, given the general multi-agent nature of OCO environments, most action sequences are never truly deterministic
    \item \textit{static or dynamic} - some OCO tasks may be static locally; however, again in general, OCO environments are dynamic
\end{itemize}

Across any variation of OCO environment or task characteristics, superior systems will have more complex, higher fidelity representations of state, inherent notions of variable/feature importance, and larger prior knowledge models of the cyber and computational domains. Additionally, the system will know where to sense and how to construct, compile, and reconcile (if need be) all important state information. Lastly, it’s hard to translate task and objective definitions to corresponding OCO states that satisfy those conditions, and it’s harder for loosely defined objectives. For example, take  a cyber operation with the potentially contrary objectives of (1) stealthily attempt to laterally move \textit{and} (2) obtain persistence on Windows servers and low-level workstations. When, in which case, is the operation considered complete? When all Windows systems are found, fingerprinted, and attempted to be exploited by all known means? What lateral movement action spaces are considered ``stealthy" and are in scope (i.e., allowed)? In short, it is arguably one of the harder problems in AI-driven OCO where intuitive (human) operator understanding and triage of OCO objectives is much harder to explicitly and efficiently define for a computational system. The TACTL use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:TACTL}} and the Bloodhound Equivalency use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:BHE}} detail tests for this competency.

\end{table}

\paragraph{OCO action creation, modification, and iteration}

The next reasoning component is the creation and use of adaptable OCO actions. Within the OCO domain the discrete and low-level  actions during an operation generally require a high level of precision and domain knowledge. Often specific actions require iterative adjustment to further an operation. This is especially the case when an AI system must map ingested documentation and information in its training data into executable actions in a dynamic, partially observable environment.
The system must recognize that a failed action is not necessarily a dead end and can even expose additional information. A model using this feedback to inform and iterate on an action is a strong indicator of competency in this area.
Strong AI systems will also form commonly successful action sequences into established solution subroutines, to be re-used when preconditions are perceived to have been met.
Ultimate reasoning over OCO actions is marked by solutions that are flexible, ``living" orchestration models of lower-level actions, as opposed to statically ordered action sequences. The TACTL use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:TACTL}} and the  \textit{CyberLayer} use case described in \textcolor{blue}{Section~\ref{subsection:CL}} detail tests for this competency.

\end{table}


\paragraph{OCO task and solution generalization} 

The final, and most powerful, reasoning component is OCO task and solution generalization. Skill and problem-solving generalization is the ultimate aspiration of an intelligent system, as it's the ``ability to handle situations (or tasks) that differ from previously encountered situations" \cite{chollet2019measure}. Generalization can also be defined in degrees, i.e., local generalization (``robustness"), broad generalization (``flexibility"), extreme generalization (``the human experience") \cite{chollet2019measure}; but, regardless of the level, any evidence for generalization of an AI system is noteworthy. Regarding the OCO domain, task generalization would be indicative of meta-learning of cyber and computational theory and primitives. The bar for such evidence is very high as true generalization must be measured while controlling for seeded priors (i.e. knowledge) and experience (i.e. training) \cite{chollet2019measure}. Correspondingly, testing for task generalization is extremely difficult and resource intensive, especially when attempting to test real-world scenarios (as opposed to toy/game environments). Examples of well formed (general) reasoning benchmarks that measure solution generalization, albeit for highly controlled environments, can been found in the \textit{Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus} \cite{chollet2019measure}, and most recently the \textit{Knights \& Knaves logical reasoning benchmark} found in \cite{xie2024memorization}.

Within OCO, and the cyber domain more broadly, this kind of generalization manifests as an ability to understand a system’s vulnerabilities and how they can be used to further a particular goal. These cannot be one-shot instances, but rather are capabilities that can be composed and reused across operations. This competency is not relegated to a specific scale or system. Concretely, this is the behavior exhibited when noting that the basic assumptions about a system may not be true and can lead to unintended behavior. That a buffer is not bounds checked, web form input may not be sanitized, code trusted through a supply chain relationship, an attachment downloaded, or trusted memory regions are the basic building blocks that enable operations. When these exploits, at the hardware, software, network, social, and organizational level are recognized by an AI system to the extent it can operationalize new attacks we can say it has generalized. 

While seemingly detached or at least originating from a greater context outside any single OCO, these solution generalizations are in fact embedded into common tools and techniques as well as operator behavior. This is simply an elaboration of the basic notion of an exploit. Operators internalize the ability to generate hypotheses about what vulnerabilities a system is likely to have, and which are mostly likely to succeed in furthering an operation. In effect, they are asking the counter-factual question to discover which incorrect assumptions were made in creating an insecure system: ``What would need to be true for this system to not be secure?'' This can alternatively be framed as asking the question: ``Where is there a trusted boundary that can be broken?'' This can operate in a backwards fashion starting from a goal state, say control of particular machines, and working backwards generating more hypotheses whenever necessary to further progress. A simple example is a buffer overflow exploit, where, when presented with a program with input, the model ``asks": ``What if this input isn't bounds checked?'' This question is testing a hypothesis to find out if certain length inputs do in fact crash the program. The model can then operationalize this counterfactual via a new program automating the injection of shellcode into the buffer to gain higher privileges on the system as a steppingstone to pivoting to a new machine. 

To be clear, operationalizing a counterfactual does not always mean code is running or being created. It may be the strategic recognition that a network provides access to contractors but cannot control their security. Social engineering is an equally valid example but currently out of scope for this work. In many ways, this definition is tediously outlining the obvious and routine in OCO and what is already present in the literature \cite{Dullien2020Weird}. Importantly, we take no position on what an eventual OCO AI system will look like. It is not necessary to always frame an operation in this way, but to note that it \textit{can be} for providing a basis for stronger solution generalization. Given the extent to which high and low-level OCO actions conform to the dual notions of counterfactuals and violations of boundaries of trust, it presents a strong method for identifying generalized (and thus dangerous) OCO capabilities in AI systems.


The \textcolor{blue}{~\ref{subsection:CL} CyberLayer} section details our current tests for this competency.

\paragraph{Scoring reasoning power} 

Given our highly qualitative (and potentially subjective) approach to defining reasoning power, when applied to candidate LLM evaluations and benchmarks, our team has taken to simply denoting whether weak or strong evidence can be observed for each of the four major components of OCO reasoning that we have defined \footnote{Our approach to quantifying OCO reasoning power has notable influence from the methodology of the \textit{Abstract and Reasoning Corpus} \cite{chollet2019measure}.}. Additionally, there is an implicit policy that if any evaluation or benchmark is marked for being able to elicit and measure strong evidence of reasoning, additional investigation is automatically warranted to verify such a noteworthy score.


\subsubsection{Benchmarks}

Given the proposed evaluation methodology for defining OCO test cases, to create an LLM benchmark we simply take a set of desired test cases from the methodology to evaluate. A conceptual view of a benchmark can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:method_benchmark}}. In this view, tests (or benchmarks that consist of tests) that align along the axes of autonomous OCO use cases and greater reasoning power equate to the highest OCO risk. In the OCCULT methodology, however, test case coverage and gap analysis can be done along any of the dimensions to identify where additional test cases are needed. Ideally, test case coverage is complete, uniform and community driven. Realistically test case coverage will always be a moving target and a constant challenge to standardize under a single methodology. Finally, OCCULT benchmarks may consist of any specified test cases, allowing for any benchmark evaluation to target and measure the risk associated with the OCO use cases and categories of interest to the investigator.

\section{LLM Tests}

\subsection{Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL)}
\label{subsection:TACTL}

\subsubsection{Design}
The Threat Actor Competency Test for LLMs (TACTL) is designed to evaluate the OCO capabilities of LLMs through a series of multiple-choice questions targeting \textit{OCO action creation, modification and iteration} detailed in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:reason3}} and \textit{Perception of OCO environment and task space} detailed in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:reason1}}. Each question in the TACTL corpus presents four possible answers, challenging the LLM to select the most appropriate response based on its understanding of OCO.

The use of the multiple-choice format for evaluation is a compromise. As noted in earlier sections, our team does not view multiple-choice benchmarks as being able to provide sole indication of real world OCO capability, as real-world OCO does not present itself in a coherent chain of discrete multiple-choice questions. However, multiple choice benchmarks do allow us to test the LLM for specific OCO knowledge, explicitly and efficiently. Thus, while not a panacea, multiple-choice benchmarks do provide some advantages, to include: allowing for fast evaluation as well as evaluation in local/resource restricted testing environments; indicating potential OCO capability that should be further investigated via other evaluation methods; and due to the standardization of multiple-choice benchmarks in LLM testing, currently providing for the greatest level of interpretability by consumers. Additionally, TACTL does provide for some enhancements (discussed in \textcolor{blue}{Dynamic generation of question variable ~\ref{par:dynamic_gen}}) over current cyber security multiple-choice benchmarks, that does improve the quality of evaluation.

A chain of multiple-choice questions is used rather than allowing open-ended LLM responses because, in our estimation, there are no efficient ways to confidently evaluate the LLM’s answer. This reflects current proposed solutions of using additional LLMs to evaluate the output of the LLM under test, as seen in \textit{CyberSecEval 1} \cite{bhatt2023purple}. While the approach to evaluation in \textit{CyberSecEval 1} \cite{bhatt2023purple} did also (correctly) use random sampling for human validation of the LLM evaluations, we believe this process could not keep pace with LLM proliferation or vastness of OCO capability categories. Also, in our view, using LLMs solely to evaluate other LLMs falls into a modern variation of the ``trusting trust'' problem laid out by Ken Thompson in \textit{Reflections on Trusting Trust} \cite{thompson1984reflections}.

% \label{fig:tactl_q_table_r}
% \end{figure*}

\paragraph{Benchmarks}

To define benchmarks (also called tasks), \textit{sequences} and \textit{tasks} of questions are created. A simple hierarchical relationship is defined here: questions are grouped into \textit{sequences}, then questions and \textit{sequences} may be grouped into \textit{tasks}. In effect, \textit{tasks} and \textit{sequences} enumerate the sets of questions they are composed of. \textit{Sequences} and \textit{tasks} are defined in YAML files. An example sequence and task YAML file can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:tactl_seq}} and \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:tactl_task}}. \textit{Sequences} denote an ordered chain of questions to supply the LLM under test, where all questions in the sequence share the same variable memory. All variables defined as the sequence of questions are tracked so that later questions (in the sequence) may specify variables defined in previous questions. For example, if the first question in a sequence defines an IP address variable, that IP address variable may be referenced in any of the later defined questions. This approach is critical for efficiently developing sequences of questions that are all part of a cohesive OCO scenario to test the LLM against. To evaluate TACTL \textit{tasks} against an LLM, \textit{tasks} are translated into an Inspect AI \cite{UK_AI_Safety_Institute_Inspect_AI_Framework_2024} dataset and then prompted to the LLM. 


\paragraph{Dynamic generation of question variables}
\label{par:dynamic_gen}

To ensure that memorization of questions does not occur (or at least attempt to mitigate), each question incorporates dynamic variables that are generated with every iteration of the test and/or overall benchmark. This variability ensures that the LLM must comprehend the underlying concepts of OCO rather than relying on memorized answers. At the implementation level, TACTL questions are codified in a YAML specification. Every question is defined in its own YAML file, along with all variable fields and metadata. An example TACTL question, as defined in its YAML file, can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:g2c_question}}. Additionally, \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:tactl_q_table}} and \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:tactl_q_table_r}} show an example of the question variables being generated (i.e., defined) at ``run time" when the test and/or benchmark is created from the TACTL source. \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:tactl_q_table}} shows the decoded question and \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:tactl_q_table_r}} shows the encoded question with all variables reconciled. As noted, any questions enumerated in a \textit{sequence} will share variable values across questions whenever the variable is referenced. Under the hood, variable generation is implemented by simple functions (Python). See \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:var_gens}} for current list of variable generators.

\label{fig:tactl_q_table_r}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Scenario driven}

% All TACTL questions are designed to be scenario-based, providing a realistic context that simulates actual real-world OCO. Each individual question is intended to be a part of a larger, cohesive scenario, testing the LLM's ability to understand and navigate complex, multifaceted OCO situations. Of course, TACTL question scenarios are primarily a construct for evaluation from our perspective (i.e. humans), as at its core a LLM is stateless between prompts; with the caveat that standard practice of most LLM interfaces is to concatenate chains of prompts, up to the maximum context window of the LLM. In our current implementation, consecutive scenario questions are not explicitly concatenated in TACTL benchmarks.

\paragraph{TACTL question corpus}

Currently, the TACTL corpus is comprises a limited set of initial questions (~180). However, our team plans to expand this corpus significantly via our own contributions, as well by open-sourcing the corpus for public contributions. We aim to crowdsource a diverse set of questions that forces the LLM to be knowledgeable on the full spectrum of OCO capability areas. Some of the areas we plan to test for is the mastery of ATT\&CK tactics and techniques \cite{strom2018mitre}, offensive security tools, AV/EDR evasion, malware development, living-off-the-land techniques, and identification of misconfigurations. We believe this collaborative approach can enhance the quality of the tests and foster a community-driven effort to advance our knowledge on the OCO capabilities of LLMs.


\subsubsection{\textit{Ground2Crown} Benchmark}
The \textit{Ground2Crown} benchmark is an example TACTL scenario that consists of 30 selected questions from the broader TACTL database, designed to challenge the LLM in navigating a realistic scenario of escalating from zero access to domain administrator within an Active Directory environment. To succeed, the LLM must demonstrate knowledge of exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that are commonly found on production networks, as well as an understanding of the tools used by both ethical hackers and adversaries to identify and exploit these weaknesses. An example question from the \textit{Ground2Crown} scenario can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:g2c_question}}. The questions encompass all 14 ATT\&CK Tactics and 44 Techniques, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of potential attack vectors within a concise set of questions. See \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:g2c_attack}} for complete enumeration of ATT\&CK tactics and techniques in the \textit{Ground2Crown} scenario.


\subsection{BloodHound Equivalency}
\label{subsection:BHE}

\subsubsection{Design}
The BloodHound Equivalency Test for LLMs is designed to evaluate the OCO capabilities of LLMs through analyzing and producing Active Directory data. The test is related to the specific OCCULT competencies of \textit{Planning} detailed in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:reason1}} through finding attack paths and \textit{Perception} detailed in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:reason2}} through a general understanding and ability to ingest Active Directory data. \textit{BloodHound} \cite{bloodhound} is an offensive security tool that uses graph-solving algorithms to reveal connections among Active Directory objects. The connections among objects represent Active Directory privileges or attributes. An example of a possible connection is the ``GenericAll" privilege allocated for a domain group on a user account. In some cases, the connections may be unintended and are cumbersome to find without BloodHound. BloodHound is supported by two popular data collectors, \textit{SharpHound} \cite{sharphound} and Bloodhound.py \cite{bloodhound.py}, which gather an environment's Active Directory data. Once the data is gathered and ingested into BloodHound, Active Directory attack paths are highlighted through identified edges between nodes. For the LLM to produce Active Directory intelligence like BloodHound, the LLM must develop, at the time of testing, a working model of the active directory environment and its underlying relationships. Furthermore, for the LLM to produce attack paths, it must understand contextual information relevant to offensive active directory techniques. If the LLM were to produce accurate intelligence regarding the generated Active Directory environment, the LLM would be demonstrating an understanding of complex Active Directory interactions. In offensive cyber operations, the struggle of applying offensive techniques to a working model of an environment is the burden of the human operator. While typically assisted by tools like BloodHound, the capacity of an operator to identify relevant attack chains given data from an environment corresponds with crystallized OCO abilities.


When the BloodHound Equivalency Test begins, synthetic (i.e. artificial) Active Directory data is generated to simulate Active Directory data dumped from an enterprise network with a BloodHound collector. The LLM is given access to the synthetically produced active directory data and a natural language description of its intended goal, e.g. ``Find all domain admins." The LLM must then produce the correct answer from the (synthetic) Active Directory data for that test. The accuracy of the LLM produced data is determined by a direct comparison of data returned by pre-built queries from BloodHound operating on the same dataset. The use of optimized pre-built queries originating from the BloodHound tool ensures a comparison is based on the ground truth of the dataset.

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=11cm]{images/bloodhound-query.png}
\caption{Example query with LLM response and BloodHound response.}
\label{fig:bloodhound_obj_query_model}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Active Directory Data Generation}
\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=5cm]{images/neo4j_datagen.png}
\caption{An example visual representation of synthetic Active Directory data, produced from the BloodHound data generation tool, as seen in BloodHound's Neo4j database WebUI.}
\label{fig:neo4j_data}
\end{figure*}

The database responsible for containing the Active Directory data, Neo4j \cite{neo4j}, is a graph database storing nodes, edges, and attributes of each. BloodHound utilizes this database to effectively break down nested active directory relationships. Therefore, the back-end logic of the open-source BloodHound tool revolves around the use of Neo4j. To streamline the test, a modified Neo4j Docker image was created to quickly stand up a fresh configured database.


The Active Directory data generation methods are modified versions of a BloodHound database creation tool provided by the open-source BloodHound project. The modified database creation tool connects to a specified Neo4j instance and populates it with data that mimics data the BloodHound collectors would collect and return. The data generation method takes the number of nodes in the network as the key argument to calculate the following parameters of the synthetic Active Directory data set:  \{\textit{number of domain administrators, number of users, number of groups, number of computers, group nesting depth, number of assigned groups per user, distribution of managed computers per IT group, kerberoastable users,} etc.\}. To properly capture the variance of an enterprise network, random sampling is utilized and combined with predefined distributions guides for the data generation. By creating Active Directory sample data using this method, the LLM can be tested on different Active Directory environments with measured variance. For the purposes of the BloodHound Equivalency testing, the number of nodes was fixed at 100 per test as to not exhaust the LLM token limits.

\subsubsection{Pre-Built BloodHound Queries}

The open-source BloodHound project comes equipped with a variety of pre-built optimized queries for identifying useful Active Directory information. However, the pre-built queries utilized from the BloodHound project do not return equal intelligence when compared against each other. The query referenced by its description ``Find all domain admins" references the security identifier of each user account and returns accounts that end in ``512." Another query, ``Find all domain admins having a session opened on a domain computer" references the security identifier and whether each of those user accounts satisfies the session requirement. To quantify complexity, a value from 1 to 4 was assigned to each of the natural language queries, where 4 represents the highest complexity of query. The query referenced ``Find all domain admins" would be classified as the lowest complexity of 1. \textcolor{blue}{Table \ref{tab:bloodhound_queries}} denote the BloodHound query and the assigned complexity value.

\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.75\linewidth} |p{0.15\linewidth} |}

 \hline
 List all Kerberoastable Users & 4 \\
 \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{The BloodHound queries and the associated complexity score.}
\label{tab:bloodhound_queries}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

The components of the BloodHound Equivalency test consist of Active Directory data generation methods, LLM interface interfaces/APIs, Neo4j interfaces, evaluation functions, and a Neo4j Docker environment.  

The LLM interface uses the open-source LLM framework DSPy \cite{khattab2023dspy} to communicate with models hosted on MITRE's internal AI Platform. After initializing communication with the LLM, a series of DSPy signatures guides the LLM through several steps of reasoning about the goal, expressed natural language, the required objects that might satisfy the query, and transformation of the data initially presented. The cascading reasoning used to coerce the LLM into applying Active Directory knowledge is often referred to as Chain of Thought (CoT) \cite{wei2022chain}. 

The evaluation methods of the BloodHound Equivalency test iterate over Python objects returned by the LLM. If the LLM returned the data in the specified format, the data can be compared easily by finding keys and values present in both the LLM transformed data and the data returned from the pre-built BloodHound query. However, if the data returned by the LLM does not abide by the specified format, then the evaluation method will resort to a string comparison evaluation. By iterating through strings returned by the LLM and comparing them against what was returned by the pre-built BloodHound queries, any common values can be found. After each query has been initially answered by the LLM, the accuracy for each tested pre-built BloodHound query can be calculated. 

\subsubsection{Tool Replacement by LLMs}

The BloodHound Equivalency test can also be categorized under the general category of tests that aim to evaluate whether LLMs, either by direct purpose or not, are subsuming capabilities and functions that have hitherto been reserved to very specific tools, software, and/or algorithms. In the case of the BloodHound Equivalency test, to perform well, any LLM would in effect be on par with the core BloodHound functionality of analyzing and identifying attack paths in an Active Directory. Furthermore, this would be notable if the LLM under test had no evidence of training or specific fine-tuning for the tested BloodHound functionality. In other words, the LLM is equivalent to BloodHound in performance for Active Directory analysis without having been explicitly trained to do so.


\subsection{\textit{CyberLayer} Cyber Attack Simulations}
\label{subsection:CL}

\subsubsection{\textit{CyberLayer} Environment}

\textit{CyberLayer} is a high-fidelity cyber operation simulation following the AI Gym \cite{1606.01540} design pattern. The simulation provides a robust action space for both offensive and defensive players as well as accurate representations of network topologies, device deployments, resources structures (e.g., domains and users), and network access controls, etc.

The high fidelity and accurate representation of the cyber domain in a simulation has proven useful not only in machine learning contexts, such as reinforcement learning (e.g., \textit{Mirage} \cite{kouremetis2024mirage}), but also as a training and evaluation environment for human players due to the capacity for the environment to exercise the decision-making process in cyber operation scenarios. The most important elements of this simulation framework that empower OCCULT  tests are (1) the ability to portray OCO scenarios that can exercise intended decision-making elements and (2) extrapolating those seed scenarios to many scenario variants that, while from a decision-making process are the same, present various identifiers, topological differences, etc., which are sufficiently varied that memorization will not be effective. Thus, these scenarios can be created to study the reasoning and decision-making capacity of an LLM and be resistant to the risk of memorization. At the same time, they can probe for specific behaviors and capabilities. To portray scenarios, \textit{CyberLayer} represents cyber operation environments with:

\begin{itemize}
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{terrain} - digital devices, network topology, firewalls and access controls, applications, clients, servers, and network protocols
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{player entities} - ranging from offensive to defensive agents, as well as the capacity for NPCs (Non-player characters, e.g. Users)
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{data resources} - files, credentials, on-device logs
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} \textit{system dynamics} - managed domains, public and private DNS, social networks amongst users, and system inter-dependencies
\end{itemize}

%terrain (digital devices, network topology, firewalls and access controls, applications, clients, servers, and network protocols), player entities (ranging from offense to defense teams, as well as the capacity for NPCs), data resources (e.g. files, credentials, on-device logs), and system dynamics (e.g. managed domains, public and private DNS, social networks amongst users, and system inter-dependencies).

Each of these elements has been modeled at a minimum to support simulated operator actions at the TTP level, i.e., how the ATT\&CK framework describes a cyber offensive TTP space,  and sometimes lower to support specific variants of techniques (e.g. RCE against differing SMB implementations). The minimum level of detail in representation of an action is the enumeration of all prerequisite conditions for action use, and characterization of both the intended effects and the necessary and realistic secondary effects. The latter includes observables (e.g., a network scan results in network connections, packets on the wire) and shows up in the flow logs. These ``side effect" aspects of the representation can be leveraged as building blocks to measure the detectability of a given course of action.

\textit{CyberLayer} currently models over 60+ different cyber actions that are available to test the LLM’s effectiveness. This action space grows as new scenarios and test cases require additional actions. Given characterization of a new TTP or variant, development of a simulacrum of the new action in \textit{CyberLayer} can take less than an hour of a junior developer’s time, especially if built upon existing actions and artifacts.

Another critical enabling element of \textit{CyberLayer} is the telemetry generated from every run through the simulation. Full environment, state, and action history are logged. This telemetry, combined with highly detailed representations of the action and observation space, allows for representative performance metrics to be drawn from a given run. 

For human offensive players, detectability may be an objective they would seek to minimize by modifying their course of action, whether by reducing actions taken or layering on additional maneuvers that would clean-up or mask their true intent. Through OCCULT’s interface to \textit{CyberLayer}, LLM-driven ``player” agents can be evaluated in the same manner as human players would.

\subsubsection{Setting Up a Scenario}
The setup of a \textit{CyberLayer} scenario begins with the design of the terrain and the elements within it. At the highest level, network segments are modeled - e.g., a broad ``Internet" segment composing everything outside an enterprise, and various segments representing logical or topological separation of intranets within an enterprise boundary. Then, each host within the environment is modeled off templates, such as an ``Enterprise Laptop" host device that has configurations for operating systems, applications, protocols, and open ports. IP ranges of devices are configured correctly to match configurations on the network segments they reside upon. Firewall rules are configurable at both the network segment and the device level, including directionality and explicitly allowed or disallowed connectivity. In a scenario configuration file, configuration of network elements such as IP blocks, domain names, and domain users and groups are also available. From this same scenario configuration file, procedural generators build out the simulation data model using the specified networks, devices, and other elements. Scenario generation can use different random seed values specified in the scenario configuration file to introduce variability into the generated environments. Alternatively, an environment using the same random seed value from a prior scenario generation can be identically reproduced.

\subsubsection{Design}

The \textit{CyberLayer} test suite for LLMs is designed to evaluate the OCO capabilities of a LLM when faced with a variety of new environments and constraints. It tests the LLM on each OCCULT competency and particularly focuses on OCO task and solution generalization \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:reason4}}. Measuring generalization is important given how sensitive LLMs can be to their input. It is often unclear if some slight variation of the scenario would dramatically increase or decrease overall performance, and thus it's critical to account for scenario variation. Often, due to the way LLMs train over massive corpora of publicly scraped internet data, benchmark datasets can leak into the training data, inadvertently skewing the apparent performance of an LLM on a reasoning type task. When dropped into a terminal, an LLM can sometimes show strong performance on penetration testing tasks \cite{fang2024llm}. However, if it is found that write-ups or solutions for the tasks are available on the public internet, this can effectively contaminate the training data and invalidate any observed performance. While the specific scenarios might ostensibly be new, many can be variations of those already publicly available. Single instances can be good signals of capability but lack the reliability to prove that the LLM understands the scenario and solution. 

Moreover, the emulation testing already done in the literature shows a pattern of the LLM's performance rapidly falling off after a certain level of difficulty (e.g. \textit{PentestGPT} \cite{deng2023pentestgpt}). While newer and larger LLMs appear to have a different fall off point, once the cliff is found, the LLM appears to default to ineffective strategies (e.g. \textit{AutoAttacker} \cite{xu2024autoattacker}), particularly when actions must be chained together, which is required in any operation. Understanding why this occurs is paramount. \textit{CyberLayer}'s generative features help us to test each aspect of an LLM's OCO capabilities in a fine-grained way. By changing the random seed value in an environment, we can maintain the broad strokes of the network topology, host configurations, and high-level solution while still altering topology. This lets us test if an LLM ``got lucky" or if it can truly adapt to a dynamic environment and maintain effectiveness. The inclusion of an extra host in a scenario subnet should have little to no effect whatsoever on a LLMs' operation. If we are to say the LLM is truly effective it must be able to accomplish the same goal even with a slight barrier being added.


If an LLM is effective but only with a particular set of tools and only in some scenarios, that dramatically alters the risk evaluation. For example, while we might expect an LLM to understand and use a common tool like \textit{Mimikatz} \cite{mkatz} effectively, living-off-the-land techniques may be more difficult. Furthermore, we want to observe what kinds of techniques an LLM tends towards when it has a variety available to it. Do different models have the same strategies and tool preference? This could be reflective of memorization by model, especially if the strategy is maladaptive. 
Our goal is to characterize this risk. In what ways is an LLM good at penetration testing? Does it pose a risk to small networks? A typical enterprise? Cloud networks? Can it use new tools once they're developed? Is an LLM able to avoid detection? Do simple defensive cyber deception practices, gaining more prevalence, throw LLMs off course? By setting different goals in the scenario, we test the LLM's ability to complete specific TTPs while keeping the environment the same. For each kind of environment, we want to know just how much damage and control an LLM can exert.


To evaluate this, \textit{CyberLayer} provides extensive logging and tracking of agents, which allows us to collect information on the number and targets of actions taken over the course of an episode, as well as the artifacts left on the network. In conjunction with the goal system, we can evaluate how focused, creative, and stealthy an LLM is in carrying out an operation. To highlight some of the unique behavioral tests \textit{CyberLayer} enables, see \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_features}}.

Here, we will detail one of our test environments, called the \textit{Worm} scenario (see \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:worm}}), as a concrete example of a \textit{CyberLayer} environment. The scenario consists of two subnets: datacenter and sales. The datacenter consists primarily of web and SMB servers, while the sales subnet is a mix of Windows workstations and Point of Sale (POS) devices. The LLM agent begins the operation on a beachhead on the sales subnet. A wide variety of goals can be set in the scenario, but typically they consist of finding a high-value target on the sales subnet or navigating to the data center subnet. The LLM agent has a variety of tools available described in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_metadata}}.

In this scenario performance is evaluated by goal completion, the number of actions taken to complete the goal, and the number of artifacts left during the operation.
% \russo{From Alex: What could the LLM do in the worm scenario, or maybe generally in cyberlayer that would be really impressive? A kind of north star.}


%\alex{LLMs can appear to perform well on a given task, but then show surprising failure modes. Or they can show good performance on one stage of a planning task and collapse. The ideal test for cyber reasoning capacity would be a randomized networked environment a different stages of an offensive operation to test an LLM for it's ability to act effectively at each stage of the killchain. \newline

%A common metric for evaluating creativity in humans is the number of uses they can come up with for an everyday item ( provide citation). In a similar vein, to test for an LLM's understanding and ability to understand and pen test networks we can evaluate the number of different solutions an LLM creates for a given Cyberlayer environment. \newline

%Moreover, even if an LLM can successfully execute a single playbook for it to be able to a real risk it must be able to adapt it's strategy. We test this by giving the LLM access to tools, while instructing it to avoid or not use the tools.

\subsubsection{Implementation}


The LLM agent network is modeled as a series of implants that share information through a communications channel to a centralized C2 server, which synthesizes a picture of the network from the agents' perspective to be used for planning. This is a similar model to Caldera\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} \cite{MITRE_Corporation_MITRE_Caldera_A_2024} and enables different agent planning and decision algorithms to be employed. Due to the text in/text out interface of an LLM we provide some additional functionality mapping to and from this data model.


Two harnesses are available for the LLM, which allow for interfacing with \textit{CyberLayer} using an internal library called \textit{Pipeworks}. \textit{Pipeworks} wraps DSPy \cite{khattab2023dspy} and TextGenerationInference (TGI) \cite{tgi} to orchestrate input/output from LLM to simulation.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=11cm, height=6cm]{images/cl_interface.drawio_1.png}
\caption{Overview of LLM \textit{CyberLayer} interface.}
\end{figure}

The first harness provides basic input to the LLM, feeding an observation consisting of \{\textit{the previous action's results, the set of discovered hosts, a history of the last \textit{n} actions, currently available set of actions}\} as well as metadata describing the actions similar to \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_metadata}}. The available actions provided to the LLM are fully parameterized. For example, `SSH onto host \textit{n}' and `SSH onto host \textit{m}' are used as opposed to abstract actions such as `lateral move.' Once the LLM provides some output, we then use a final call to TGI with the grammar \textit{(action name, target)} for all available actions to map back to the correct \textit{CyberLayer} action. The architecture of the first harness can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:llm_harness_1}}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:llm_harness_1}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=13cm, height=6cm]{images/SimpleLLM.drawio_3.png}
\caption{Overview of the first LLM Harness.}
\label{fig:llm_harness_1}
\end{figure}


The second harness is similar to the first, differing only in the LLM processing block. At a high level, the same observations are given to the LLM but go through a series of prompts to summarize the observations, create a plan, identify the stage of the kill chain, and select an action. We then use TGI to map this output back into \textit{CyberLayer}. The architecture of the second harness can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:llm_harness_2}}.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=7cm]{images/ComplexLLM.drawio_4.png}
\caption{Overview of the second LLM Harness utilizing a more complex prompting structure.}
\label{fig:llm_harness_2}
\end{figure}

In both instances the grammar used omits where the action is being run from and the parameters used. While this could be enabled to allow for even more control by the LLM, we use the simplest keys possible to identify which action to run due to how many actions can be available at a given time step. When the same action type, target pair can be actuated from several implants, the action defaults to running the action from the oldest implant.


The actions an LLM has available are dependent on the level of guidance or ``guard rails" set. The lowest level of guidance provides the LLM with actions for which agent has sufficient parameters. For example, until credentials are discovered with the appropriate tool, an agent will not have the ability to SSH into hosts. Once an action is unlocked it can be run any number of times. The LLM must determine which actions are likely to succeed, as well as further its goals. Actions without the correct preconditions satisfied will fail, such as insufficient permissions, but are available to run again. However, the same action being run repeatedly leaves many artifacts that an intrusion detection system (IDS) may detect. 

% \alex{(From MK) reading this line, it sounds the opposite of what you just stated in previous line about how actions are unlocked by preconditions. assuming you are using "preconditions" and "parameters" interchangeably}.

The second level of guidance prevents redundant actions from being taken using the same parameters. Continuing with the same SSH example, if the action fails due to firewall rules, it can no longer be run from that host. If credentials for a different user on the same host are used or the action is taken from an implant on a different host, the action can be selected by the LLM again.


The third and highest level of guidance includes the previous level in addition to only allowing actions with the correct prerequisites to run. This is essentially equivalent to the LLM driving a \textit{Caldera} operation, where actions are available based on pre and post conditions. Actions can still fail - e.g., due to firewall rules or incorrect permissions - and the LLM must account for this when attempting to reach its goal. A summary of the guidance levels can be seen in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_llm_guidance}}.

% \alex{ (comment from mk)  Also isnt there a a 4th level of guidance, ie no guidance? the llm just get an action manifest, goal and beachhead and told to go. From Alex: We could have that zeroth level but didn't run any tests with it/ would need to build that apparatus to OTE.}

Goals are expressed in a domain specific language (DSL) which has two main parts: actions and targets. Actions can be expressed either as specific commands or low-level actions, such as SSH and \textit{esentutl} or grouped by ATT\&CK tactics, such as discovery and  persistence. The targets are expressed as either a list of specific hosts, i.e. `host 1,' `host 87,' or as an attribute string that is de-referenced into a list of hosts. An attribute string such as `windows' produces a list of hosts that have Windows as a part of their Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) string. Both host expressions have a modifier that allows the goal to be marked as completed when some percentage of hosts have had the correct action or action type successfully executed on them. Simply stated, in \textit{CyberLayer}, we care about the types of actions run on interesting hosts. A successful ransomware attack, for example, could be expressed as running encryption on all files on all Windows devices. This allows us to test for specific tactic and tool use, providing visibility into potential over reliance or an inability to generalize to new environments.

\section{LLM Evaluation Platform}
The OCCULT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard, housed within the LLM Evaluation Platform, intends to closely mimic the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard \cite{hface} but with additional UI features that allow for enhanced comprehension of OCCULT LLM test cases. The evaluation framework is designed to enable rapid test integration and LLM compatibility while maintaining a navigable layout for test and benchmark metrics and exploration of individual test results. The programmatic nature of the framework’s APIs was designed to allow domain experts to enhance their reach by using LLMs for automation of converting threat intelligence into ``unit tests." There is an emphasis for individual tests to evaluate and report metrics that are both meaningful to red-teamers and/or cyber security defenders and are relevant to an operational workflow, emphasizing the risk that any individual LLM could pose from a quantifiable perspective.

\subsection{The Leaderboard View}
The Leaderboard View allows users to view, sort, and filter evaluated LLMs on the OCCULT evaluation tests and/or benchmark. This view lets users compare performance of LLMs across the range of evaluation tests, as well as create custom views of the evaluations to better understand the more complex intricacies of each model's performance across a particular benchmark. Refer to \textcolor{blue}{ Figure~\ref{fig:leaderboard-home}} for a snapshot of the leaderboard view.

\begin{figure*}
\center

\caption{A screen capture of the OCCULT LLM Leaderboard. (Note that benchmark scores in this screenshot are placeholders and do not  reflect any actual evaluations.)}
\label{fig:leaderboard-home}
\end{figure*}

Other views provide the ability to explore more detailed metrics, including actual model input and output to the benchmark datasets. For multiple choice Q\&A datasets, this includes the full question asked of the LLM and the LLM's answer. This includes custom visualizations of the model's performance. \textit{CyberLayer} evaluations, for example, display the trajectory the LLM took in navigating the cyber environment and OCO task.

\subsection{LLM Evaluation}
The Leaderboard allows for LLM evaluation using the standard OpenAI chat completions API \cite{OpenAIPython}, which show a wide range of integrations and functionality across open-source and close-source LLMs. For all LLM evaluations, the model provides relevant context and (if applicable) historical context. With the TACTL benchmark(s), for example, only a single-turn Q\&A format is used. With the \textit{CyberLayer} benchmark(s), the model works through a step-by-step process that requires multi-turn interaction and the tracking of a complex instruction and output history. All LLM evaluations use the same sampling parameters to control for variance in next-token prediction, with the drawback that this does not account for variations in each LLM's sensitivities to sampling parameters.

LLM evaluation utilizes the InspectAI framework \cite{UK_AI_Safety_Institute_Inspect_AI_Framework_2024}. This allows the evaluation platform to support a wide range of benchmark types and styles while minimizing the customization needed for new benchmark additions. Behind-the-scenes, InspectAI supports rapid prototyping of new evaluations and the ability to quickly adapt to modifications in existing benchmarks. Each of the three currently supported benchmarks has a custom InspectAI Task, which supports helper functions and pipeline components for prompting, tool integration, and output parsing.

\section{Preliminary Results}

\textit{Note:} Right before publication of this work, MITRE's new Federal AI Sandbox (powered by a NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD) \cite{spod_ann} went online and allowed us to additionally evaluate the \textbf{DeepSeek-R1}, \textbf{DeepSeek-V3}, and \textbf{Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct} models against both TACTL benchmarks (\textit{Ground2Crown} and \textit{TACTL-183}) but not against the BloodHound Equivalency or \textit{CyberLayer} benchmarks. A forthcoming publication will focus on more comprehensive and thorough evaluations for all of our benchmarks, to include results against these three aforementioned models. 

\subsection{TACTL - \textit{Ground2Crown} Benchmark}

Nine LLMs were evaluated against the TACTL \textit{Ground2Crown} scenario. As mentioned previously, this scenario is a set of 30 total questions covering 44 ATT\&CK TTPs. This sample size is far too small to extract any forgone conclusions about an LLM's ability to effectively perform OCO activity; however, we can comment on trends observed in this preliminary data. 

%From their highest to lowest score, the models evaluated were \textbf{Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct} (90\%), \textbf{Llama-3-70B-Instruct} (79\%), \textbf{Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct} (77\%), \textbf{Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct} (77\%), \textbf{Codestral-22B} (61\%), and \textbf{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} (52\%).%

As can be seen in \textit{Ground2Crown} results \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:tactl-g2c}}, a (non-surprising) correlation exists between the number of parameters a model uses and its performance when answering TACTL \textit{Ground2Crown} OCO questions. Models that utilize a higher number of parameters generally scored higher on the test, with \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} and \textbf{DeepSeek-V3} scoring a \textbf{100\%} with the highest number of parameters at 685 billion and 671 billion, respectively. However, this claim only generally holds as demonstrated by the \textbf{Mixtral 8x22B} model performing the worst at a \textbf{60\%} with 176 billion parameters indicating more thorough evaluations are needed. \textcolor{blue}{Appendix~\ref{app:tactl_g2c_attack_heatmap}} provides a breakdown of each model's performance against each individual ATT\&CK TTP covered in the \textit{Ground2Crown} benchmark. The ATT\&CK TTPs are ordered by average model performance, from high to low. Because the benchmark was small, we did not further explore why models performed poorly on the associated TTPs (e.g. Permission Groups Discovery, Brute Force). However, our team is working on larger TACTL benchmarks that investigate further results in depth.

\subsection{\textit{TACTL-183} Benchmark}
At the time of writing this publication, the OCCULT team had curated a total of 183 multiple choice questions into the TACTL dataset. The full dataset not only includes the \textit{Ground2Crown} scenario, but also includes other scenarios and individual lines of questioning surrounding: Cobalt Strike, Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI) on the FIN6 adversary, various offensive security tools, Atomic Red Team inspired questions, malware, web app, Linux, and registry keys. Thus, in addition to results for the TACTL \textit{Ground2Crown} benchmark, we provide results for a benchmark consisting of all the questions currently present in the TACTL corpus, correspondingly called \textit{TACTL-183} (`183' denoting the 183 total questions in the benchmark). %For \textit{TACTL-183}, we provide for an ATT\&CK TTP performance breakdown similar to what is provided for the \textit{Ground2Crown} benchmark results in \textcolor{blue}{Section 6.1}.%

\label{tab:tactl-183}
\end{table}

\textit{TACTL-183} benchmark results can be found in \textcolor{blue}{Table \ref{tab:tactl-183}} and the ATT\&CK TTP breakdown can be found in \textcolor{blue}{Appendix \ref{app:tactl183_attack_heatmap}}. One can observe that overall the models tested strong against the {\textit{TACTL-183} benchmark}. Of the 111 MITRE ATT\&CK techniques (or sub-techniques) represented in the \textit{TACTL-183 benchmark}, for only 4 of the techniques did the models average score fall below \textless50\% accuracy, and for only 27 of the techniques did the models average score below \textless70\% accuracy. Among the models, \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} performed the best with \textbf{91.8\%} accuracy score, while \textbf{Mixtral 8x22B} performed the worst with \textbf{65\%} accuracy. Of note, all the recently published \textbf{DeepSeek} models performed at the top of our observed performance range. Beyond raw performance, the \textit{TACTL-183} benchmark also further highlighted differences in the inference-time and quantity of output tokens observed in model testing. Along these metrics, \textbf{DeepSeek R1} and \textbf{DeepSeek R1**} performed notably worse, on the order of 1-2 order of magnitude longer for inference time and 2-3 orders of magnitude larger number of output tokens. However, the improvement from \textbf{DeepSeek V3} to \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} suggests the model’s cheap tuning on ``reasoning” traces did enhance offensive cyber reasoning capabilities.

 %The time-to-inference and output token sizes alone may negate the obvious performance advantages compared to that of the \textbf{GPT-4o} model.%

These results also highlight an interesting aspect of the OCCULT methodology with regards to the \textit{LLM Use-Case}. The choice of an LLM by an operator may highly depend on how quickly that LLM can answer questions when deployed as an autonomous agent, as timing of actions and decisions is a critical aspect of an offensive operation. For example, as shown in \textcolor{blue}{Table \ref{tab:tactl-183}}, the total inference time it takes the \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} model, as the highest scoring model, to complete the benchmark is 1861 seconds (or 31 minutes). The potential benefits of enhanced OCO capability found in the \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} model may not be worth the additional 1844 seconds (or 30 minutes) required over the next best model, in this case \textbf{Llama 3.1 405B}. The \textbf{DeepSeek-R1} model and its variants may not be the ideal choice for certain autonomous use-cases as the inference time taken are orders of magnitude more to reach their higher performance (scores) on this benchmark. Thus, if inference time is the most important constraint for an OCO use case, then the \textbf{GPT-4o} model is the most ideal model, which for the \textit{TACTL-183} benchmark led with 8 seconds of inference time.


\subsection{BloodHound - Equivalency}

The BloodHound Equivalency test was conducted to assess the ability of a LLM to identify and explore connections between objects in a simulated active directory environment. After running a preliminary round of trials on \textbf{Mixtral 8x7B} and \textbf{Mixtral 8x22B} models, initial results demonstrated a combined (all LLMs tested) average correct answer rate of \textit{52.5\%} for 12 pre-built queries tested, averaged over five trials per model; see \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:bloodhound_obj_query_model}}. Results are present only for the \textbf{Mixtral 8x7B} and \textbf{Mixtral 8x22B} models as the other models did not have large enough token limits to receive the BloodHound active directory information without summarization of active directory data or adjustment. The correct answers were calculated based on how many relevant active directory artifacts the LLM was able to produce in response to the natural language query. Specifically, if the LLM was able to produce at least half the number of ground truth active directory objects that is considered a successful answering of the query. In the 10 pre-built queries tested, the LLMs gathered 622 relevant active directory artifacts out of the total 922 possible objects; see \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:bloodhound_obj_query}} for a breakdown of these results based on individual queries. 


\begin{figure*}[!htb]

\caption{Model performance by BloodHound query per trial.

\label{fig:bloodhound_obj_query_model}
\end{figure*}

The test results revealed that the LLMs tested were able to identify key Active Directory attributes and relationships, such as Domain Administrators or Kerberoastable users. A rudimentary understanding of Active Directory structures and their applications to offensive cyber operation techniques was demonstrated despite an unimpressive correct answer rate that already is lenient by only requiring the LLM to identify 50\% of the total objects possible.

\caption{A summation of the total number of objects found per query across all 5 trials across all LLMs tested (Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x22B).

\label{fig:bloodhound_obj_query}
\end{figure*}


However, an analysis of the preliminary results highlighted some current limitations in LLM performance. First, in responses for which the LLM deviated from the specified data format, the evaluation had to rely on string comparison. Despite these challenges, the LLM consistently produced results that closely aligned with the outputs of the pre-built BloodHound queries, particularly in straightforward tasks like identifying domain admins through security identifiers. Second, a steep decline in both the correct answer rate and the number of collected query targets was observed as query complexity increased, see \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:bloodhound_complex}}. These findings suggest that while the LLMs show promise in automating analysis of complex network environments, there is room for improvement, especially in environments where deep contextual knowledge is needed to satisfy the query sufficiently.

\subsection{\textit{CyberLayer} - \textit{Worm} Scenario}

The \textit{CyberLayer} performance on the \textit{Worm} scenario was evaluated by goal completion, the number of actions taken to complete the goal, and the number of artifacts left during the operation. The goal for this operation is to move from one host to another specified host within the subnet specifically using the \textit{esentutl} tool as a live-off-the-land lateral movement technique. It necessarily requires the correct host to be discovered as well as users with credentials that can access the share on the target host. These metrics are reported for the maximum level of guidance, \textit{Level 3}, provided to the LLM under test. \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{fig:cl_guided}} displays the initial results of the tested LLMs (in order from left-to-right) in addition to a non-LLM guided random agent baseline for comparison.
This figure details the span of steps taken to reach an established and unchanging goal within the \textit{Worm} Scenario across a range of 15 trial runs per LLM where the network topology random seed is changed for every trial, but stays consistent for each LLM in that trial. This effectively tests how consistent and precise a given LLM under test is at reaching a goal when slight variations of network topology are introduced and how consistent LLMs perform in comparison to each other with that same network topology set by the random seed. High variance in step count indicates less consistent planning.

\caption{\textit{CyberLayer} - \textit{Worm} Scenario. Guidance provided. A more compact range of number of steps indicates a more optimal performing LLM at reaching the established goal consistently across random changes to network topology.}
\label{fig:cl_guided}
\end{figure*}

 
 Most notably, the \textbf{Meta Llama 3.1 70B} model can consistently reach target in the least number of steps. We can additionally pull from action history data, and this model rarely deviates from selecting actions on only the source and target hosts, resulting in the least number of artifacts generated and a more consistent action path to the goal as seen in \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_guided}}. Comparatively, the \textbf{Meta Llama 3.1 8B} and \textbf{Command R+} models have wide ranges in number of steps taken, generally indicating less consistency in reaching the goal. In terms of the actions selected, these models tend to advance quickly in the scenario to learn and gather the necessary information about the target host early on. However, they have significant difficulties in selecting erroneous actions across other hosts before selecting the final correct action, which is also indicated by their higher artifact count.
 

In \textcolor{blue}{Table~\ref{tab:cl_guided}} we can see two important features. First, generally models that take fewer actions and leave fewer artifacts indicate a more focused and ultimately stealthy default strategy without explicit instruction. Second, while some model's action counts are similar i.e., \textbf{Meta Llama 3.1 8B} and \textbf{Command R+ 104B}, their artifact count differs,  which indicates a large difference in the model's preferred sequence of actions. Moreover, it is clear the models do not choose actions randomly, which as observed leads to 10+ artifacts per action taken.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this work, we presented OCCULT, a methodology and framework for designing, building, and evaluating offensive cyber operation (OCO) test cases for LLMs. We first detailed our evaluation philosophy in terms of a core set of tenets describing what makes for effective and useful LLM evaluations. These tenets address the current gaps we see in the literature and open-source work regarding the evaluation of LLMs for offensive cyber capabilities, which requires measuring performance across different cyber tools, environments, and use-cases to encompass the breadth and depth of the offensive cyber landscape. We then outlined a corresponding methodology for how to design OCO test cases along the three measurable dimensions of OCO capability areas, an LLM's reasoning power, and its use-case to the operation/operator. We argue that well-made OCO test cases for LLMs must follow this methodology (or a similar approach) or else risk having only negligible utility when providing actionable results and risk assessments to cyber defenders.

Furthermore, we implemented three different test cases that were all designed via the OCCULT methodology and fall under the OCCULT framework. These tests were TACTL, Bloodhound Equivalency, and \textit{CyberLayer} cyber-attack simulations. In depth, we detailed the design, implementation, and evaluation mechanics of all three tests. Our purpose is to demonstrate the complexities and nuances of each test so the community can gain an appreciation of the OCO landscape and the fidelity with which future tests and metrics must be designed to quantify the real risks that LLMs pose as autonomous OCO enablers. 

To demonstrate how the OCCULT framework is actualized, we presented the OCCULT LLM Evaluation/Leaderboard platform. As demonstrated, the prototype platform, while still a beta, is already functional and extendable given its streamlined architecture and use of many existing LLM prompting and integration APIs.  While benchmarks and frameworks exist within the LLM/AI community and tests will naturally differ in reported metrics, a unified and transparent methodology like the OCCULT framework will allow for more realistic, and therefore more impactful, assessment of this emerging technology. 

Finally, we provided a small set of preliminary evaluation results for each of these tests against a cadre of LLMs that were readily available to us when prototyping OCCULT. We emphasize that these preliminary results are too small to draw more significant conclusions, albeit they did provide for interesting insights into the mechanics of the test cases. See \textbf{Future Work} section for notes on forthcoming rounds of major LLM testing.

\subsection{Future Work \& Community Contributions to OCCULT Test Cases}

Our research team’s next project is to complete a new round of LLM benchmark testing against our three test cases. We plan to publish these evaluation results in early 2025.

Please note that MITRE believes this work will have the most benefit for the community if the community becomes involved in developing the OCCULT test corpus, as no one organization has the resources to make good test cases for all OCO categories and use cases. Thus, we are asking anyone who would like to contribute to OCCULT in any of the following ways to please connect with the corresponding authors:

\begin{itemize} 
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Contribute to existing test cases.
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Identify and create new test cases.
\item \vspace{-0.2cm} Help us improve the standardization and shareability of OCO benchmarks and evaluation tooling.
\end{itemize}

We plan to release the TACTL and Bloodhound Equivalency tests cases and data sets to the public in the near future, as well as the OCCULT evaluation platform to allow for ease of benchmark testing and analysis. Additionally, we are aiming to create further OCCULT test cases and benchmarks for prioritized areas of cyber security threats and concerns in 2025.
