\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduced \coolname{}, an optimized training and inference schema designed for seamless integration into any range-view-based network. To enhance the scalability, we further developed two data augmentation techniques for class rebalance and occupancy increase. Additionally, we proposed a novel unsupervised post-processing method to effectively address the "many-to-one" issue, minimizing the 2D-to-3D performance gap. Our approach has substantiated significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over baselines across various network architectures on two widely used LiDAR benchmarks. Despite the limitation in some corner case of class imbalance in the dataset, our approach shows its overall versatility and effectiveness in advancing LiDAR semantic segmentation.
