\section{Discussion and Future Work}\label{sec:discussion}
This paper pioneers the novel approach of selective response, showing that withholding responses can be a powerful tool for GenAI systems. By opting not to answer every query as accurately as it can---particularly when new or complex topics emerge---GenAI can encourage user participation on community-driven platforms and thereby generate more high-quality data for future training. This mechanism ultimately enhances GenAI's long-term performance and revenue. From a welfare perspective, our results indicate that such selective engagement can also benefit users, leading to better solutions and increased overall satisfaction. Since this work is the first to address selective response strategies for GenAI, numerous promising directions remain for future research; we highlight some of them below. 

First, from a technical standpoint, all of the results in this paper rely on Assumption~\ref{assumption: data lip}, involving the lipshitz condition of the accuracy function and the sensitivity parameter $\beta$. Future work could seek to relax this assumption. Furthermore, our constrained optimization approach in Subsection~\ref{sec: welfare constrained revenue maximization} could be extended to approximate the optimal (continuous) strategy instead of the optimal discrete strategy.

Second, our stylized model adopts the simplifying---though unrealistic---assumption that only a single GenAI platform exists. Admittedly, this makes it easier to focus on the idea of selective responses, and indeed, this assumption is pivotal in keeping our analysis tractable. Future research could explore scenarios with multiple GenAI platforms and human-centered forums. In such settings, one platform's selective response might redirect users not only to forums but also to competing GenAI platforms, leading to the tragedy of the commons \cite{hardin1968tragedy}: Although all GenAI platforms benefit from fresh data generation, none may choose to respond selectively if it means losing users to competitors. 

Third, we assumed Forum behaves non-strategically. In reality, human-centered platforms often monetize their data by selling it to GenAI platforms, adding a further layer of strategic interaction for GenAI. Moreover, data transfer between the platforms can form the basis for collaboration: GenAI could employ selective response to bolster Forum content creation, and Forum could, in turn, attribute that content to GenAI for subsequent use in retraining.


%Third, we make the (again) simplifying assumption that Forum is non-strategic. However, in practice, human-centered platforms can sell their data to GenAI platforms. This adds additional considerations for GenAI. Furthermore, data transmission between the platforms can also become the basis for collaboration: GenAI can use selective response to ensure enough content is generated in Forum, and Forum could provide the data attributed to this mechanism back to GenAI. 


%Second, this paper makes the simplifying yet unrealistic assumption of the existence of one GenAI platform. Indeed, this simplifies many aspects and allows us to analyze selective responses. Future work could address the data generation process with more than one GenAI platform and possibly several human-centered forums. In such a case, selective response of one GenAI platform can either drive users to forums or to other GenAI platforms; thus, we might face a tragedy of the commons situation~\ref{hardin1968tragedy}, where all GenAI platforms are interested in fresh data generation but none volunteer to selectively respond and lose users. 

%This paper examines the competition between a generative AI platform and human-based platforms, challenging the assumption that always providing answers is optimal. We analyzed the impact of withholding answers on GenAI's revenue and developed an efficient approximately optimal algorithm for this purpose. We further explored how withholding affects users, showing that it can lead to better outcomes compared to always answering. Specifically, we demonstrated that withholding can Pareto-dominate this strategy and derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for that. Finally, we proposed a second approximately optimal algorithm that maximizes GenAI's revenue while ensuring users are better off than when GenAI answers all queries.

%On a more conceptual level, our model assumes that GenAIâ€™s data comes solely from the competing platform (Forum). Future research could explore a scenario where GenAI can purchase additional data from a third party. This extension could provide valuable insights into the interplay between withholding answers and data purchasing, and whether these two strategies can complement each other or must be traded off.
