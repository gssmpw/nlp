abstract = {Discovering the source of a patient's fever without clinically localised signs can be a daunting task for doctors. In particular for leukaemia patients with fever of unknown origin, fast discovering the source of the fever is a formidable challenge, as this population has the potential to lead to fever in many different situations. In this paper, we applied XGBoost algorithm to predict the pathogenic infections from a big data repository of leukemia patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and compared the performance with other machine learning algorithms. Our results illustrates that those machine learning algorithms achieves good performance. In particular, the XGBoost obtains the best performance with an area under receiving-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.8376 and F1-score of 0.7034. Compared with existing literature, our experiment provides new insights for doctors to determine the cause of fever in leukemia patients.},

abstract = {Background
Criteria classifying fever of unknown origin (FUO) patients remains subject to discrepancies. A minimal standardized set of investigative tests serves as the foundation for the qualitative criteria, whereas quantitative incorporates the length of evaluation (7 or 3 days). A systematic review of studies would help physicians anticipate the frequency of illness types that could influence management.
Methods
Prospective studies published in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from January 1, 1997 to July 31, 2022, were included. A meta-analysis estimated associated pooled proportions between these criteria and diagnostic outcomes adjusted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) definitions.
Results
Five qualitative studies corresponded to an increase of 15.3% (95% CI: 2.3%-28.3%, P = .021) in undiagnosed FUO proportions compared to eleven quantitative studies. Quantitative studies had 19.7% (95% CI: 6.0%-33.4%, P = .005) more in adjusted infectious disease proportions than qualitative studies. No significant differences in proportions between FUO defining criteria were noted for adjusted noninfectious inflammatory disorders (P = .318), oncology (P = .901), non-inflammatory miscellaneous disorders (P = .321), diagnostic evaluation process, gross national income (GNI), or World Health Organization (WHO) geographic region.
Conclusions
Use of either qualitative or quantitative FUO criteria was associated with a statistically significant risk of over- or under-estimating infectious diseases and undiagnosed illnesses when using an ICD-10 adjusted FUO five-category system. Clinicians should anticipate differences depending on which criteria are used. While further research is warranted, qualitative criteria provide the best framework for study comparisons.}

  abstract = {Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a diagnostic challenge, with its cause remaining undiagnosed in approximately half of patients. Nuclear medicine tests typically are performed after a negative or inconclusive initial workup. Gallium-67 citrate and labeled leukocytes were previous mainstays of radionuclide imaging for FUO, although they had limited diagnostic performance. FDG PET/CT has subsequently emerged as the nuclear medicine imaging test of choice, supported by a growing volume of evidence. A positive FDG PET/CT result contributes useful information by identifying potential causes of fever, localizing sites for further evaluation, and guiding further management; a negative result contributes useful information by excluding focal disease as the cause of fever and predicts a favorable prognosis. In 2021, CMS rescinded a prior national noncoverage determination for FDG PET for infection and inflammation, leading to increasing national utilization of FDG PET/CT for FUO workup. This article reviews the current status of the role of FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of patients with FUO. The literature reporting the diagnostic performance and yield of FDG PET/CT in FUO workup is summarized, with comparison with historically used nuclear medicine tests included. Attention is also given to the test's clinical impact; protocol, cost, and radiation considerations; and application in children.}

Various types of disease can cause FUO, but the cause remains unknown in a certain proportion of FUO, even when the advanced diagnostic methodologies are used. FDG-PET/CT is regarded as a second-line modality in the diagnostic process of FUO, and its potential to identify the cause of FUO will be maximized when the appropriate clinical considerations are understood. Accordingly, this review presents basic knowledge regarding FUO, and reports the current status of FDG-PET/CT applied to diagnosing the cause of FUO, including diagnostic performance, test protocols, possible factors influencing the diagnostic result, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. This knowledge will enable effective future use of FDG-PET/CT to improve outcomes in patients with FUO.}

ABSTRACT = {Conventional diagnostic imaging is often ineffective in revealing the underlying cause in a considerable proportion of patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO). The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) in patients with FUO. We retrospectively reviewed 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed on 50 consecutive adult patients referred to our department for further investigation of classic FUO. Final diagnosis was based on histopathological and microbiological findings, clinical criteria, or clinical follow-up. Final diagnosis was established in 39/50 (78%) of the patients. The cause of FUO was infection in 20/50 (40%), noninfectious inflammatory diseases in 11/50 (22%), and malignancy in 8/50 (16%) patients. Fever remained unexplained in 11/50 (22%) patients. 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan substantially contributed to the diagnosis in 70% of the patients, either by identifying the underlying cause of FUO or by directing to the most appropriate site for biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 18F-FDG-PET/CT for active disease detection in patients with FUO were 94.7%, 50.0%, 84.0%, 85.7%, and 75.0%, respectively. In conclusion, whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/CT is a highly sensitive method for detection of the underlining cause of FUO or for correctly targeting suspicious lesions for further evaluation.},

  abstract = {Advancements in deep learning techniques carry the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare, particularly in fields that utilize medical imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.}

  abstract = {Language-supervised pretraining has proven to be a valuable method for extracting semantically meaningful features from images, serving as a foundational element in multimodal systems within the computer vision and medical imaging domains. However, the computed features are limited by the information contained in the text, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging, in which the findings described by radiologists focus on specific observations. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of paired imaging–text data due to concerns over the leakage of personal health information. In this work, we fundamentally challenge the prevailing reliance on language supervision for learning general-purpose biomedical imaging encoders. We introduce RAD-DINO, a biomedical image encoder pretrained solely on unimodal biomedical imaging data that obtains similar or greater performance than state-of-the-art biomedical-language-supervised models on a diverse range of benchmarks. Specifically, the quality of learned representations is evaluated on standard imaging tasks (classification and semantic segmentation), and a vision–language alignment task (text report generation from images). To further demonstrate the drawback of language supervision, we show that features from RAD-DINO correlate with other medical records (for example, sex or age) better than language-supervised models, which are generally not mentioned in radiology reports. Finally, we conduct a series of ablations determining the factors in RAD-DINO’s performance. In particular, we observe that RAD-DINO’s downstream performance scales well with the quantity and diversity of training data, demonstrating that image-only supervision is a scalable approach for training a foundational biomedical image encoder.}
