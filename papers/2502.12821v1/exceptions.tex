\section{$Q_1$ exceptions}
\label{sec:exceptions-q1}
Regarding the constants redefinition task, we consider some exceptions to the default $Q_1$: \textit{What is the first -non-zero- digit of \{constant\}?}. These exceptions are listed in Table \ref{tab:exceptions-q1}. Those questions directly trigger the existing knowledge of LLMs, mostly requesting retrieving rather than reasoning on the queried information. For example, it is well known that $i^2=-1$ and there is no reasoning on the question \textit{$Q_1$: What is the value of $i^2$?}.

\begin{table}[h!]

    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline
    & $Q_1$ \\
\hline
$c$&  How far does light travel in one second? \\
$i$ & What is the value of $i^2$? \\
$\infty$ & What is the value of infinity? \\
zero & What is the absolute value of zero? \\
\hline
    \end{tabular}
