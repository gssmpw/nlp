\section{Related Work}
Previous methods for event relation extraction____ primarily utilize multi-class classification, MASK prediction, or prototype matching, focusing on addressing specific sub-tasks such as coreference, temporal, causal, or sub-event relations. In the classification-based approach____, event mentions are paired together, and additional features are incorporated, such as prototypes, logical rules, graph convolutional networks, or prompts. MASK prediction-based methods____ train a masked language model to predict the relation. The prototype matching method____ manually selects instances to serve as prototypes for each relation, and new instances are then matched against these prototypes. ____ and ____ each proposed reading comprehension models based on multi-choice and multi-span, respectively, allowing the model to select the correct answer from candidate options or to generate multiple answers simultaneously. Simultaneously, many entity relation extraction methods based on LLMs____ directly prompt large language models to generate relations between pairs of entities. However, these methods have several drawbacks. Therefore, we have designed a series of improvement measures to address these identified deficiencies.
