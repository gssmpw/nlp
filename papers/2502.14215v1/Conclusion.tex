\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work, we present \tool, the first LLM-driven framework for generating \emph{compilable}, and \emph{verified} secure program partitions to defend against manipulation vulnerabilities for smart contracts. Our evaluation on 18 annotated confidential smart contracts demonstrates that \tool is able to partition smart contracts with a success rate of 78\%, reducing around 30\% code compared to function-level partitioning. Furthermore, the evaluation results indicate that \tool could effectively defend against eight of nine real-world manipulation attacks through secure program partitioning, and the runtime overhead is moderate with gas increase between 61\% and 101\% when deploying partitions into a TEE-based infrastructure.
In the future, we plan to enhance \tool by incorporating automated identification of \secrete variables within smart contracts, enhancing partition ranking technique with external expert models, and further improving the effectiveness of secure program partitioning.
