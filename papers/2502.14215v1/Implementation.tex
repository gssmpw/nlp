% \section{Implementation}

% \subsection{Application Architecture}
% \ye{introduce how partitions are deployed and executed among normal blockchain and TEE-based blockchain.}

% \subsection{Off-chain Message Call}
% \ye{add intermediate user to play as a router conveying message between the partition in normal blockchain and the privilege partition in TEE-based blockchain.}


% \subsection{Orchestration of Third-party Contracts}
% \ye{Calls to third-party contracts could be classified into privilege partitions. This should be handled carefully. A way could be to assume external call always succeed. However, this may not true.}

% \subsection{Transformation of TEE Non-compliant Statements}
% \ye{According to the implementation of eEVM, it does not allow some opcodes including REVERT, RETURNDATACOPY, and .... We must avoid transaction reversion in privilege partition code.}
