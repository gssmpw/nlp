\begin{abstract}

This paper presents \name{}, a computational genomics acceleration platform that provides the illusion of practically infinite on-device memory capacity by compressing genomic data movement over PCIe.
\name{} introduces novel optimizations for efficient accelerator implementation to reference-based genome compression, including fixed-stride matching using cuckoo hashes and grouped header encoding, incorporated into a familiar interface supporting random accesses.
We evaluate a prototype implementation of \name{} on an affordable Alveo U50 FPGA equipped with 8~GB of HBM.
Thanks to the orders of magnitude improvements in performance and resource efficiency of genomic compression, our prototype provides access to TBs of host-side genomic data at memory-class performance, measuring speeds over 30\% of the on-device HBM bandwidth, an order of magnitude higher than conventional PCIe-limited architectures.
Using a real-world pre-alignment filtering application, \name{} demonstrates over 6$\times$ improvement over the conventional PCIe-attached architecture, achieving 30\% of peak internal throughput of an accelerator with HBM, and 90\% of the one with DDR4.
\name{} supports memory-class performance to practically infinite data capacity, using a small, fixed amount of HBM, making it an attractive solution to continued future scalability of computational genomics.
