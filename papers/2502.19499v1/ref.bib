  abstract = 	 {We study the problem of estimating the score function of an unknown probability distribution $\rho^*$ from $n$ independent and identically distributed observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming that $\rho^*$ is subgaussian and has a Lipschitz-continuous score function $s^*$, we establish the optimal rate of $\tilde \Theta(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}})$ for this estimation problem under the loss function $\|\hat s - s^*\|^2_{L^2(\rho^*)}$ that is commonly used in the score matching literature, highlighting the curse of dimensionality where sample complexity for accurate score estimation grows exponentially with the dimension $d$. Leveraging key insights in empirical Bayes theory as well as a new convergence rate of smoothed empirical distribution in Hellinger distance, we show that a regularized score estimator based on a Gaussian kernel attains this rate, shown optimal by a matching minimax lower bound. We also discuss extensions to estimating $\beta$-HÃ¶lder continuous scores with $\beta \leq 1$, as well as the implication of our theory on the sample complexity of score-based generative models.}

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputsâ30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibersâa manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}}

In this work, we show that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. With a generate-and-filter pipeline, we extract over a thousand training examples from state-of-the-art models, ranging from photographs of individual people to trademarked company logos. We also train hundreds of diffusion models in various settings to analyze how different modeling and data decisions affect privacy. Overall, our results show that diffusion models are much less private than prior generative models such as GANs, and that mitigating these vulnerabilities may require new advances in privacy-preserving training.},

  abstract = 	 {Neural networks are known to be a class of highly expressive functions able to fit even random input-output mappings with 100% accuracy. In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we highlight a learning bias of deep networks towards low frequency functions â i.e. functions that vary globally without local fluctuations â which manifests itself as a frequency-dependent learning speed. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the question of what functions can be captured by ReLU networks with an unbounded number of units (infinite width), but where the overall network Euclidean norm (sum of squares of all weights in the system, except for an unregularized bias term for each unit) is bounded; or equivalently what is the minimal norm required to approximate a given function. For functions $f:\mathbb R \rightarrow\mathbb R$ and a single hidden layer, we show that the minimal network norm for representing $f$ is $\max(\int \lvert fâ(x) \rvert \mathrm{d} x, \lvert  fâ(-\infty) + fâ(+\infty) \rvert)$, and hence the minimal norm fit for a sample is given by a linear spline interpolation.  }
