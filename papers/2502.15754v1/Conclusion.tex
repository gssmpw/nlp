\vspace{-2mm}\section{Conclusion} 
Text2Net represents a transformative approach to network simulation, bridging the gap between plain-text user input and fully functional network configurations. By leveraging LLMs and NLP, Text2Net automates the setup of complex network scenarios, making network simulations faster, more intuitive, and accessible. The evaluation highlights its efficiency, scalability, and educational value, as it significantly reduces the cognitive and operational overhead of manual configuration. Text2Net not only accelerates the learning curve for students and educators but also demonstrates potential applications in professional settings where rapid prototyping and testing are critical. This study is limited to routing, specifically static routing, as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate Text2Net's functionality. Future work will expand its capabilities to include Layer 2 protocols (e.g., VLAN and Spanning Tree Protocol) and advanced configurations like NAT and VPN. Additionally, we plan to replace RegEX and pattern matching with LangChain and RAGs, enabling dynamic retrieval and generation of accurate network commands. These enhancements will improve scalability and establish Text2Net as a versatile tool for network simulation, education, and professional use.
