In this work, we introduce Text2Net, a text-based computer network simulation engine, that introduces a transformative approach to computer network education. Text2Net leverages state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) text generation tools to interpret and transform plain-text descriptions of network topologies, configurations and functionalities, into dynamic and interactive simulations. This tool utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and large language models, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT-4T, to facilitate an intuitive interface that allows users (e.g. students, educators, and trainer/trainee engineers) to configure and interact with network simulations without the need for learning multiple simulation tools thus simplifying hands-on learning of networking. Text2Net addresses significant educational barriers by automating complex setup processes and making network learning faster, more accessible and engaging. This paper explores Text2Net's development, focusing on its innovative use of AI, the system's architecture, and its impact on network education. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's usability, performance, and educational value through qualitative analyses to demonstrate its effectiveness. Text2Net is a stepping stone to potentially revolutionize computer network education.
