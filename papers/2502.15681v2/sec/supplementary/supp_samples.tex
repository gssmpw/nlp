\section{Extended Samples}
\vspace{-2pt}
\label{app:extended}



We provide extended samples on CIFAR-10~(Fig.~\ref{fig:cifar-edm}~(multi-step teacher), Fig.~\ref{fig:cifar-js}~(KL, \method)); ImageNet-64~(Fig.~\ref{fig:imagenet-64-edm}~(multi-step teacher), Fig.~\ref{fig:imagenet-64-js}~(JS, \method)); COYO-700M~( Fig.~\ref{fig:sdxl-js-cfg-5}~(SDXL \method), Fig.~\ref{fig:sd-js-cfg-5}~(SDv1.5 \method)). The teacher and student models use the same random seeds and class labels/text prompts. We further provide the randomly sampled COYO-700M prompts for the generated samples in the main text and supplementary material below.
