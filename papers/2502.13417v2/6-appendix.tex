\section{Prompt Templates for Initial Alignment}
\label{appendix:prompt}
We structure the prompt using the following components to obtain the initial preference judgments from off-the-shelf LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.).  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Task description}: User-provided short description and instructions for the task.
    \item \textit{Preference criteria}: User-provided detailed criteria defining what is a good/bad response.
    \item \textit{Few-shot examples (optional)}: User-provided samples, chain-of-thought rationales and final preferences.
    \item \textit{Sample to annotate}: The target sample to be annotated.
\end{enumerate}
Below we provide our unified system prompt and user prompts used for HH-RLHF and TL;DR. Note that these prompts are not carefully tuned, as \myname{} should not assume ideal prompt engineering.

\#\# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Review the task, criteria, and input thoroughly.

2. Evaluate each response based on how well it aligns with the criteria.

3. Decide which response (A or B) is better aligned with the criteria.

}


\subsection{User Prompt for TL;DR}
\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\ttfamily

\#\# TASK

Summarize the given reddit post.

-------------------------------------------------

\#\# CRITERIA

What makes for a good summary? Roughly speaking, a good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the original – tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the same information as the original post. We would like you to consider these different dimensions of summaries:

**Essence:** is the summary a good representation of the post?

**Clarity:** is the summary reader-friendly? Does it express ideas clearly?

**Accuracy:** does the summary contain the same information as the longer post?

**Purpose:** does the summary serve the same purpose as the original post?

**Concise:** is the summary short and to-the-point?

**Style:** is the summary written in the same style as the original post?

Generally speaking, we give higher weight to the dimensions at the top of the list. Things are complicated though - none of these dimensions are simple yes/no matters, and there aren’t hard and fast rules for trading off different dimensions.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{appendix:setup}
\subsection{Data Preparation}
\subsubsection{Datasets}
We use the following datasets in our experiments:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \bbb{HH-RLHF:}
    We use Anthropic's helpful and harmless human preference dataset~\cite{bai2022training}, which includes 161K training samples. Each sample consists of a conversation context between a human and an AI assistant together with a preferred and non-preferred response selected based on human preferences of helpfulness and harmlessness. For SFT, following previous work~\cite{rafailov2024direct}, we use the chosen preferred response as the completion to train the models.
    \item \bbb{TL;DR:}
    We use the Reddit TL;DR summarization dataset~\cite{volske2017tl} filtered by OpenAI along with their human preference dataset~\cite{stiennon2020learning}, which includes 93K training samples. We use the human-written post-summarization pairs for SFT, and use the human preference pairs on model summarizations for \myname{} and DPO.
\end{itemize}

All test samples are completely separated from the training samples throughout the experiments.

\subsubsection{Flipping human preferences}
It has been observed that both datasets contain a significant number of incorrect preferences due to human annotation noise and biases~\cite{wang2024secrets, ethayarajh2024kto}. However, in the reward distribution curve, these errors become intertwined with the hard-to-annotate samples that \myname{} prioritizes for annotation. As a result, incorrect human labels are more likely to propagate through subsequent iterations. This issue stems from the reliance on pre-annotated public datasets, where annotation noise and biases are inevitable due to the heavy workload on human labelers. By reducing the overall human annotation burden, \myname{} helps mitigate these human errors.

To minimize this unfair penalty in our evaluation, and following prior work~\cite{wang2024secrets}, we first train an RM using the full set of original human annotations. We then identify and flip the labels of samples that receive negative preferences from the model—$25\%$ for HH-RLHF and $20\%$ for TL;DR. These flipped labels serve as the ground truth for all experiments.

To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we run DPO on both the flipped and unflipped datasets and compare their win rates against the SFT model. The results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:flipping_win_rate}, show that while both DPO models outperform the SFT baseline, the model trained on flipped labels achieves greater improvements across both datasets. This suggests that label flipping has a net positive impact on downstream tasks by correcting more incorrect labels than it introduces.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        \toprule
        Preference Source for DPO & HH-RLHF & TL;DR \\
        \midrule
        Unflipped & 51.0 & 59.4\\
        \textbf{Flipped} & \textbf{55.7} & \textbf{60.2} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Win rate against SFT (\%)}
    \label{tab:flipping_win_rate}
\end{table}

\subsection{Model Training}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \bbb{SFT:}
    We perform full-parameter fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-3B base model. We use learning rate $2e^{-5}$, warm up ratio $0.2$, and batch size of $32$ for training 4 epochs.
    \item \bbb{Reward Modeling:} 
    We train our reward model with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. This was a LoRA fine-tuning. We use learning rate $1e^{-4}$, warm up ratio $0.1$, LoRA rank 32, LoRA alpha 64, and batch size of $128$ for training 2 epochs. 
    \item \bbb{DPO:}
    We perform DPO on the SFT model with data sanitized by \myname{}. We use learning rate $1e^{-6}$, warm up ratio $0.1$, beta $0.1$ and $0.5$ for HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets, respectively, and batch size of $64$ for training 4 epochs.  
\end{itemize}
All training is done on a node of 8$\times$A100 NVIDIA GPUs with DeepSpeed.

\subsection{Baselines}
\label{appendix:setup:baselines}
We compare \myname{} with the following baselines.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textit{GPT-4o/GPT-4o mini}:
    This baseline involves directly using data annotated by GPT-4o/4o-mini to fine-tune a model for the downstream task, following an approach similar to RLAIF~\cite{lee2023rlaif}.
    \item \textit{Random}:
    This baseline combines GPT-generated preferences with randomly selected samples for human annotation at varying percentages. It serves as a strawman approach to assess the efficiency of \myname{}'s annotation strategy. Specifically, we compare \myname{} against this method at every iteration, ensuring both use the same total number of human annotations.
    \item \textit{Human}:
    This refers to RLHF with full human annotations. \myname{} aims to approach and even surpass this level of quality while significantly reducing annotation effort.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\myname{}-Specific Configurations}
\label{appendix:setup:config}
Unless stated otherwise, we use the following default configurations for \myname{}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] 
    \item \textbf{Sharding}: \myname{} is run on a randomly down-sampled 1/4 shard of the full dataset. 
    \item \textbf{Amplification Ratio}: The default value of $\alpha$ is set to 4. 
    \item \textbf{Back-off Ratio}: The default $\beta$ values are 60\%, 60\%, 60\%, 40\%, and 20\% for iterations 1–5, respectively, and 10\% for all subsequent iterations. 
    \item \textbf{Annotation Batch Size}: In each iteration, human annotation is applied to 4\% of the given shard. 
\end{itemize}

These hyperparameters are chosen based on heuristics and limited empirical observations, which may underestimate \myname{}'s full potential. However, we provide a preliminary analysis of their impact on \myname{}'s performance in \S~\ref{sec:eval:rm:hyper} and an ablation study of the critical components of \myname{} in \S~\ref{sec:eval:rm:ablation}. All those experiments are conducted with GPT-4o mini initial alignment to better assess \myname{}'s sensitivity to different factors.

\section{Obtaining Pair-wise Win Rate with AlpacaEval}
\label{appendix:win_rate}
To compute the pairwise win rate, we use the default annotator template \texttt{alpaca\_eval\_gpt4} in AlpacaEval but replace GPT-4 with Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the judge. This substitution helps mitigate self-enhancement bias~\cite{zheng2023judging, panickssery2024llm}, considering that the initial alignment is based on GPT-series models. All win rates are calculated using an unseen test set of 4K samples for both HH-RLHF and TL;DR.

Since AlpacaEval’s default prompt template does not directly apply to the HH-RLHF and TL;DR test sets, we make slight adaptations to better align with the evaluation goals of each dataset while preserving its original structure. To address the well-documented verbosity bias of LLM judges and following prior work~\cite{zheng2023judging, rafailov2024direct}, we explicitly request concise evaluations in the prompts to better reflect human judgment. We provide our adapted win rate prompt templates for the HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets.

%\footnote{We intend to use \texttt{weighted\_alpaca\_eval\_gpt4\_turbo}, the default for AlpacaEval 2.0. However, the Claude 3.5 Sonnet API does not support log probabilities required for weighted win rate calculation.}
