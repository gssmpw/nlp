Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with user preferences is challenging due to the high cost of quality human annotations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the generalizability limitations of AI Feedback. To address these challenges, we propose \myname{}, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. \myname{} identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that \myname{} reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7\% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on \myname{}'s curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of \myname{}'s strategic data curation.
