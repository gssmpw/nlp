\section{Conclusion and Limitations} 
\label{sec:conclusion} 
We present a unified and general humanoid whole-body controller. Through an extended command space and intervention training, \our enables versatile gait control while supporting external upper-body control, which can serve as a basic controller for extensive loco-manipulation tasks. Future works can adopt \our to control various humanoid robots, or take the policy trained by \our as a unified low-level controller to build a high-level planner to achieve complicated tasks.
