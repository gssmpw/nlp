\section*{Limitations}
While our study offers valuable insights into how author-level attributes influence AI text detection, our evaluation is primarily based on open-source detectors and the ICNALE corpus, which predominantly comprises texts from Asian English learners. Future work should extend this analysis to additional systems and more diverse datasets to further validate the generalizability of our findings.
