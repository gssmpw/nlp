%Numerous studies that analyze quote identification and recommendation processes utilizing information from well-known books, newspapers, magazines, different websites, etc. can be found in the research literature.\\ %The literature can be divided into four major parts -- a) quote identification, where the aim is to distinguish between quotable and non-quotable phrases based on certain linguistic features, b) given a context, quote recommendation (QR) attempts to recommend quotes from a list of available quotes, c) quotable paragraph identification, where the goal is to rank the most quotable paragraphs in the source document given the context,  and d) quote identification and recommendation, which attempts to simultaneously rank the paragraphs and recommend the most quotable phrase from a source document, given a context. We illustrate the recent works which cover each of those categories of research. \\

\noindent\textbf{The present work}: We extend the work of Yin et al., by proposing a novel retriever augmented multi-task reader based quote extraction. The framework employs a \textit{vector-store} based paragraph retriever followed by a decoder-only transformer based re-ranker and a novel multi-task based reader containing a sequence tagging module for identifying quotable phrases along with context aware span prediction. We curate three datasets of different genres and evaluate our approach. Our method outperforms all the previous baselines and generalizes better in a cross-domain few-shot setting.
