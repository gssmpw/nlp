\section{Discussion and future directions}

In this paper, we derive a novel matrix Hoeffding concentration inequality for Markov chains and a novel high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bound for martingales in the Wasserstein distance. 
We apply these results to obtain state-of-the-art finite sample convergence guarantees and Gaussian approximations for TD learning with Markovian observation. 
While this work addresses a wide range of theoretical problems, it also points to several directions for future research. First, it is of interest to further tighten the dependence on $d$ in the matrix Hoeffding's inequality of Theorem \ref{thm:matrix-hoeffding} and Corollary \ref{cor:matrix-hoeffding}; secondly, a more favorable, polylogarithmic dependence in $d$ in the Berry-Esseen bound in Corollary \ref{thm:Berry-Esseen-mtg} should be expected under the Kolmogorov distance; see \cite{KOJEVNIKOV2022109448}. In regards to other applications, beyond TD learning, Corollaries \ref{thm:matrix-bernstein-mtg} and \ref{thm:Berry-Esseen-mtg} provide powerful tools for analyzing the statistical properties of other Markov chain-based ML algorithms like MCMC, stochastic approximation and Q-learning. Finally, closing the gap between the $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ rate in the Berry-Esseen bound for TD with Markov data in Theorem \ref{thm:TD-berry-esseen} and the $O(T^{-\frac{1}{3}})$ rate for its independent-sample counterpart is also worth exploring.
