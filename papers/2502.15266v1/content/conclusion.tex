\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose the task of C2EC, which is an extended CSC task that handles misspellings and two previously ignored errors: redundant and missing characters.
To support this task, we construct a focused C2EC dataset containing real-world errors by combining and manually verifying two existing datasets.
We propose a training-free method for the C2EC task by extending the \texttt{TfPf} method.
Experiments show that our method achieves large improvements over both 10-shot in-context learning and the \texttt{TfPf} baseline on conventional CSC and C2EC datasets, achieving competitive performance with models nearly 50 times larger.
