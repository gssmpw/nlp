\begin{abstract}
One-max search is a classic problem in online decision-making, in which a trader acts on a sequence of revealed prices and accepts one of them irrevocably to maximize its profit. The problem has been studied both in probabilistic and in worst-case settings, notably through competitive analysis, and more recently in learning-augmented settings in which the trader has access to a {\em prediction} on the sequence. However, existing approaches either lack {\em smoothness}, or do not achieve optimal worst-case guarantees: they do not attain the best possible trade-off between the {\em consistency} and the {\em robustness} of the algorithm. We close this gap by presenting the first algorithm that simultaneously achieves both of these important objectives. Furthermore, we show how to leverage the obtained smoothness to provide an analysis
of one-max search in stochastic learning-augmented settings which capture randomness in both the observed prices and the prediction.
