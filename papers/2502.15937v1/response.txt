% Then talk about how we can potentially automatically discover these behaviors

% Then discuss combining humans and behavior discovery (Representation learning)
% Self-supervised learning enables neural networks to learn from patterns that are implicit within the training data without requiring the downstream labels of traditional supervised methods. Prior work explored swarm behavior discovery using semi-supervised learning, where the majority of training was entirely self-supervised and then human-labeled data was used to fine-tune the performance of the network**Zhang et al., "Discovering Swarm Behaviors with Deep Reinforcement Learning"**__**Kim et al., "Swarm Behavior Analysis with Deep Autoencoders"**. By contrast, we investigate using a completely self-supervised learning method with zero fine-tuning, resulting in the first end-to-end representation learning framework used in the context of behavior discovery that is completely human-free.
