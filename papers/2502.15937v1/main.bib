	abstract = {Spatial formations can give many social cues, such as illustrating a group of people are having a conversation (social affiliation), or that they are trying to move swiftly through a space (functional goal). This work explored how people perceive varied robots formations while navigating through a space and approaching people. Evaluation occurred across four different geometric formations: wedge, v-shape, vertical line, and horizontal line (Fig 3). Two studies were conducted: the first being an exploratory study of three robots navigating through a public space, and the second being a controlled user study of the same robots approaching humans in different formations. Results showed that triangle shapes were generally received more positively than lines, with wedge being the viewed as harmless, polite, welcoming, and encouraging the human to join the robot group, whereas horizontal line was seen as threatening and unwelcoming. From a path planning perspective, v-shape and wedge were also more robust to controller variance. Results from this work show that formation impacts how people perceive robots, and as a result may impact task success. Future researchers can use these results to inform their behavior design for multi-robot groups to increase task success and desired communication effects.},

There are a number of existing robot simulators, but only a few which target multi-robot systems. Those that do target multi-robot systems make use of complex software frameworks that can make them difficult to install and challenging for beginners to use. We address this gap by developing a simple and flexible simulator as a web application written in JavaScript, making it immediately accessible without the need for any installation or local configuration process. Users can interact with the robots and write control code directly in the browser. SwarmJS is tailored towards swarms of mobile robots operating in the plane and engaged in tasks such as aggregation, collision avoidance, object clustering, object sorting and planar construction. In this paper we present the motivation and design for SwarmJS and showcase its features on the tasks mentioned above.},

Prior work has considered behavior search for homogeneous swarms and proposed the use of novelty search over either a hand-specified or learned behavior space followed by clustering to return a taxonomy of emergent behaviors to the user. In this paper, we seek to better understand the role of novelty search and the efficacy of using clustering to discover novel emergent behaviors. Through a large set of experiments and ablations, we analyze the effect of representations, evolutionary search, and various clustering methods in the search for novel behaviors in a heterogeneous swarm. Our results indicate that prior methods fail to discover many interesting behaviors and that an iterative human-in-the-loop discovery process discovers more behaviors than random search, swarm chemistry, and automated behavior discovery. The combined discoveries of our experiments uncover 23 emergent behaviors, 17 of which are novel discoveries. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known emergent behaviors for heterogeneous swarms of computation-free agents. Videos, code, and appendix are available at the project website.2},

Rather than immediately try to shrink or `bridge the gap' anytime a real-world experiment failed that worked in simulation, we characterize conditions under which this is actually necessary. When these conditions are not satisfied, we show how very simple simulators can still be used to both (i) design new multi-robot systems, and (ii) guide real-world swarming experiments towards certain emergent behaviors when the gap is very large. The key ideas are an iterative simulator-in-the-design-loop in which real-world experiments, simulator modifications, and simulated experiments are intimately coupled in a way that minds the gap without needing to shrink it, as well as the use of minimally viable phase diagrams to guide real world experiments. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods on deploying a real multi-robot swarm system to successfully exhibit an emergent milling behavior.},

In this article, we review Swarm Chemistry and its variants as concrete sample cases to illustrate beneficial characteristics of heterogeneous swarm systems, including the cardinality leap of design spaces, multiscale structures/behaviors and their diversity, and robust self-organization, self-repair and ecological interactions of emergent patterns, all of which serve as the driving forces for open-ended evolutionary processes.

In computer simulations, the swarm is successful in locating over 90\% of survivors in less than an hour. The swarm is controlled by new sets of reactive behaviors which are presented and evaluated. The reactive behaviors integrate collision avoidance, battery recharge, formation control, altitude maintenance, and a variety of search methods to optimize the coverage area of camera and heart-beat locator sensors mounted on the robots. The behaviors are implemented in simulation on swarms of sizes from 1 to 20 robots. The simulation uses actual location data, including post-disaster satellite imagery, real locations of damaged and inundated buildings, and realistic victim locations based on personal interviews and accounts. The results demonstrate the value of using behavior-based swarming algorithms to control autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for post-disaster search and assessment. Three examples of algorithms that have been effective in simulation are presented.},

The direction in which the object moves is controlled by the way in which the robots distribute themselves around its perimeter — if the robots dynamically reallocate themselves around the section of the object's perimeter that occludes their view of the goal, the object will eventually be transported to the goal. This strategy is fully distributed, and makes no use of communication between the robots. A controller based on this strategy was implemented on a swarm of 12 physical e-puck robots, and a systematic experiment with 30 randomized trials was performed. The object was successfully transported to the goal in all the trials. On average, the path traced by the object was about 8.4\% longer than the shortest possible path.},

The novelty of our proposed solution is that it is applicable to extremely simple robots that lack run-time computation or storage. The solution requires only a single bit of information per robot-whether or not another robot is present in its line of sight. Computer simulations show that our deterministic controller, which was obtained through off-line optimization, achieves around 71-76\% coverage in a test scenario with no robot redundancy, which corresponds to a 26-39\% reduction of the area that is not covered, when compared to an optimized random walk. A moderately lower level of performance was observed in 20 experimental trials with 25 physical e-puck robots. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same controller can be used in environments of different dimensions and even to navigate a maze. The controller provides a baseline against which one can quantify the performance improvements that more advanced and expensive techniques may offer. Moreover, due to its simplicity, it could potentially be implemented on swarms of sub-millimeter-sized robots. This would pave the way for new applications in micro-medicine.},

The robots have no memory and are equipped with one binary sensor, which informs them whether or not there is another robot in their line of sight. It is proven that the sensor needs to have a sufficiently long range; otherwise aggregation cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of the controller used. The optimal controller is found by performing a grid search over the space of all possible controllers. With this controller, robots rotate on the spot when they perceive another robot, and move backwards along a circular trajectory otherwise. This controller is proven to always aggregate two simultaneously moving robots in finite time, an upper bound for which is provided. Simulations show that the controller also aggregates at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Moreover, in 30 experiments with 40 physical e-puck robots, 98.6\% of the robots aggregated into one cluster. The results obtained have profound implications for the implementation of multi-robot systems at scales where conventional approaches to sensing and information processing are no longer applicable.},

          ,  
            Many fish species gather by the thousands and swim in harmony with seemingly no effort. Large schools display a range of impressive collective behaviors, from simple shoaling to collective migration and from basic predator evasion to dynamic maneuvers such as bait balls and flash expansion. A wealth of experimental and theoretical work has shown that these complex three-dimensional (3D) behaviors can arise from visual observations of nearby neighbors, without explicit communication. By contrast, most underwater robot collectives rely on centralized, above-water, explicit communication and, as a result, exhibit limited coordination complexity. Here, we demonstrate 3D collective behaviors with a swarm of fish-inspired miniature underwater robots that use only implicit communication mediated through the production and sensing of blue light. We show that complex and dynamic 3D collective behaviors—synchrony, dispersion/aggregation, dynamic circle formation, and search-capture—can be achieved by sensing minimal, noisy impressions of neighbors, without any centralized intervention. Our results provide insights into the power of implicit coordination and are of interest for future underwater robots that display collective capabilities on par with fish schools for applications such as environmental monitoring and search in coral reefs and coastal environments.},

              . Two models of one-dimensional collective towing are compared: one in which transporters with different maximum speeds pull the payload with continuous, variable forces and another in which transporters with identical speeds pull with intermittent, unsynchronized forces. A statistical analysis of ant data supports the hypothesis that ants behave according to the first model, in which the steady-state transport speed is the maximum speed of the slowest teammate. By contrast, the ant data are not consistent with the second model, which predicts constant speed regardless of team size. To verify these predictions, the ant behaviours in each model are translated into decentralized controllers and implemented on teams of two to four robots. The controller for the first model incorporates a real-time reinforcement learning algorithm that successfully reproduces the observed relationship between ant team size and transport speed. The controller for the second model yields the predicted invariance of transport speed with team size. These results show the value of robotic swarms for testing mechanistic hypotheses about biological collectives.},

In this paper we propose an approach to self-healing swarm robotic systems and take inspiration from the process of granuloma formation, a process of containment and repair found in the immune system. We use a case study of a swarm performing team work where previous works have demonstrated that partially failed robots have the most detrimental effect on overall swarm behaviour.

The sensing and navigation capabilities of these robots are intentionally limited; no digital sensor data processing and no direct communication are allowed. In this way, we can approximate the features of smaller mesoscopic-scale systems and demonstrate that even such a limited swarm is nonetheless able to exhibit simple forms of intelligent and adaptive collective behavior.},

A swarm-bot is comprised of autonomous mobile robots called s-bots. S-bots can either act independently or self-assemble into a swarm-bot by using their grippers. We report on experiments in which we study the process that leads a group of s-bots to self-assemble. In particular, we present results of experiments in which we vary the number of s-bots (up to 16 physical robots), their starting configurations, and the properties of the terrain on which self-assembly takes place. In view of the very successful experimental results, swarm-bot qualifies as the current state of the art in autonomous self-assembly.},

One key aspect of the MARS concept is the low individual intelligence, meaning that each robot is equipped with only a minimum of sensor technology in order to achieve a low cost and energy efficient system that provides scalability and reliability for field tasks. The robot swarms are coordinated by a centralized entity (OptiVisor) which is responsible for path planning, optimization and supervision. It also serves as a mediator between the robots and different cloud services responsible for the documentation of the procedure. This paper focuses on the architecture and function of OptiVisor within the overall MARS system. An OptiVisor in combination with a simulation environment for a robot swarm is presented and shows the feasibility of the general concept and the current state of the algorithms. Furthermore, the paper shows results about the current progress of OptiVisor integration using real robots.},

	abstract = {Cooperative object transport in distributed multi-robot systems requires the coordination and synchronisation of pushing/pulling forces by a group of autonomous robots in order to transport items that cannot be transported by a single agent. The results of this study show that fairly robust and scalable collective transport strategies can be generated by robots equipped with a relatively simple sensory apparatus (i.e. no force sensors and no devices for direct communication). In the experiments described in this paper, homogeneous groups of physical e-puck robots are required to coordinate and synchronise their actions in order to transport a heavy rectangular cuboid object as far as possible from its starting position to an arbitrary direction. The robots are controlled by dynamic neural networks synthesised using evolutionary computation techniques. The best evolved controller demonstrates an effective group transport strategy that is robust to variability in the physical characteristics of the object (i.e. object mass and size of the longest object’s side) and scalable to different group sizes. To run these experiments, we designed, built, and mounted on the robots a new sensor that returns the agents’ displacement on a 2D plane. The study shows that the feedback generated by the robots’ sensors relative to the object’s movement is sufficient to allow the robots to coordinate their efforts and to sustain the transports for an extended period of time. By extensively analysing successful behavioural strategies, we illustrate the nature of the operational mechanisms underpinning the coordination and synchronisation of actions during group transport.},

Inspired by these interactions, this work presents a novel stochastic approach that allows a swarm of heterogeneous robots to create emergent patterns in a completely decentralized fashion and relying only on local information. Our approach consists of modeling the swarm configuration as a dynamic Gibbs Random Field (GRF) and setting constraints on the neighborhood system inspired by chemistry rules that dictate binding polarity between particles. Using the GRF model, we determine velocities for each robot, resulting in behaviors that lead to the creation of patterns or shapes. Simulated experiments show the versatility of the approach in producing a variety of patterns, and experiments with a group of physical robots show the feasibility in potential applications.},

journal={Swarm Intelligence},
volume={14},

pages={259-284},
abstract={Segregative behaviors, in which individuals with common characteristics are placed together and set apart from other groups, are commonly found in nature. In swarm robotics, these behaviors can be important in different tasks that require a heterogeneous group of robots to be divided in homogeneous sets according to their physical (sensors, actuators) or logical (algorithms) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a controller that can spatially segregate a swarm of robots in two specific ways: clusters and concentric rings. By segregation, we mean that the swarm is partitioned in groups, with similar robots belonging to a same group, and these groups are spatially separated from each other. We achieve this by adapting and extending the differential potential concept, an abstraction of the mechanism by which cells achieve segregation. We present stability analysis and perform simulated experiments in 2D and 3D spaces in order to show the robustness of the proposed controller. Experiments with a limited number of real robots are also presented as a proof of concept. Results show that our approach allows a swarm of heterogeneous robots to segregate in a stable, compact, and collision-free fashion.},
