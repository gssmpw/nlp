\section{Position vs. Current Stance}
\noindent\textbf{Position:} Sustaining human-generated data for ML requires shifting focus toward intrinsic human motivations.

\noindent\textbf{Majoritarian Stance:} Data quality is a major consideration in machine learning, and many researchers and companies are actively exploring how to best collect high-quality human-produced data. Researchers recognize that incentives influence the level of effort contributed, and as a result, they often rely exclusively on financial incentives to encourage greater effort in data production. While incentives are important, we contend that solely relying on financial rewards\textemdash{}counter to intuition\textemdash{}risks backfiring by reducing the quality of the data collected. Instead, ML researchers should prioritize enhancing the intrinsic motivation of human participants, using external incentives sparingly as supportive nudges rather than primary drivers.
