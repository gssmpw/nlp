Structure-based monocular VIO initialization methods can be divided into two categories, based on whether IMU measurements are used for the initialization of visual trajectory and structure (3D feature points). If IMU measurements are not needed for structure initialization, it is classified as loosely-coupled, otherwise it is tightly-coupled.

Typical loosely-coupled methods include **Mur-Artal et al., "ORB-SLAM2: An Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D Cameras"**. Pure visual SfM is leveraged to obtain up-to-scale camera trajectory and structure expressed in the camera frame **Kannala et al., "SIFT Flow: Dense Correspondence across Scenes and Its Applications"**. By aligning the rotation motions of IMU and camera, the gyroscope bias is solved. Then, the translation motions of IMU and camera are correlated and formulated as a linear system to be solved for the remaining initial states. **Li et al., "Visual-Inertial Odometry with High-Resolution Images"** get the initial camera trajectory through pure visual SLAM. Then, the motion correlation between IMU and camera is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem considering measurement uncertainty. The initial states are solved iteratively. Finally, structure-based VI-BA is performed to optimize both the initial state and structure. One drawback of loosely-coupled methods is that they rely on pure visual SfM or SLAM at the beginning, without considering the accuracy or robustness improvement from complementary IMU measurements on the initial trajectory, especially in challenging scenarios such as rapid rotation.

To jointly use IMU and visual bearing measurements for structure initialization, some researchers propose tightly-coupled methods, including **Li et al., "Visual-Inertial Odometry with High-Resolution Images"**. The gyroscope bias is assumed to be known or even negligible to obtain the rotational motion estimation. Furthermore, utilizing measurements from two sensors, the initial states and structure are jointly estimated through closed-form solutions. However, without accounting for gyroscope bias, the initialization accuracy could be severely affected **Mur-Artal et al., "ORB-SLAM2: An Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D Cameras"**. Meanwhile, the joint estimation for the visual landmarks may result in unstable numerical solution due to the lack of prior knowledge about the 3D information of feature points. **Li et al., "Real-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry on Mobile Devices"** attempt to use monocular depth prior inferred from deep learning based approach to better constrain initialization problem. However, these methods may suffer from the generalization issue inherited from deep learning and demand GPU enabled devices, significantly increasing computing resource and cost, and reducing power efficiency.

Both the loosely-coupled and tightly-coupled method mentioned above need to estimate the 3D visual structure. Processes like SfM, SLAM, or structure-based VI-BA are typically computationally expensive. Is it possible to tackle the VIO initialization problem without recovering the structure? Few papers address it from this perspective.

**Zhang et al., "LOKI: Low-Degree Polynomial-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry"** take the first step to investigate the structure-less method. The rotation constraints from the IMU **Li et al., "Real-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry on Mobile Devices"** are directly integrated into the frame-to-frame rotation constraints **Kannala et al., "SIFT Flow: Dense Correspondence across Scenes and Its Applications"**, which makes the gyroscope bias estimation gain benefit from tightly-coupled mode and improves rotation motion estimations. Then, both loosely-coupled and tightly-couple solutions are proposed in **Zhang et al., "LOKI: Low-Degree Polynomial-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry"** to estimate the rest of the initial states. These two solutions are formulated with linear translation constraints, and do not require the 3D structure reconstruction. Extensive experiments in **Li et al., "Visual-Inertial Odometry with High-Resolution Images"** show this structure-less initialization method outperforms SOTA structure-based initialization methods **Mur-Artal et al., "ORB-SLAM2: An Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D Cameras"**, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. However, decoupled estimation and linear constraints can compromise accuracy performance. To fully explore the accuracy of structure-less initialization method, we propose a novel structure-less VI-BA to refine the initial solution obtained from **Zhang et al., "LOKI: Low-Degree Polynomial-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry"**.
