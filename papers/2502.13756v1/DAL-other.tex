\section{Other Deontic Action Logics}\label{section:new:dals}
One of the main benefits of our algebraic treatment of $\DAL$ is that it can be extended using standard algebraic tools to cope with different versions of the logic.  In this section, firstly, we show how classical variations of 
$\DAL$ can be algebraically captured by standard algebraic constructions,  that is, equations, sub-algebras, and generated algebras.  One interesting point of these extensions is that the soundness and completeness properties of these extensions can be obtained by applying similar constructions to the Lindenbaum algebra presented in earlier sections.  Secondly, we consider intuitionistic versions of the logic by replacing the Boolean components of the algebras by Heyting algebras.  As far as we are aware, intutionistic deontic action logics have not been considered before in the literature. 
%We take advantage of the characteristics of our algebraic treatment of $\DAL$ and characterize some extensions and possible variations of \DAL.
