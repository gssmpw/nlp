\paragraph{Language.}\label{section:dal:syntax}

The language of {\DAL} consists of \emph{actions} and \emph{formulas}.
Actions, indicated $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, \dots, are built on a countable set $\bact = \set{\mathsf{a}_i}{i\in \Nat_0}$ of basic action symbols according to the following grammar:
%
\begin{align}
		\alpha,\beta & ::=
				\mathsf{a}_i
			\mid
				{\alpha \sqcup \beta}
			\mid
				{\alpha \sqcap \beta}
			\mid
				{\bar{\alpha}}
			\mid
				\mathsf{0}
			\mid
				\mathsf{1}. \label{definition:actions}
\end{align}%
We use $\act$ to indicate the set of all actions.
Formulas of \DAL, indicated $\varphi$, $\psi$, $\chi$, \dots, are built on the set $\act$ according to the following grammar:
%
\begin{align}
		\varphi,\psi & ::=
				{\alpha = \beta} \mid
				\perm(\alpha)
				\mid
				\forb(\alpha)
			% \mid
			% 	{\varphi \to \psi}
			\mid
				{\varphi \lor \psi}
			\mid
				{\varphi \land \psi}
			\mid
				{\lnot \varphi}
			\mid
				\bot
			\mid
				\top.
			\label{definition:formulas}
\end{align}%
We use $\form$ to indicate the set of all formulas of \DAL.
Intuitively, action symbols $\mathsf{a} \in \bact$ indicate a \emph{basic} action; actions ${\alpha \sqcup \beta}$ indicate the \emph{free-choice} composition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$; actions ${\alpha \sqcap \beta}$ indicate the \emph{parallel} composition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$; and $\bar{\alpha}$ indicate complement of $\alpha$. Finally, $\mathsf{0}$ and $\mathsf{1}$ indicate the \emph{impossible} and the \emph{universal} actions, respectively.
%
Turning to formulas, $\alpha = \beta$ indicates that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the same actions;  $\perm(\alpha)$ is read as $\alpha$ is \emph{permitted};
and $\forb(\alpha)$ is read as $\alpha$ is \emph{forbidden}.
Formulas built using $\land$, $\lor$, and $\lnot$, as well as $\bot$ and $\top$, have their standard interpretation.
We use $\varphi \to \psi$ as an abbreviation for $\lnot \varphi \lor \psi$, and $\varphi \liff \psi$ as an abbreviation for $(\varphi \to \psi) \land (\psi \to \varphi)$.
% Analogous to $\to$, we use $\alpha \sqsubset \beta$ as an abbreviation for $\bar{\alpha} \sqcup \beta$.
% Finally, we use $\obl(\alpha)$, read as $\alpha$ is \emph{obligatory}, as an abbreviation of $\forb(\bar{\alpha})$.

\medskip 

In \Cref{ex:syntax}, we present some actions and formulas of \DAL along with their intuitive interpretations.

\medskip

\begin{example}\label{ex:syntax}
Let $\mathsf{parking}$, $\mathsf{drinking}$, and $\mathsf{driving}$ be basic actions in $\bact$. Then:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\overline{\mathsf{parking}} = \mathsf{driving}$ asserts that `parking is the complement of (actively) driving';
	\item $\forb(\mathsf{drinking} \sqcap \mathsf{driving})$ asserting that `drinking while driving is forbidden';
	% \item $\neg\perm(\mathsf{teach \sqcup drink}$ stands for `it is nor permitted to teach while drinking';
	% \item ${{\overline{\mathsf{parking}} = \mathsf{driving}} \land \forb(\mathsf{drinking} \sqcap \mathsf{driving})} \to \forb(\overline{\mathsf{parking}} \sqcap \mathsf{drinking})$ intuitively says that since parking is the complement of driving, and drinking while driving is forbidden, then it is also forbidden to do anything other than parking while driving.
	\item $\forb(\mathsf{drinking} \sqcap \mathsf{driving}) \land \lnot\perm(\mathsf{drinking} \sqcap \mathsf{parking})$ asserting that `drinking while driving is forbidden' and that `it is not permitted to park while driving' either; indicating that operating a vehicle while drinking breaks the law.
