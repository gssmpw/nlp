In this section, we introduce the details of the \alg{} for batch SD and provide an analysis of its time complexity and optimality.
Overall, we leverage the insight that SD suffers from a cascading failure rate in a single sequence but not across different sequences.
More specifically, we distinguish between two types of tokens involved in drafting: \textit{sequential} and \textit{parallel}. 
For each request $r_i$, all pairs $(i, \cdot) \in \gD$ are sequential, i.e., for all $j < k$, $(i,j)$ must be accepted for $(i, k)$ to be accepted as well, implying a cascade of the failure rate. 
On the other hand, for $i \neq j$, $(i, \cdot)$ and $(j, \cdot)$ are parallel, as the failure rate of $(i, \cdot)$ does not influence that of $(j, \cdot)$. 
We highlight that the distinct nature of the two modes serves as the fundamental motivation of our proposed approach for an improved $\gG_{\text{step}}$, and consequently the total throughput $\gG$.
