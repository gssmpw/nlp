% \section*{Limitation}
% We acknowledge that there is a room for improvement on our annotation of the dataset. So far, our annotation is done on sentence level, sometimes it is hard to identify toxicity based on a single sentence, where the context should play an important role. However, given our goal of rewriting the toxicity, we find that annotation at the sentence level is important. Thus, in this work, we keep the annotation at the sentence level.
