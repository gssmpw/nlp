\maketitle



\begin{abstract}
Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems.
Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability and diffusion diversity.
In this paper, we study the dynamics of information diffusion in 12 asymmetric open environments defined by information content and distribution mechanisms. 
We first present a general framework to capture the features of information diffusion. 
Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of LLM-based attention.
Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. 
Additionally, we observe the emergence of information cocoons, the evolution of information gaps, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.

\section{Full Prompt for Agent Decision}

\label{appendix:agent_decision}
% \small
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
template = """Based on your attention infomation in this round [turn_number] [prompt_1], you will make the following decisions in sequence:

1. According to the weight value of each message, determine whether you will be influenced by this round of information. The information with larger weight values needs to be paid attention to. Select False if it is not influenced, and True if it is. Answer with 'action': True or False.

2. If 'action' is True:
- Decide if the action is to pass information. Answer with 'pass_information': True or False.
- Decide if the action is to change a relationship. Answer with 'change_relationship': True or False.

- If 'pass_information' is True (If you choose 'pass_information': False, then you don't need to do this part of reasoning):
    - Give full consideration to who you want to know this information. Decide whether the receiver of this information is new or existing. Answer with 'receiver_type': 'existing' or 'new'.
    - If 'receiver_type' is 'new':
        - You need to decide for yourself the profile of the agent that will receive the message. This agent should not be an existing one. Answer with 'receiver_type': 'new'.
        - Describe the new agent's attributes and the relationship between you and the new agent, which will be used to add this agent to the system. Answer with 'new_agent': SocialAgentProfile:{{{{"age", "gender", "Innate", "occupation"}}}}.
        - You need to decide what is your relationship with this new agent. Answer with 'relationship': 'general'/'positive'/'negative'.
        - Based on the chosen receiver, generate what you want to say based on your own identity and your attention. Change the content of the message as needed to fulfill your social purposes. Answer with 'argument':(the content text).
    - If 'receiver_type' is 'existing':
        - You need to send your message to an existing agent. This agent must be an existing one. Answer with 'receiver_type': 'existing'.
        - You need to decide which agent you will talk to. Answer with 'existing_id': 'The *integer value* of the agent id'.
        - Based on the chosen receiver, generate what you want to say based on your own identity and your attention. Change the content of the message as needed to fulfill your social purposes. Answer with 'argument':(the content text).

- If 'change_relationship' is True (If you choose 'change_relationship': False, then you don't need to do this part of reasoning):
    - Decide which relationship to change and what the new relationship status should be. Answer with 'relationship_change': 'agent_id' and 'new_relationship': 'general'/'positive'/'negative'.
