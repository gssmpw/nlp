Previous work by the authors considered UAV CM through rotor defect detection in pre/post flight settings ____. In past work, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to determine the best-performing ML model and the impact of the various feature sets on the model's predictive performance. However, there was no consideration of the impact of network resource utilization on the optimal solution, and accuracy was the only metric used to compare model performance. To address the limitations of past solutions and the gaps in the state-of-the-art, the work presented in this paper focuses on optimizing both the ML model performance (using additional ML model performance metrics) and the network resource utilization efficiency (using a crafted feature throughput metric).
The contributions of this work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The development of a network resource-aware UAV CM framework.
    \item A trade-off analysis between network resource utilization and ML model performance.
\end{itemize}
