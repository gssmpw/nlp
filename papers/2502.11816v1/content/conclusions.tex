\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We introduced \model{}, the first TS mixer architecture for IMTS forecasting.
The key innovation lies in its channel aggregation and decoding mechanism, which enables the use of fully connected layers on irregularly observed channels. 
Our ablation studies demonstrate that embedding and aggregation modules can be shared across channels, allowing for a universal transformation from irregularly observed data to fixed-sized vectors.

Our experiments show that \model{} outperforms competing methods on three out of four benchmark datasets. 
Moreover, on the fourth dataset (MIMIC), our experiment established a new state-of-the-art with GraFITi, while our model performs second best.
Additionally, our architecture achieves a speed-up in training and inference time.

For future work, we aim to explore how certain modules introduced in \model{} can benefit other forecasting models.
