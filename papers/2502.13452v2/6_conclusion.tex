\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present ELite, a LiDAR-based lifelong mapping framework that distinguishes map elements beyond static and dynamic using two-stage ephemerality. 
ELite integrates map alignment, dynamic object removal, and updates into a cohesive system, enhancing performance by propagating ephemerality across modules. 
By providing an extended representation for map changes, ELite enables meaningful updates and supports applications such as static map construction and spatial analysis. 
Real-world validation confirms its accuracy and reliability, making ELite a valuable tool for long-term robot operation.
