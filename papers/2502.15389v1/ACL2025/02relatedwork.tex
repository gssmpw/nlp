Visual prompting techniques is reported to enhance VQA accuracy and reduce hallucinations by emphasizing key image regions. For example, the Engineering Visual Prompting method addes red circles and arrows by hand~\citep{redcircle, mark}, while a semi-automated approach overlays segmentation data from models such as SEEM~\citep{seem}. To experiment on over 20,000 objects, API prompting, which is fully automated approach, was employed.

%Many studies have explored the use of visual prompting to highlight relevant image regions, aiming to improve VQA accuracy and mitigate hallucinations. The Engineering Visual Prompting method employs red circles and arrows to emphasize target areas~\citep{redcircle, mark}. A more automated approach supporting text-based prompting is proposed, which leverages segmentation by overlaying segmentation data from models such as SEEM~\cite{seem}. However, this method still requires manual effort to obtain segmentation data. In this work, to conduct experiments on over 20,000 objects, API prompting approach, which is fully automated, was used instead of a manual method.
