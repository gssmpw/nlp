This study employs the open-source MSCOCO dataset, restricting object categories to its 80 predefined classes. While this ensures consistency with previous vision-language research, it also introduces potential bias by excluding objects outside these classes. Future work should assess whether similar visual prompting techniques are effective across a broader range of objects and datasets.

Additionally, API Prompting method relies entirely on VLM outputs, constraining its performance to the accuracy and biases of the underlying model. Although this study focuses on mitigating object hallucination, API Prompting cannot guarantee fully reliable object recognition. Researchers and practitioners should be mindful of these limitations, especially in high-stakes scenarios where incorrect outputs might lead to misinterpretations.
