One limitation of this study is that it only evaluated LLaVA as the target Vision Language Model (VLM), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other models. Additionally, the alignment of visual attention heatmaps for non-existing objects was not assessed, indicating that further analysis is needed in this area. 

Moreover, the experiments were conducted solely using the MSCOCO dataset, and future work should expand the evaluation to include additional datasets to ensure the robustness and broader applicability of the results. Furthermore, since datasets that contain both questions and corresponding answers alongside matching segmentation data, which can be used to evaluate object hallucination, are scarce, it may be necessary to develop such datasets.
