\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present \benchall, a dual-channel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' generation for Triton operators. \benchone integrates real-world Triton operator samples from open repositories, while \benchtwo introduces complementary tasks that align with PyTorch interfaces. Our evaluation framework addresses both functional accuracy and the performance on NVIDIA GPUs. 
We also conduct extensive experiments and detailed analysis on our benchmark, and find that current LLMs struggle to generate high-quality Triton operators, underscoring the necessity for further advancement in generating accurate as well as performance-aware Triton code. 
We anticipate \benchall will serve as an essential framework for advancing automated operator generation for Triton.
