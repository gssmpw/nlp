Please evaluate the complexity of the code in the following two aspects based on the requirements of the Triton operator and score it from simple to complex on a scale from 1 to 5: \\
1) Memory layout complexity: Analyze the memory access pattern, including memory tiling, array transposition, address alignment, cache utilization, and the number of global memory accesses. \\
2) Computation scheduling complexity: Examine instruction-level parallelism, computation-memory pipeline, thread block design, inter-thread communication, thread branch divergence, and hardware resource utilization. \\
The final score is the ceiling of the average score from both aspects, and only one complexity score is output in [ ].
