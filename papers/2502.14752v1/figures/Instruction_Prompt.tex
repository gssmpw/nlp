Based on the above Triton operator code, generate a detailed description so that the large model can accurately reproduce the corresponding kernel and wrapper function. \\
Be clear about the logic and main functionality of the operator, specify the function name, inputs, and outputs, and describe any public variables clearly. \\
Try to describe the function's code implementation. Ensure that the large model can reproduce the corresponding function and parameter code based on these instructions. \\
Note that the output should maintain correct python syntax. \\
