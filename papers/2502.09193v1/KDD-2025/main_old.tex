\begin{abstract}
Overfitting is a well-known issue in machine learning that occurs when a model struggles to generalize its predictions to new, unseen data beyond the scope of its training set. 
Traditional techniques to mitigate overfitting include early stopping, data augmentation, and regularization.
In this work, we demonstrate that the degree of overfitting of a trained model is correlated with the ability to generate \textit{counterfactual examples}. The higher the overfitting, the easier it will be to find a valid counterfactual example for a randomly chosen input data point.
Therefore, we introduce CF-Reg, a novel regularization term in the training loss that controls overfitting by ensuring enough margin between each instance and its corresponding counterfactual.
Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and models show that our \textit{counterfactual regularizer} outperforms existing regularization techniques.
%three main advantages of our approach: \textit{(i)} it can be used to quantify the degree of overfitting of a model, \textit{(ii)} it suggests a novel training procedure that \textit{simultaneously} learns the base model and its associated counterfactual explainer, and \textit{(iii)} it can make use of the entire training set without the need to hold out samples for testing.

% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.

% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.  

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.
