\section{Experimental Setup Details}
\subsection{Hyperparameters for DT1: Action Classification}
\label{appx:dt1}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dt1}, we evaluate MoFM on NTU-RGB+D~\cite{ntu60Paper} (60 classes) and NTU-RGB+D-120~\cite{ntu120paper} (120 classes) for action recognition. The detailed hyperparameters for training on both datasets are presented in Table~\ref{tab:training_setup_ntu}.
%We used the NTU-RGB+D \cite{ntu60Paper} and NTU-RGB+D-120 \cite{ntu120paper} datasets for action classification experiments, following both Cross-Subject (X-Sub) and Cross-View (X-View) splits. The NTU-120 dataset was also used for one-shot action classification experiments. Tables  \ref{tab:dt1_training_setup_nt60} and  \ref{tab:dt1_training_setup_ntu120} summarize the hyperparameters for reproducibility.

\subsection{Hyperparameters for DT2: One-shot Action Calssification}
\label{appx:dt2}
We evaluate MoFM for one-shot action recognition on NTU-RGB+D-120~\cite{ntu120paper}. The model is trained on the auxiliary set (100 samples per class) using supervised contrastive learning~\cite{khosla2020supervised}, where \(m=2\) samples per class are randomly selected in each batch. Training hyperparameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dt2_training_setup}.

\subsection{Hyperparameters for DT3: Self-supervised Human Anomaly Detection}
\label{appx:dt3}
%As detailed in \cref{sec:sht}, we utilized the widely used SHT \cite{liu2018future} dataset to evaluate and demonstrate the self-supervised anomaly detection capabilities of our model. In alignment with the standard convention for self-supervised anomaly detection, the model was exclusively trained on normal data to effectively learn and understand normal behavior patterns. The detailed hyperparameters for fine-tuning can be found in \cref{appx:dt3}. Please note that the hyperparameters remain the same for HR-SHT, as it is a subset of the SHT dataset. HR-SHT \cite{morais2019learning} uses the same training set but features a different test set, which focuses exclusively on human-related anomalies.
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sht}, we evaluate MoFM on the SHT~\cite{liu2018future} dataset and its human-centric subset HR-SHT~\cite{morais2019learning} for anomaly detection. The training hyperparameters for both datasets are presented in Table~\ref{tab:fine_tuning_setup_dt3}. Please note that the hyperparameters remain the same for HR-SHT, as it is a subset of the SHT dataset. HR-SHT \cite{morais2019learning} uses the same training set but features a different test set, which focuses exclusively on human-related anomalies.

\subsection{Hyperparameters for DT4: Supervised Human Anomaly Detection}
\label{appx:dt4}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sup_anomaly}, for supervised anomaly detection we utilized the UBnormal dataset \cite{Acsintoae_CVPR_2022}. Detailed hyperparameters for the fine-tuning process are provided in Table \ref{tab:extended_fine_tuning_setup_dt4} to ensure reproducibility.
