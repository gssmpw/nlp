\section{Foreword}


Welcome to this Introductory Textbook on Geometry and Information Geometry! Whether you are a student, researcher, or simply someone curious about this fascinating field, this book is designed to provide you with a clear and accessible entry point into the world of geometry and its modern extension into information geometry.

Geometry, in its many forms, has been a cornerstone of mathematics for centuries. With the advent of information theory and machine learning, new geometric structures have emerged that help us better understand complex probabilistic models, optimization, and data analysis. Information geometry is one such powerful framework, blending classical differential geometry with modern applications in probability and statistics.

This book is structured to guide you from the fundamentals of topology and differentiable manifolds to the more advanced concepts of probability geometry and Frobenius manifolds. The progression is designed to be intuitive, allowing you to build your knowledge step by step.

Throughout the chapters, you will find exercises to test your understanding, as well as solutions to some of the more challenging problems to aid your learning. To complement the material, you are encouraged to follow along with the accompanying YouTube video (see the QR code below), which aligns with this textbook and served as an inspiration for its creation.

We hope this book provides you with both insight and enjoyment as you embark on your journey into geometry and information geometry.

\begin{abstract}  
This introductory text arises from a lecture given in Göteborg, Sweden, given by the first author and is intended for undergraduate students, as well as for any mathematically inclined reader wishing to explore a synthesis of ideas connecting geometry and statistics. At its core, this work seeks to illustrate the profound and yet natural interplay between differential geometry, probability theory, and the rich algebraic structures encoded in (pre-)Frobenius manifolds.  

\, 

The exposition is structured into three principal parts. The first part provides a concise introduction to differential topology and geometry, emphasizing the role of smooth manifolds, connections, and curvature in the formulation of geometric structures. The second part is devoted to probability, measures, and statistics, where the notion of a probability space is refined into a geometric object, thus paving the way for a deeper mathematical understanding of statistical models. Finally, in the third part, we introduce (pre-)Frobenius manifolds, revealing their surprising connection to exponential families of probability distributions and, discuss more broadly, their role in the geometry of information.  At the end of those three parts the reader will find stimulating exercises.

\, 

By bringing together these seemingly distant disciplines, we aim to highlight the natural emergence of geometric structures in statistical theory. This work does not seek to be exhaustive but rather to provide the reader with a pathway into a domain of mathematics that is still in its formative stages, where many fundamental questions remain open. The text is accessible without requiring advanced prerequisites and should serve as an invitation to further exploration.
