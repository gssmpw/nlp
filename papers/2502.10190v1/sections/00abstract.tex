To make an engaging video, people sequence interesting moments and add visuals such as B-rolls or text. While video editing requires time and effort, AI has recently shown strong potential to make editing easier through suggestions and automation. A key strength of generative models is their ability to quickly generate multiple variations, but when provided with many alternatives, creators struggle to compare them to find the best fit. We propose VideoDiff, an AI video editing tool designed for editing with alternatives. With VideoDiff, creators can generate and review multiple AI recommendations for each editing process: creating a rough cut, inserting B-rolls, and adding text effects. VideoDiff simplifies comparisons by aligning videos and highlighting differences through timelines, transcripts, and video previews. Creators have the flexibility to regenerate and refine AI suggestions as they compare alternatives. Our study participants (N=12) could easily compare and customize alternatives, creating more satisfying results.
% We evaluated VideoDiff in a user study with 12 video creators and found that users preferred videos they created with VideoDiff and found it useful for working with variations.

% \mira{I removed the reference to CapCut - I don't think we need it - and tried to emphasize that there is this new powerful capability and tools are not designed for it. I don't love how we define VideoDiff - in particular ``designed around'' seems very vague. I can't think of a better phrasing right now but it's something to revisit. }



% One powerful new capabality of generative models is the ability to quickly generate multiple varations, however when faced with many different alternatives creators find it challenging to review and compare multiple videos to find one that best suits their needs. 
% We propose VideoDiff, an AI video editing tool designed around the comparison of generated variations. 


% To make an engaging video, people sequence interesting moments, remove irrelevant footage, and add visuals such as supplementary b-roll footage or text overlays. 
% While video editing traditionally requires significant time and effort, AI has recently shown strong potential to automate editing through suggestions.
% AI video tools such as CapCut or OpusClip generate multiple versions of edited videos, offering creators alternatives.
% However, creators still face the tedious task of reviewing and comparing multiple videos to find one that best suits their needs.
% We propose VideoDiff, an AI video editing tool designed around comparison of multiple generated versions. 
% With VideoDiff, creators can generate and review multiple AI recommendations for each part of the editing process: creating a rough cut, inserting b-roll and adding text effects. 
% VideoDiff simplifies comparisons by aligning videos and highlighting differences through timelines, transcripts, and video previews. Creators can pick one version they like best or combine parts from different generated recommendations. Or they can regenerate and refine AI suggestions.
% We evaluated VideoDiff in a user study with 12 video creators.
% Our study with 12 video creators demonstrates that VideoDiff simplifies video comparison and authoring, enabling more efficient Human-AI video co-creation.

% Video creators edit their videos to remove low-quality footage or add B-rolls and visual effects. With the power of generative AI, it will become easier for AI tools to edit videos for creators. While AI tools can generate multiple versions of edited videos in parallel, the creator is left with the task of reviewing and comparing these videos to understand which best suits their needs. We propose VideoDiff, an interactive comparison tool that visualizes the differences between multiple videos at various levels of detail.
