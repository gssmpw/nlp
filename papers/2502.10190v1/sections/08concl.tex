\section{Conclusion}
We presented \sysname{}, a human-AI video co-creation tool designed to support efficient video editing with alternatives. Through a functional prototype and quantitative and qualitative user feedback, we showed that users want to work with variations when they are editing videos and would like flexible tools that offer easy ways to minimize watching and maximize creative potential. \camready{VideoDiff inspired users to explore alternative ideas while retaining key edit decisions to users who can select and refine AI suggestions.
All study participants wanted to integrate it into their workflow to create more satisfying videos.} Generative AI tools offer new promising capabilities that will only improve over time. It is up to the HCI community to create new experiences that harness that power into better and better creative tools.
