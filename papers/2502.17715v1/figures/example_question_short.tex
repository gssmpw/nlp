        \textbf{CA} & Occupation domination occurs due to a combination of historical, social, economic, and geographic factors. \textit{Historically}, certain groups have had greater access to education, resources, and opportunities, leading them to be more prevalent in specific jobs or industries. This is often reinforced by network effects, where individuals within a profession prefer to work with or hire people who share similar backgrounds, cultural norms, or experiences, thus perpetuating the concentration of certain demographics in those fields. \textit{Legal and institutional} barriers can also play a significant role. Discriminatory policies or practices can systematically exclude certain groups from specific professions, allowing other groups, who do not face such barriers, to dominate those fields. \textit{Geographic and environmental} factors further influence occupation domination. The presence of certain natural resources or particular climate conditions in an area can dictate the types of industries that develop there. Local populations often specialize in these industries, passing down specialized skills and knowledge through generations, which solidifies their dominance in those fields over time. \\
