        \textbf{IA} & It took me a long time to understand heuristics and \textcolor{blue}{\textit{I still don't know if I can ELI5 after a handful of bachelor and graduate degrees.}}  A heuristic is like a clue or a key to help you solve a problem or remember something. That's the best I got. \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{CA} & A heuristic is a practical approach or mental strategy used for problem-solving and decision-making, particularly when dealing with complex or incomplete information. It serves as a cognitive shortcut, allowing individuals to reach quick and satisfactory solutions without the need for exhaustive analysis or perfect precision. By focusing on the most relevant aspects of a problem and often relying on past experiences, common sense, or general rules of thumb, heuristics simplify the decision-making process and reduce cognitive load. While heuristic methods are not guaranteed to provide the best solution, they are typically sufficient for achieving an immediate goal and are useful in many everyday situations where speed and practicality are prioritized over exhaustive accuracy. \\
