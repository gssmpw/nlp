            \textbf{Initial Answer} & If the current going thru you is around 1 amp, the shock may give you a heart attack. So it's like the hospital shock paddles, only it kills you. If the current is like 10 amps, it probably won't give you a heart attack, and you may survive if your organs aren't fully cooked. Which they definitely could be if the current isn't immediately stopped. And cooked kidneys don't function that good. So to summarize, either heart attack or cooked organs/burned, depending on the current. Edit: To clarify, it takes less than 1 amp to stop your heart, and the current also has to go thru your heart. I just used 1 amp and 10 amps as sample values. \\

If it would have been justified to blow the guy's brains out then you are okay.  If it wasn't, then you're in trouble.  So if an axe murderer kicks in your door to murder your family, and he runs right into your Home Alone style funhouse and gets killed by an iron that falls 3 stories and hits him in the face\u2026 well then good.

        \textbf{Job Description} \\
        \midrule
        Welcome, and thank you for participating in this text evaluation task! In this job, you'll be helping us verify the quality of follow-up questions generated by GPT.\\
        For each task, we will provide you with a pair consisting of a question and answer collected from Reddit's ``Explain Like I'm Five” (ELI5) forum. You will be asked to evaluate the quality of the follow-up question generated by GPT. These questions and answers aim to provide layperson-friendly explanations for real-life queries. Here is an example of one task sample: \\
        Each task may contain noise, such as invalid follow-up questions, sensitive information, or questions unrelated to the original question or answer. Your role is to help us identify these noisy samples.\\
        For each task, you will be shown one triple (question, answer, follow-up question). Carefully review each component and answer the following questions based on your judgment: \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q1:} Do you think the follow-up question is a valid question? \\
        \textbf{A.} Yes \quad
        \textbf{B.} No \\

\subsection{Valid/Invalid Question Guideline}

The follow-up question might contain multiple sentences but it should consist of at least one valid question. A valid question must be in a question format and ask meaningful information, including Wh-questions (what/why/where/etc.), open-ended questions, probing questions and etc. Invalid questions like ``10000 meters? really?”, are often used in conversational speech to express feelings instead of asking for new information. 
Table~\ref{tab:valid_invalid_followupq} contains examples of valid and invalid follow-up questions.

Since wind speeds are often low at night, and increase during the daytime, wind waves often die out during the night, leading to a relatively flat sea (perhaps with swell waves) in the early morning. During the day, the wind waves increase in size as the wind speed increases, leading to a rougher, more choppy, sea surface during the afternoon and evening. } \\

% \paragraph{Initial Question:} ELI5: Why is the sea calm in the mornings? 
% \paragraph{Initial Answer:} There are two types of waves which can turn a flat sea into a rougher one - swell waves and wind waves. Swell waves can arrive at any time of day, but because wind waves are generated by the wind, they only develop when the wind begins to blow steadily. Since wind speeds are often low at night, and increase during the daytime, wind waves often die out during the night, leading to a relatively flat sea (perhaps with swell waves) in the early morning. During the day, the wind waves increase in size as the wind speed increases, leading to a rougher, more choppy, sea surface during the afternoon and evening. 

% \subsubsection{Valid Follow-up Question Example:} 
% "Now it's time for my question. Why are winds always weak in the morning and very strong during the day?" 
% \paragraph{Reason:} The follow-up question is a ``Why” question, asking specific reasons about the change of the winds during the day. Therefore, it is a valid question. 

% \subsubsection{Invalid Follow-up Question Example:}
% “Isn't it just common sense that the sea is calmer in the morning?” 
% \paragraph{Reason:} This is a rhetorical question because it does not genuinely seek new information. Instead, it implies that the answer is already obvious and does not contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way. 

\subsection{Inappropriate Question Guideline}

Examples of racist comments include: ``It's credit to your race,” ``Black people will not understand.” Examples of hate speech include: ``He should go back to where he comes from,” ``All Mexicans are rapists.” Examples of offensive or rude comments include: ``Women are not suitable for working in the IT field,” ``Gay will never understand.” Table~\ref{tab:inappropriate_followupq} contains an example of an inappropriate follow-up question.

\subsection{Relevance Question Guideline}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strongly Related}: The follow-up question asks for specific definitions, particular reasons, or meanings directly from the original question and answer.
    \item \textbf{Related}: The follow-up question primarily seeks information from the original question or answer but also brings in additional, new information.
    \item \textbf{Slightly Related}: The follow-up question mainly addresses other cases but has some relevance to the original question or answer.
    \item \textbf{Not Related}: The follow-up question does not relate to the original question or answer.
\end{itemize}
Table~\ref{tab:relate_followupq} contains follow-up questions with various levels of relevance.

            \midrule
            \multicolumn{2}{p{1.05\linewidth}}{\textbf{Initial Answer:} Those white trails are called contrails, short for condensation trails. They form when hot exhaust from the airplane's engines mixes with the cold air in the upper atmosphere. The water vapor in the exhaust condenses and freezes into tiny ice crystals, creating the white streaks you see in the sky. The persistence of these trails depends on humidity levels; if the air is dry, the contrail dissipates quickly, but if the air is humid, the contrail can linger for a long time.} \\

            \textbf{Reason} & \textbf{Reason}\\
            \midrule
            The follow-up question directly builds on the information provided in the answer, specifically regarding the persistence of contrails. Since the answer already mentions humidity as a factor, this question seeks further clarification, making it strongly related.  & This follow-up question extends the topic of contrails by asking about their environmental impact. While the original answer does not discuss environmental effects, the question is still relevant because it builds on the phenomenon explained. Thus, it is considered related. \\

           The follow-up question is about airplanes, which is the general topic of the original question, but it shifts the focus from contrails to noise. While both topics are related to aviation, the connection between them is weak, making the question only slightly related.  & The follow-up question introduces a completely unrelated topic (volcanoes) that has no connection to airplanes, contrails, or atmospheric conditions. Since it does not build on the original question or answer in any way, it is considered not related. \\

\section{Baseline Reproduce}
\label{appendix:baseline_reproduce}
\input{figures/comparison}
To establish a baseline, we attempted to reproduce the results of \citet{meng-etal-2023-followupqg} using the reported parameters, as the original implementation was unavailable. We use BART-large, consisting of 24 layers, 16 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 1024. The initial learning rate (5e-5) led to training instability, which we mitigated by adjusting it to 2e-5 while keeping other hyperparameters unchanged (batch size: 8, epochs: 10, optimizer: Adam \cite{kinga2015method}). The training was conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32GB memory, taking approximately 6 hours per run. We set the random seed as 42. After multiple runs, our reproduced model yielded similar overall performance but with some variation—certain metrics improved while others slightly declined (see Table \ref{tab:comparison}). This model served as the baseline for subsequent experiments.

% \label{app:numerical_mapping_of_human_eval}
% To enable quantitative analysis, we applied predefined mappings, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:user_selection_mapping}, to transform categorical annotations from human evaluation tasks into numerical representations. Binary values (0/1) were assigned to categorical judgments, such as the validity of follow-up questions (valid = 1, not valid = 0), while ordinal values (0-3) were used for graded attributes, such as relevance (not related = 0, strongly related = 3).

        \textbf{Job Description} \\
        \midrule
        In this job, you'll be helping us evaluate the quality of follow-up questions generated by a language model called BART. \\
        For each task, we will provide you with a pair consisting of a question and answer collected from Reddit's ``Explain Like I'm Five'' (ELI5) forum. You will be asked to evaluate the quality of the follow-up question generated by BART. These questions and answers aim to provide layperson-friendly explanations for real-life queries. \\
        Our data may contain noise, such as invalid follow-up questions, errors, lack of reasoning, or follow-up questions unrelated to the original question or answer. Your role is to help us identify these noisy samples. \\
        For each task, you will be shown one triple (question, answer, follow-up question). Carefully review each component and answer the following questions based on your judgment: \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q1:} Do you think the follow-up question is a valid question? \\
        \textbf{A.} Yes \quad
        \textbf{B.} No \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q2:} How relevant is the follow-up question to the original question and answer? \\
        \textbf{A.} Strongly Related \quad
        \textbf{B.} Related \quad
        \textbf{C.} Slightly Related \quad
        \textbf{D.} Not Related \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q3:} Does the follow-up question contain any of the following errors? \\
        \textbf{A.} No Errors \quad
        \textbf{B.} Redundant \quad
        \textbf{C.} Repetitive  \quad
        \textbf{D.} Wrong Semantic Collocation \quad
        \textbf{E.} Other Errors \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q4:} Does generating this follow-up question require reasoning? \\
        \textbf{A.} Requires complex amount of reasoning \quad
        \textbf{B.} Requires moderate amount of reasoning \quad
        \textbf{C.} Requires minimal amount of reasoning \quad
        \textbf{D.} Does not require any reasoning \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Q5:} Does the follow-up question contain new information for the audience? \\
        \textbf{A.} Introduces a lot of new information \quad
        \textbf{B.} Introduces some new information \quad
        \textbf{C.} Introduces little new information \quad
        \textbf{D.} Does not introduce any new information \\

\subsection{Error Question Guideline}

\noindent Does the follow-up question contain any of the following errors?

\noindent \textbf{Identify any language issues in the follow-up question.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No Errors} – The follow-up question is appropriate and adds value.
    \item \textbf{Redundant} – The follow-up does not introduce any new information.
    \item \textbf{Repetitive} – The follow-up question closely mirrors the original question.
    \item \textbf{Wrong Semantic Collocation} – The question contains unnatural or incorrect phrasing.
    \item \textbf{Other Errors} – Any issues that do not fit the categories above.
\end{itemize}
Table~\ref{tab:error_followupq} contains examples of follow-up questions with various error status.

\subsection{Reasoning Question Guideline}

Evaluate the level of reasoning needed to generate the follow-up question. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complex reasoning} involves synthesizing multiple ideas or deeply analyzing information.
    \item \textbf{Moderate reasoning} requires interpreting the given content or slightly extending the discussion.
    \item \textbf{Minimal reasoning} involves simple comprehension or directly rephrasing information.
    \item \textbf{No reasoning} applies to questions that are direct repetitions or restatements without any thought process.
\end{itemize}

            \midrule
            \multicolumn{2}{p{1.05\linewidth}}{\textbf{Initial Answer:} Sleep is essential for brain function because it helps with memory consolidation, cognitive processing, and emotional regulation. During sleep, the brain strengthens neural connections, removes toxins, and allows different areas to reset for the next day.} \\

            \textbf{Reason} & \textbf{Reason}\\
            \midrule
           This follow-up question requires complex reasoning because it involves comparing two different scenarios (chronic vs. occasional sleep deprivation) and analyzing their distinct long-term effects on cognition, requiring deeper thought and synthesis of information.  & This follow-up question requires moderate reasoning because it builds on a specific detail from the original answer (toxin removal) and asks for an explanation of the biological process involved. \\

\subsection{Informativeness Question Guideline}

Evaluate whether the follow-up question enriches the topic by providing or eliciting new information.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A Lot of New Information} indicates a significant amount of new knowledge is introduced.
    \item \textbf{Some New Information} suggests moderate enrichment.
    \item \textbf{Little New Information} implies minimal addition.
    \item \textbf{No New Information} means no new information is provided to the audience.
\end{itemize}

            \midrule
           This follow-up question introduces a significantly new dimension by asking about different types of vaccines, which were not mentioned in the original answer, expanding the discussion substantially.  & The follow-up question adds moderately new information by focusing on the timeline of immunity development, a relevant but additional detail not covered in the initial answer. \\
