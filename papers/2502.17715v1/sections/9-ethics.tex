All annotators involved in the human evaluation for this research were fairly compensated, with payment rates exceeding the local minimum wage to ensure equitable remuneration for their time and effort. Prior to recruiting annotators, ethical approval was obtained from the research ethics board at the authorsâ€™ institution, ensuring that the human evaluation process adhered to ethical guidelines and that no harm was caused to any individual involved. Additionally, the \fd{} dataset is publicly available, and we commit to making our dataset, including the augmented data and generated comprehensive answers, accessible to promote transparency and reproducibility in future work.
