\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \sysname{}, a real-time diagnostic framework for LLM training. By addressing critical challenges such as lightweight long-term monitoring, root cause detection, and backbone extensibility, \sysname{} provides a comprehensive solution for anomaly diagnostics across large-scale GPU clusters. With its novel intra-kernel tracing mechanism and holistic aggregated metrics, \sysname{} not only reduces diagnostic complexity but also improves the detection and resolution of non-obvious slowdowns and errors. Its deployment in real-world training clusters, spanning over 6,000 GPUs, demonstrates its efficacy in diagnosing distributed LLM training. Furthermore, \sysname{} is open-sourced to encourage broader adoption.
