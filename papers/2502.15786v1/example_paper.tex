\begin{abstract}
Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose \name{}, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. \name{} consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the modelâ€™s ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate \name{} on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by $12.0\%$, unseen subject generalization by $16.4\%$, and novel task adaptation by $25.0\%$. Furthermore, the attention patterns in \name{} provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.
