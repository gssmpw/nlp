\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose \name{}, a subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding model. Our neuroscience-informed attention mechanism in the fMRI encoder ensures subject generalization, while brain instruction tuning enhances versatility. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate our model's state-of-the-art performance, and visualizations offer insights into the patterns it leverages. We envision that these advancements will contribute to medical treatments, neuroscience research, and brain-computer interfaces in the future. \noindent\textbf{Limitations:} This work focuses on static fMRI, without incorporating temporal dynamics. Future research could explore integrating temporal information and investigating its relationship with other modalities such as videos.% sounds and music.
