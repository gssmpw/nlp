    \caption{{\bf Set-and-Sequence} framework operates in two stages:
(i) Identity Basis: We train \emph{LoRA Set Encoding} on a unordered set of frames extracted from the video, focusing only on the appearance of the dynamic concept to achieve high fidelity without temporal distractions.
(ii) Motion Residuals: The Basis of the Identity LoRAs is frozen and the coefficient part is augmented with coefficients of \emph{LoRA Sequence Encoding} trained on the \emph{temporal sequence} of full video clip, allowing the model to capture the motion dynamics of the concept.}
