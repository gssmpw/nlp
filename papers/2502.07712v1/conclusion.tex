\section[Conclusion]{Conclusion}
This paper introduces the concept of mock testing in the context of DNNs and presents a novel technique, {\em KUnit}. 
The technique is based on the idea of decoupling to reduce the dependencies between different stages of DL applications, specifically data preparation and model design. 
Decoupling is achieved by defining interfaces 
that facilitate the creation of mock objects for unit testing of each stage.
The empirical evaluation using 50 DL programs shows that in the data preparation stage, the mock model helped identify 10 issues, and mock data
assisted in identifying 53 issues in the model design stage.
In a user evaluation with 36 participants, {\em KUnit} helped resolve 25 issues in the data preparation stage and 38 issues in the model design stage.
Our results show that mock objects provided a lightweight emulation of the dependencies for unit testing and
identified issues that, in current practice, are identified after data and model integration, specifically during DL model training.
Participants found {\em KUnit} helpful for identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.
