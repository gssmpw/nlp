    \caption{Left: Estimation consistency (accuracy of predictions on the answer that CoT  will eventually select. Right: Conformal estimation of CoT answer. Probes are often confident on sizeable portions of the test sets (37\% on average) with low error even on datasets with poor total consistency.}
