    \caption{Overview of our method: During training we collect the hidden states of the input token and eventual output behavior on a variety of prompts, using them to train a probe on the hidden states. With a validation set, we calibrate the probes for conformal prediction by identifying a threshold for confident predictions. During inference, if the probes are confident in their estimate of the eventual LM behavior, we stop all computation and return the prediction.}
