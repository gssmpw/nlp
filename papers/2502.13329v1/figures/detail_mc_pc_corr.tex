    \caption{Left: Density plot of the correlation coefficient between the CoT model accuracy and the consistency of the probe estimate. The coefficient is often positive, indicating that instances where the probe inaccurately estimates CoT model are also instances where the model is more likely to be incorrect. Right: On CosmoQA, probes have near-random consistency with initial tokens. There is a sudden performance boost towards the final token. Confidence remains steady, suggesting poor calibration in early token probes. }
