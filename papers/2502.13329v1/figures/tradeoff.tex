    \caption{Tradeoff between accuracy loss (CoT Accuracy - Accelerated CoT Accuracy) and inference cost when using our method to accelerate CoT Prompting in IID (Left) and OOD (Right) settings. In IID setting, Accuracy loss is \textbf{negative} on average, and never more than 1.34\%, while inference cost reductions are 65\% on average. In the OOD setting, inference cost reductions are higher at 81\% on average, with a small accuracy loss of 2.3\% on average.}
