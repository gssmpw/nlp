    \caption{Tradeoff between accuracy loss (CoT Accuracy - Accelerated CoT Accuracy) and inference cost when using our method to accelerate CoT Prompting in the OOD setting. Probes are still able to minimize accuracy loss (2.5\% on average) while greatly reducing inference cost (79.8\% on average).}
