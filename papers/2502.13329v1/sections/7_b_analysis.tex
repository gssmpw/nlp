\subsection{Layer Ablation}

A deeper analysis of the interaction between the performance and the layer used for probing shows that no consistent patterns can be identified. A subset of the common patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:all_layers}) shows that sometimes that apart from early layers being poor, it is unclear whether the middle or final layers are consistently better for accuracy or confidence.
