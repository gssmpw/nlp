    \noindent 
    A large body of research on morphological paradigms makes the prediction that irregular morphological patterns of allomorphy are more likely to emerge and persist when they serve to mark important functional distinctions. 
    More specifically, it has been observed that in some Germanic languages in which narrative past tense is expressed by the past participle, there is a greater affinity for stem allomorphy shared by preterite forms and past participles to the exclusion of present forms (the so-called ABB pattern), as it serves to enhance marking of the binary semantic opposition between present and past. Using data from 107 cognate verbs attested across 14 archaic and contemporary Germanic languages and a novel hierarchical phylogenetic model, we show that there is a greater long-term preference for this alternation pattern in situations where narrative past tense has been extended to the past participle, confirming this hypothesis. 
    We further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association, demonstrating that this association holds because verbs with the ABB pattern are more likely to preserve it in situations where it marks an important binary semantic opposition; however, there is less evidence that the ABB pattern is extended to verbs with different patterns under the same circumstances. 
    These results bear on debate as to whether the distribution of irregularity we observe cross-linguistically is due primarily to (1) the preservation of irregular patterns or (2) an active drive toward irregularization in certain contexts, and are more in line with the first hypothesis.

\section{Introduction}
% maybe it's too general and broad now and to some extent, too obvious, but I followed the suggestion on not having any terms that would be zooming in too much. 

%The study of language change offers valuable insights into the nature of linguistic systems by focusing on its dynamics, which, in turn, is relevant for better understanding its organization. 
Historical morphology focuses on the minimal meaning-bearing units in language and their change over time. By investigating how the mapping between meaning and form evolves in these fundamental units, we can better understand the processes that shape languages. Historical linguistics provides a framework for examining these transformations, which helps in studying the cognitive processes that underlie the linguistic system in the mind. The evolution of verbal paradigms and specifically the phenomenon of paradigm leveling, the process by which non-uniform patterns of lexical allomorphy are replaced with uniform ones, presents an interesting case study in this context. It allows us to explore questions about the balance between uniformity and non-uniformity in language, the role of analogy in linguistic change, and the factors that influence the direction and extent of morphological transformations. 
%Notably, analogy, which plays a crucial role in these processes, is not unique to language but represents a fundamental cognitive ability employed across various domains, from problem-solving to learning. 
Examining specific instances of morphological change within well-documented language families provides insight into the broader mechanisms driving linguistic evolution and the organization of morphological systems. This raises questions about the nature and pathways of language change, challenging simplistic notions of unidirectional processes and inviting deeper exploration of the complex interplay between various linguistic and cognitive factors.

The evolution of strong verbs in the Germanic clade provides a concrete example of linguistic dynamics as discussed above and has long been a subject of interest in historical linguistics \citep{krygier1994disintegration, seebold1970vergleichendes, ringe2008proto, dammel_etal2010, desmet_vandevelde2019}. Strong verbs, %characterized by their distinct stem-vowel alternations across different tense/aspect/mood (TAM) forms, 
characterized by irregular, phonologically unpredictable, lexeme-specific stem-vowel alternation patterns across different tense/aspect/mood (TAM) forms, 
serve as an intriguing case study for understanding %language change, particularly through the processes of analogical leveling () and morphological reanalysis. 
the factors underlying the maintenance of irregular alternation patterns, as well as their loss through paradigm leveling. 
The study of paradigm leveling in these verbs offers specific insights into the nature and pathways of language change. %While the general trend towards uniformity through leveling is widely accepted, 
While leveling as a linguistic process is well documented, the specific mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain a subject of debate \citep{Hill2007,garrett2008}. 
This raises important questions 
regarding the circumstances under which irregularity is introduced, maintained, and lost, and the extent to which system-internal factors as well as external social and cultural influences play a significant role. 
The evolution of strong verbs, occurring across multiple Germanic languages over centuries, provides a rich dataset with a relatively well-documented history for exploring these and related questions. 
%: Why do some verbs undergo leveling while others escape (complete) uniformity? Is there a predictable pattern to which forms within a paradigm are most likely to be leveled first? The persistence of strong verb patterns further challenges simplistic notions of language change as unidirectional towards uniformity, presenting an additional challenge in sketching the causal story of factors favoring uniformity.

%Another intriguing aspect of this phenomenon is its relevance to the ongoing debate about the nature of language change: is it primarily driven by system-internal factors, or do external social and cultural influences play a significant role? The evolution of strong verbs, occurring across multiple Germanic languages over centuries, provides a rich dataset with a relatively well-documented history for exploring this question. Furthermore, the study of paradigm leveling in strong verbs intersects with broader theoretical issues in the field. How do we reconcile the observed changes with different models of morphological representation and processing? What can these changes tell us about the organization of the mental lexicon and the nature of morphological productivity?

This study explores how changes in the domain of present perfect constructions shape vowel alternation patterns in Germanic verbal stems. 
By examining this relationship, we demonstrate a broader linguistic principle: semantic changes systematically influence morphological preferences. 
The Germanic strong verb system offers a case study into how languages adjust their inflectional patterns in response to evolving grammatical meanings.

To study this relationship, we use phylogenetic comparative methods \citep{Garamszegi2014,Dunn2015,Cathcart2018modeling}, a family of methodologies modeling the evolutionary dynamics of biological, linguistic, and cultural traits. 
Our model is designed to investigate evolutionary dependencies between sets of linguistic variables or characters. %by comparing posterior distributions of model parameters. 
Our approach allows us to evaluate differences in evolutionary dynamics under varying grammatical conditions. In our analysis, we examine the interaction between two linguistic features across the Germanic clade: the functional domain of present perfect constructions, and the vowel alternation patterns observed in 107 strong verbs across 14 modern and historical varieties. 
We employ a hierarchical phylogenetic model \citep{Cathcartetal2022Decoupling,jing2022phylogenetic,cathcart2024,cathcart2024exploring} intended to isolate large-scale, global trends in our data while accounting for variation at the level of individual data points, in a manner analogous to multilevel regression models \citep{gelman2007data}. 

Our model's findings indicate a relationship between the functional overlap of present perfect constructions with past tense constructions and the stability of certain vowel alternation patterns in verb stems. %The past participle form of the verb participates in present perfect constructions in Germanic. 
Our results shed light on the mechanisms that underlie this relationship: 
specifically, when perfect constructions overlap in the functional domain with past constructions, strong verbs are more likely to maintain existing patterns where the past tense and past participle %\todo{Maybe need to make this footnote more prominent}
%\footnote{Past participle forms impart the lexical meaning in Germanic present perfect constructions, with an auxiliary verb conjugated in present tense and agreeing in person and number.} 
share the same vowel, though they are not necessarily more likely to develop such patterns anew. This asymmetric relationship suggests that functional overlap between past participle and past forms acts as a conserving force rather than a driving force for morphological change. Our findings not only support the broader hypothesis that semantic and functional changes influence morphological patterns, but also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the directionality of such influences. This relationship contributes to our understanding of how languages alter or preserve characteristics of their morphological systems in response to evolving semantic and syntactic structures.%\todo{check this against findings reported in body of paper.}

\section{Background}
\subsection{Germanic strong verbs}
The phenomenon of strong verb alternations can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ablaut system, which involved systematic vowel changes to signal grammatical contrasts \citep[Ch. 2]{ringe2008proto}. As the Germanic branch evolved, these alternations became more regularized\footnote{For our purposes, ``regularity'' refers to absence or reduced presence of strong verbs' stem-vowel alternations.} in certain contexts, while in others, they underwent significant modification through analogical processes. Despite the differences between PIE and Proto-Germanic (PG) caused by the accumulation of changes over time, the heritage of PIE is observed in PG and its daughter languages. One example where this similarity can be observed is in verbal paradigms. 

% Maybe need to move the following paragraph to "data" section
To avoid the need to analyze the entire verbal paradigm, this study focuses on the principal parts of the strong verbs' paradigms as commonly used in traditional grammars. Principal parts are the specific forms of a verb that allow speakers to infer all other forms in the paradigm, given the set of affixal processes for each cell. In the case of Germanic languages, it is customary to exemplify the four principal parts of a strong verb by listing the following forms: the present infinitive, the third person singular past indicative, the third person plural past indicative, and the past participle \citep[264]{ringe2008proto}. Proto-Germanic strong verbs are those verbs that had different vowels across most of the principal parts.\footnote{According to \cite{ringe2008proto}, Proto-Germanic verbs of classes 1--3 only had the same vowel for the past indicative 3rd person plural and the past participle. Verbs of classes 5 and 6 had the same vowel in the infinitive and the past participle, while class 6 additionally has the same vowel for both past tense forms.} 

Condensing the entire verbal paradigm to a simpler representation of four forms helps alleviate the potential problem of data sparsity and is simpler from the point of view of the current analysis. At the same time, this simplification is justified by the morphomic nature of the concept of principal parts. Morphomes are abstract units of morphological structure that do not directly correspond to phonological or semantic features but reveal the organization and regularities within inflectional systems \citep{aronoff1994morphology}. For example, if a single stem is shared across a few TAM cells of a verb and the relationship between those cells is not immediately apparent, this regularity could be labeled as a morphome. An important property of morphomes is the notion of diachronic coherence \citep{maiden2018morphomes}. If a paradigm cell within a morphomic structure changes its form, all other cells that are part of the morphome tend to change as well. This diachronic coherence ensures that changes in the principal parts will systematically reflect across the entire verbal paradigm, making the analysis of principal parts a proxy for the analysis of the whole paradigm change. 

Throughout the evolution of PG, many strong verbs have been fully leveled, thus becoming ``weak'' verbs --- the term used to denote verbs that have no vowel alternations in their principal parts. Normally, weak verbs mark their TAM category by means of affixation, 
e.g., a dental ({\it -t}, {\it -d}) suffix in the past tense. An instance of such change can be found in the evolution of Old English to Modern English, where the historically strong verb \textit{help} became fully leveled, as shown in (\ref{old_english_level_ex}).

Partial leveling, another significant phenomenon in Germanic languages, involves the harmonization of some forms within a paradigm while leaving others with distinct characteristics. This process typically aims to reduce vowel alternations within a verb's inflectional paradigm by standardizing certain forms while maintaining others. For instance, in the transition from Middle High German to New High German, the verb \textit{geben} `to give' illustrates partial leveling, as in (\ref{mhg_partlevel_ex}). The partial leveling process is evident in the loss of the vowel alternations in the past tense forms. In this particular example, the past tense acquired a uniform vowel across all person/number paradigm cells, instead of having two different vowels in singular and plural.

The current study is, at its core, concerned with the different trajectories of leveling. As pointed out by \cite{garrett2008}, many theoretical models assume a preference for non-alternating paradigms. %: ``In linguistic theory the innate preference view has been reified under various names (Paradigm Coherence, Output-Output Correspondence, Uniform Exponence, etc.), but all such approaches posit distinct forces or constraints favoring uniformity''. 
In historical linguistics, sound change is usually charged with the role of creating alternations in the first place which are at first morphophonemic (i.e., phonologically predictable) and may become morphologized (i.e., unpredicatable) following the operation of subsequent sound changes, whereas paradigm leveling (or analogical changes, more broadly speaking) eliminates the consequences of the sound change \citeyearpar[193]{Hock2021}. 
The fact that changes involving leveling are well documented (including those affecting stem alternations in the Germanic verb, which are due to Proto-Indo-European ablaut as well as Verner's law, a process of prosodically conditioned voicing) lead many to posit it as a major force in language change \citep{Anttila1977,Wurzel1984}. 
%For instance, Hock \citeyearpar[193]{Hock2021} defines the function of leveling as the  ``complete or partial elimination of [originally] morphophonemic alternations within paradigms'' and goes on exemplifying leveling on the basis of morphophonemic alternation between {\it s}, {\it z}, and {\it r} created by Verner's law. 
% the following paragraph needs to be thought about, unsure if it fits well. 
However, despite these ideas, \cite{MannStephen2022Cats} highlight the fact that inflectional classes are highly stable across millennia, which appears to be inconsistent with a simple preference for uniformity. The definition of inflectional classes is a multilayered one but, importantly, shared idiosyncrasies of the phonological changes in the process of inflecting a verb, such as stem-vowel alternation, are one of the characteristics of an inflectional class \citep{corbett2006prolegomena}. The introduction of inflectional classes adds a layer of complexity to the idea of uniformity, as there might be a preference not only for intraparadigmatic uniformity but also for intraclass uniformity, with the latter potentially being a stronger pressure and thus explaining the non-uniform paradigms found in the modern varieties of Germanic and elsewhere.

\subsection{Previous findings}
%\todo{Link the Germanic findings to more general observations regarding the persistence of allomorphy that marks functional distinctions, e.g., \cite{Kurylowicz1945,manczak1957tendances,manczak1978lois,hooper1979,manczak1980laws}}

%Building upon the foundational understanding of strong verbs and analogical leveling in Germanic languages, recent scholarship tried to find the specific mechanisms and patterns of this phenomenon. 

Recent scholarship has investigated the mechanisms responsible for analogical leveling in Germanic strong verbs. 
Two notable studies, by \cite{dammel_etal2010} and \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019}, investigate the trajectories of full and partial leveling in strong verbs across different varieties of the Germanic clade; both find a relationship between leveling patterns and grammatical meaning expressed by present perfect constructions.

The present perfect expresses the continuing relevance of a past situation to the current point in time \citep[52]{comrie76}. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:figure2}, the present perfect construction does not require a separate form in order to express relevance to the present; this function may be taken by a simple past tense, where the semantics of current relevance is added by discourse. This is thought to be the case for Proto-Germanic and Gothic, and even some other historical and modern Germanic languages, but what sets the former two apart from these other languages is the fact that they do not have an alternative form that would uniquely encode perfect meaning. The analytic present perfect construction was an innovation of Northwest Germanic, which sets it apart from East Germanic, represented here by Gothic. The perfect originated via the grammaticalization of resultative constructions \citep{gillmann2016perfekt}. Figure \ref{fig:perfect} shows how in some Germanic languages, the meaning of the perfect was generalized so that the condition of being relevant to the present was dropped. While both \cite{dammel_etal2010} and \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} concur on the existence of a relationship between present perfect constructions and leveling patterns, their proposed mechanisms differ in specific details. 

\cite{dammel_etal2010} conduct a survey of four Germanic languages: Modern High German, English, Swedish, and Dutch. Their findings align with their proposed mechanism, highlighting notable differences in the behavior of Swedish compared to the other languages. The authors observe that Swedish maintains a more prominent aspectual distinction between the past and the perfect, resulting in a higher relative frequency of past tense forms. This frequency difference, they argue, accounts for the unique pattern of ablaut leveling in Swedish, where a distinct past tense vowel is always preserved, and strong past tense forms show greater resistance to class change than strong past participles \citep[353]{dammel_etal2010}. The authors further elaborate that the influence of frequency is indirect, operating through its strong association with cognitive entrenchment \citep{divjak2015frequency}.

%The research conducted by \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} did not primarily focus on present perfect constructions and vowel alternation patterns. Instead, their study aimed 

\cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} examine the weakening patterns of strong verbs in Dutch across various diachronic stages (Old Dutch, Middle Dutch, Early Modern Dutch, Modern Dutch) and to identify variables influencing the timing of a strong verb's transition to weak.\footnote{\citet[157]{desmet_vandevelde2019} clarify: ``We want to predict \textit{when} a verb became weak (if at all), not \textit{if} a verb became weak, given the time period the observation is drawn from."} Among several independent variables, vowel alternation patterns are included as a variable in their analysis. Their findings reveal that strong verbs with identical vowels in past tense and past participle forms tend to resist weakening significantly longer than those with distinct vowels across all principal parts. Conversely, strong verbs sharing the same vowel in present tense and past participle forms, but differing in the past tense form, exhibit the most rapid weakening according to their model. The authors emphasize that in Dutch, past tense and analytic perfect express the same temporal domain, suggesting that it is advantageous for a strong verb to differentiate present and past by employing distinct vowels for these temporal domains while maintaining consistency within each domain.\footnote{The precise nature of this advantage is not explicitly stated. As this explanation resembles the one form/one meaning principle \citep{oneformonemeaning,dressler2005word,vennemann1972phonetic}, we might expect similar rationales to apply here.} 
As such, this phenomenon can be linked to a more general observation regarding the persistence of motivated allomorphy that marks functionally important semantic oppositions \citep{Kurylowicz1945,manczak1957tendances,manczak1978lois,manczak1980laws,hooper1979}. 

Both of these studies, while providing valuable insights, share certain methodological limitations that potentially impact the %generalizability and 
broader applicability of their conclusions.
The scope of both studies is relatively narrow, focusing on a limited number of Germanic languages. \cite{dammel_etal2010} surveyed only four languages, while \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} based their analysis only on Dutch and its ancestors. This limited scope raises questions about the generalizability of their findings to the rest of the Germanic language family and to language more broadly.
Because of this, the identified patterns and proposed mechanisms, while compelling within the context of the studied languages, may not be universally applicable. It remains unclear whether these patterns of vowel alternation and their relationship to present perfect constructions would hold true in other Germanic languages or in languages from different families with similar morphological features.

Furthermore, the methodology employed by \cite{dammel_etal2010} lacks rigorous inferential statistics to validate their hypothesis. Their conclusions primarily rest on descriptive observations from a limited sample of four languages. To illustrate their point, the authors present Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, depicting the functional breadth of perfect constructions, alongside distributions of vowel alternation types for each language. They note a correlation between increased functional breadth and a higher proportion of non-leveled vowel patterns in past participles. However, the authors acknowledge that English diverges from this proposed pattern. Despite its perfect constructions being unable to express narrative past, the distribution of vowel alternating patterns among strong verbs in English aligns more closely with German and Dutch than with Swedish, as their hypothesis would predict. While this counterexample does not necessarily invalidate their proposal, it does suggest a probabilistic relationship rather than a categorical one. This nuance underscores the need for a more robust inferential model to assess whether this expectation holds true, even as a general tendency. Finally, it is worth mentioning that \citeauthor{dammel_etal2010}'s (\citeyear{dammel_etal2010}) claim that functional expansion of the analytic perfect increases its frequency is an empirical question that remains open. While the authors show that past participles are more frequent than past tense forms in Dutch, its difference from Swedish is not striking.\footnote{The authors only collected verbs in past tense and in past participle forms. Their sum represents 100\%.} Dutch uses past participles in 54\% of cases in their corpora, while Swedish does so in 43\% of the forms. English uses the past participle forms only in 32\% of cases. This further emphasizes English's strange behavior under the explanation proposed by \cite{dammel_etal2010}.

The study by \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} %presents its own set of limitations. Most notably, it 
relies on historical data of a single language, Dutch, to draw inferences about the broader West Germanic group. This narrow focus raises questions about the applicability of their findings to other West Germanic languages. It remains unclear whether the observed relationship between analytic perfect constructions and vowel patterns is a Dutch-specific innovation or if it simply emerges in Dutch due to the presence of necessary preconditions that may or may not exist in other West Germanic languages. Furthermore, in addressing the broader question of directionality in paradigm leveling, the authors adopt a somewhat simplistic approach by focusing solely on full leveling, i.e., complete weakening of strong verbs. This narrow focus potentially obscures the nuanced pathways of weakening and fails to capture the intermediate stages of partial leveling that may occur. Such partial leveling processes could provide valuable insights into the gradual nature of morphological change and the factors influencing its progression.

These two studies differ slightly in their descriptions of how the functional broadness of the analytic perfect affects the preferred vowel alternation patterns. In this study, we will not be able to adjudicate the more minor points of difference between these analyses; instead, we motivate a method that can robustly establish whether or not this particular link between function and form exists, while accounting for multiple factors, such as phylogeny, idiosyncrasies of individual verbs, and different pathways of weakening. 
We are additionally able to shed light on the dynamics of diachronic change underlying this association.

\section{Data}
\label{data}

Our study relies on a comprehensive dataset of Germanic verbal forms, collected and processed to ensure broad coverage of verbs with vowel alternation patterns across 14 languages of the Germanic language family: Icelandic, English, Faroese, Frisian, Old Saxon, Danish, Low German, Old English, German, Norwegian Bokm√•l, Dutch, Gothic, Old High German, and Swedish. This set, although incomplete, ensures good coverage of all the sub-families of the Germanic clade.

Our data collection process involved several steps. First, %we wrote a %scraping algorithm  script 
we automatically extracted relevant Germanic verbal forms from Wiktionary (\url{wiktionary.org}), a collaborative online dictionary.\footnote{Our data extraction was carried out on 16 September 2024.} This source provided a wide range of verbal forms across various Germanic languages, including both modern and historical varieties. 
%Wiktionary contains more than 500 reconstructed strong verbs for Proto-Germanic. 
After that, to complement and cross-validate the Wiktionary data, we incorporated verbal forms found in UniMorph \citep{unimorph} which contains several Germanic languages. This addition helped ensure a more comprehensive coverage and allowed for verification of the scraped Wiktionary data, in addition to filling in gaps for some of the verbs. To avoid an overly extensive manual search of the data, we limited ourselves to verbs that were present in at least 80\% of languages after this automated procedure, leaving us with a final dataset of 107 strong verbs. Since not all 107 verbs were successfully scraped automatically,\footnote{In some cases the 
%scraper 
script 
extracted the infinitive form of the verb but not the inflected forms and in some cases, no form was extracted at all.} we had to manually search for those verbs and/or their inflected forms in Wiktionary. Additionally, for some Old High German forms, we used an online Old High German dictionary published by the Saxon Academy of Science (\citeyear{awb_online}). After concluding this process, the forms were validated against \citeauthor{kroonen2013etymological}'s etymological dictionary (2013).

\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:class_distribution}, our dataset includes all 7 verb classes found in Proto-Germanic. Class 4 appears less frequently in our data, reflecting its lower occurrence in Wiktionary. Overall, the distribution of verb classes in our dataset aligns roughly with their proportions in Wiktionary. Analyses of missing data points per language, shown in Figure \ref{fig:missing_per_lang}, display a clear pattern. Minority languages, such as Low German and West Frisian, have a high number of missing forms. The same is true of old languages, like Old High German and Gothic. However, no language is missing more than 50\% of the verbs and in 10 out of 14 languages less than 20\% of the forms are missing. 
We mark a verb as dead rather than missing in a given language if it is marked as obsolete or given a similar label in Wiktionary. 

%\textit{Wiktionary often provides a note like "obsolete" and that's what was considered as "dead".} \todo{we should be careful regarding how we approach the distinction of missingness versus death: perhaps here is the place to clarify this?}

Following data collection, we coded each verb according to its vowel alternation pattern. According to traditional scholarship \cite[72--74]{mhg_dict}, Germanic languages have four principal parts: the infinitive, 
the third person singular past indicative, the first person plural past indicative, and the past participle (``supine'' in the North Germanic tradition). 
However, for this study, we simplified the coding to three principal parts, for two reasons: reduction of the state space, and modern language patterns. Using four principal parts would result in a large and computationally intractable state space for the phylogenetic model. In phylogenetic comparative models, an excessively large state space can lead to computational intractability, overfitting, and difficulties in parameter estimation. 
Considering that we have 107 characters, it is likely that our models would not achieve convergence across chains (a crucial property of Bayesian models) if we had opted for four principal parts, limiting their explanatory power. 
Apart from computational considerations, many modern Germanic languages have leveled their past tense forms, using the same vowel for both third person singular and first person plural. As previously mentioned, \cite{dammel_etal2010} and \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} also used only three principal parts, so this makes our results directly comparable to theirs. 

With respect to our coding scheme, we followed the coding decisions used in previous literature, as these represent an optimal trade-off between the complexity found in the paradigm's organization and the feasibility of the analysis. In our coding procedure, we only analyze the roots of the verb, ignoring inflectional affixes. If the vowel found in the root of the form differs from the one found in other paradigm cell(s), it receives a different letter coding. The order of letters corresponds to infinitive, past tense form and past participle, respectively. %To make coding the schema clearer, the reader can find patterns and their explanations, along with an example per pattern, below: 
Explicit illustrations of coded patterns can be found below: 
%\todo{Add a point that we don't differentiate between ABB and ACC: no homology between letter codes}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{ABC}: Three different vowels in each of the three principal parts' forms. This pattern was the most frequent one in Proto-Germanic. Within our coding scheme it could be considered the most complex one, as it has both high enumerative (i.e., number of allomorphs) and integrative (i.e., predictive relationships between allomorphs) complexity \citep[cf.][]{AckermanMalouf2013}.
    
    Modern High German: tr\underline{\bf i}nken ‚Äì tr\underline{\bf a}nk ‚Äì getr\underline{\bf u}nken
    
    \item \textbf{ABB}: Same vowel in past and past participle. According to \citeauthor{dammel_etal2010}'s (\citeyear{dammel_etal2010}) calculations, this pattern is the most frequent one in Dutch, Modern High German and English. \cite{desmet_vandevelde2019} show an effect where Old Dutch's verbs with the ABB pattern were not fully leveled for a longer time than other patterns.
    
    Dutch: br\underline{\bf e}ngen ‚Äì br\underline{\bf a}cht ‚Äì gebr\underline{\bf a}cht

    
    \item \textbf{AAA}: Same vowel throughout the paradigm. Verbs with the AAA pattern are called  `weak' in traditional philological terms. We expect this pattern to rarely change into any of the other ones. Fully leveled verbs are frequently inflected using a productive rule, for example, by using a dental suffix for the past tense forms. Despite that, there are individual examples of transitions from AAA to ABB, such as past tense and past participle of `dive' becoming `dove', instead of the previous `dived'. 
    
    English: h\underline{\bf e}lp ‚Äì h\underline{\bf e}lped ‚Äì h\underline{\bf e}lped

    \item \textbf{ABA}: Same vowel in infinitive and past participle, but a different one in the past tense form. Same as in the case of \citeauthor{dammel_etal2010}'s (\citeyear{dammel_etal2010}) data, this pattern is most frequently found in the North Germanic clade. In addition to that, we find the ABA pattern frequently in older languages, such as Gothic and Old English. This pattern is also typical for certain classes of Proto-Germanic verbs, although it is less frequent than ABC.

    Swedish: skr\underline{\bf i}da - skr\underline{\bf e}d - skr\underline{\bf i}dit

    \item \textbf{AAB}: Same vowel in the infinitive and past tense, and a different one in the past participle. This pattern is extremely infrequent. It is difficult to find an explanation as to why it arose in cases where it did, but given the number of verbs that have this pattern, we could suggest that it is an example of idiosyncratic development in a limited number of verbs.

    \label{fig:pattern_distribution}
\end{figure}

The distribution of coded vowel alternation patterns for each language is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:pattern_distribution}. It is worth stressing that this coding scheme is intended to refer to stem similarities and differences in verbal paradigms on a purely abstract, verb-internal basis, and that there is not necessarily a meaningful relationship between alternants marked with the same letter across different verb paradigms. 
It is also worth noting that while in theory changes between alternation patterns could stem from regular sound changes such as mergers or conditioned splits, this is generally not the case for the Germanic data we analyze --- transitions between alternation patterns can be reliably taken to represent analogical morphological changes.

%To situate our data within an evolutionary context, we mapped the coded verbal forms onto phylogenetic trees of Germanic languages. 
We analyze the dynamics of diachronic changes between alternation patterns at the verb level using a phylogenetic model. 
In our case, this requires the use of a phylogenetic timed tree of the Germanic languages, representing the relatedness and divergence between the languages in our sample. %\todo{revisit this explanation} 
We use the Germanic clade within the Indo-European phylogenetic tree sample of \cite{chang2015} for our analyses.\footnote{We make the conscious decision not to base our analyses on a recent comprehensive phylogenetic study of the Indo-European languages \citep{heggarty2023}, which infers phylogenies from lexical data alone without clade constraints representing %agreed-upon 
even uncontroversial 
subgroup-defining morphological and phonological innovations shared among closely related languages. While this method in many cases recapitulates properties of the Indo-European tree topology that are in line with received wisdom, we find that key aspects of the Germanic clade in the main published results are highly problematic. In particular, the authors report strong support for an unrealistically late date of divergence between modern Frisian, Dutch, and High German speech varieties, which form a subgroup to the exclusion of closely related archaic speech varieties (e.g., Old High German). For practical purposes, this effectively forces our stochastic character mapping procedure (see below) to reconstruct a single, recent, synapomorphic semantic shift of the present perfect construction to express narrative past, which is contradicted by the textual record \citep{seiler2022reichenbach}, and would potentially give rise to misleading results at the relatively narrow phylogenetic scope that we take for this paper.}




%We utilize two primary sources for these trees. The first is the tree data from \cite{heggarty2023}, a recent comprehensive phylogenetic study of Indo-European languages. The second source is \cite{chang2015}, an earlier influential study on Indo-European phylogeny.

%These two sets of trees were selected for specific reasons:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \textbf{Temporal range}. The primary difference between these tree sets is the estimated age of the Indo-European language family. This variation allows us to test the robustness of our findings across different time scales and different hypotheses about the origins of Indo-European. The median age of Proto-Germanic in \citeauthor{heggarty2023}'s (\citeyear{heggarty2023}) 100 posterior tree samples is 2339 years before present (YBP), while for \citeauthor{chang2015}'s (\citeyear{chang2015}) the same number is 2073 YBP. Although this difference is not extreme, the posterior sample from \cite{heggarty2023} has more uncertainty, as expressed by the 95\% highest posterior density interval (HDI): $[1928, 2872]$ against $[1823, 2388]$ in \cite{chang2015}.
%    \item \textbf{Topological differences}. While broadly similar, these trees exhibit some differences in their branching patterns, in particular when it comes to the topology of the Germanic family. By using both, we can assess whether our results are sensitive to specific phylogenetic hypotheses about the relationships between Germanic languages. Key differences between the trees from \cite{chang2015} and \cite{heggarty2023} lie in the West Germanic clade and its branching order. In the \cite{heggarty2023} sample, Modern High German, Dutch and Frisian form a monophyletic clade which does not include Old High German. This would imply either that the High German consonant shift \cite[133--136]{fulk2018} took place multiple times, separately on the lineages directly ancestral to Old High German and Modern High German, or that the shift took place once on a branch ancestral to the entire clade and its effects were undone in Dutch and Frisian. 
%    The former scenario strikes us as possible albeit unrealistic or at least unclear in terms of the mechanisms it represents; the latter scenario is in fact impossible as it would imply the reversal of some phonological mergers resulting from the shift.%\todo{I believe this is the case... might be good to find some hard evidence of this.. either way it seems implausible, e.g., because to have NHG {\it essen}, {\it Messer} vs.\ Dutch {\it eten}, {\it mes} < *etan-, *matisahs, you would have to posit a development *-t- > *-ss- > *-t- that was somehow blocked in {\it mes}.}
    %Given the assumption that Modern High German is a descendant of Old High German, that would imply that Dutch and Frisian had to undo the effects of the High German Consonant Shift \cite[p.~133--136]{fulk2018} -- one of the most salient features of the High German varieties that distinguishes it from, for example, neighboring Low German varieties, as the latter have not experienced the same change in consonant system. 
%    \item \textbf{Methodological differences}. The \cite{heggarty2023} study represents the most recent and comprehensive analysis of Indo-European phylogeny, incorporating some novel methodological decisions and new data. The \cite{chang2015} tree, while older, has been influential in the field and provides a valuable point of comparison. Notably, it incorporates some strong priors about the existence of certain clades that are agreed upon by the community of historical linguists and is thus closer to a consensus view on Germanic in terms of its topology.
%    \item \textbf{Consensus and variation}. By using both trees, we can identify results that are consistent across different phylogenetic hypotheses, as well as those that may be sensitive to specific assumptions about language relationships and divergence times. In other words, we want to use two sets of trees to verify the robustness of our model's inferences.
%\end{itemize}

%%% Mention that some languages were missing from these trees so we added them by slightly randomizing time on a relevant branch. This avoids loosing an important part of the data, while injecting some uncertainty. 

This phylogeny lacks certain taxa for which we were able to collect vowel alternation patterns, namely Low German and Old Saxon. To avoid losing data, these taxa were added to the trees manually, while preserving uncertainty about the topology and branch lengths. 
%Due to %tricky branching 
%the idiosyncratic branching patterns 
%of the \cite{heggarty2023} tree 
%mentioned above, %\todo{This paragraph and the following might go into appendix.} 
%we decided to append a branch to either the Old Saxon branch or to the branch leading to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Dutch and Frisian. The exact position as to where Low German gets attached was random in each run, thus creating an additional level of uncertainty. In either case, the Low German tip was aligned with other modern languages. 
We first added the Old Saxon taxon. It was added as a sister node to the MRCA of Old High German and Modern High German. This created a topology where Old Saxon and its descendant, Low German, are closely related to the High German clade but do not have to undo the effects of the High German Consonant Shift. In terms of branch length, Old Saxon's age was again randomly generated, but it was centered around the same value as Old High German. Old Saxon manuscripts tend to be slightly older than Old High German manuscripts but their age difference is not major; hence, we assume that their age should be similar. After adding a branch for Old Saxon, 
we added a sibling branch for Low German to this branch, putting these two taxa into a close relationship that is effectively one of near-direct descent. 
%Low German is branching from it, effectively saying that Low German is a direct descendant of Old Saxon. Just as in the previous case, the 
The Low German branch length has been adjusted accordingly to reflect that it is a modern language. 

A visualization of selected character data mapped onto a tree can be found in Figure \ref{fig:tree_char}. It should be stressed that this is a single tree from the tree samples we use; we account for phylogenetic uncertainty by running our model over multiple such trees.

Finally, the data for functional expansion of the analytic perfect were collected. We operationalized this expansion as a binary character. This character answers the question ``Was the present perfect construction expanded to be used for expressing narrative past?". Because of that, in upcoming sections, we will refer to the two states of this character as either {\sc extended} (E), or {\sc non-extended} (N). For the first case, a prime example is Modern High German, whereas English is a representative of a language where present perfect constructions were not extended. Both of these states are shown in Example \ref{examples:tam}.

\begin{exe}
    \ex The following sentences are calques in English and German, with the only difference being word order. \label{examples:tam}

            \\

        \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The data for this character for Old High German and Low German came from \cite{seiler2022reichenbach}, for Old English and Old Saxon from \cite{macleod_2012}, while the rest of the languages were coded according to \cite{Weber2023}. %\todo{If someone actually goes for detailed check, I only miss reference for Faroese but I am certain it's the same as Icelandic.}

%high-level overview

Under the phylogenetic comparative method that we use to analyze the evolution of stem alternations in Germanic, stem alternation patterns evolve over a phylogeny according to a continuous-time Markov (CTM) process (cf.\ \citealt{Dunn2011,haynie2016phylogenetic,Dunn2017,Cathcart2018modeling,Cathcart2020,shirtz2021evolutionary}, as well as \citealt{van2021markov}, where time-series change in verbal morphology is modeled with a CTM chain). 
Under this stochastic process, a system undergoes transitions between different states, as schematized in Figure \ref{fig:CTM}. 
Between-state transitions occur according to frequencies whose expected values are represented by transition rates; as there are five different states, a schema like that shown would have $5 ~\text{states} \times 4 ~\text{transitions (to other states)} ~+ 1 ~\text{death} ~\text{rates} = 21~\text{parameters}$. 
These parameters represent transitions between states as well as transitions to the state {\sc dead}, the last of which is state independent. 
A CTM chain has a stationary or equilibrium distribution, which represents the proportion of time that the system is expected to be in different states as time approaches infinity; this distribution can be interpreted as the long-term preference for particular states. 
In our study, we allow the basic CTM process shown in Figure \ref{fig:CTM} --- specifically, rates for transitions represented by solid lines --- to vary across regimes represented by different TAM states, yielding a basic model with $41$ parameters ($5 ~\text{states} \times 4 ~\text{transitions} \times 2~\text{regimes} ~+ 1 ~\text{death} ~\text{rate}$). 
This allows us to investigate whether there are different propensities for certain stem alternation patterns depending on whether present perfect expresses narrative past. %\todo{Enumeration of rates is wrong: fix}

In the model setting we employ, the evolution of the analytic perfect constructions in Germanic is treated as a given, observed entity on which the evolution of verb-level patterns is conditioned, rather than co-inferring properties of the evolution of all variables of interest. 
%has to be known to be included in the model as a variable, rather than co-inferring the evolution of the two variables. 
%This will inform the model, at any given point in the tree, which regime should be applied. 
In our model, which lineages (in this case branches or segments of branches) belong to which regime is given information that serves as input to our model. 
So-called ``painting'' of regimes onto trees \citep{beaulieu2012modeling} is standard practice for complex models like the one we use. 

The data collected for this study apply only to the tips of the tree but not the internal nodes of the trees and not to certain points on branches. To solve this problem, we used stochastic character mapping, as implemented in \textsf{phytools} \citep{phytools}. Stochastic character mapping allows us to track the probability of change from a {\sc non-extended} participle to an {\sc extended} one at any moment along any branch. Note that we start with state {\sc N} at the root, as this is universally agreed to be an innovation in Germanic, as opposed to a retention \citep{seiler2022reichenbach}. In principle, one could use probabilities of the participle being extended in meaning to inject additional uncertainty in the model. However, this creates additional complications for the implementation, so we limited ourselves to a deterministic definition of regimes, i.e., the transitions occur either according to the {\sc E} regime, or {\sc N} regime. To do that, we track the probability of the {\sc E} being higher than 50\% along a branch and once the probability is higher than this threshold, the {\sc E} regime kicks in. This tree-painting procedure is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:transform_simmap}.

%mapping onto tree

%flat, global process vs. hierarchical process

The evolution of stem alternation patterns was modeled jointly for the 107 Germanic verbs in our sample. 
We make use of two model settings in our analyses. 
In the first of these, a flat, non-hierarchical model, all verbs evolve according to a single shared set of $41$ parameters that vary across the two TAM regimes described above. 
This rather restrictive assumption may be unrealistic, as different pressures may be active in different cognate classes; furthermore, 
%as in the case of no pooling for regression models, 
inferred parameter values may be sensitive to skews in the data. 
As a more realistic alternative model, we employ a hierarchical model, which assumes that lexeme-level transition rates are drawn from hierarchical distributions corresponding to each transition type, analogous to random effects in a regression model. 
This allows us to account for idiosyncrasies in change patterns at the level of the individual verb while shedding light on global trends in the verbal system on the whole. 

The hierarchical model incorporates log-normally distributed priors over transition rates, with the hyperparameters $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma$ (scale) governing the distributions for each transition type across verbs. These priors define normal distributions for log-transformed transition rates, allowing for variability across verbs while enforcing regularization to prevent overfitting. 
%\todo{revisit this}
The lexeme-specific transition rates 
%($\epsilon_v$, a separate $\epsilon$ for each verb $v$) 
for each verb are modeled as deviations from the global %mean 
expected value. 
%scaled by the shared standard deviation parameter. 
This structure enforces partial pooling \citep{gelman2007data,mcelreath2020statistical} by shrinking verb-specific estimates toward the global trends defined by the two TAM regimes. Regime-level parameters (corresponding to {\sc N} and {\sc E}) are sampled independently. 

In summary, the model jointly analyzes the evolution of stem alternation patterns in 107 Germanic verbs using two approaches: a flat model with shared parameters and a hierarchical model that accounts for verb-level variability. The hierarchical model employs log-linear priors to enable partial pooling across verbs, regularizing verb-specific transition rates toward global trends defined by the TAM regimes. This approach balances the capturing of general patterns of change while accommodating individual differences among verbs.

We fit both models on 50 trees from the tree sample, each mapped according to the regimes representing the TAM states E(xtended) and N(ot extended). Fitting the model on multiple trees serves to incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty. Prior to fitting the model on real data, we validated our model on the basis of simulated data in order to ensure that our model fitting procedure is not prone to false positives.
%As an additional validation of our results, we fit a non-hierarchical (non-pooling) model on the data of 100 features on 50 trees from the tree sample in order to assess whether the results of our main analysis hold for a less complex model and whether our main model's complexity is justified. 
We find that hierarchical model falsely detects an effect --- a decisive difference in stationary probability between the two regimes for a state --- in only 1 case, when using 99\% highest density interval, and in 2 cases when using 95\% highest density interval. That is, only 2 states in two separate trees are found to be decisively different across the two regimes out of 250 possible cases (50 trees $\times$ 5 states, excluding \textsc{d}).
In the aforementioned analyses, we do not make any prior assumptions about verb-level alternation patterns to be reconstructed to Proto-Germanic, 
%{\color{orange} [cite source for expert reconstructions].} 
but find that our model produces reconstructions that agree with expert ones for 89\% of the verbs in our data set (\ref{appendix.reconstruction}). 
As an additional validation, we run the hierarchical model on the MCC tree of the tree sample while constraining the ancestral pattern for each verb at the root of the tree to match expert reconstructions (\ref{appendix.constrained}). %We find that the results reported in the main section of this paper are obtained across all model variations that we run. 

%{\color{red} We find that the results reported in the main section of this paper are obtained across all model variations that we run. But entry/exit rates are different for ancestral reconstructed tree} 

We use Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO-CV, \citealt{vehtari2017practical}) estimation to compare the predictive performance of the hierarchical and non-hierarchical models, finding better performance for the hierarchical model and therefore justifying this model's additional complexity. 
The models are fitted using \textsf{RStan} \citep{Carpenteretal2017}. 
Further details of the model specification and inference along with a complete description of the simulation procedure can be found in the Appendix \ref{app:model}.

samples from the posterior distributions of model parameters, in our case between-state CTM transition rates. 
We evaluate our main hypothesis of interest, namely whether there is a greater preference for the ABB pattern, using inferred posterior parameter values and quantities derived from these parameter values. 
For each posterior sample, we calculate the stationary distribution of the CTM process characterized by the sampled transition rates in order to construct a posterior distribution of stationary distributions, representing the long-term preferences for each alternation pattern in the extended and non-extended TAM regimes. 
We assess the degree to which the two TAM regimes differ in their propensities for different states by computing the pairwise differences in posterior samples between the extended and non-extended regimes for each alternation pattern's stationary probability. 
We calculated stationary probabilities by normalizing the right eigenvectors of the CTM rate matrix using R's \texttt{svd()} function. 
In line with relatively conservative Bayesian hypothesis assessment criteria \citep{kruschke2021bayesian}, we consider a difference to be decisive only if the 95\% highest posterior density interval (HDI) excludes zero, a null value representing no difference. 

Figure \ref{fig:stat.prob} displays posterior distributions of differences in alternation pattern-level stationary probabilities (extended vs. non-extended). 
As is clear, the long-term preference for ABB is decisively higher in the extended regime than in the non-extended one; the 95\% HDI of differences excludes zero, with 100\% of samples showing a difference greater than zero. 
Additionally, the long-term preference for AAA is decisively lower in the extended regime than in the non-extended one. 
This is at least partially %an artifact  
a property of reallocation of mass on the probability simplex: increases in probability mass of one event coincide with decreases in probability mass of another event. 
Our results display a clear relative preference for ABB and relative dispreference for AAA under the extended regime. 
%if a counterargument is that we are seeing a rise of AAA in contact-prone areas, why would we see a decrease simply in ABB 
However, in principle, two scenarios could be at play here. 
It could be the case that extension leads to a higher preference for the ABB pattern, and the decreased preference for AAA on lineages with extension is simply an artifact of the increased preference for ABB. 
Conversely, it could be the case that lineages within the non-extended regime, several of which show various types of simplification of the verbal system (e.g., inflectional syncretism), some of which may be due to contact-induced language shift \citep{dahl2001circum,cole2022contact}, display a greater preference for the AAA pattern, and the decreased preference for ABB is an epiphenomenon of this. However, if the latter scenario were true, we would expect differences in preference for other alternation pattern types across the two regimes (viz., a decreased preference for all non-uniform alternation patterns in the non-extended regime), but we do not see this. 

To further clarify the dynamics of change that underlie the increased preference for the ABB pattern on extended branches, we inspect other properties of our inferred evolutionary parameters. 
For each state, we compute posterior exit and entry rates, representing the overall frequencies at which verb forms abandon a given alternation pattern for another or adopt a pattern 
(for details on how these quantities are calculated, see the appendix).

Entries in bold face indicate intervals that do not overlap with 0 and display decisive evidence for a difference.}
\end{table} 

Figures \ref{fig:exit.rates} and \ref{fig:entry.rates} provide posterior distributions of differences in exit and entry rates for different alternation patterns (extended vs. non-extended). %for the two tree samples we use. 
Table \ref{table:hdis} summarizes this information in a tabular format. 
According to our criteria, we find that there is no difference in entry rates across regimes for all alternation patterns, but the exit rate for the pattern ABB is decisively lower in the extended regime than in the non-extended one. 
This indicates that the chief mechanism responsible for the asymmetry in preferences across regimes is that verbs displaying the ABB pattern abandon this pattern less frequently in the extended regime than in the non-extended regime. 
Thus, the expansion of narrative past tense semantics to present perfect creates a state of affairs that facilitates the persistence and entrenchment of this semantically motivated stem alternation pattern; however, it is not necessarily the case that verbs that did not originally display the ABB pattern are more likely to be attracted to it in this regime. 

\section{Discussion}

Our results are twofold: first, we confirm a previously proposed association between the TAM semantics of the Germanic analytic perfect and the ABB stem alternation pattern using data from multiple Germanic languages and a phylogenetic model that explicitly characterizes the dynamics of linguistic evolution. 
Second, we shed light on the mechanisms that underlie this association, which could stem from a number of underlying factors. 
The evolutionary transition rates most likely to give rise to the data we observe suggest that the dynamic is largely one involving the retention of certain patterns under certain circumstances, rather than a scheme under which items are drawn to a beneficial pattern. This is the scenario envisioned by previous studies as being responsible for the association between extended narrative past tense and the ABB pattern (e.g., \citealt{desmet_vandevelde2019}, who frame this association in terms of the longer survival of ABB), but to our knowledge, our results are the first confirmation of this view capable of explicitly teasing apart a wide variety of mechanisms at play. %\todo{Alexandru, is this correct? Do these authors believe the dynamic is the one that we give evidence for? Really about survival.}
%\todo{qualify}

%{\color{purple} Link to the literature arguing for this dynamic --- Alexandru, do you have anything?} 

This finding bears on debates in the literature on morphological change regarding irregularization versus the preservation of regularity, albeit indirectly. %, {\color{blue} as we do not focus as closely on changes between alternation patterns in terms of the relative simplicity or complexity they bring about (e.g., an ABB $\rightarrow$ ABC change introduces more allomorphy into a paradigm). } 
There is some debate as to whether irregularity is found in communicatively beneficial contexts (e.g., high-frequency items; \citealt{Blevinsetal2017}) due to changes that actively introduce irregularity \citep{Nuebling2000} or simply due to the maintenance of irregular patterns \citep{Gaeta2007} that result from orthogonal processes such as sound change \citep{sturtevant1947introduction}. 
While it is uncontroversial that Germanic languages undergo irregularization at times, e.g., German {\it R\"uckumlaut} \citep{fertig2017morphological}, the innovation of English past tense {\it dived} $\rightarrow$ {\it dove} \citep{newberry2017detecting}, etc., our results support the idea that the distribution of certain irregular, non-uniform paradigms (specifically ABB) overwhelmingly results from the conservation of a much older irregular pattern inherited from Proto-Indo-European whose origins are unclear but may be due to prosodic conditioning at an earlier stage of the proto-language \citep{lundquist2018morphology}. %\todo{cite e.g. ƒåop?}

%issues to flag in conclusion: we assume a directed association between semantics and morphology, which 

Some discussion is warranted regarding the causal interpretation of our results. 
Our results are compatible with a scenario under which present perfect constructions expand their meaning to be used for narrative past, which causes verbs to retain the ABB pattern with higher probability. 
%{\color{purple} We don't use an explicit causal model.} 
%At the same time, we have assumed a directed association from semantics to morphology, and have not allowed the causal chain to fall out of the data. 
At the same time, ours is not an explicit causal model: we have assumed a directional association from semantics to morphology, and have not allowed the causal chain between the two variables to fall out of the data. 
In our view, this assumption is justified; while it has been posited that certain morphological phenomena directly influence semantics and conceptualization 
%check sources on classifiers leading to transnumerality .. other whorfian stuff?
\citep{Lucy1992,Acquaviva2004}, we know of no plausible, well-motivated claim that Germanic languages underwent extension of narrative past tense to perfect participles due to the higher frequencies of the ABB stem alternation pattern. 

Those familiar with phylogenetic comparative methods may question why we have assumed a directional association from semantics to morphology rather than employing certain standard tools for phylogenetic causal inference. 
The Discrete method and its variants \citep{Pagel1994,PagelMeade2006} explicitly model precedence relations in changes involving pairs of correlated features, which can be seen as an operationalization of causality. 
However, we are not working with a pair of two features, but rather with changes in TAM plus 107 cognate verbs. Extending the Discrete model to the analysis of the coevolution of 108 features would result in an intractable CTM state space that would need to take into account a number of value combinations %across features 
that scales exponentially with the number of features. In contrast, our approach allows us to model individual verbs as evolving according to independently and identically distributed parameters with a factorizable likelihood, facilitating model comparison techniques such as PSIS-LOO-CV. 
It is worth noting that it is in theory possible to model the coevolution between verb-level patterns and TAM semantics independently for each verb in our sample, but this has the consequence of assuming that TAM semantics evolves independently across verbs rather than at the language level. While this approach is vaguely reminiscent of views of grammar which argue for an item-based approach to acquisition, usage and change \citep{goldberg2006constructions}, 
%representations 
the latter assumption strikes us as less controversial and better motivated, particularly since we do not observe any synchronic intra-language variation in TAM semantics at the level of individual verbs (item-based approaches may be better suited to modeling other phenomena, such as changes in grammatical relations for individual verbs; \citealt{bardhdal2012reconstructing}). 
%\todo{link to literature on slavic aspect?}

Another possible means of investigating causal relationships between coevolving variables is a recently developed method for continuous traits which infers whether changes in the value of one variable bring about changes in the ``optimal'' value of the other trait, i.e., the value to which it is expected to revert in the long term \citep{ringen2021novel,sheehan2023coevolution}. 
%\todo{describe a bit more concretely what the method does}
%that detects changes in optima 
At the time of writing, this method has been used exclusively to explore relationships between pairs of variables; while it can be expanded to explore dependencies between more than two variables, it is not clear if it will scale well to more than a hundred variables, given computational considerations such as the construction of large covariance matrices. 
In theory, while this method should be extendable to non-ordinal categorical data, we have not yet explored the consequences that various choices vis \`a vis this model would have for analyzing the data we work with. 
However, as causal phylogenetic models grow more flexible, addressing questions of this sort will become more feasible. 




\section{Conclusion}

This paper employed a phylogenetic model to explore the evolution of morphological patterns at the lexeme-level in the Germanic subgroup of Indo-European. 
We used a hierarchical model which allowed us to uncover an association between TAM semantics of the present perfect and a particular stem alternation pattern (ABB) while controlling for idiosyncratic behavior at the lexical level. While we did not explicitly include variables pertaining to usage-based properties like frequency, etc., it is likely that the structure of our model captures variability along these lines at least indirectly. 
As historical and synchronic resources are expanded and flexible phylogenetic models of this sort are further developed, it will be possible to investigate the role of a suite of factors underlying phenomena of this sort. 
The approach can be extended to address other questions regarding the evolution of patterns within lexical items and related phenomena. %, such as, e.g., whether environmental factors shape phonotactic patterns in word forms \citep{maddieson2018language,wang2023temperature}. 

Our results confirm a hypothesis regarding the greater affinity for certain stem alternation patterns under certain TAM configurations. To our knowledge, we are the first to uncover this association using a phylogenetic model. This model can be seen simply as a means of demonstrating an association while accounting for Galton's problem \citep{Narroll1961}, i.e., the fact that patterns found in phylogenetically related taxa are not independent observations. However, the utility of such models does not end here: as we show, the transition rate parameters of phylogenetic models also provide information further clarifying the mechanisms underlying associations of this sort, and can directly engage with mechanistic explanations (e.g., cognitive, sociolinguistic) regarding how these patterns emerge and are maintained.

\subsection{Hierarchical model}
\label{hierarchical-model}

\href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/models_code/simmap_verb_hierarchy.stan#L105-112}{Transition rates} of our hierarchical model have the following distributions. 
The global death rate of verbs, which is state independent and does not vary across verbs or regimes $\delta \sim \text{LogNormal}(0,1)$.
A transition rate 
between states $i \neq j \in \{\text{AAA},\text{AAB},\text{ABA},\text{ABB},\text{ABC}\}$ %(where neither is the state {\sc dead}) 
for verb $v \in \{1,...,V\}$ 
in regime $r \in \{\text{\sc E(xtended)},\text{\sc N(on-extended)}\}$ 
is denoted by 
$\rho^{r}_{v,i,j} \sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu^r_{i,j},\sigma^r_{i,j})$, where $\mu^r_{i,j} \sim \text{Normal}(0,1), \sigma^r_{i,j} \sim \text{HalfNormal}(0,1)$. 

From each set of verb-specific rates (plus the death rate) we construct two 
\href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/models_code/simmap_verb_hierarchy.stan?ref_type=heads#L2-33}{rate matrices} (one for each regime), 
%$Q^{\text{\sc e}},Q^{\text{\sc n}}$; 
$Q_v^r : r \in \{\text{\sc E},\text{\sc N}\}$; 
off-diagonal cells contain inter-state transition rates (as defined above); diagonal cells contain the negative sum of all other cells in the same row. %\todo{Discuss rate comparison}
The likelihoods of the patterns attested in cognates of verb $v \in \{1,...,V\}$, $P(X|Q,T) = \prod_{v=1}^V P(\boldsymbol{x_v}|Q_v,T)$, can be computed individually via the \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/models_code/simmap_verb_hierarchy.stan#L36-71}{pruning algorithm} \citep{felsenstein1981,felsenstein2004}, a dynamic program that exploits the conditional independence structure of directed acyclic graphs (such as phylogenies; cf.\ \citealt{pearl2022reverend}). 
In post-order traversal (i.e., moving from nodes directly ancestral to the tips of the tree toward the root), we compute the following partial likelihood for each node $n$ ancestral to each branch segment,
$$
\mathcal{L}^n_v(s) = \prod_{d \in D(n)} \sum_{t \in \mathbb{S}} P_{s \rightarrow t}(\ell_{n,d};Q_v^{r_{n,d}}) \mathcal{L}^d_v(t)
$$
where $D(n)$ denotes the descendants of node $n$; 
%(which may number one or two depending on whether the node lies at a bifurcation) 
$\mathbb{S}$ the set of states; 
$P_{s \rightarrow t}(\ell_{n,d};Q_v^{r_{n,d}})$ the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $t$ over time interval $\ell_{n,d}$, the length of the branch segment between node $n$ and its descendant $d$, under the rates for verb $v$ associated with $r_{n,d}$, the regime of the branch segment between node $n$ and its descendant $d$ (via matrix exponentiation: $P(\ell_{n,d};Q_v^{r_{n,d}}) = \exp{(Q_v^{r_{n,d}} \ell_{n,d})}$); and $\mathcal{L}_v^d(t)$ the likelihood of state $t$ at node $d$. State likelihoods at tips of the tree will be either 1 (if they attest the state in question) or 0; for tips with missing data, all state likelihoods are set to 1. 
The likelihood for the entire tree at the root $r$ is $P(\boldsymbol{x_v}|Q_v,T) = \sum_{s \in \mathbb{S}} \pi(s)\mathcal{L}_v^r(s)$, where $\pi(s)$ is the prior probability of state $s$ at the root of the tree (which we set uniformly to %$|\mathbb{S}|^{-1}$). 
$\frac{1}{\mathbb{S}}$). 

We draw posterior parameter samples using RStan \citep{Carpenteretal2017}. 
%For each tree in our tree sample, we draw samples from the posterior distribution $P(Q|X,T) \propto P(Q,X,T) = \prod_{v=1}^V P(x_v|Q_v,\Psi) P(Q)$ using RStan \citep{Carpenteretal2017}. 
We construct an approximation to the posterior distribution of parameters that incorporates uncertainty over the space of phylogenies $\Psi$ using tree samples (denoted $\mathbb{T}$), $P(Q|X) \propto P(Q,X) = \allowbreak \int_\Psi P(X|Q,\Psi) \allowbreak P(Q) P(\Psi) dT \allowbreak \approx %{|\mathbb{T}|^{-1}} \sum_{t \in \mathbb{T}} P(X|Q,T) P(Q)$ 
\frac{1}{|\mathbb{T}|} \sum_{t \in \mathbb{T}} P(X|Q,T) P(Q)$ 
by aggregating posterior samples across trees. 
For each tree in the 50-tree sample, we run \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/simmap_verb_hierarchy.R#L105-116}{10000 iterations} of the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) over 4 chains, discarding the first 8000 samples. We set the {\tt adapt\underline{\phantom{x}}delta} argument to $0.999$, which decreases the step size of the sampler and mitigates divergence across chains. 
We use the {\tt map\underline{\phantom{x}}rect()} function to parallelize the computation of verb-level likelihoods. 
%\todo{redo}
We monitor convergence using the potential scale reduction factor \citep{gelman1992inference}, with values close to 1 indicating that all chains have mixed. 
We aggregate posterior samples together from individual trees in the sample using the function {\tt sflist2stanfit()}. 

Following rate inference, we use posterior expected rate values to address a number of hypotheses of interest. We construct \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analyze_output/stationary_prob.R#L46-50}{posterior rate matrices} of expected transition rates under each regime, $Q_0^{r} : r \in \{\text{\sc e},\text{\sc n}\}$ from the expected rates $\exp{\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}\right)}$ and $\exp{\left(\delta\right)}$. We compute the \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analyze_output/stationary_prob.R#L52-53}{posterior stationary distributions} $\boldsymbol{\pi}^r : r \in \{\text{\sc e},\text{\sc n}\}$ for each regime using R's {\tt svd()} function, normalizing the right eigenvalues. 
Entry and exit rates are calculated as follows (derived by Gerhard J\"ager {\it apud} \citealt[SI 8--10]{CarlingCathcart2021b}); %\footnote{The formula for entry rates was derived for the authors by Gerhard J\"ager.} 
below, $R(i \rightarrow j)$ denotes the transition rate from state $i$ to state $j$, and $\pi(j)$ denotes the stationary probability of state $j$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analyze_output/entry+exit_rates_new.R?ref_type=heads#L142-143}{Exit rate for state} $i$: $$\sum_{j \neq i} R(i \rightarrow j)$$

\end{itemize}
We construct posterior distributions of differences in stationary probabilities, entry, and exit rates between the extended and non-extended regimes by taking the differences of these parameters across samples. 
We compute HDIs with the R package {\tt HDInterval} \citep{HDI}. 

\subsection{Non-hierarchical model}

Our non-hierarchical setting assumes that rates of change are \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/models_code/simmap_no-hierarchy.stan?ref_type=heads#L104-105}{invariant across cognate verbs}, and that each verb $v \in \{1,...,V\}$ evolves according to the rates $\exp \left( \boldsymbol{\mu} \right)$ and $\exp \left( \delta \right)$. 
Details of inference are as above. 

\subsection{Model comparison}
We carry out model comparison between the \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/model_comparison/compare_models.R}{hierarchical and flat models
using PSIS-LOO-CV} \citep{vehtari2017practical}. %For both tree samples, t
The hierarchical model greatly outperforms the flat model; between-model differences exceed $\pm$2 standard errors of the differences ($\text{ELPD}_{\text{\sc hier}} - \text{ELPD}_{\text{\sc flat}} = 57.90, \text{SE}(\Delta \text{ELPD}) = 11.87$).

\subsection{Ancestral state reconstruction}
\label{appendix.reconstruction}

%\todo[color=purple]{@Alexandru: Which model? Hierarchical? Flat? It is important to be as clear as possible. Link to code!!!} 
We use \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/anc_rec/anc_rec.R#L106-115}{fitted rate parameters from the hierarchical model} to reconstruct ancestral state distributions for each verb in our data set to the root of the tree, representing Proto-Germanic. 
The probability of state $s$ at the root of the tree is proportional to the quantity $\pi(s)\mathcal{L}_v^r(s)$, \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/anc_rec/anc_rec.R#L119}{normalized so that all probabilities sum to $1$} \citep{yang2014molecular}. 
We carry out this procedure for each posterior rate sample, sampling a state from the categorical distribution parameterized by the resulting distribution of states at the root, and compute the posterior probability of each sampled state. 
For each verb, we \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/anc_rec/eval_rec.R?ref_type=heads}{compare the state with highest probability to the state reconstructed to Proto-Germanic by experts} (we rely primarily on the paradigmatic information found in Wiktionary, which is taken primarily from \citealt{ringe2008proto}). 
According to this procedure, our model reconstructs ancestral states with 89\% accuracy, correctly reconstructing 95 out of 107 verbal patterns for Proto-Germanic.


%After fitting the model, we fixed parameter distributions and ran Felsenstein's algorithm to obtain the most likely states for each verb of the Proto-Germanic according to our model. These reconstructions have form of probability of each state at the root. We take the state with the highest probability and consider it our reconstruction and compare the accuracy of the reconstructions against the expert reconstructions. According to this procedure, our model had 89\% accuracy --- it correctly reconstructed 95 out of 107 verbal patterns for Proto-Germanic.


\subsection{Ancestry-constrained model}
\label{appendix.constrained}

As an additional validation of our results, we ran an ancestry-constrained version of the hierarchical model, intended to assess whether we obtain similar results when we enforce the state reconstructed at the root of the tree to match expert reconstructions arrived at via the comparative method. 
We repeat the procedure described for the hierarchical model (due to the computationally intensive nature of model fitting, we limit ourselves to running the model on the \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis_results/tam_simmap_root/summ_simmap_mcc.rds?ref_type=heads}{MCC tree of the tree sample}), with one key difference: for each verbal cognate set, we attach an \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/analysis/tam_simmap_root.R?ref_type=heads#L20-21}{``adventitious'' branch of very short length to the root of the tree}, setting the state of the descendant node to the state reconstructed to Proto-Germanic by experts (we rely primarily on the paradigmatic information found in Wiktionary). %, but check this against the inflectional classes reconstructed by \citealt{kroonen2013etymological}). NB: NO CLASS INFO IN KROONEN, to my knowledge, just strong or weak. 
%\todo{some expert source?} 
Under this setting, we find the same key result as for the hierarchical model, i.e., that there is a higher stationary probability of ABB and lower stationary probability of AAA in the extended regime than in the non-extended regime. 

\subsection{Simulation-based validation study}

%We carry out a simulation study to validate the model-fitting procedure used in this paper. 
%To validate our model-fitting procedure, we conduct a simulation study designed to assess the false positive rate of our hierarchical inference framework. 
We conducted a simulation study designed to assess the extent to which our hierarchical model-fitting procedure yields false positives and validate whether our result reported in this paper can be trusted. 
Specifically, we \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/simulation/sim_history.R?ref_type=heads#L37-78}{simulated data under a non-hierarchical model} with no differences in behavior across TAM regimes (extended vs.\ non-extended), and then \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/simulation/sim_history.R?ref_type=heads#L81-116}{fitted the hierarchical model on this synthetic data} to examine whether it erroneously detects differences in stationary probabilities between the two regimes. 
If the hierarchical model infers systematic differences between regimes where none exist, this would indicate an elevated false positive rate and potential model overfitting. 

We generated synthetic character matrices. We simulated character evolution for \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/simulation/sim_history.R?ref_type=heads#L24-25}{$100$ hypothetical verbs across $50$ phylogenetic trees}. The trees were the same as the ones used in the main analysis. The evolutionary process followed a non-hierarchical model where each verb shared a single set of transition rates across states, without any variation across regimes. This ensures that any inferred differences between regimes in the hierarchical analysis stem from model artifacts rather than genuine underlying patterns.

%The transition rate matrix $Q$ for each verb was constructed as follows. Off-diagonal elements represented transition rates between states. 
Each verb's transition rates were drawn from a log-normal hyper-distribution with parameters $\mu = 0.5$ and $\sigma = 0.1$. 
Death rates (i.e., transitions to the absorbing state \textsc{d}) were fixed at an arbitrarily small rate of $0.05$. 
%The diagonal elements are set to maintain row-wise sum constraints ($q_{ii} = -\sum_{j \neq i} q_{ij}$). 
We initialized root states such that all verbs start in the ABC state, reflecting the predominant reconstructed Proto-Germanic pattern. Evolutionary trajectories for each verb were simulated along the tree using the {\tt sim.history()} function from the {\tt phytools} \citep{phytools} package, which implements continuous-time Markov process simulations.

%To perform inference, we fit the hierarchical model to the simulated data using RStan \citep{Carpenteretal2017}. 



%The likelihood computation follows the pruning algorithm (), with a No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) used to obtain posterior samples. 

Details of inference are as described above (\ref{hierarchical-model}), except that we ran NUTS 
%Each MCMC chain runs 
for \href{https://gitlab.uzh.ch/alexandru.craevschi/germanic_strong_verbs/-/blob/main/simulation/sim_history.R?ref_type=heads#L107-116}{3000 iterations across 4 chains, discarding the first 1500 samples.} %We monitor convergence diagnostics, including $\hat{R}$, ensuring values close to 1. 
We then compared inferred stationary probabilities between the extended and non-extended regimes (the same procedure carried out for our main analyses and displayed in Figure \ref{fig:stat.prob}). Since the data were generated without regime-specific effects, any decisive difference inferred by the hierarchical model would indicate a false positive.

As mentioned in the main text, we obtained a very low false positive rate. If we use a 99\% HDI to assess whether zero is included in the posterior credible interval, we detected only one state in one tree when the difference was deemed decisive according to our testing procedure (yielding a false positive rate of $0.01$). For a 95\% HDI, there were two states in two separate trees that were decisively different in their stationary probability ($0.02$). Finally, under an 89\% HDI, we had a false positive rate of $0.06$. For the paper, we report results with a 95\% HDI.
