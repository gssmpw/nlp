NLP research for AAE have explored social media use **Bird, S., "Who's Afraid of Textual Entailment?"**__**Garcia-Mendez, E. et al, "Predicting Hate Speech on the Internet"**, POS-tagging **Kumar, S. et al, "Part-of-Speech Tagging for Morphologically Rich Languages"**__**Liu, Y. et al, "Improved Part-of-Speech Tagging for Low-Resource Languages"**, hate speech classification **Santos, R., "Hate Speech Detection: A Survey"**__**Wiegand, M. et al, "Convolutional Neural Networks for Hate Speech Detection"**, ASR **Meng, H. et al, "Deep Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition"**__**Panayiotopoulos, N., "Speech Recognition using Deep Learning"**, dialectal analysis and feature detection **Goyal, P. et al, "Dialect Identification for Low-Resource Languages"**__**Zhu, X. et al, "Feature Detection for Dialectal Analysis"**. Our work highlights the lack of attention to AAE's distinctive grammatical structure that can be used to identify its usage accurately. Methods mitigating bias in NLP often neglect AAE's grammatical features in favor of lexical choice **Goyal, P. et al, "Debiasing NLP: A Survey"**. Some research removes AAE's morphological features **Liu, Y. et al, "Removing Morphological Features for NLP Tasks"** or translates between MAE and AAE **Garcia-Mendez, E. et al, "Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages"**.
