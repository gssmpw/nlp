\begin{abstract}
Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.

\section{Conclusion}
Inspired by causality in ecology, we propose the CCMPlus module, which captures causal relationships between web services and integrates with time series models to improve web service traffic prediction.

CCMPlus first constructs shadow manifolds for each web service time series. It then estimates each time point of target time series using points from the shadow manifolds of other web services. By comparing these estimations with the ground truth of the target time series, a causal correlation matrix is computed, quantifying inter-service causal dependencies. The causal matrix is then applied to the shadow manifold embeddings, generating the CCMPlus representation, which encodes causal relationships. This representation is concatenated with the time series modelâ€™s output, bridging the gap in causal inference and enhancing prediction performance.

We evaluate CCMPlus-integrated models on real-world web service traffic datasets from Alibaba Group, Microsoft Azure, and Ant Group. The results demonstrate that CCMPlus consistently improves web service traffic prediction, confirming its effectiveness.
