\textbf{Active Noise Cancellation:} 
The concept of ANC was first introduced by Lueg ____, focusing on sound oscillation cancellation. Given that ANC algorithms must adapt to variations in amplitude, phase, and noise source movement ____, most ANC algorithms are based on the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm ____, which is effective in echo cancellation. The FxLMS (Filtered-x LMS) algorithm extends LMS by using an adaptive filter to account for distortions in the primary and secondary paths. ____ analyzed errors in FxLMS due to inaccuracies in estimating the secondary path inverse, where nonlinear distortions degrade performance. Several methods address these issues: the Filtered-S LMS (FSLMS) ____ algorithm uses a Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) ____ to handle nonlinearity, while the Volterra Filtered-x LMS (VFXLMS) ____ employs a multichannel structure. The Bilinear FxLMS ____ improves nonlinearity modeling, and the Leaky FxLMS ____ introduces a leakage term to mitigate overfitting. The Tangential Hyperbolic Function-based FxLMS (THF-FxLMS) ____ models saturation effects for enhanced performance. ____ proposed blind source separation for noise cancellation.
