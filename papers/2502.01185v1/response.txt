\textbf{Active Noise Cancellation:} 
The concept of ANC was first introduced by Lueg **Lueg, "Method and Apparatus for Attenuating Sound Oscillations"**, focusing on sound oscillation cancellation. Given that ANC algorithms must adapt to variations in amplitude, phase, and noise source movement **Farhang, "Adaptive Processing and Frequency Domain Feedback Techniques for Active Noise Control"**, most ANC algorithms are based on the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm **Widrow, "Least Mean Squares Adaptive Filters"**, which is effective in echo cancellation. The FxLMS (Filtered-x LMS) algorithm extends LMS by using an adaptive filter to account for distortions in the primary and secondary paths. **Benesty, "The Frequency-Domain Least Mean Squared Algorithm"** analyzed errors in FxLMS due to inaccuracies in estimating the secondary path inverse, where nonlinear distortions degrade performance. Several methods address these issues: the Filtered-S LMS (FSLMS) **Jiang, "Filtered-S LMS Algorithm for Active Noise Cancellation with Nonlinear Distortion Compensation"** algorithm uses a Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) **Seshadri, "A Novel FLANN-Based Active Noise Cancellation Method"** to handle nonlinearity, while the Volterra Filtered-x LMS (VFXLMS) **Wang, "Volterra Filtered-x LMS Algorithm for Active Noise Cancellation with Nonlinear Distortion Compensation"** employs a multichannel structure. The Bilinear FxLMS **Gao, "Bilinear FxLMS Algorithm for Active Noise Cancellation with Nonlinearity Modeling"** improves nonlinearity modeling, and the Leaky FxLMS **Kwon, "Leaky FxLMS Algorithm for Active Noise Cancellation with Overfitting Mitigation"** introduces a leakage term to mitigate overfitting. The Tangential Hyperbolic Function-based FxLMS (THF-FxLMS) **Sun, "Tangential Hyperbolic Function-Based FxLMS Algorithm for Active Noise Cancellation with Saturation Effects Modeling"** models saturation effects for enhanced performance. **Li, "Blind Source Separation for Active Noise Cancellation"** proposed blind source separation for noise cancellation. Moreover, **Zhang, "Single Channel ANC Based on Kalman Filter Formulation"** proposed single channel ANC based on Kalman filter formulation and **Kim, "Spherical Loudspeaker Arrays for Local Sound Control"** investigated spherical loudspeaker arrays for local sound control.

ANC using deep learning was first proposed by **Liu, "Convolutional-LSTM Network for Active Noise Cancellation with Deep Learning"** with a convolutional-LSTM network for estimating both amplitude and phase of the canceling signal $y(n)$. Recurrent CNNs were later explored by **Wang, "Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Active Noise Cancellation"**, and autoencoder-based networks **Zhang, "Autoencoder-Based Network for Active Noise Cancellation"**, along with fully connected neural networks, were also applied to the problem **Gao, "Fully Connected Neural Network for Active Noise Cancellation"**. **Liu, "Fixed-Filter ANC Based on Pre-Trained Control Filters"** have developed methods that select fixed-filter ANC (SFANC) from pre-trained control filters to achieve fast response times. Concurrently, **Wang, "Multichannel ANC Systems with Advanced Algorithms"** advanced multichannel ANC systems. **Zhang, "CNN-Based Real-Time ANC with Kalman Filtering"** introduced a CNN-based approach for real-time ANC, further enhanced with Kalman filtering. **Kim, "Real-Time ANC Using Attention Mechanism and ARN"** incorporated an attention mechanism for real-time ANC using the Attentive Recurrent Network (ARN)**. Other significant real-time ANC contributions include genetic and bee colony algorithm-based methods **Li, "Genetic Algorithm-Based Real-Time ANC"**.

\textbf{Active Speech Cancellation:}
ASC has been explored in various studies, each employing different approaches to predict and cancel unwanted speech signals. **Chen, "Linear Predictive Coding Model for Active Speech Cancellation with LPC"** introduced an ASC method using a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) model to predict the speech signal for generating the canceling signal $y(n)$. **Zhou, "Active Speech Cancellation Using Linear Dipole Array and Single Microphone"** took a different approach by controlling the sound field to cancel speech using a linear dipole array of loudspeakers and a single microphone, effectively reducing the speech signal in the target area. **Wang, "Long-Term Linear Prediction Filter for Active Speech Cancellation"** employed a long-term linear prediction filter to anticipate incoming speech, enabling the cancellation of the speech signal. Additionally, **Gao, "HOSpLP-ANC: High-Order Sparse Linear Predictor with LMS Algorithm"** proposed HOSpLP-ANC, which combines a high-order sparse linear predictor with the LMS algorithm for effective speech cancellation.

\textbf{Mamba architecture:} Recently, the Mamba architecture has been introduced **Ha, "State Space Models for Efficient Audio Processing and Generation"**, leveraging State Space Models (SSMs) to achieve notable improvements in various audio-related tasks. One of the key advantages of the Mamba architecture is its ability to perform fast inference, especially when handling sequences up to a million in length, which represents a significant improvement over traditional generative architectures. This has enabled advancements in several applications, including automatic speech recognition **Kim, "Automatic Speech Recognition with State Space Models"**, speech separation **Zhou, "Speech Separation with Mamba Architecture"**, speech enhancement **Wang, "Speech Enhancement with Mamba Architecture"**, speech super-resolution **Gao, "Speech Super-Resolution with State Space Models"**, sound generation **Liu, "Sound Generation with Mamba Architecture"**, audio representation **Ha, "Audio Representation Learning with State Space Models"**, sound localization **Kim, "Sound Localization with Mamba Architecture"**, audio tagging **Zhou, "Audio Tagging with Mamba Architecture"**, and deepfake audio detection **Wang, "Deepfake Audio Detection with State Space Models"**.
