\section{Conclusion}

We have presented FairDiverse, a comprehensive IR toolkit designed to facilitate standardized evaluations of fairness-aware and diversity-aware algorithms. FairDiverse offers three key advantages over other toolkits. (1) It provides a comprehensive framework for integrating various models at different IR pipeline stages; (2) It implements 28 fairness- and diversity-aware models for 16 recommendation and search base models; (3) It offers flexible APIs for researchers to develop and integrate custom models. 


However, a limitation of FairDiverse is that it only supports single-round fairness- and diversity-aware IR models. It does not yet support dynamic settings, such as long-term fairness or fairness under dynamic feedback loops~\cite{xu2023ltp}. In future work, we plan to expand FairDiverse to support dynamic scenarios and explore the use of LLM agents~\cite{zhang2024generative} for simulation and evaluation. Additionally, we also aim to incorporate more beyond-accuracy models, including novelty- and serendipity-aware models.
