\title[FairDiverse: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Fair and Diverse Information Retrieval Algorithms]{FairDiverse: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Fair and Diverse \\Information Retrieval Algorithms}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
In modern information retrieval (IR), achieving more than just accuracy is essential to sustaining a healthy ecosystem, especially when addressing fairness and diversity considerations. To meet these needs, various datasets, algorithms, and evaluation frameworks have been introduced. However, these algorithms are often tested across diverse metrics, datasets, and experimental setups, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in direct comparisons.
This highlights the need for a comprehensive IR toolkit that enables standardized evaluation of fairness- and diversity-aware algorithms across different IR tasks. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{FairDiverse}, an open-source and standardized toolkit.
FairDiverse offers a framework for integrating fairness- and diversity-focused methods, including pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques, at different stages of the IR pipeline. The toolkit supports the evaluation of \textbf{28} fairness and diversity algorithms across \textbf{16} base models, covering two core IR tasks—search and recommendation—thereby establishing a comprehensive benchmark.
Moreover, FairDiverse is highly extensible, providing multiple APIs that empower IR researchers to swiftly develop and evaluate their own fairness- and diversity-aware models, while ensuring fair comparisons with existing baselines. The project is open-sourced and available on GitHub:~\url{https://github.com/XuChen0427/FairDiverse}.

\section{Introduction}

% In modern information retrieval (IR) systems, ensuring fair treatment and support for both head and tail products/users is crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Building upon this idea, previous research has emphasized the importance of developing fair and diverse information retrieval systems. ensuring fair treatment and support for both head and tail products/users is crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem.

Information retrieval (IR) tasks, such as search and recommendation, typically aim to select the information that meets user needs~\cite{IRbook, chowdhury2010introduction}. 
In modern IR, factors beyond the accuracy of information access, such as novelty, diversity, and fairness, are crucial for building a healthy ecosystem~\cite{Li_sigir24}. 
Among these factors, fairness and diversity have gained increasing attention in recent years~\cite{li2022fairness, santos2010exploiting, PM2_12_sigir}. Both aim to expose users to a broader range of information sources~\cite{santos2010exploiting, dang2012diversity} while also supporting diverse types of providers~\cite{fairrec, xu2023p}.

To ensure fairness and diversity in IR systems, many fairness-aware~\cite{fairrec, xu2023p, TaxRank, SDRO, APR, FairNeg, cpfair, rus2024study} and diversity-aware algorithms~\cite{li2022fairness, santos2010exploiting, qin2020diversifying, yan2021diversification} have been designed as plugins or modules that can be integrated into various stages of the IR pipeline. However, fairness and diversity often suffer from a lack of unified definitions~\cite{li2022fairness, LLM4FairSurvey}. 
As a result, the evaluation of these algorithms in IR systems are based on different metrics, datasets, and evaluation settings (details are shown in Section~\ref{sec:related_work}). Hence, the performance of these algorithms cannot be compared consistently. Developing a unified, fair, and extensible toolkit for fairness and diversity is critically important and urgently needed to evaluate these algorithms consistently across IR tasks. Such a toolkit framework holds significant value for fostering a trustworthy IR community.

To create a unified and equitable evaluation, we introduce FairDiverse, an open-source standardized toolkit designed to assess fairness and diversity in IR systems.
First, FairDiverse offers detailed guidance on incorporating fairness- and diversity-aware algorithms throughout various stages of the IR process. These algorithms are categorized into pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods, corresponding to data processing, model training, and result evaluation stages in different IR pipeline steps, respectively. 
Then, FairDiverse implements a wide range of fairness- and diversity-aware models (\textbf{28} models) tailored to \textbf{16} base models under two fundamental IR tasks: search and recommendation. 
It offers corresponding implementation code and systematically evaluates these algorithms using over ten accuracy, fairness, and diversity metrics, enabling the construction of a benchmark within FairDiverse.

%FairDiverse evaluates two fundamental tasks in IR: search and recommendation. Recognizing that unfairness and lack of diversity often arise during the data collection, model training, and evaluation stages of IR systems, FairDiverse categorizes \textbf{30+} fairness- and diversity-aware algorithms into three types: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods. It provides corresponding implementation code and systematically evaluates these algorithms using more than ten IR accuracy, fairness, and diversity metrics across ten datasets, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework and workflow.

In the literature, only a few open-source toolkits and libraries have been developed for fairness- and diversity-aware IR algorithms. Table~\ref{tab:compare} provides a comparison between these existing resources and the proposed FairDiverse, highlighting features such as supported IR tasks (recommendation and search), algorithm types (pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing), and the number of implemented models. Other toolkit details are provided in Section~\ref{sec:related_work}. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:compare}, FairDiverse provides the largest number of models, offering extensive coverage of all types of fairness- and diversity-aware algorithms. Additionally, it supports major information retrieval (IR) tasks, including search and recommendation, making it a versatile and comprehensive toolkit.

FairDiverse is designed to be highly extensible, providing a range of flexible APIs that allow IR researchers to efficiently develop and integrate their own fairness- and diversity-aware IR models. This extensibility ensures that researchers can tailor the toolkit to their specific needs while maintaining consistency with established evaluation protocols. This makes it an invaluable resource for advancing fairness and diversity in IR systems.
