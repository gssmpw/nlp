We plan to explore electron transport differences with more heavy species, especially meta-stables and excited species. 
%Also, we plan to develop a 2D $\vect{x}$-space BTE solver and study two-dimensional fluid and BTE effects on electron transport in LTPs. 
Both fluid and hybrid approaches require long time horizons with thousands of RF cycles to achieve time-periodic solutions. The above can be eliminated by a reduce-order model that can generate approximate time-periodic solutions, and the above can be used as an initial condition for the high-fidelity model. Another possible extension would be to explore spatially adaptive velocity space discretization. This can benefit greatly, especially moving towards solving the 3D3V BTE.
