We introduced NeurFlow, a framework that systematically elucidates the function and interactions of neuron groups within neural networks. By focusing on the most important neurons, we revealed relationships between neuron groups,  which are often obscured by the inherent complexity of neural network structures. Furthermore, we fully automated the processes of identifying, interpreting, and annotating neuron group circuits using large language models.
% Our method aims to provide a more efficient and comprehensive approach to the automated interpretation of neural activity. Through rigorous experimentation, we validated the optimality and fidelity of the proposed framework. Additionally, we demonstrated the applicability of NeurFlow across a variety of domains, including image debugging and automatic concept labeling.
