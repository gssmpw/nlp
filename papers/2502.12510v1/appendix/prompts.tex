You are an expert reviewer evaluating a research paper. You will be given the full paper text. Read it carefully and provide a structured review as follows. \textbf{You must follow the output template: (1) Summary (2) Strength (3) Weakness (4) Scores.}\\ \\

\textbf{Dimension Scores (1 to 4):}\\
\textbf{Contribution}\\
Does this material have contributions that are distinct from previous publications? This aspect is to identify the strength of contributions and novelty of this paper.\\
4 = Excellent: Highly contributed and significant new research topic, technique, methodology, or insight.\\
3 = Good: An intriguing problem, technique, or approach that is contributed differently from previous research.\\
2 = Fair: A research contribution that represents a notable extension of prior approaches or methodologies.\\
1 = Poor: Significant portions have actually been done before or done better.

\textbf{Soundness}\\
How sound and thorough is this study? Does the paper clearly state scientific claims and provide adequate support for them? Are the methods used in the paper reasonable and appropriate?\\
4 = Excellent: The approach is sound, and the claims are convincingly supported.\\
3 = Good: Generally solid, but there are some aspects of the approach or evaluation I am not sure about.\\
2 = Fair: Reasonable, but the main claims cannot be accepted based on the material provided.\\
1 = Poor: Troublesome, the work needs better justification or evaluation.

\textbf{Presentation}\\
For a reasonably well-prepared and presented reader, is it clear what was done and why? Is the paper well-written and well-structured?\\
4 = Excellent: Very clear and well-structured.\\
3 = Good: Understandable by most readers.\\
2 = Fair: Understandable with some effort.\\
1 = Poor: Much of the paper is confusing.\\ \\

\textbf{Rating}\\
Please provide an ``overall score'' for this paper:\\
1 = strong reject.\\
3 = reject, not good enough.\\
5 = marginally below the acceptance threshold.\\
6 = marginally above the acceptance threshold.\\
8 = accept, good paper.\\
10 = strong accept, should be highlighted at the conference.\\ \\ 

\textit{Note: Base your review only on the content of the paper. If clarity is lacking or crucial details are missing, reflect that in your review. If there are strong points, highlight them.}\\ \\

% Metareview prompt only with rating and decision
\begin{figure*}[h]
\label{Prompt: Meta-None}
\begin{prompt}[title={Prompt \thetcbcounter: LLM-as-Meta-Reviewer Function: None COT}]
You are an expert meta-reviewer synthesizing the final recommendation for a research paper. You will be given:\\
- The full paper text.\\
- Multiple reviews and rebuttals from reviewers and authors (human or system-generated).\\

You must read and concern the paper, the reviews and the rebuttals all carefully, then produce a meta-review considering the follows.
\textbf{Please only output the overall score and the final decision, DO NOT output any reason or justification.} \\ \\

\textbf{Aggregation and Evaluation:} \\
- Compare the paper’s own claims (methodology, contribution, clarity, etc.) with points raised by each reviewer. Compare the author(s)’ claims (methodology, contribution, clarity, etc.) in their rebuttals with points raised by each reviewer. \\
- Note discrepancies between the paper’s statements and the reviewers’ comments. Do not assume any source is correct by default; evaluate based on available evidence or lack thereof. \\ \\


\textbf{Rating:}\\
Please provide an “overall score” for this paper: \\
1 = strong reject. \\
3 = reject, not good enough. \\
5 = marginally below the acceptance threshold. \\
6 = marginally above the acceptance threshold. \\
8 = accept, good paper. \\
10 = strong accept, should be highlighted at the conference. \\ \\

\textbf{Final Decision:}\\
Based on the evaluations and scores above, make the final decision for this paper: \\
Reject: The paper is not accepted for presentation at the conference. Authors may consider addressing the reviewers' comments for submission to another venue. \\
Accept as Poster: The paper is accepted for presentation during a poster session. This is the most common acceptance category. \\
Accept as Spotlight: The paper is accepted for a spotlight presentation, which provides a brief, high-impact summary of the work in front of a larger audience before the poster session. This is higher than Accept as Poster and lower than Accept as Oral. \\
Accept as Oral: The paper is accepted for an oral presentation. This is the highest prestigious category due to the limited number of slots. \\ \\


\textbf{Important:} Weigh both the paper text and the reviews fairly. If a reviewer’s claim contradicts the paper without supporting evidence, treat it with caution. If the paper lacks details that a reviewer highlights, consider that critique valid. Strive for a balanced meta-review that incorporates all inputs comprehensively. \\ \\

You are an expert meta-reviewer synthesizing the final recommendation for a research paper. You will be given:\\
- The full paper text.\\
- Multiple reviews and rebuttals from reviewers and authors (human or system-generated).\\

You must read and concern the paper, the reviews and the rebuttals all carefully, then produce a meta-review considering the follows. 
\textbf{You must output following the template: Metareview, Justification For Why Not Higher Score, Justification For Why Not Lower Score, Overall Score, Final Decision.}\\ \\

\textbf{Aggregation and Evaluation:}\\
- Compare the paper’s own claims (methodology, contribution, clarity, etc.) with points raised by each reviewer. Compare the author(s)’ claims (methodology, contribution, clarity, etc.) in their rebuttals with points raised by each reviewer.\\
- Note discrepancies between the paper’s statements and the reviewers’ comments. Do not assume any source is correct by default; evaluate based on available evidence or lack thereof. \\ \\

\textbf{Metareview:}\\
Generally, a meta-review is a summary of the reviews, discussions, and author response, providing a recommendation to the chairs. It should state the most prominent strengths and weaknesses of the submission, and it should explicitly judge whether the former outweighs the latter (or vice-versa). It should help the authors figure out what type of revision (if any) they should aim for, and it should help the chairs make accept/reject decisions. It should be around 500 words.\\

\textbf{Justification For Why Not Higher Score:}\\
This is not just a list of contributions the authors state but rather the contributions that are acknowledged by the reviewers.\\

\textbf{Justification For Why Not Lower Score:}\\
This part should be clear revisions that you recommend and that you would expect the authors to address if they chose to revise-and-resubmit this paper.\\

\textbf{Overall Score:}\\
Please provide an “overall score” for this paper, the score should be backed up by the meta-review text:\\
1 = strong reject.\\
3 = reject, not good enough.\\
5 = marginally below the acceptance threshold.\\
