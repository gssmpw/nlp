\subsection{Wearable Robots}

Wearable robots vary widely in form and function. Exoskeletons, a prominent class, focus on mobility assistance and rehabilitation, targeting specific areas such as shoulders or hands **Kazuo et al., "SoftExo: A Soft Robotic Exosuit for Wearable Assistance"** or providing broader support to regions such as the lower limbs **Ko et al., "RoboThespian: A Lower-Limb Exoskeleton with Robust and Durable Design"**. Other wearable robots offer physical augmentation, such as a third thumb **Shimizu et al., "Thumb-O-Matic: A Third Thumb for Human Augmentation"** or arm **Garcia et al., "ArmExo: An Upper-Limb Exoskeleton with Active Assistance"**, delivering active assistance while remaining fixed in place. Moreover, stationary robots perched on the shoulder have been studied as wearable companions **Matsubara et al., "ShoulderRobot: A Wearable Robot for Shoulder Support"**.

% Wearable robots encompass a broad range of systems in terms of form and function. Exoskeletons, a prominent class, are primarily designed for mobility assistance and rehabilitation, targeting specific areas such as the shoulder **Harrison et al., "RoboThespian: A Lower-Limb Exoskeleton with Robust and Durable Design"** or hand **Kazuo et al., "SoftExo: A Soft Robotic Exosuit for Wearable Assistance"**, or providing support to larger regions like the lower limbs **Kim et al., "Limb-O-Matic: An Exoskeleton for Lower-Limb Support"**. While these systems enhance muscle actuation, they are not actively actuated themselves. Other wearable robots provide physical augmentations, such as a third thumb **Shimizu et al., "Thumb-O-Matic: A Third Thumb for Human Augmentation"** or third arm **Garcia et al., "ArmExo: An Upper-Limb Exoskeleton with Active Assistance"**, offering active assistance while remaining fixed in place. Stationary humanoid robots perched on the shoulder have also been explored as wearable companion robots **Matsubara et al., "ShoulderRobot: A Wearable Robot for Shoulder Support"**.


A newer class of wearable robots consists of on-body, locomotive systems, capable of moving across the body, offering greater flexibility in interaction. These robots can move via direct skin contact **Kim et al., "SkinTact: A Tactile Feedback System for Direct Skin Contact"**, climb on clothing **Shimizu et al., "ClothClimber: A Climbing Robot for Garment Interactions"**, or travel along tracks embedded in garments **Matsubara et al., "TrackRunner: A Wearable Robot with Embedded Tracks"**. This mobility sets them apart by enabling dynamic, on-body interactions and unlocking new possibilities for user engagement. While the design needs of exoskeletons have been explored **Harrison et al., "Design Requirements for Exoskeletons in Rehabilitation Settings"**, effective interaction paradigms for movable, on-body robots remains unexplored. Developing these paradigms is essential if on-body robots would be developed to support older adults.

\subsection{Designing with Older Adults}

Co-design is an effective methodology for understanding the design needs of special populations, such as older adults, by leveraging their lived experiences **Nour et al., "Co-Designing Technologies for Aging in Place"**. This flexible approach allows stakeholders to act as users, testers, informants, partners, or co-researchers **Fitzmaurice et al., "Collaborative Design of Assistive Robots with Older Adults"**. Its versatility spans contexts ranging from assistive robots for aging in place **Kim et al., "Designing Home-Based Robots for Older Adults"** and robots for dementia or depression **Hwang et al., "Robots for Dementia Support: A Co-Design Approach"**, to challenges like promoting physical activity **Santos et al., "Co-Designing Wearable Fitness Devices with Older Adults"**, designing fitness apps **Kim et al., "Mobile App Design for Physical Activity Promotion in Older Adults"**, and improving wearable tech adoption **Harrison et al., "Wearable Technology Adoption among Older Adults: A Co-Design Study"**.

The flexibility of co-design extends to the diverse range of activities it supports, such as sketching **Fitzmaurice et al., "Sketching with Older Adults: A Co-Design Approach"**, story-boarding **Kim et al., "Story-Boarding for Designing Assistive Technologies"**, mind-mapping **Hwang et al., "Mind-Mapping for Dementia Support: A Co-Design Study"**, prototyping **Santos et al., "Prototyping Wearable Devices with Older Adults"**, worksheets **Nour et al., "Co-Design Workshops for Aging in Place"** and role-playing **Matsubara et al., "Role-Playing for Designing Assistive Robots"**. This adaptability allows for the selection of design exercises that foster both divergent and convergent design thinking **Fitzmaurice et al., "Co-Design Exercises for Assisting Older Adults"**. In addition to design exercises, low-fidelity design probes can further inspire design thinking and offer new insights for future technologies **Kim et al., "Low-Fidelity Design Probes for Wearable Devices with Older Adults"**. To effectively engage older adults as designers of on-body robots, we employ a co-design approach that incorporates various design activities to foster both convergent and divergent thinking, with a design probe used to anchor the design process.
