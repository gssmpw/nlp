\textbf{\system} is an open-source, ML-compatible humanoid platform for efficiently collecting large-scale, high-quality training data in both simulation and the real world. We leverage massive parallel environments, an accurate digital twin for simulation, and an intuitive teleoperation device for precise upper and lower body control in real-world data collection. We demonstrate that \system meets these requirements and successfully acquires a diverse set of loco-manipulation skills from both data sources, including walking, push-ups, pull-ups, wagon pushing, bimanual, and full-body manipulation.}
