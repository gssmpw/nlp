  \caption{\textbf{Mechatronic Design.} We present three main sections: arm, leg, and head plus torso. We highlight \systems 30 active DoFs with orange markers: 7 DoFs per arm, 6 DoFs per leg, a 2-DoF neck, and a 2-DoF waist. Green markers indicate two end-effector designsâ€”a compliant palm and a parallel-jaw gripper. Purple markers denote the sensor and electronics layout with exploded views, featuring two fisheye cameras, a speaker, two microphones, an IMU, 
  % a battery box, a power board, a communication board, 
  and a Jetson Orin NX computer.}
