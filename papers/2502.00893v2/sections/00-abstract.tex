\begin{abstract}

Learning-based robotics research driven by data demands a new approach to robot hardware designâ€”one that serves as both a platform for policy execution and a tool for embodied data collection to train policies. We introduce \system, a low-cost, open-source humanoid robot platform designed for scalable policy learning and research in robotics and AI. \system enables seamless acquisition of high-quality simulation and real-world data. The plug-and-play zero-point calibration and transferable motor system identification ensure a high-fidelity digital twin, enabling zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to the real-world. A user-friendly teleoperation interface facilitates streamlined real-world data collection for learning motor skills from human demonstrations. Utilizing its data collection ability and anthropomorphic design, \system is an ideal platform to perform whole-body loco-manipulation. Additionally, \systems compact size ($0.56~\mathrm{m},\space 3.4~\mathrm{kg}$) ensures safe operation in real-world environments. Reproducibility is achieved with an entirely 3D-printed, open-source design and commercially available components, keeping the total cost under $6000~\mathrm{USD}$. Comprehensive documentation allows assembly and maintenance with basic technical expertise, as validated by a successful independent replication of the system. We demonstrate \systems capabilities through arm span, payload, endurance tests, loco-manipulation tasks, and a collaborative long-horizon scenario where two robots tidy a toy session together. By advancing ML-compatibility, capability, and reproducibility, \system provides a robust platform for scalable learning and dynamic policy execution in robotics research.

% Data-driven robotics relies on high-quality, large-scale datasets. Simulation enables scalable data collection but demands accurate digital twins, while real-world data offers high fidelity but is costly and complex. To bridge this gap, we present \system, an open-source humanoid platform designed to be ML-compatible, capable, and reproducible. 
% To ensure ML-compatibility, \system facilitates efficient data collection in both simulation and the real world. A plug-and-play calibration procedure creates a high-fidelity digital twin, validated through zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on an RL walking policy. Real-world data collection is scaled through an intuitive teleoperation system, enabling simultaneous upper and lower body control, which supports learning visuomotor policies.
% With 30 degrees of freedom, \system excels in complex whole-body control tasks such as push-ups and pull-ups, achieved by directly replaying keyframe animations in the real world.
% To ensure reproducibility, \system is designed to be low-cost, easy to build, and simple to repair. This was verified by having a second \system instance built by another CS Ph.D. student, demonstrating zero-shot loco-manipulation policy transfer between instances. Additionally, we showcased a long-horizon collaborative task involving two \system units.
% \karen{1. Need to address Toddy's capability/dofs for both manipulation and locomotion. 2. Need to make the ML-compatibility argument more crisp. Argue that we are not just designing yet another humanoid. We believe that a ML-compatible humanoid platform needs to provide two critical services, not just the robot hardware itself. First, we provide a procedure to create and calibrate the digital twin of the ToddlerBot, enabling effective learning and validation in simulation. Second, we provide a teleoperation system to facilitate large-scale real-world data collection. 3. Need to bring out the point that robot hardware for research community needs to be self-reliant (i.e. easily repairable and extensible).}
