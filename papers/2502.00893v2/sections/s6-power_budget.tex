With the motor selection finalized, we can estimate the power budget. The computer and camera together consume approximately $15~\mathrm{W}$ under typical operating conditions. Actual walking power consumption depends on the energy efficiency of the control policy, but preliminary analysis suggests that the upper body requires minimal power during walking, as it carries no additional load. The lower body operates with alternating support, meaning only one leg is actively working at a time. Assuming a 70\% duty cycle, total motor power consumption is estimated at $~60~\mathrm{W}$, requiring a $75~\mathrm{Wh}$ battery for one hour of continuous walking.

For the battery, we offer two options: A $2000~\mathrm{mAh}$ LiPo battery ($215~\mathrm{g}$) available off-the-shelf or a custom-made 4-cell 21700 battery with $5000~\mathrm{mAh}$, which has higher energy density and weighs $330~\mathrm{g}$.
In practice, the battery lasts 3–5 hours in research settings where the robot walks intermittently. The peak power output from the battery is $14.8~\mathrm{V} \times 25~\mathrm{A} = 370~\mathrm{W}$, sufficient to power all the joints. When debugging without a battery, a $15~\mathrm{V}~300~\mathrm{W}$ power supply is a practical alternative—safer and easier to obtain than those required for full-scale humanoids, which often exceed $2~\mathrm{kW}$ and $60~\mathrm{V}$.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pcb}, the battery provides a $14-19\mathrm{V}$ input, regulated to $12\mathrm{V}$ via dual step-down converters to power the motors through TTL communication outlets. An E-stop terminal block controls motor power, enabling emergency reboots. The $14-19\mathrm{V}$ output powers the Jetson Orin NX, which remains on when the battery is connected to prevent data loss from an abrupt shutdown.
