Figure~\ref{fig:joystick} illustrates the remote controller layout to teleoperate \system, with button and axis mappings detailed in Table~\ref{tab:mapping}. During teleoperation, the human operator sends velocity commands to the walking policy and determines the timing for skill transitions. The same mapping was used for Steam Deck and ROG Ally X.
