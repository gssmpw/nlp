\subsection{Range of Motion}

We design each jointâ€™s range of motion based on human biomechanics, optimizing geometries to prevent self-collisions and achieve near-human or even superhuman mobility in most joints (Figure~\ref{fig:rom}).
The additional extension of the ankle pitch partially compensates for the $40\degree$ gap in knee pitch and the absence of toes. For shoulder roll, although $90\degree$ is limited compared to a human's shoulder abduction, the same hand-up pose can be achieved by actuating the shoulder pitch joint.
