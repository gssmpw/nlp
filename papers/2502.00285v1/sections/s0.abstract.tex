Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the  training data.
%
To fill this gap, we propose \model, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a $k$ nearest neighbor-based loss that guides \model\ to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. 
Experiments show that \model\ can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22\% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.
The source code of \model\ is available at \url{https://github.com/changyanchuan/TSMini}.
