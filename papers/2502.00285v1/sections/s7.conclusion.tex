\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}


We proposed \model, a simple yet highly effective trajectory similarity learning model using a sub-view encoder for input trajectory modeling and a $k$NN-guided loss for model training. 
\model\ can capture trajectory movement patterns at different granularity and is optimized with the similarity between a trajectory and its $k$NNs. It thus produces trajectory representations robust to a variety of similarity measures.  
Experimental results on large trajectory datasets show that \model\ achieves significant improvements in accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art models by 22\% on average.
