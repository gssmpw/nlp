This paper contributes foundational research in the areas of task vector arithmetic and scalable model merging within the machine learning community. Our primary goal is to advance the theoretical understanding and practical methodologies for efficient multi-task learning and model adaptation. Given the scope of this research, we do not anticipate immediate ethical concerns or direct societal consequences. Therefore, we believe there are no specific ethical considerations or immediate societal impacts to be emphasized in the context of this work.
