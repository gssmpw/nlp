\section{Related Work}
Our work builds on analytical works that discusses language model's inconsistency____, and \framework{} is a learning scheme that mitigate such issues by encouraging consistency high-level solutions among relevant questions. \framework{} is related to previous works that use LLMs to generate programmatic solutions____ or other structures____. Some of them also aims to improve model consistency____ via programs, but our work considers abstraction and high-level solutions, which can transfer better. Several works have also been using analogy to encourage generalization ____. Our work shares a similar motivation, but we are the first to propose automatic self-supervision methods and improve model performances in the training step. Our work is also related and motivated by other works that use self-supervision or distillation signals____. Decomposition-based inference pipelines____ also inspires our work, as our programmatical solutions resembles a decomposed inference process.

% Our work builds on a shared belief among multiple works ____ that they rely on superficial word biases. Some works try to acquire symbolic signals in the form of computer programs ____, and our work borrows this formulation as the generation target, which is both controllable and explainable. Distant and self-supervision ____ are also relevant to our work since we acquire automatic signals that save time and money compared with human annotation. Several works have also been using analogto encourage generalization ____, and our work is the first to propose automatic self-supervision methods.
