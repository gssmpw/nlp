\begin{abstract}
Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials (MLIPs) enable accelerated simulations for materials discovery. However, current research efforts fail to impactfully utilize MLIPs due to: 1. Overreliance on Density Functional Theory (DFT) for MLIP training data creation; 2. MLIPs' inability to reliably and accurately perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for diverse materials; 3. Limited understanding of MLIPs' underlying capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we aargue that MLIP research efforts should prioritize: 1. Employing more accurate simulation methods for large-scale MLIP training data creation (e.g. Coupled Cluster Theory) that cover a wide range of materials design spaces; 2. Creating MLIP metrology tools that leverage large-scale benchmarking,  visualization, and interpretability analyses to provide a deeper understanding of MLIPs' inner workings; 3. Developing computationally efficient MLIPs to execute MD simulations that accurately model a broad set of materials properties. Together, these interdisciplinary research directions can help further the real-world application of MLIPs to accurately model complex materials at device scale.

% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}
% \vspace{-0.1cm}
% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of  Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
