abstract = {Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample equilibrium states, but these methods become computationally expensive for complex systems, where the transition from one equilibrium state to another may only occur through rare events. No√© et al. used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting. Science, this issue p. eaaw1147; see also p. 982 By combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, neural networks sample the equilibrium distribution of many-body systems. Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in ‚Äúone shot,‚Äù vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.}}

abstract = {Monte Carlo methods, tools for sampling data from probability distributions, are widely used in the physical sciences, applied mathematics, and Bayesian statistics. Nevertheless, there are many situations in which it is computationally prohibitive to use Monte Carlo due to slow ‚Äúmixing‚Äù between modes of a distribution unless hand-tuned algorithms are used to accelerate the scheme. Machine learning techniques based on generative models offer a compelling alternative to the challenge of designing efficient schemes for a specific system. Here, we formalize Monte Carlo augmented with normalizing flows and show that, with limited prior data and a physically inspired algorithm, we can substantially accelerate sampling with generative models. Many problems in the physical sciences, machine learning, and statistical inference necessitate sampling from a high-dimensional, multimodal probability distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, the ubiquitous tool for this task, typically rely on random local updates to propagate configurations of a given system in a way that ensures that generated configurations will be distributed according to a target probability distribution asymptotically. In high-dimensional settings with multiple relevant metastable basins, local approaches require either immense computational effort or intricately designed importance sampling strategies to capture information about, for example, the relative populations of such basins. Here, we analyze an adaptive MCMC, which augments MCMC sampling with nonlocal transition kernels parameterized with generative models known as normalizing flows. We focus on a setting where there are no preexisting data, as is commonly the case for problems in which MCMC is used. Our method uses 1) an MCMC strategy that blends local moves obtained from any standard transition kernel with those from a generative model to accelerate the sampling and 2) the data generated this way to adapt the generative model and improve its efficacy in the MCMC algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of this algorithm and investigate numerically its efficiency, in particular in terms of its propensity to equilibrate fast between metastable modes whose rough location is known a priori but respective probability weight is not. We show that our algorithm can sample effectively across large free energy barriers, providing dramatic accelerations relative to traditional MCMC algorithms.}}

The normalizing flows are directly trained to transport between annealing temperatures using a KL divergence for each transition. This optimization objective is itself estimated using the normalizing flow/SMC approximation. We show conceptually and using multiple empirical examples that CRAFT improves on Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo (Arbel et al., 2021), on which it builds and also on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Stochastic Normalizing Flows (Wu et al., 2020). By incorporating CRAFT within particle MCMC, we show that such learnt samplers can achieve impressively accurate results on a challenging lattice field theory example.}

Subsequently they can be used as variational approximators to assess extensive properties of statistical systems, like free energy, and also as neural samplers used in Monte Carlo simulations. The practical application of this approach is unfortunately limited by its unfavourable scaling both of the numerical cost required for training, and the memory requirements with the system size. This is due to the fact that the original proposition involved a neural network of width which scaled with the total number of degrees of freedom, e.g. L2 in case of a two dimensional L√óL lattice. In this work we propose a hierarchical association of physical degrees of freedom, for instance spins, to neurons which replaces it with the scaling with the linear extent L of the system. We demonstrate our approach on the two-dimensional Ising model by simulating lattices of various sizes up to 128√ó128 spins, with time benchmarks reaching lattices of size 512√ó512. We observe that our proposal improves the quality of neural network training, i.e. the approximated probability distribution is closer to the target that could be previously achieved. As a consequence, the variational free energy reaches a value closer to its theoretical expectation and, if applied in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the resulting autocorrelation time is smaller. Finally, the replacement of a single neural network by a hierarchy of smaller networks considerably reduces the memory requirements.}

abstract = {While it is tempting to use high-temperature simulations to infer observations about low temperature, it is not always clear how to do so. Here we demonstrate how using generative artificial intelligence we can mix information from simulations conducted at a set of temperatures and generate molecular configurations at any temperature of interest including temperatures at which simulations were never performed. The configurations we generate carry correct Boltzmann weights, and our model minimizes the generation of spurious unphysical configurations. We demonstrate its use here through combining with replica exchange molecular dynamics in a postprocessing framework for sampling peptide and ribonucleic acid. We believe the framework is extensible to generic simulations and experiments for mixing control parameters other than temperature. Using simulations or experiments performed at some set of temperatures to learn about the physics or chemistry at some other arbitrary temperature is a problem of immense practical and theoretical relevance. Here we develop a framework based on statistical mechanics and generative artificial intelligence that allows solving this problem. Specifically, we work with denoising diffusion probabilistic models and show how these models in combination with replica exchange molecular dynamics achieve superior sampling of the biomolecular energy landscape at temperatures that were never simulated without assuming any particular slow degrees of freedom. The key idea is to treat the temperature as a fluctuating random variable and not a control parameter as is usually done. This allows us to directly sample from the joint probability distribution in configuration and temperature space. The results here are demonstrated for a chirally symmetric peptide and single-strand RNA undergoing conformational transitions in all-atom water. We demonstrate how we can discover transition states and metastable states that were previously unseen at the temperature of interest and even bypass the need to perform further simulations for a wide range of temperatures. At the same time, any unphysical states are easily identifiable through very low Boltzmann weights. The procedure while shown here for a class of molecular simulations should be more generally applicable to mixing information across simulations and experiments with varying control parameters.}}

	abstract = {Protein denoising diffusion probabilistic models are used for the de novo generation of protein backbones but are limited in their ability to guide generation of proteins with sequence-specific attributes and functional properties. To overcome this limitation, we developed ProteinGenerator (PG), a sequence space diffusion model based on RoseTTAFold that simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures. Beginning from a noised sequence representation, PG generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by desired sequence and structural protein attributes. We designed thermostable proteins with varying amino acid compositions and internal sequence repeats and cage bioactive peptides, such as melittin. By averaging sequence logits between diffusion trajectories with distinct structural constraints, we designed multistate parent--child protein triples in which the same sequence folds to different supersecondary structures when intact in the parent versus split into two child domains. PG design trajectories can be guided by experimental sequence--activity data, providing a general approach for integrated computational and experimental optimization of protein function.},

  abstract = 	 {We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.}
