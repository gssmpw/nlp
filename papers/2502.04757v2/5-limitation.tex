\section{Limitations}
The ELITE evaluator aims to provide an accurate safety evaluation. However, as a rubric-based approach, its evaluation performance may vary depending on the capabilities of the VLM, which we acknowledge as a potential limitation. 

Moreover, although the ELITE benchmark is constructed to cover a broad taxonomy and include diverse image-text pairs, certain cases that elicit harmful responses may still not be contained. For example, multi-turn jailbreak methods remain unincorporated.
