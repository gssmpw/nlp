The planning part of the algorithm is based on the idea of back chaining. Starting from a goal condition we iteratively select actions to achieve that goal, and if those actions have unmet preconditions, they are extended with actions to achieve them in the same way. The fact that BTs are inherently modular and reactive makes the proposed solution blend acting and planning in a way that enables the robot to effectively react to external disturbances. If an external agent undoes an action the robot reexecutes it without re-planning, and if an external agent helps the robot, it skips the corresponding actions, again without replanning. We illustrate our approach in two different robotics scenarios.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the dynamics of articulated rigid bodies can be solved in O (n) time using a recursive method, where n is the number of joints. However, when elasticity is added between the bodies (e.g., damped springs), with linearly implicit integration, the sti{\dbend}ness matrix in the equations of motion breaks the tree topology of the system, making the recursive O (n) method inapplicable. In such cases, the only alternative has been to form and solve the system matrix, which takes O (n3) time. We propose a new approach that is capable of solving the linearly implicit equations of motion in near linear time. Our method, which we call R{\dbend}{\dbend}M{\dbend}{\dbend}, is built using a combined reduced/maximal coordinate formulation. This hybrid model enables direct {\dbend}exibility to apply arbitrary combinations of constraints and contact modeling in both reduced and maximal coordinates, as well as mixtures of implicit and explicit forces in either coordinate representation. We highlight R{\dbend}{\dbend}M{\dbend}{\dbend}'s {\dbend}exibility with seamless integration of deformable objects with two-way coupling, at a standard additional cost. We further highlight its {\dbend}exibility by constructing an e{\dbend}cient internal (joint) and external (environment) frictional contact solver that can leverage bilateral joint constraints for rapid evaluation of frictional articulated dynamics.

Our method involves representing the search space of behavior trees as a formal grammar and searching over this grammar by means of a new generalization of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), named MCDAGS. Additionally, our method employs simulated annealing to expedite the aggregation of the most functional subtrees. We present simulated experiments for a marine target search and response scenario, and an abstract task selection problem. Our results demonstrate that the learned behavior trees compare favorably with a manually-designed tree, and outperform baseline learning methods. Overall, these results show that our method is a viable technique for the automatic design of behavior trees for robotic task planning.},

  abstract = {Robotics applications have hard time constraints and heavy computational burdens that can greatly benefit from domain-specific hardware accelerators. For the latency-critical problem of robot motion planning and control, there exists a performance gap of at least an order of magnitude between joint actuator response rates and state-of-the-art software solutions. Hardware acceleration can close this gap, but it is essential to define automated hardware design flows to keep the design process agile as applications and robot platforms evolve. To address this challenge, we introduce robomorphic computing: a methodology to transform robot morphology into a customized hardware accelerator morphology. We (i) present this design methodology, using robot topology and structure to exploit parallelism and matrix sparsity patterns in accelerator hardware; (ii) use the methodology to generate a parameterized accelerator design for the gradient of rigid body dynamics, a key kernel in motion planning; (iii) evaluate FPGA and synthesized ASIC implementations of this accelerator for an industrial manipulator robot; and (iv) describe how the design can be automatically customized for other robot models. Our FPGA accelerator achieves speedups of 8{\texttimes} and 86{\texttimes} over CPU and GPU when executing a single dynamics gradient computation. It maintains speedups of 1.9{\texttimes} to 2.9{\texttimes} over CPU and GPU, including computation and I/O round-trip latency, when deployed as a coprocessor to a host CPU for processing multiple dynamics gradient computations. ASIC synthesis indicates an additional 7.2{\texttimes} speedup for single computation latency. We describe how this principled approach generalizes to more complex robot platforms, such as quadrupeds and humanoids, as well as to other computational kernels in robotics, outlining a path forward for future robomorphic computing accelerators.},

We consider various cost functions which model the cost needed to equip a robot with some capabilities, and show that the general form of this problem is NP-hard, confirming what many perhaps have suspected about this sort of design-time optimization. As a result, several questions of interest having both optimality and efficiency of solution is unlikely. However, we also show that, for some specific types of cost functions, the problem is either polynomial time solvable or fixed-parameter tractable.},

Even a seemingly simple task such as sitting on a chair is notoriously hard to model with supervised learning. This difficulty is because such a task involves complex planning with periodic and non-periodic motions reacting to the scene geometry to precisely position and orient the character. Our proposed deep auto-regressive framework enables modeling of multi-modal scene interaction behaviors purely from data. Given high-level instructions such as the goal location and the action to be launched there, our system computes a series of movements and transitions to reach the goal in the desired state. To allow characters to adapt to a wide range of geometry such as different shapes of furniture and obstacles, we incorporate an efficient data augmentation scheme to randomly switch the 3D geometry while maintaining the context of the original motion. To increase the precision to reach the goal during runtime, we introduce a control scheme that combines egocentric inference and goal-centric inference. We demonstrate the versatility of our model with various scene interaction tasks such as sitting on a chair, avoiding obstacles, opening and entering through a door, and picking and carrying objects generated in real-time just from a single model.},

Motion capture remains the most popular source of motion data, but collecting mocap data typically requires heavily instrumented environments and actors. In this paper, we propose a method that enables physically simulated characters to learn skills from videos (SFV). Our approach, based on deep pose estimation and deep reinforcement learning, allows data-driven animation to leverage the abundance of publicly available video clips from the web, such as those from YouTube. This has the potential to enable fast and easy design of character controllers simply by querying for video recordings of the desired behavior. The resulting controllers are robust to perturbations, can be adapted to new settings, can perform basic object interactions, and can be retargeted to new morphologies via reinforcement learning. We further demonstrate that our method can predict potential human motions from still images, by forward simulation of learned controllers initialized from the observed pose. Our framework is able to learn a broad range of dynamic skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts. (Video               1               )},

Planning or control algorithms can then use this action space to generate desired motions. In particular, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn controllers that achieve goal-directed movements.

  abstract = {Automatic neural architecture design has shown its potential in discovering powerful neural network architectures. Existing methods, no matter based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture search in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture optimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach: (1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous space. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as input and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation of a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the encoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better accuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder. Experiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources. Specifically we obtain 2.11\% test set error rate for CIFAR-10 image classification task and 56.0 test set perplexity of PTB language modeling task. The best discovered architectures on both tasks are successfully transferred to other tasks such as CIFAR-100 and WikiText-2. Furthermore, combined with the recent proposed weight sharing mechanism, we discover powerful architecture on CIFAR-10 (with error rate 3.53\%) and on PTB (with test set perplexity 56.6), with very limited computational resources (less than 10 GPU hours) for both tasks.},

Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We finally present the open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods, available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented algorithms within a unified interface to foster and facilitate research on the topic.},

Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires heavy manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we present a graph neural architecture search method (GraphNAS) that enables automatic design of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and trains the recurrent network with policy gradient to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Furthermore, to improve the search efficiency of GraphNAS on big networks, GraphNAS restricts the search space from an entire architecture space to a sequential concatenation of the best search results built on each single architecture layer. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of validation set accuracy. Moreover, in a transfer learning task we observe that graph neural architectures designed by GraphNAS, when transferred to new datasets, still gain improvement in terms of prediction accuracy.},

By performing sim2real transfer on a selection, for the first time we measured the shape of the reality gap for variations in design complexity. We found for the flapping wing that the reality gap changes non-monotonically with complexity, suggesting that certain morphology details narrow the gap more than others, and that such details could be identified and further optimised in a future end-to-end automated morphology design process.},

  abstract = {Value Iteration Networks (VINs) are effective differentiable path planning modules that can be used by agents to perform navigation while still maintaining end-to-end differentiability of the entire architecture. Despite their effectiveness, they suffer from several disadvantages including training instability, random seed sensitivity, and other optimization problems. In this work, we reframe VINs as recurrent-convolutional networks which demonstrates that VINs couple recurrent convolutions with an unconventional max-pooling activation. From this perspective, we argue that standard gated recurrent update equations could potentially alleviate the optimization issues plaguing VIN. The resulting architecture, which we call the Gated Path Planning Network, is shown to empirically outperform VIN on a variety of metrics such as learning speed, hyperparameter sensitivity, iteration count, and even generalization. Furthermore, we show that this performance gap is consistent across different maze transition types, maze sizes and even show success on a challenging 3D environment, where the planner is only provided with first-person RGB images.},

  abstract = {Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions. We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression problems.

On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model.

This chapter describes the process of applying Grammatical Evolution (GE) to evolve Behaviour Trees for a real-time video-game: the Mario AI Benchmark. The results obtained show that these structures are quite amenable to artificial evolution using GE, and can provide a good balance between long-term (pathfinding) and short-term (reactiveness to hazards and power-ups) planning within the same structure.},

Next, we use this regression model to predict the validation accuracies of a large number of random architectures. Finally, we train the top-K predicted architectures and deploy the model with the best validation result. While this approach seems simple, it is more than 20{\texttimes} as sample efficient as Regularized Evolution on the NASBench-101 benchmark. On ImageNet, it approaches the efficiency of more complex and restrictive approaches based on weight sharing such as ProxylessNAS while being fully (embarrassingly) parallelizable and friendly to hyper-parameter tuning.},

(2) How to evaluate the correlation between different architectures? (3) How to learn these correlations with a small number of samples? To this end, we first model these correlations from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, by introducing a novel Gaussian Process based NAS (GP-NAS) method, the correlations are modeled by the kernel function and mean function. The kernel function is also learnable to enable adaptive modeling for complex correlations in different search spaces. Furthermore, by incorporating a mutual information based sampling method, we can theoretically ensure the high-performance architecture with only a small set of samples. After addressing these problems, training GP-NAS once enables direct performance prediction of any architecture in different scenarios and may obtain efficient networks for different deployment platforms. Extensive experiments on both image classification and face recognition tasks verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.},

However, the current standard of using one-hot vectors as discrete communication tokens prevents agents from acquiring more desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding. Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide range of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel human communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent communication, outperforming the use of one-hot communication.},

  abstract = {Designing robots by hand can be costly and time consuming, especially if the robots have to be created with novel materials, or be robust to internal or external changes. In order to create robots automatically, without the need for human intervention, it is necessary to optimise both the behaviour and the body design of the robot. However, when co-optimising the morphology and controller of a locomoting agent the morphology tends to converge prematurely, reaching a local optimum. Approaches such as explicit protection of morphological innovation have been used to reduce this problem, but it might also be possible to increase exploration of morphologies using a more indirect approach. We explore how changing the environment, where the agent locomotes, affects the convergence of morphologies. The agents' morphologies and controllers are co-optimised, while the environments the agents locomote in are evolved open-endedly with the Paired OpenEnded Trailblazer (POET). We compare the diversity, fitness and robustness of agents evolving in environments generated by POET to agents evolved in handcrafted curricula of environments. Our agents each contain of a population of individuals being evolved with a genetic algorithm. This population is called the agent-population. We show that agent-populations evolving in open-endedly evolving environments exhibit larger morphological diversity than agent-populations evolving in hand crafted curricula of environments. POET proved capable of creating a curriculum of environments which encouraged both diversity and quality in the populations. This suggests that POET may be capable of reducing premature convergence in co-optimisation of morphology and controllers.},

However, no prior dataset or benchmark has systematically evaluated physically grounded perception of complex social interactions that go beyond short actions, such as high-fiving, or simple group activities, such as gathering. In this work, we create a dataset of physically-grounded abstract social events, PHASE, that resemble a wide range of real-life social interactions by including social concepts such as helping another agent. PHASE consists of 2D animations of pairs of agents moving in a continuous space generated procedurally using a physics engine and a hierarchical planner. Agents have a limited field of view, and can interact with multiple objects, in an environment that has multiple landmarks and obstacles. Using PHASE, we design a social recognition task and a social prediction task. PHASE is validated with human experiments demonstrating that humans perceive rich interactions in the social events, and that the simulated agents behave similarly to humans. As a baseline model, we introduce a Bayesian inverse planning approach, SIMPLE (SIMulation, Planning and Local Estimation), which outperforms state-of-the-art feedforward neural networks. We hope that PHASE can serve as a difficult new challenge for developing new models that can recognize complex social interactions.},

  abstract = {In skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model the human body skeletons as spatiotemporal graphs, have achieved remarkable performance. However, in existing GCN-based methods, the topology of the graph is set manually, and it is fixed over all layers and input samples. This may not be optimal for the hierarchical GCN and diverse samples in action recognition tasks. In addition, the second-order information (the lengths and directions of bones) of the skeleton data, which is naturally more informative and discriminative for action recognition, is rarely investigated in existing methods. In this work, we propose a novel two-stream adaptive graph convolutional network (2s-AGCN) for skeletonbased action recognition. The topology of the graph in our model can be either uniformly or individually learned by the BP algorithm in an end-to-end manner. This data-driven method increases the flexibility of the model for graph construction and brings more generality to adapt to various data samples. Moreover, a two-stream framework is proposed to model both the first-order and the second-order information simultaneously, which shows notable improvement for the recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the two large-scale datasets, NTU-RGBD and KineticsSkeleton, demonstrate that the performance of our model exceeds the state-of-the-art with a significant margin.},

  abstract = {The task of generating code from a natural language description, or NL2Code, is considered a pressing and significant challenge in code intelligence. Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are ``Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning''. In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.},

We propose `multi-level evolution', a bottom-up automatic process that designs robots across multiple levels and niches them to tasks and environmental conditions. Multi-level evolution concurrently explores constituent molecular and material building blocks, as well as their possible assemblies into specialized morphological and sensorimotor configurations. Multi-level evolution provides a route to fully harness a recent explosion in available candidate materials and ongoing advances in rapid manufacturing processes. We outline a feasible architecture that realizes this vision, highlight the main roadblocks and how they may be overcome, and show robotic applications to which multi-level evolution is particularly suited. By forming a research agenda to stimulate discussion between researchers in related fields, we hope to inspire the pursuit of multi-level robotic design all the way from material to machine.},

  abstract = {Graph pattern matching is finding all matches in a data graph for a given pattern graph and is often defined in terms of subgraph isomorphism, an NP-complete problem. To lower its complexity, various extensions of graph simulation have been considered instead. These extensions allow graph pattern matching to be conducted in cubic time. However, they fall short of capturing the topology of data graphs, that is, graphs may have a structure drastically different from pattern graphs they match, and the matches found are often too large to understand and analyze. To rectify these problems, this article proposes a notion of strong simulation, a revision of graph simulation for graph pattern matching. (1) We identify a set of criteria for preserving the topology of graphs matched. We show that strong simulation preserves the topology of data graphs and finds a bounded number of matches. (2) We show that strong simulation retains the same complexity as earlier extensions of graph simulation by providing a cubic-time algorithm for computing strong simulation. (3) We present the locality property of strong simulation which allows us to develop an effective distributed algorithm to conduct graph pattern matching on distributed graphs. (4) We experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms using both real-life and synthetic data.},

  abstract = {Transformers have revolutionized vision and natural language processing with their ability to scale with large datasets. But in robotic manipulation, data is both limited and expensive. Can manipulation still benefit from Transformers with the right problem formulation? We investigate this question with PerAct, a language-conditioned behavior-cloning agent for multi-task 6-DoF manipulation. PerAct encodes language goals and RGB-D voxel observations with a Perceiver Transformer, and outputs discretized actions by ``detecting the next best voxel action''. Unlike frameworks that operate on 2D images, the voxelized 3D observation and action space provides a strong structural prior for efficiently learning 6-DoF actions. With this formulation, we train a single multi-task Transformer for 18 RLBench tasks (with 249 variations) and 7 real-world tasks (with 18 variations) from just a few demonstrations per task. Our results show that PerAct significantly outperforms unstructured image-to-action agents and 3D ConvNet baselines for a wide range of tabletop tasks.},

  abstract = {Robots are traditionally bounded by a fixed embodiment during their operational lifetime, which limits their ability to adapt to their surroundings. Co-optimizing control and morphology of a robot, however, is often inefficient due to the complex interplay between the controller and morphology. In this paper, we propose a learning-based control method that can inherently take morphology into consideration such that once the control policy is trained in the simulator, it can be easily deployed to robots with different embodiments in the real world. In particular, we present the Embodiment-aware Transformer (EAT), an architecture that casts this control problem as conditional sequence modeling. EAT outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired robot embodiment, past states, and actions, our EAT model can generate future actions that best fit the current robot embodiment. Experimental results show that EAT can outperform all other alternatives in embodiment-varying tasks, and succeed in an example of real-world evolution tasks: stepping down a stair through updating the morphology alone. We hope that EAT will inspire a new push toward real-world evolution across many domains, where algorithms like EAT can blaze a trail by bridging the field of evolutionary robotics and big data sequence modeling.},

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have been successful in both industry and academia, especially for computer vision tasks. The great success of deep learning is mainly due to its scalability to encode large-scale data and to maneuver billions of model parameters. However, it is a challenge to deploy these cumbersome deep models on devices with limited resources, e.g., mobile phones and embedded devices, not only because of the high computational complexity but also the large storage requirements. To this end, a variety of model compression and acceleration techniques have been developed. As a representative type of model compression and acceleration, knowledge distillation effectively learns a small student model from a large teacher model. It has received rapid increasing attention from the community. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation from the perspectives of knowledge categories, training schemes, teacher鈥搒tudent architecture, distillation algorithms, performance comparison and applications. Furthermore, challenges in knowledge distillation are briefly reviewed and comments on future research are discussed and forwarded.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, most existing work mainly considers one single teacher network. In practice, a student may access multiple teachers, and multiple teacher networks together provide comprehensive guidance that is beneficial for training the student network. In this paper, we present a method to train a thin deep network by incorporating multiple teacher networks not only in output layer by averaging the softened outputs (dark knowledge) from different networks, but also in the intermediate layers by imposing a constraint about the dissimilarity among examples. We suggest that the relative dissimilarity between intermediate representations of different examples serves as a more flexible and appropriate guidance from teacher networks. Then triplets are utilized to encourage the consistence of these relative dissimilarity relationships between the student network and teacher networks. Moreover, we leverage a voting strategy to unify multiple relative dissimilarity information provided by multiple teacher networks, which realizes their incorporation in the intermediate layers. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our method is capable of generating a well-performed student network, with the classification accuracy comparable or even superior to all teacher networks, yet having much fewer parameters and being much faster in running.},

However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1--3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players.

This new direction has given rise to the evolution of a new technological domain named deep reinforcement learning, which combines the representational learning power of deep learning with existing reinforcement learning methods. Undoubtedly, the inception of deep reinforcement learning has played a vital role in optimizing the performance of reinforcement learning-based intelligent agents with model-free based approaches. Although these methods could improve the performance of agents to a greater extent, they were mainly limited to systems that adopted reinforcement learning algorithms focused on learning a single task. At the same moment, the aforementioned approach was found to be relatively data-inefficient, particularly when reinforcement learning agents needed to interact with more complex and rich data environments. This is primarily due to the limited applicability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to many scenarios across related tasks from the same environment. The objective of this paper is to survey the research challenges associated with multi-tasking within the deep reinforcement arena and present the state-of-the-art approaches by comparing and contrasting recent solutions, namely DISTRAL (DIStill \& TRAnsfer Learning), IMPALA(Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) and PopArt that aim to address core challenges such as scalability, distraction dilemma, partial observability, catastrophic forgetting and negative knowledge transfer.},

Recent work aims to eliminate the re-training of policies by investigating whether a morphology-agnostic policy, trained on a diverse set of agents with similar task objectives, can be transferred to new agents with unseen morphologies without re-training. This is a challenging problem that required previous approaches to use hand-designed descriptions of the new agent's morphology. Instead of hand-designing this description, we propose a data-driven method that learns a representation of morphology directly from the reinforcement learning objective. Ours is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that can train a policy to generalize to new agent morphologies without requiring a description of the agent's morphology in advance. We evaluate our approach on the standard benchmark for agent-agnostic control, and improve over the current state of the art in zero-shot generalization to new agents. Importantly, our method attains good performance without an explicit description of morphology.},

The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)---a blind assessment of the state of the field---AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. The MuZero algorithm learns an iterable model that produces predictions relevant to planning: the action-selection policy, the value function and the reward. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games3---the canonical video game environment for testing artificial intelligence techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled4---the MuZero algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi---canonical environments for high-performance planning---the MuZero algorithm matched, without any knowledge of the game dynamics, the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm5 that was supplied with the rules of the game.},

Systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs themselves could make programming more productive and accessible. Recent transformer-based neural network models show impressive code generation abilities yet still perform poorly on more complex tasks requiring problem-solving skills, such as competitive programming problems. Here, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that achieved an average ranking in the top 54.3\% in simulated evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform. AlphaCode solves problems by generating millions of diverse programs using specially trained transformer-based networks and then filtering and clustering those programs to a maximum of just 10 submissions. This result marks the first time an artificial intelligence system has performed competitively in programming competitions. Computer programming competitions are popular tests among programmers that require critical thinking informed by experience and creating solutions to unforeseen problems, both of which are key aspects of human intelligence but challenging to mimic by machine learning models. Using self-supervised learning and an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, Li et al. developed AlphaCode, a deep-learning model that can achieve approximately human-level performance on the Codeforces platform, which regularly hosts these competitions and attracts numerous participants worldwide (see the Perspective by Kolter). The development of such coding platforms could have a huge impact on programmers' productivity. It may even change the culture of programming by shifting human work to formulating problems, with machine learning being the main one responsible for generating and executing codes. ---YS Modern machine learning systems can achieve average human-level performance in popular competitive programming contests.},

Unfortunately, there has not yet been a comprehensive summary  of the EC-based NAS algorithms. This article reviews over 200 articles of most  recent EC-based NAS methods in light of the core components, to systematically  discuss their design principles and justifications on the design.

Despite their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks, GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best humaninvented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.},

As a wellknown one-shot solution, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) performs continuous relaxation on the architecture's importance and results in a bi-level optimization problem. As many recent studies have shown, DARTS cannot always work robustly for new tasks, which is mainly due to the approximate solution of the bi-level optimization. In this paper, one-shot neural architecture search is addressed by adopting a directed probabilistic graphical model to represent the joint probability distribution over data and model. Then, neural architectures are searched for and optimized by Gibbs sampling. We rethink the bi-level optimization problem as the task of Gibbs sampling from the posterior distribution, which expresses the preferences for different models given the observed dataset. We evaluate our proposed NAS method -- GibbsNAS on the search space used in DARTS/ENAS as well as the search space of NAS-Bench-201. Experimental results on multiple search space show the efficacy and stability of our approach.},

However, the high computational cost of NAS limits its use in commercial applications. Two recent NAS paradigms, namely one-shot and sparse propagation, which reduce the time and space complexities, respectively, provide clues for solving this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel search strategy for one-shot and sparse propagation NAS, namely AdvantageNAS, which further reduces the time complexity of NAS by reducing the number of search iterations. AdvantageNAS is a gradientbased approach that improves the search efficiency by introducing credit assignment in gradient estimation for architecture updates. Experiments on the NAS-Bench-201 and PTB dataset show that AdvantageNAS discovers an architecture with higher performance under a limited time budget compared to existing sparse propagation NAS. To further reveal the reliabilities of AdvantageNAS, we investigate it theoretically and find that it monotonically improves the expected loss and thus converges.},

There are, however, certain aspects of grammar design that greatly affect the speed of convergence and quality of solutions generated with GE. In this chapter, general guidelines for grammar design are presented. These are domain-independent, and can be used when applying GE to any problem.

  abstract = {Deep learning has made substantial breakthroughs in many fields due to its powerful automatic representation capabilities. It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers' prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of humans' inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture.                                Neural Architecture Search                              (               NAS               ) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. In addition, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.},

The deep neural network (DNN) is a modern, powerful model to tackle this task, whose representation ability mainly comes from hidden layers. The interpretability of DNN, however, drops rapidly as the inexplicable hidden part becomes deeper and deeper. To make neural networks more explainable, we propose a novel neural network named concept evolution network (CEN), learning explicit concepts of images to help classify. Concepts evolve during training with three stages: emergence, elevation, and elimination. We design three algorithms (one primary and two improved) to train CEN. The experiment results on MNIST show our methods' feasibility and that CEN has both interpretability and adaptive learning capacity for the image classification task. In the last section, we discuss the development prospects of CEN in the future.},

We propose a multi-expert learning architecture (MELA) that learns to generate adaptive skills from a group of representative expert skills. During training, MELA is first initialized by a distinct set of pretrained experts, each in a separate deep neural network (DNN). Then, by learning the combination of these DNNs using a gating neural network (GNN), MELA can acquire more specialized experts and transitional skills across various locomotion modes. During runtime, MELA constantly blends multiple DNNs and dynamically synthesizes a new DNN to produce adaptive behaviors in response to changing situations. This approach leverages the advantages of trained expert skills and the fast online synthesis of adaptive policies to generate responsive motor skills during the changing tasks. Using one unified MELA framework, we demonstrated successful multiskill locomotion on a real quadruped robot that performed coherent trotting, steering, and fall recovery autonomously and showed the merit of multi-expert learning generating behaviors that can adapt to unseen scenarios.},

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems---from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\,{\texttimes}\,4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor's algorithm improves on Strassen's two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor's ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.},

A pivotal feature of the evolutionary approach is that it considers the whole robot at once, and enables the exploitation of robot features in a holistic manner. Evolutionary robotics can also be seen as an innovative approach to the study of evolution based on a new kind of experimentalism. The use of robots as a substrate can help to address questions that are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate through computer simulations or biological studies. In this paper, we consider the main achievements of evolutionary robotics, focusing particularly on its contributions to both engineering and biology.

It is possible to co-evolve robot control and morphology in simulation, and this work suggests that there exists important correlations between different body parameters (e.g. wheel base diameter, body size, and sensory range) in order to achieve optimal performance on specific tasks. The evolved morphology can be constructed with LEGO, and the evolved controller can be downloaded to the LEGO MINDSTORMS RCX. Hence, the experiments suggest a path towards automatic building plans for LEGO MINDSTORMS robots. Further, it is possible to manipulate the morphology in a user-guided approach of building modular LEGO robots, which allow children to construct their own robots within 10 minutes. Finally, the experiments give suggestion to new research on building blocks with processing power.},

Despite the recent success of DRL, the learned controller is viable for a single character. Changes in body size and proportions require learning controllers from scratch. In this paper, we present a new method of learning parametric controllers for body shape variation. A single parametric controller enables us to simulate and control various characters having different heights, weights, and body proportions. The users are allowed to create new characters through body shape parameters, and they can control the characters immediately. Our characters can also change their body shapes on the fly during simulation. The key to the success of our approach includes the adaptive sampling of body shapes that tackles the challenges in learning parametric controllers, which relies on the marginal value function that measures control capabilities of body shapes. We demonstrate parametric controllers for various physically simulated characters such as bipeds, quadrupeds, and underwater animals.},

  abstract = {Most existing deep multi-task learning models are based on parameter sharing, such as hard sharing, hierarchical sharing, and soft sharing. How choosing a suitable sharing mechanism depends on the relations among the tasks, which is not easy since it is difficult to understand the underlying shared factors among these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter sharing mechanism, named Sparse Sharing. Given multiple tasks, our approach automatically finds a sparse sharing structure. We start with an over-parameterized base network, from which each task extracts a subnetwork. The subnetworks of multiple tasks are partially overlapped and trained in parallel. We show that both hard sharing and hierarchical sharing can be formulated as particular instances of the sparse sharing framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three sequence labeling tasks. Compared with single-task models and three typical multi-task learning baselines, our proposed approach achieves consistent improvement while requiring fewer parameters.},

  abstract = {Robots and intelligent systems that sense or interact with the world are increasingly being used to automate a wide array of tasks. The ability of these systems to complete these tasks depends on a large range of technologies such as the mechanical and electrical parts that make up the physical body of the robot and its sensors, perception algorithms to perceive the environment, and planning and control algorithms to produce meaningful actions. Therefore, it is often necessary to consider the interactions between these components when designing an embodied system. This thesis explores work on the task-driven co-optimization of robotics systems in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously optimizing the physical components of the system with inference or control algorithms directly for task performance. We start by considering the problem of optimizing a beacon-based localization system directly for localization accuracy. Designing such a system involves placing beacons throughout the environment and inferring location from sensor readings. In our work, we develop a deep learning approach to optimize both beacon placement and location inference directly for localization accuracy. We then turn our attention to the related problem of task-driven optimization of robots and their controllers. In our work, we start by proposing a data-efficient algorithm based on multi-task reinforcement learning. Our approach efficiently optimizes both physical design and control parameters directly for task performance by leveraging a design-conditioned controller capable of generalizing over the space of physical designs. We then follow this up with an extension to allow for the optimization over discrete morphological parameters such as the number and configuration of limbs. Finally, we conclude by exploring the fabrication and deployment of optimized soft robots.},

Current artificial intelligence systems pale in their understanding of intuitive physics, in comparison to even very young children. Here we address this gap between humans and machines by drawing on the field of developmental psychology. First, we introduce and open-source a machine-learning dataset designed to evaluate conceptual understanding of intuitive physics, adopting the violation-of-expectation (VoE) paradigm from developmental psychology. Second, we build a deep-learning system that learns intuitive physics directly from visual data, inspired by studies of visual cognition in children. We demonstrate that our model can learn a diverse set of physical concepts, which depends critically on object-level representations, consistent with findings from developmental psychology. We consider the implications of these results both for AI and for research on human cognition.},

However, identifying an optimal physical design and its corresponding control policy is inherently challenging. The freedom to choose the number of links, their type, and how they are connected results in a combinatorial design space, and the evaluation of any design in that space requires deriving its optimal controller. In this work, we present N-LIMB, an efficient approach to optimizing the design and control of a robot over large sets of morphologies. Central to our framework is a universal, design-conditioned control policy capable of controlling a diverse sets of designs. This policy greatly improves the sample efficiency of our approach by allowing the transfer of experience across designs and reducing the cost to evaluate new designs. We train this policy to maximize expected return over a distribution of designs, which is simultaneously updated towards higher performing designs under the universal policy. In this way, our approach converges towards a design distribution peaked around high-performing designs and a controller that is effectively fine-tuned for those designs. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on a series of locomotion tasks across varying terrains and show the discovery novel and high-performing design-control pairs.},

  abstract = {Learning locomotion skills is a challenging problem. To generate realistic and smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state machines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the automatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL is to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a simple reward function [Duan et al. 2016]. Although several different DRL algorithms can successfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look nothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to the locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state machines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to the DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that are symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we introduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that encourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning method that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with left/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes appropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance, so that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because our method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a variety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for the lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our results show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy gaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance from motion examples or contact planning.},

We introduce a set of cooperative control tasks that includes tasks with discrete and continuous actions, as well as tasks that involve hundreds of agents. The three approaches are evaluated against each other using different neural architectures, training procedures, and reward structures. Using deep reinforcement learning with a curriculum learning scheme, our approach can solve problems that were previously considered intractable by most multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. We show that policy gradient methods tend to outperform both temporal-difference and actor-critic methods when using feed-forward neural architectures. We also show that recurrent policies, while more difficult to train, outperform feed-forward policies on our evaluation tasks.},

The algorithm we propose is used to optimize design parameters, namely link lengths and the placement of actuators, while concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot's movements are modeled as spatio-temporal solutions to optimal control problems. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize robot designs based on specifications expressed as a function of range of motion or actuator forces. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing two simulated robots that employ linear actuators: a manipulator and a large quadruped. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of a small quadrupedal robot and testing its performance using a hardware implementation.},

In this paper, we present a hierarchical framework that improves sample-efficiency and generalizability of learned locomotion skills on real-world robots. Our approach divides the problem of goal-oriented locomotion into two sub-problems: learning diverse primitives skills, and using model-based planning to sequence these skills. We parametrize our primitives as cyclic movements, improving sample-efficiency of learning from scratch on a 18 degrees of freedom robot. Then, we learn coarse dynamics models over primitive cycles and use them in a model predictive control framework. This allows us to learn to walk to arbitrary goals up to 12m away, after about two hours of training from scratch on hardware. Our results on a Daisy hexapod hardware and simulation demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at reaching distant targets, in different environments, and with sensory noise.},

Neuromorphic engineering studies neural computational principles to develop technologies that can provide a computing substrate for building compact and low-power processing systems. We discuss why endowing robots with neuromorphic technologies -- from perception to motor control -- represents a promising approach for the creation of robots which can seamlessly integrate in society. We present initial attempts in this direction, highlight open challenges, and propose actions required to overcome current limitations.},

  abstract = {Both the design and control of a robot play equally important roles in its task performance. However, while optimal control is well studied in the machine learning and robotics community, less attention is placed on finding the optimal robot design. This is mainly because co-optimizing design and control in robotics is characterized as a challenging problem, and more importantly, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for co-optimization does not exist. In this paper, we propose Evolution Gym, the first large-scale benchmark for co-optimizing the design and control of soft robots. In our benchmark, each robot is composed of different types of voxels (e.g., soft, rigid, actuators), resulting in a modular and expressive robot design space. Our benchmark environments span a wide range of tasks, including locomotion on various types of terrains and manipulation. Furthermore, we develop several robot co-evolution algorithms by combining state-of-the-art design optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Evaluating the algorithms on our benchmark platform, we observe robots exhibiting increasingly complex behaviors as evolution progresses, with the best evolved designs solving many of our proposed tasks. Additionally, even though robot designs are evolved autonomously from scratch without prior knowledge, they often grow to resemble existing natural creatures while outperforming hand-designed robots. Nevertheless, all tested algorithms fail to find robots that succeed in our hardest environments. This suggests that more advanced algorithms are required to explore the high-dimensional design space and evolve increasingly intelligent robots -- an area of research in which we hope Evolution Gym will accelerate progress.

While planning approaches are good at generating feasible whole-body robot trajectories, they struggle with dynamic environments as well as the incorporation of constraints given by the task and the environment. On the other hand, dynamic motion models in the action space struggle with generating kinematically feasible trajectories for mobile manipulation actions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn feasible dynamic motions for a mobile base while the end-effector follows a trajectory in task space generated by an arbitrary system to fulfill the task at hand. This modular formulation has several benefits: it enables us to readily transform a broad range of end-effector motions into mobile applications, it allows us to use the kinematic feasibility of the end-effector trajectory as a dense reward signal and its modular formulation allows it to generalise to unseen end-effector motions at test time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on multiple mobile robot platforms with different kinematic abilities and different types of wheeled platforms in extensive simulated as well as real-world experiments.},

In this work, an approach to achieve a posture stabilizing capability based on stability training and reinforcement learning is explored and verified by simulations. An automatic abstraction method for state space is proposed by using the Gauss basis function and inner evaluation indexes to speed up the learning process. Hierarchical structure stabilizer using the Monte Carlo method is designed according to the concept of variable ZMP. Training samples are extracted from the state transition of the stability training process using balance controllers based on the robot dynamic model. The stabilizers are trained with and without applying the automatic abstraction of state space. Then simulation tests of them are conducted under conditions where the training platform exerts amplitude-limited random disturbances on the robot. Also, the influence of the model errors is studied by introducing deviations of the CoM position during the simulation tests. By comparing the simulation results of two learning stabilizers and the model-based balance controller, it is demonstrated that the designed stabilizer can achieve approximate success rate of the ideal model-based balance controller and exert all the driving ability of the robot under the large disturbance condition of {\textpm}30{$^\circ$} inclination of the platform. Also, the effects of the model error can be overcome by retraining using state transition data with the model error.},

This process is even more challenging for robots that do not have an accurate physical model, such as compliant or micro-scale robots. Data-driven gait optimization provides an automated alternative to analytical gait design. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to efficiently learn a wide range of locomotion tasks with walking robots. This approach formalizes locomotion as a contextual policy search task to collect data, and subsequently uses that data to learn multiobjective locomotion primitives that can be used for planning. As a proof-of-concept we consider a simulated hexapod modeled after a recently developed microrobot, and we thoroughly evaluate the performance of this microrobot on different tasks and gaits. Our results validate the proposed controller and learning scheme on single and multiobjective locomotion tasks. Moreover, the experimental simulations show that without any prior knowledge about the robot used (e.g., dynamics model), our approach is capable of learning locomotion primitives within 250 trials and subsequently using them to successfully navigate through a maze.},

Generating the walking motion from mocap data requires a controllable and responsive character in both animation and robotics.

In this paper, we propose a new data-driven bipedal control framework by adjusting the mocap data with physics-based model to achieve a robust and natural performance while keeps the style of the data as complete as possible. In our framework, the desired bipedal action is designed from the balance strategy and a cascaded position-velocity control with gravity compensation is proposed for joint tracking control of the desired action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through different external perturbation tests. This framework more fully integrates the original data into desired-action design while keeps a robust and stable performance in the simulation.},

Keeping this in mind, worldwide, many researchers are working on various aspects of biped robots, such as gait generation, dynamic balance margin, and the design of controllers. The main aim of this review article is to discuss the main challenges encountered in the biped gait generation and design of various controllers while moving on different terrain conditions such as flat, ascending and descending slopes or stairs, avoiding obstacles/ditches, uneven terrain, and an unknown environment. As per the authors' knowledge, no single study has been carried out in one place related to the gait generation and design of controllers for each joint of the biped robot on various terrains. This review will help researchers working in this field better understand the concepts of gait generation, dynamic balance margin, and the design of controllers while moving on various terrains. Moreover, the current article will also cover the different soft computing techniques used to tune the gains of the controllers. In this article, the authors have reviewed a vast compilation of research work on the gait generation of the biped robot on various terrains. Further, the authors have proposed taxonomies on various design issues identified while generating the gait in different aspects. The authors reviewed approximately 296 articles and discovered that all researchers attempted to generate the dynamically balanced biped gait on various terrains.},

Reinforcement learning methods are used in biped robots recently due to their powerful ability to deal with high-dimensional computing problem. However, it's hard to design good reward function to guide the robot to walk and behavior like human. This paper builds a biped robot model and presents a control framework of reinforcement learning based on Isaac Gym simulation platform. The designed reward function considers the velocity tracking, the symmetry of hip angle and leg lifting to simulate human motion. The training process only lasts for 2 hours from the very beginning. The results show that after training the biped robot has a good performance of velocity tracking and attitude control and shows good symmetries in joint angles especially in hip. The results also prove the designed reward function is effective and hopeful to be available on other applications.},

We develop a simple control strategy that can be used to generate a large variety of gaits and styles in real-time, including walking in all directions (forwards, backwards, sideways, turning), running, skipping, and hopping. Controllers can be authored using a small number of parameters, or their construction can be informed by motion capture data. The controllers are applied to 2D and 3D physically-simulated character models. Their robustness is demonstrated with respect to pushes in all directions, unexpected steps and slopes, and unexpected variations in kinematic and dynamic parameters. Direct transitions between controllers are demonstrated as well as parameterized control of changes in direction and speed. Feedback-error learning is applied to learn predictive torque models, which allows for the low-gain control that typifies many natural motions as well as producing smoother simulated motion.},

These skills not only enable humans to perform complex tasks, but also provide powerful priors for guiding their behaviors when learning new tasks. This is in stark contrast to what is common practice in physics-based character animation, where control policies are most typically trained from scratch for each task. In this work, we present a large-scale data-driven framework for learning versatile and reusable skill embeddings for physically simulated characters. Our approach combines techniques from adversarial imitation learning and unsupervised reinforcement learning to develop skill embeddings that produce life-like behaviors, while also providing an easy to control representation for use on new downstream tasks. Our models can be trained using large datasets of unstructured motion clips, without requiring any task-specific annotation or segmentation of the motion data. By leveraging a massively parallel GPU-based simulator, we are able to train skill embeddings using over a decade of simulated experiences, enabling our model to learn a rich and versatile repertoire of skills. We show that a single pre-trained model can be effectively applied to perform a diverse set of new tasks. Our system also allows users to specify tasks through simple reward functions, and the skill embedding then enables the character to automatically synthesize complex and naturalistic strategies in order to achieve the task objectives.},

  abstract = {We propose a robust dynamic walking controller consisting of a dynamic locomotion planner, a reinforcement learning process for robustness, and a novel whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC). Previous approaches specify either the position or the timing of steps, however, the proposed locomotion planner simultaneously computes both of these parameters as locomotion outputs. Our locomotion strategy relies on devising a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for robust walking. The learned policy generates multi step walking patterns, and the process is quick enough to be suitable for real-time controls. For learning, we devise an RL strategy that uses a phase space planner (PSP) and a linear inverted pendulum model to make the problem tractable and very fast. Then, the learned policy is used to provide goal-based commands to the WBLC, which calculates the torque commands to be executed in full-humanoid robots. The WBLC combines multiple prioritized tasks and calculates the associated reaction forces based on practical inequality constraints. The novel formulation includes efficient calculation of the time derivatives of various Jacobians. This provides high-fidelity dynamic control of fast motions. More specifically, we compute the time derivative of the Jacobian for various tasks and the Jacobian of the centroidal momentum task by utilizing Lie group operators and operational space dynamics respectively. The integration of RL-PSP and the WBLC provides highly robust, versatile, and practical locomotion including steering while walking and handling push disturbances of up to 520 N during an interval of 0.1 sec. Theoretical and numerical results are tested through a 3D physics-based simulation of the humanoid robot Valkyrie.},

The control fragments that compose the control graph are developed using guided learning. This leverages the results of open-loop sampling-based reconstruction in order to produce state-action pairs that are then transformed into a linear feedback policy for each control fragment using linear regression.

  abstract = {The physical design of a robot and the policy that controls its motion are inherently coupled, and should be determined according to the task and environment. In an increasing number of applications, data-driven and learningbased approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, have proven effective at designing control policies. For most tasks, the only way to evaluate a physical design with respect to such control policies is empirical---i.e., by picking a design and training a control policy for it. Since training these policies is timeconsuming, it is computationally infeasible to train separate policies for all possible designs as a means to identify the best one. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a method that performs simultaneous joint optimization of the physical design and control network. Our approach maintains a distribution over designs and uses reinforcement learning to optimize a control policy to maximize expected reward over the design distribution. We give the controller access to design parameters to allow it to tailor its policy to each design in the distribution. Throughout training, we shift the distribution towards higher-performing designs, eventually converging to a design and control policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and demonstrate that it discovers novel designs and walking gaits, outperforming baselines in both performance and efficiency.},

In contrast, in robotics we primarily train a single robot for a single task. However, modular robot systems now allow for the flexible combination of general-purpose building blocks into task optimized morphologies. However, given the exponentially large number of possible robot morphologies, training a controller for each new design is impractical. In this work, we propose MetaMorph, a Transformer based approach to learn a universal controller over a modular robot design space. MetaMorph is based on the insight that robot morphology is just another modality on which we can condition the output of a Transformer. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that large scale pretraining on a variety of robot morphologies results in policies with combinatorial generalization capabilities, including zero shot generalization to unseen robot morphologies. We further demonstrate that our pre-trained policy can be used for sample-efficient transfer to completely new robot morphologies and tasks.},

  abstract = {Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a fundamental problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent can massively improve the sample efficiency of a more complex one. To this end, we propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies into two parts: an independently learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level policy. To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly released navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies.

This letter shows that a large class of codesign problems have a common structure, as they are described by two posets, representing functionality, and resources. The codesign constraints can be expressed as two maps in opposite directions between the two posets. Finding the most resource-economical feasible solution is equivalent to finding the least fixed point of the composition of those two maps. If the two maps are monotone, results from order theory allow concluding uniqueness and systematically deriving an optimal design or a certificate for infeasibility.}

  abstract = {Physics-based character animation has seen significant advances in recent years with the adoption of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, DRL-based learning methods are usually computationally expensive and their performance crucially depends on the choice of hyperparameters. Tuning hyperparameters for these methods often requires repetitive training of control policies, which is even more computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose a novel Curriculum-based Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization framework (CMFBO) for efficient hyperparameter optimization of DRL-based character control systems. Using curriculum-based task difficulty as fidelity criterion, our method improves searching efficiency by gradually pruning search space through evaluation on easier motor skill tasks. We evaluate our method on two physics-based character control tasks: character morphology optimization and hyperparameter tuning of DeepMimic. Our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods applicable for physics-based character animation. In particular, we show that hyperparameters optimized through our algorithm result in at least 5x efficiency gain comparing to author-released settings in DeepMimic.},

  abstract = {In many reinforcement learning tasks, the goal is to learn a policy to manipulate an agent, whose design is fixed, to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The design of the agent's physical structure is rarely optimized for the task at hand. In this work, we explore the possibility of learning a version of the agent's design that is better suited for its task, jointly with the policy. We propose an alteration to the popular OpenAI Gym framework, where we parameterize parts of an environment, and allow an agent to jointly learn to modify these environment parameters along with its policy. We demonstrate that an agent can learn a better structure of its body that is not only better suited for the task, but also facilitates policy learning. Joint learning of policy and structure may even uncover design principles that are useful for assisted-design applications.}

We then parameterize each skill with respect to the environment, such as the height of obstacles, or with respect to the task parameters, such as running speed and direction. We employ a continuation process to achieve the required parameterization of the motions and their affine feedback laws. The continuation method uses a predictor-corrector method based on radial basis functions. Lastly, we build control laws specific to the sequential composition of different skills, so that the simulated character can robustly transition to obstacle clearing maneuvers from running whenever obstacles are encountered. The learned transition skills work in tandem with a simple online step-based planning algorithm, and together they robustly guide the character to achieve a state that is well-suited for the chosen obstacle-clearing motion.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing graceful and life-like behaviors for physically simulated characters has been a fundamental challenge in computer animation. Data-driven methods that leverage motion tracking are a prominent class of techniques for producing high fidelity motions for a wide range of behaviors. However, the effectiveness of these tracking-based methods often hinges on carefully designed objective functions, and when applied to large and diverse motion datasets, these methods require significant additional machinery to select the appropriate motion for the character to track in a given scenario. In this work, we propose to obviate the need to manually design imitation objectives and mechanisms for motion selection by utilizing a fully automated approach based on adversarial imitation learning. High-level task objectives that the character should perform can be specified by relatively simple reward functions, while the low-level style of the character's behaviors can be specified by a dataset of unstructured motion clips, without any explicit clip selection or sequencing. For example, a character traversing an obstacle course might utilize a task-reward that only considers forward progress, while the dataset contains clips of relevant behaviors such as running, jumping, and rolling. These motion clips are used to train an adversarial motion prior, which specifies style-rewards for training the character through reinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial RL procedure automatically selects which motion to perform, dynamically interpolating and generalizing from the dataset. Our system produces high-quality motions that are comparable to those achieved by state-of-the-art tracking-based techniques, while also being able to easily accommodate large datasets of unstructured motion clips. Composition of disparate skills emerges automatically from the motion prior, without requiring a high-level motion planner or other task-specific annotations of the motion clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse cast of complex simulated characters and a challenging suite of motor control tasks.},

Control algorithms regulated the running speed, organized use of the legs, and maintained balance. All motions were generated by numerically integrating equations of motion derived from the physical models. The resulting behavior included running at various speeds, traveling with several gaits (run, trot, bound, gallop, and hop), jumping, and traversing simple paths. Whereas the use of control permitted a variety of physically realistic animated behavior to be generated with limited human intervention, the process of designing the control algorithms was not automated: the algorithms were "tweaked" and adjusted for each new creature.},

Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an offpolicy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

However, due to the expensive evaluation cost of models (e.g., training deep learning models or training models on large datasets), vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) is typically computationally infeasible. To alleviate this issue, Hyperband (HB) utilizes the early stopping mechanism to speed up configuration evaluations by terminating those badly-performing configurations in advance. This leads to two kinds of quality measurements: (1) many low-fidelity measurements for configurations that get early-stopped, and (2) few high-fidelity measurements for configurations that are evaluated without being early stopped. The state-of-the-art HB-style method, BOHB, aims to combine the benefits of both BO and HB. Instead of sampling configurations randomly in HB, BOHB samples configurations based on a BO surrogate model, which is constructed with the high-fidelity measurements only. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements greatly hampers the efficiency of BO to guide the configuration search.},

In some cases, both high- and low-fidelity simulations are available, where the high fidelity evaluation is accurate but time-consuming, whereas the low-fidelity evaluation is less accurate but computationally cheap. To find an acceptable optimum within a limited budget, it is economical for evolutionary algorithms to use both high- and low-fidelity evaluations in a single optimization search. This paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm using the transfer stacking technique for bi-fidelity optimization. To this end, a radial basis function network is firstly built to approximate the high-fidelity fitness function as additional low-fidelity evaluation, then a surrogate model transferring the original and additional low-fidelity evaluations to the expensive high-fidelity evaluation is adapted to guide the search. The simulation results on a series of bi-fidelity optimization benchmark problems with resolution, stochastic, and instability errors and a beneficiation processes optimization problem show that the proposed algorithm is both effective and efficient for solving bi-fidelity optimization problems, when their low-fidelity evaluations have resolution and stochastic errors.},

Specifically, different from existing graphbased schemes, GATES models the operations as the transformation of the propagating information, which mimics the actual data processing of neural architecture. GATES is a more reasonable modeling of the neural architectures, and can encode architectures from both the ``operation on node'' and ``operation on edge'' cell search spaces consistently. Experimental results on various search spaces confirm GATES's effectiveness in improving the performance predictor. Furthermore, equipped with the improved performance predictor, the sample efficiency of the predictorbased neural architecture search (NAS) flow is boosted.},

  abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great success in learning complex control policies for a variety of applications in robotics. However, in most such cases, the hardware of the robot has been considered immutable, modeled as part of the environment. In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose to model the robot body as a ``hardware policy'', analogous to and optimized jointly with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such hardware policies as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization family. We present two such design examples: a toy mass-spring problem, and a real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand. We compare our method against traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM model are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM.},

However, prompting methods that rely on implicit knowledge in an LLM often hallucinate incorrect answers when the implicit knowledge is wrong or inconsistent with the task. To tackle this problem, we present Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT), a framework that learns a rule library for reasoning with LLMs. HtT contains two stages, an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, an LLM is first asked to generate and verify rules over a set of training examples. Rules that appear and lead to correct answers sufficiently often are collected to form a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is then prompted to employ the learned rule library to perform reasoning to answer test questions. Experiments on both numerical reasoning and relational reasoning problems show that HtT improves existing prompting methods, with an absolute gain of 11-27\% in accuracy. The learned rules are also transferable to different models and to different forms of the same problem.},

This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, ``Tree of Thoughts'' (ToT), which generalizes over the popular ``Chain of Thought'' approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (``thoughts'') that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4\% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74\%.

  abstract = {Autonomous agents have long been a prominent research focus in both academic and industry communities. Previous research in this field often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an upsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More specifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, for which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the previous work. Then, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in the fields of social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field. To keep track of this field and continuously update our survey, we maintain a repository of relevant references at https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey.},

  abstract = {Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's ``hands and eyes,'' while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

  abstract = {Learning from natural language is a programming-free and user friendly teaching method that allows users without programming knowledge or demonstration capabilities to instruct robots, which has great value in industry and daily life. The manipulation skills of robots are often hierarchical skills composed of low-level primitive skills, so they can be conveniently represented by behavior trees (BTs). Based on this idea, we propose NL2BT, a framework for generating behavior trees from natural language and controlling robots to complete hierarchical tasks in real time. The framework consists of two language processing stages, an initial behavior tree library composed of primitive skill subtrees, and a BT-Generation algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of NL2BT, we use it to build a Chinese natural language system for instructing robots in performing 3C assembly tasks, which is a significant application of Industry 4.0. We also discuss the positive impact of real-time teaching, visual student models, and the synonymous skill module in the framework. In addition to the demonstrated application, NL2BT can be easily migrated to other languages and hierarchical task learning scenarios.},

  abstract = {The notions of distance and similarity play a key role in many machine learning approaches, and artificial intelligence in general, since they can serve as an organizing principle by which individuals classify objects, form concepts and make generalizations. While distance functions for propositional representations have been thoroughly studied, work on distance functions for structured representations, such as graphs, frames or logical clauses, has been carried out in different communities and is much less understood. Specifically, a significant amount of work that requires the use of a distance or similarity function for structured representations of data usually employs ad-hoc functions for specific applications. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide an overview of this work to identify connections between the work carried out in different areas and point out directions for future work.},

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. ``make breakfast''), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. ``open fridge''). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.},

To robustify this data-collection process, the LLM also infers a code-snippet for the success condition of each task, simultaneously enabling the data-collection process to detect failure and retry as well as the automatic labeling of trajectories with success/failure. For (2), we extend the diffusion policy single-task behavior-cloning approach to multi-task settings with language conditioning. Finally, we propose a new multi-task benchmark with 18 tasks across five domains to test long-horizon behavior, common-sense reasoning, tool-use, and intuitive physics. We find that our distilled policy successfully learned the robust retrying behavior in its data collection procedure, while improving absolute success rates by 33.2\% on average across five domains. Code, data, and additional qualitative results are available on https://www.cs.columbia.edu/\&nbsp;huy/scalingup/.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to a growing interest in applying RL to classical planning domains or applying classical planning methods to some complex RL domains. However, the long-horizon goal-based problems found in classical planning lead to sparse rewards for RL, making direct application inefficient. In this paper, we propose to leverage domain-independent heuristic functions commonly used in the classical planning literature to improve the sample efficiency of RL. These classical heuristics act as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards issue and enable our RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals on these heuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique requires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted metric used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic Machines, a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic inputs. We demonstrate on several classical planning domains that using classical heuristics for RL allows for good sample efficiency compared to sparse-reward RL. We further show that our learned value functions generalize to novel problem instances in the same domain.

  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. Furthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.},

Based on the observation of relations between action and proposition layers, we present a new and high-quality domain-independent pruning strategy for forward-chaining heuristic planning through Action Utility Analysis. The proposed strategy extracts so-called directly-used actions from relaxed planning graph as promising successors. Its pruning result is in general better than the helpful actions strategy. Our strategy can be used in any progression state space search framework. Experiments in the STRIPS benchmarks of International Planning Competitions (IPC) show that our pruning strategy along with algorithms decreases the search space effectively, and can outperform helpful action strategy of FF.},

  abstract = {Algorithms have been designed for robot motion planning with various adaptability to different problems. However, how to choose the most suitable planner in a scene has always been a problem worthy of research. This paper aims to find the most suitable motion planner for each query under three different scenes and six different queries. The work lies in optimization of sampling-based motion planning algorithms through motion planning pipeline and planning request adapter. The idea is to use the pre-processing of the planning request adapter, to run OMPL as a pre-processer for the optimized CHOMP or STOMP algorithm, and connect through the motion planning pipeline, to realize the optimization of the motion trajectory. The optimized trajectories are compared with original trajectories through benchmarking. The benchmarking determines the most suitable motion planning algorithm for different scenarios and different queries. Experimental results show that after optimization, the planning time of the algorithm is longer, but the efficiency is significantly improved. In the low-complexity scenes, STOMP optimizes the sampling algorithm very well, improves the trajectory quality greatly, and has a higher success rate. CHOMP also has a good optimization of the sampling algorithm, but it reduces the success rate of the original algorithm. However, in more complex scenes, optimization performance of the two optimization methods may not be as good as the original algorithm. In future work, we need to find better algorithms and better optimization algorithms to tackle with complex scenes.}

BEHAVIOR-1K includes two components, guided and motivated by the results of an extensive survey on "what do you want robots to do for you?". The first is the definition of 1,000 everyday activities, grounded in 50 scenes (houses, gardens, restaurants, offices, etc.) with more than 5,000 objects annotated with rich physical and semantic properties. The second is OmniGibson, a novel simulation environment that supports these activities via realistic physics simulation and rendering of rigid bodies, deformable bodies, and liquids. Our experiments indicate that the activities in BEHAVIOR-1K are long-horizon and dependent on complex manipulation skills, both of which remain a challenge for even state-of-the-art robot learning solutions. To calibrate the simulation-to-reality gap of BEHAVIOR-1K, we provide an initial study on transferring solutions learned with a mobile manipulator in a simulated apartment to its real-world counterpart. We hope that BEHAVIOR-1K's human-grounded nature, diversity, and realism make it valuable for embodied AI and robot learning research. Project website: https://behavior.stanford.edu.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robots combine a variety of skills to form increasingly complex behaviors called missions. While the skills are often programmed at a relatively low level of abstraction, their coordination is architecturally separated and often expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. Recently, the language of Behavior Trees gained attention among roboticists for this reason. Originally designed for computer games to model autonomous actors, Behavior Trees offer an extensible tree-based representation of missions. However, even though, several implementations of the language are in use, little is known about its usage and scope in the real world. How do behavior trees relate to traditional languages for describing behavior? How are behavior tree concepts used in applications? What are the benefits of using them? We present a study of the key language concepts in Behavior Trees and their use in real-world robotic applications. We identify behavior tree languages and compare their semantics to the most well-known behavior modeling languages: state and activity diagrams. We mine open source repositories for robotics applications that use the language and analyze this usage. We find that Behavior Trees are a pragmatic language, not fully specified, allowing projects to extend it even for just one model. Behavior trees clearly resemble the models-at-runtime paradigm. We contribute a dataset of real-world behavior models, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop this language, associated tools, and analysis techniques.},

Like the HSP system, FF relies on forward state space search, using a heuristic that estimates goal distances by ignoring delete lists. Unlike HSP's heuristic, our method does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and used to prune the search space. FF was the most successful automatic planner at the recent AIPS-2000 planning competition. We review the results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of FF compared to HSP.},

  abstract = {Many known planning tasks have inherent constraints concerning the best order in which to achieve the goals. A number of research efforts have been made to detect such constraints and to use them for guiding search, in the hope of speeding up the planning process. We go beyond the previous approaches by considering ordering constraints not only over the (top-level) goals, but also over the sub-goals that will necessarily arise during planning. Landmarks are facts that must be true at some point in every valid solution plan. We extend Koehler and Hoffmann's definition of reasonable orders between top level goals to the more general case of landmarks. We show how landmarks can be found, how their reasonable orders can be approximated, and how this information can be used to decompose a given planning task into several smaller sub-tasks. Our methodology is completely domain- and planner-independent. The implementation demonstrates that the approach can yield significant runtime performance improvements when used as a control loop around state-of-the-art sub-optimal planning systems, as exemplified by FF and LPG.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider multiagent planning with joint actions----that refer to the same action being performed concurrently by a group of agents. There are few works that study specification of joint actions by extending PDDL. Since there are no multiagent planners that can handle joint actions, we propose a multiagent planning algorithm, which is capable of handling joint actions. In a multiagent setting, each agent has a different capability. The proposed algorithm obtains the number of agents involved in a joint action based on the capability of the individual agents. We have implemented our algorithm and compared its efficiency with some state-of-the-art classical planners. The results show that when the problem size increases, our algorithm can solve such problems whereas it cannot be solved by the classical planners.},

A controller is only valid for a subset of the states of the character, known as the domain of attraction (DOA). This article shows how many states that are initially outside the DOA can be brought inside it. Our first contribution is to show how DOA expansion can be performed for a high-dimensional simulated character. Our second contribution is to present an algorithm that efficiently increases the DOA using random trees that provide denser coverage than the trees produced by typical sampling-based motion-planning algorithms. The trees are constructed offline but can be queried fast enough for near-real-time control. We show the effect of DOA expansion on getting up, crouch-to-stand, jumping, and standing-twist controllers. We also show how DOA expansion can be used to connect controllers together.},

We briefly deal with the structural analysis of planning problems, which has initiated theVidal, Vincent development of efficient planning algorithms and associated planners. Then, we describe the Markov Decision Processes framework (MDP), initially proposed in the Operations Research community before the AI community adopted it as a framework for planning under uncertainty. Eventually, we will describe innovative (approximate or exact) MDP solution algorithms as well as recent progresses in AI in terms of knowledge representation (logics, Bayesian networks) which have been used to increase the power of expression of the MDP framework.},
