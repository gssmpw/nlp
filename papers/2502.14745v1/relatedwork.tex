Expressive querying of models stored as intensional data is, to
the best of our knowledge, an original idea.  At the same time,
this idea fits more broadly in the important general theme of
integrating machine learning tasks in database systems; there has
been much research on this theme, as covered in surveys and
monographs \cite{boehmbook,declarmlsurvey,ss-m-ml-lifecycle-survey}.

Specifically on applications of SQL to machine learning, there
has been interesting work on using and extending SQL to not only
invoke \cite{madlib}, but also train machine learning models
\cite{jermaine_linalgebra,ml2sql,sql4ml}.  In essence, the
latter also involves evaluation-type queries over models.
Our novel focus here is on using SQL for the analysis of
already learned models, stored as intensional data in the
database.

We also note that the general idea of querying 
intensional data, other than machine
learning models, has repeatedly surfaced in database research,
e.g., constraints \cite{kkr_cql}, schemas \cite{schemasql2},
or even queries as data \cite{stoneb_queldatatype,metasql}.
