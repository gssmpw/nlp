\section{Related work}
There are several other works that deal not with the diameter, but rather with the problem of computing the \emph{distance} of two given vertices of some polytope $P$.
In the case of the distance this problem was shown to be NP-hard for the bipartite perfect matching polytope $P_G$ independently by Aichholzer et al.\ ____ and Ito et al.\ ____. Additionally, Borgward et al.\ ____ show NP-hardness of computing circuit distances in 0/1-network flow polytopes, and Cardinal and Steiner show the same for polymatroids ____.
These results were strengthened by Cardinal and Steiner ____ to a $O(\log n / \log \log n)$-hardness of approximation result for computing a short path between two 
vertices of distance two on the bipartite perfect matching polytope, assuming ETH.
As explained in ____, the techniques for handling polytope diameters and distances are very different, since distances can be very short (which is often helpful for proofs), 
but diameters are usually large.

Finally, a related series of work deals with \emph{combinatorial reconfiguration} of perfect matchings ____. 
In these papers, the notion of adjacency between two perfect matchings differs from the adjacency on the bipartite perfect matching polytope considered in the present paper.
