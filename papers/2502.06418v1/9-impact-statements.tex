\section*{Impact Statement}
% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

Watermarking is an avenue for AIGC provenance and detection, preventing potential misbehavior such as the spread of misinformation, copyright violation, and adversarial false attribution. Our work primarily underscores novel threats to modern learning-based watermarking schemes prioritizing robustness against real-world distortions. In theory, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise watermarks, potentially harming users and service providers. However, the watermarking methods analyzed in this study are all open-source and research-focused, while the real-world deployment of invisible and robust watermarks remains in its early stages. Therefore, we believe making our work public has no direct negative impact. Conversely, we believe our findings have a positive societal impact by exposing a fundamental vulnerability in existing robust watermarking techniques, thereby preventing potential covert exploitation by adversaries and offering valuable insights for developing more secure image watermarking solutions.


% However, the watermarking methods studied in this paper are all open-sourced and research-oriented ones. 
% The deployment of invisible and robust watermarks in practice is at an early age.
