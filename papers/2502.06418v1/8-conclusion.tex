\section{Conclusion}
We reveal a tradeoff in robust watermarks: Improved redundancy of watermark information enhances robustness, but increased redundancy raises the risk of watermark leakage. We propose DAPAO attack, a framework that requires only one image for watermark extraction, effectively achieving both watermark removal and spoofing attacks against cutting-edge robust watermarking methods. Our attack reaches an average success rate of 87\% in detection evasion (about 60\% higher than existing evasion attacks) and an average success rate of 85\% in forgery (approximately 51\% higher than current forgery studies).
