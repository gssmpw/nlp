\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\subsection{Effectiveness against In-processing Watermarks}
% Our method demonstrates limited effectiveness when addressing watermarks with high semantic coupling. Regarding our forgery attack, the basic strategy of adding the learned variable to a clean image fails to deceive RivaGan and HiDDeN, two watermarking techniques that are more closely related to the semantics of the carrier image. While we also propose an optimization approach tailored to these two scenarios, it is essential to further investigate the performance of our method for semantically embedded watermarks.

In-processing watermarks usually demonstrate a stronger coupling effect with the semantics of imagery, probably presenting insufficient pattern leakage for our method to utilize. For example, Tree-Ring~\cite{wen2023tree} subtly influences the entire image generation process by embedding a pattern structured in the Fourier domain into the noise vector for sampling. This watermarking significantly connects with the image content, and our attacks exhibit limited performance on it.

While in-processing watermarks present challenges for our method, this watermarking approach has a limited range of applications. It necessitates significant modifications to existing image synthesis algorithms and cannot be applied to watermarking real images.

\subsection{Defenses against DAPAO}
We urgently need to develop defenses for post-processing watermarks against our attacks, considering these methods have wider application scenarios. A promising direction is to optimize the adversarial training (described in Sec.~\ref{sec:background}) with the inclusion of leakage estimation, striking a balance between robustness and security.

% Current watermarking methods rehearse to ensure the correct watermark can be decoded from distorted watermarked images by applying adversarial training of the watermarking encoder and decoder. They include a distortion layer between the encoder and decoder to perform image compression or other operations.
