  abstract =      {.This paper develops a class of algorithms for
                   general linear systems and eigenvalue problems. These
                   algorithms apply fast randomized dimension reduction
                   (``sketching'') to accelerate standard subspace
                   projection methods, such as GMRES and Rayleigh--Ritz.
                   This modification makes it possible to incorporate
                   nontraditional bases for the approximation subspace
                   that are easier to construct. When the basis is
                   numerically full rank, the new algorithms have
                   accuracy similar to classic methods but run faster
                   and may use less storage. For model problems,
                   numerical experiments show large advantages over the
                   optimized MATLAB routines, including a speedup over
                   and a speedup over .},

  abstract =      {\{The conjugate gradient method applied to the normal
                   equations ATAx=ATb (CGLS) is often used for solving
                   large sparse linear least squares problems. The
                   mathematically equivalent algorithm LSQR based on the
                   Lanczos bidiagonalization process is an often
                   recommended alternative. In this paper, the
                   achievable accuracy of different conjgate gradient
                   and Lanczos methods in finite precision is studied.
                   It is shown that an implementation of algorithm CGLS
                   in which the residual sk=AT(b-Axk) of the normal
                   equations is recurred will not in general achieve
                   accurate solutions. The same conclusion holds for the
                   method based on Lanczos bidiagonalization with
                   starting vector ATb. For the preferred implementation
                   of CGLS we bound the error
                   {\textbar}{\textbar}r-rk{\textbar}{\textbar} of the
                   computed residual rk. Numerical tests are given that
                   confirm a conjecture of backward stability. The
                   achievable accuracy of LSQR is shown to be similar.
                   The analysis essentially also covers the
                   preconditioned case.\vphantom\}},
