                   matrices with non-positive off-diagonal entries (SDDM
                   matrices), including Laplacian matrices. We use
                   preconditioned conjugate gradient to solve the system
                   of linear equations. Our preconditioner is a variant
                   of the Approximate Cholesky factorization of Kyng and
                   Sachdeva (FOCS 2016). Our factorization approach is
                   simple: we eliminate matrix rows/columns one at a
                   time, and update the remaining entries of the matrix
                   by sampling entries to approximate the outcome of
                   complete Cholesky factorization. Unlike earlier
                   approaches, our sampled entries always maintain a
                   connected graph on the neighbors of the eliminated
                   variable. Our algorithm comes with a tuning parameter
                   that upper bounds the number of samples made per
                   original entry.},

                   techniques for solving problems in linear algebra
                   have been proposed in the last decade, but they have
                   not yet made a significant impact on numerical linear
                   algebra. We show that by using a high-quality
                   implementation of one of these techniques, we obtain
                   a solver that performs extremely well in the
                   traditional yardsticks of numerical linear algebra:
                   it is significantly faster than high-performance
                   implementations of existing state-of-the-art
                   algorithms, and it is numerically backward stable.
                   More specifically, we describe a least-squares solver
                   for dense highly overdetermined systems that achieves
                   residuals similar to those of direct QR
                   factorization-based solvers (lapack), outperforms
                   lapack by large factors, and scales significantly
                   better than any QR-based solver.},

                   general linear systems and eigenvalue problems. These
                   algorithms apply fast randomized dimension reduction
                   (``sketching'') to accelerate standard subspace
                   projection methods, such as GMRES and Rayleigh--Ritz.
                   This modification makes it possible to incorporate
                   nontraditional bases for the approximation subspace
                   that are easier to construct. When the basis is
                   numerically full rank, the new algorithms have
                   accuracy similar to classic methods but run faster
                   and may use less storage. For model problems,
                   numerical experiments show large advantages over the
                   optimized MATLAB routines, including a speedup over

                   equations ATAx=ATb (CGLS) is often used for solving
                   large sparse linear least squares problems. The
                   mathematically equivalent algorithm LSQR based on the
                   Lanczos bidiagonalization process is an often
                   recommended alternative. In this paper, the
                   achievable accuracy of different conjgate gradient
                   and Lanczos methods in finite precision is studied.
                   It is shown that an implementation of algorithm CGLS
                   in which the residual sk=AT(b-Axk) of the normal
                   equations is recurred will not in general achieve
                   accurate solutions. The same conclusion holds for the
                   method based on Lanczos bidiagonalization with
                   starting vector ATb. For the preferred implementation
                   of CGLS we bound the error
                   {\textbar}{\textbar}r-rk{\textbar}{\textbar} of the
                   computed residual rk. Numerical tests are given that
                   confirm a conjecture of backward stability. The
                   achievable accuracy of LSQR is shown to be similar.
                   The analysis essentially also covers the

                   robust preconditioners for the CGLS method applied to
                   the solution of large and sparse least squares
                   problems. The algorithm computes an incomplete LDLT
                   factorization of the normal equations matrix without
                   the need to form the normal matrix itself. The
                   preconditioner is reliable (pivot breakdowns cannot
                   occur) and has low intermediate storage requirements.
                   Numerical experiments illustrating the performance of
                   the preconditioner are presented. A comparison with
                   incomplete QR preconditioners is also included.},
