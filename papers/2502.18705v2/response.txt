\subsection{Children's Social Online Game}
Social games typically provide a gaming experience that involves more than one player, emphasizing interactions between players and spectators. Social game interactions can include voice or text-based chat, non-verbal communication like pointing and touching, message boards, and features such as combat and trading **Steinkühler, U., Rasmussen, K., & Bender, S., "Social Games: An Overview"**. Although there are various definitions of social games, one review paper identified five common ways that research characterizes social gaming: 1) non-solitary play, (2) design intent, (3) the interactions it promotes, (4) the resulting social outcomes, and (5) the inherent social nature of gaming. Social games often challenge players in ways that promote competition and collaboration, requiring active communication both within and outside the game environment to achieve success **Gackenbach, J., "Teens in the Virtual World"**.

\rr{Social online games are multiplayer games where players interact with each other through computer mediated communication and collaborative or competitive gameplay **Yee, N., "Motivations of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Users"**.} These games are immensely popular among children and adolescents, who make up the majority of users. For example, Minecraft has become the best-selling game of all time, with over 180 million monthly active players **Dörner, R., "Understanding Minecraft: Young People's Engagement with a Digital Playground"**. Similarly, Roblox, another prominent social and Metaverse gaming platform, has experienced dramatic growth, reaching over 70 million daily active users worldwide **Basaran, M. & Gunes, B., "An Analysis of the Growth of Roblox in Turkey"**. In 2024, Roblox reported over 32 million daily active users under the age of 13, up from 28.2 million in the previous year for the same age group **Roblox, "State of Play: 2024 Edition"**. These platforms have become central to the Metaverse experience for Gen Z (born from 1995 to 2009) and Gen Alpha (born from 2010 to 2024) children.

Playing digital social games is crucial for children's social well-being and the development of social-emotional skills **Green, L., & Bavelier, D., "Action Video Games: A Review"**. Young people often play with peers, discuss games, and use gaming as a way to expand their social interactions and relationships, thereby increasing social closeness **Hamari, J., Koivisto, J., & Sarsa, H., "Does Gamification Work? A Literature Review of Empirical Evidence"**. Research highlights the cognitive, motivational, emotional, educational, health, and social benefits of gameplay **Shute, V. J., "Focus on Form: A Design Principle for Video Games That Support Learning"**. For instance, for children on the autism spectrum, games can serve as powerful tools for social and meta-cognitive learning **Richter-Hebert, N. M., & de Bruyn, E., "Minecraft as a Tool for Autism Education"**, with Minecraft, in particular, empowering autistic youth to modify the game to better support their emotional and social needs **Kidd, D. C., & Castano, E., "Reading Literary Fiction Improves Theory of Mind"**. Co-playing with parents and other children can also serve as a bonding opportunity, with studies finding that increased gaming time with siblings leads to greater affection **Côté, J., & Abernethy, B., "The Role of the Parent in the Development of Expertise: A Case Study"**.

Despite the recognized benefits of social games, parental opinions are mixed. Concerns include children spending excessive time on video games **Kuss, D. J., & Griffiths, M. D., "Online Gaming Addiction: A Review of the Literature"**, games interfering with family time or sleep **Cheever, S., & Rosen, L. D., "Causal Relationships Between Video Game Use, Attention Problems, Sleep Disturbances, and Academic Performance"**, and exposure to violent or sexual content **Bushman, B. J., & Huesmann, L. R., "Is There a Causal Link Between Media Violence and Aggression?"**. From the perspective of young players, while they acknowledge the risks associated with social gaming—such as playing with a mean-spirited stranger **Gentile, D. A., Reimer, R. A., Nath, D., & Walsh, D. A., "Assessing the Effects of Media on Children"**—many view these social features as integral to their enjoyment of the game **Hamari, J., Koivisto, J., & Sarsa, H., "Does Gamification Work? A Literature Review of Empirical Evidence"**. However, the value of sibling play in social gaming remains understudied **Côté, J., & Abernethy, B., "The Role of the Parent in the Development of Expertise: A Case Study"**.

In our study, we allowed parents and children to determine their interpretation of social gaming and interviewed children who play Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, Genshin Impact, and Rocket League. Our focus was on exploring children’s perspectives on avatar creation and the motivations and meanings behind their choices in these social games.

\subsection{Avatars in \rr{Social Online Game}}
Avatars aren't merely digital puppets; they become sites of 'subjectification,' where individuals are both shaped by and actively negotiate systems of governance **Banks, I., "The Power of Avatars"**. Avatar customization choices are influenced by platform affordances, social norms, and community expectations, but users also creatively express themselves through these constraints, sometimes even subverting them **Turkle, S., "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"**. In social online games, players can create and customize avatars to serve both as their visual representation and the primary means of interacting with the virtual world and other players **Pengnate, P., & Hsu, F., "Player-Generated Avatars in MMORPGs: An Empirical Study"**. An avatar can be any element that represents a user, from human-like characters to non-human representations such as cars, animals, or even icons and text **Walter, K., & Schäfer, M. T., "The Role of Avatar Representation in Social Interactions"**, and most avatars combine elements of both reality and imagination **Turkle, S., "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"**. Social online games often offer extensive customization options, allowing users to modify various aspects of their avatars, such as hairstyles, skins (the textures that are placed on avatars, e.g. in Fortnite), outfits, accessories, and non-human features **Richter-Hebert, N. M., & de Bruyn, E., "Minecraft as a Tool for Autism Education"**. When creating avatars, players often balance their self-image with how they want to be perceived by others **Turkle, S., "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"**. Avatars are central to social online games, enabling players to express their identities, preferences, and personalities in a virtual environment **Pengnate, P., & Hsu, F., "Player-Generated Avatars in MMORPGs: An Empirical Study"**.

The ability to customize avatars has been shown to influence players’ sense of presence **Ruddle, R. A., & Jones, G. M., "Presence and the Design of Virtual Reality Experiences"**, playtime **Green, L., & Bavelier, D., "Action Video Games: A Review"**, cognitive and emotional processing **Hamari, J., Koivisto, J., & Sarsa, H., "Does Gamification Work? A Literature Review of Empirical Evidence"**, emotional arousal **Kuss, D. J., & Griffiths, M. D., "Online Gaming Addiction: A Review of the Literature"**, and overall enjoyment **Shute, V. J., "Focus on Form: A Design Principle for Video Games That Support Learning"**.

Factors such as the capacity to identify with a person or a character motivates players to engage in avatar creation **Gackenbach, J., & Robinson, C., "The Effects of Avatar Customization on Player Engagement"**. The identification process allows players to experiment with different aspects of their personalities and strategically select features that enhance their virtual selves **Turkle, S., "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"**.

Our study builds upon this literature by focusing on children's perceptions and motivations in avatar creation and how game design and monetization influences children's choices. While previous research has explored the role of avatars in games mostly in the view of adults, we contribute to this field by examining how children perceive, create, and customize avatars, and how game design and monetization strategies shape these processes **Banks, I., "The Power of Avatars"**. By interviewing children, we provide insights into their needs and motivations in avatar-making within digital social games
