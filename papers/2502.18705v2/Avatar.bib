abstract = {Digital games frequently give rise to engaging and meaningful social interactions, both over the internet and in the real and tangible world of the gamer. This is the focus of the present paper, which explores digital gaming as a situated experience, shaped by socio-spatial contingencies. In particular we discuss how co-players, audience, and their spatial organization shape play and player experience and review supporting evidence for this. We present a framework describing social processes underlying situated social play experience and how these are shaped by the player the game's socio-spatial and media context. The core of this framework describes various 'sociality characteristics', and discusses these both in terms of co-located and mediated social game settings.},

    abstract = { The researchers examined social interactions of children using home computers. The main concern was whether computers tended to isolate youthful users. Adult anxiety regarding the damaging effects of computers on children was assessed. Parental involvement, orientation to computers, and gender were the main independent variables. A case study approach was employed to gather observational data regarding the variety of interactional networks that framed the computer experience of 32 participants. The findings challenged the notion that heavy computer users experience social isolation. It was found that the interpersonal lives and computer activities of children reflexively amplified each other and that boys were more likely to socialize in relation to computers than were girls. The findings were explained as consequences of context and gender-based differentiated styles of world-creating activity. Recommendations were made to parents and teachers encouraging a less apprehensive and more integrative/developmental view of the social effects of children’s computer use. }

    abstract = { Electronic games are now an everyday part of childhood and adolescence. The debate has moved from whether children should play video games to how to maximize potential benefits and to identify and minimize potential harms. To do this, we must understand what motivates children to play electronic games and what needs the games meet. Drawing on a survey of 1,254 middle school children, focus groups with boys and their parents, and findings from other quantitative and qualitative research, the author describes a variety of motivations for video game play (including games with violent content) and how these may vary based on factors such as mood, environment, personality, and developmental stage. The findings are put into the context of normal development, and suggestions are given for parents, educators, and researchers. }

As a result, designers have little guidance on which multiplayer game mechanics are most effective. We summarize literature on game design for social closeness into a framework with two collaborative mechanics: cooperation and interdependence. We then created four versions of an online game to independently test the effects of these game mechanics on relationship formation between paired online strangers, showing that cooperation and interdependence are two distinct factors that both can be used to improve play experience and increase social bonds. Additionally, we unpack the effect of interdependence, showing that the improved social closeness can be explained by the increase in conversational turns.}

Video game use has been associated with several behavioral and health outcomes for adolescents. The aim of the current study was to assess the relationship between parental co-play of video games and behavioral and family outcomes.
Method
Participants consisted of 287 adolescents and their parents who completed a number of video game-, behavioral-, and family-related questionnaires as part of a wider study. Most constructs included child, mother, and father reports.
Results
At the bivariate level, time spent playing video games was associated with several negative outcomes, including heightened internalizing and aggressive behavior and lowered prosocial behavior. However, co-playing video games with parents was associated with decreased levels of internalizing and aggressive behaviors, and heightened prosocial behavior for girls only. Co-playing video games was also marginally related to parent–child connectedness for girls, even after controlling for age-inappropriate games played with parents.
Conclusions
This is the first study to show positive associations for co-playing video games between girls and their parents.}

We also show that greater identification translates into motivated behaviour as operationalized by the time that players spent in an unending version of the infinite runner. Important for the design of games for entertainment and serious purposes, we discuss how identification with an avatar can be facilitated to cultivate intrinsic motivation within and beyond games.},

This paper offers two contributions. First, we provide a survey and a discussion of the existing literature. Second, we describe a field study that extends the current body of empirical evidence of the potential benefits of touchless motion-based gaming for autistic children. Our research involved five autistic children and one therapist in the experimentation of a set of Kinect games at a therapeutic center for a period of two and a half months. Using standardized therapeutic tests, observations during game sessions, and video analysis of over 20 hours of children's activities, we evaluated the learning benefits in relationship to attentional skills and explored several factors in the emotional and behavioral sphere. Our findings show improvements of the considered learning variables and help us to better understand how autistic children experience motion-based touchless play. Overall, our research sheds a light on the opportunities offered full body touchless games for therapy and education of these special users.},

In this article, we present results from a study into the digital play of twenty-four 9–14-year-olds, attending to our participants’ perspectives and attitudes towards ‘game addiction’ and how it interacts with their play and identity. Focused primarily on the online multiplayer first-person shooter game Fortnite, we examine how children encounter and attempt to negotiate game addiction discourse and demonstrate how the discourse in and of itself produces challenges for young people whose interests and passions revolve around games. This article subsequently discusses how the discursive frameworks that are perpetuated in the media around ‘problematic play’ need to incorporate and be inclusive of the child’s right to play, and the relevance of our findings to the study of media panic and children’s critical media literacies. }

Player balancing that provides skill assistance for the weaker player can allow for enjoyable play experiences; however, previous research (and conventional wisdom) has suggested that skill assistance should be kept hidden to avoid perceptions of unfairness. We carried out a study to test how disclosing skill assistance affects player experience. We found -- surprisingly -- that disclosing assistance did not harm play experience; players were more influenced by the benefits of equalized performance resulting from assistance than by their knowledge of the assist. We introduce the idea of attribution biases to help explain why awareness was not harmful -- people tend to take credit for their successes, but attribute failures externally. We discuss how game designers can incorporate skill assistance to build multiplayer games that improve experiences for a wide range of players.},

We investigate how in-game friendships develop, and how they affect well-being. We deployed an online survey (N= 234) measuring the properties of games and social capital that participants experience within their gaming community, alongside indicators of the social aspects of their psychological wellbeing (loneliness, need satisfaction of relatedness). First, our findings highlight two strong predictors of in-game social capital: interdependence and toxicity, whereas cooperation appears to be less crucial than common wisdom suggests. Second, we demonstrate how in-game social capital is associated with reduced feelings of loneliness and increased satisfaction of relatedness. Our findings suggest that social capital in games is strongly and positively related to players' psychological well-being. The present study informs both the design of social games as well as our theoretical understanding of in-game relationships.},

abstract = {Digital games often constitute a shared activity where people can spend time together, communicate and socialize. Several commercial titles place social interaction at the center of their design. Prior works have investigated the social outcomes of gaming, and factors that impact the experience. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how social gaming has been approached and explored before. In this work, we present a systematic review covering 263 publications, gathered in February 2021, that study gaming experiences involving more than one person, with a focus on the social element that emerges among partakers (players and/or spectators). We contribute with a systematized understanding of (1) how the topic is being defined and approached, (2) what facets (mainly in terms of outcomes and determinants of the experience) are being acknowledged and (3) the methodologies leveraged to examine these. Our analysis, based on mixed deductive and inductive coding, reveals relevant gaps and tendencies, including (1) the emphasis in novel technologies and unconventional games, (2) the apparent negligence of player diversity, and (3) lower ecological validity associated with totally mediated evaluations and a lack of established constructs to assess social outcomes.}

abstract = {Outstanding multiplayer games engage players by providing rich social interactions. Yet, it is still not clear how to purposefully design these interactions. Our paper tackles this issue by establishing a research model for social player interaction highlighting the impact of the game design, the player group, and the gaming setting. Based on that model, we investigated the influence of three particular game design patterns - player interdependence, time pressure, and shared control - on the interaction of players. For that purpose, we developed a co-located game to systematically test variations of those patterns. We analyzed the resulting player experience and social interaction by applying questionnaires and videotaping game play sessions. Results indicate that high player interdependence implies more communication and less frustration, whereas shared control results in less perceived competence and autonomy. Moreover, individual player characteristics also impact the social interaction.},
