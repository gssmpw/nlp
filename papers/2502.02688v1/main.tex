\begin{abstract}
The success of Constraint Programming relies partly on the global constraints and implementation of the associated filtering algorithms. Recently, new ideas emerged to improve these implementations in practice, especially regarding the all different constraint.

In this paper, we consider the cardinality constraint with costs. The cardinality constraint is a generalization of the all different constraint that specifies the number of times each value must be taken by a given set of variables in a solution. The version with costs introduces an assignment cost and bounds the total sum of assignment costs. The arc consistency filtering algorithm of this constraint is difficult to use in practice, as it systematically searches for many shortest paths. We propose a new approach that works with upper bounds on shortest paths based on landmarks. This approach can be seen as a preprocessing. It is fast and avoids, in practice, a large number of explicit computations of shortest paths.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the arc consistency algorithm of the cardinality constraint with costs. 
This constraint is present in many industrial problems and the establishment of the arc consistency is often too slow to be used in practice, as it is based on finding the shortest paths from the assigned values. We introduce a new method that uses upper bounds on shortest paths based on triangular inequalities and landmarks. 
This approach avoids the computation of many shortest paths and improves the computation time of the arc consistency filtering algorithm.
The larger the graph and the larger the margins, the greater the improvement will be.
In addition, we have introduced a sufficient condition, which is quick to compute, for a costgcc constraint to be arc consistent.
