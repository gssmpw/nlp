abstract = {Given the aging highway infrastructure requiring extensive rebuilding and enhancements, and the consequent rise in the number of work zones, there is an urgent need to develop advanced safety systems to protect workers. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant potential for delivering warnings to workers, its integration into roadway work zones remains relatively unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to improve safety measures within roadway work zones by conducting an extensive analysis of how different combinations of multimodal Augmented Reality (AR) warnings influence the reaction times of workers. This paper addresses this gap through a series of experiments that aim to replicate the distinctive conditions of roadway work zones, both in real-world and virtual reality environments. Our approach comprises three key components: an advanced AR system prototype, a VR simulation of AR functionality within the work zone environment, and the Wizard of Oz technique to synchronize user experiences across experiments. To assess reaction times, we leverage both the simple reaction time (SRT) technique and an innovative vision-based metric that utilizes real-time pose estimation. By conducting five experiments in controlled outdoor work zones and indoor VR settings, our study provides valuable information on how various multimodal AR warnings impact workers reaction times. Furthermore, our findings reveal the disparities in reaction times between VR simulations and real-world scenarios, thereby gauging VRâ€™s capability to mirror the dynamics of roadway work zones. Furthermore, our results substantiate the potential and reliability of vision-based reaction time measurements. These insights resonate well with those derived using the SRT technique, underscoring the viability of this approach for tangible real-world uses.}

abstract = {Work zone crashes and fatalities persist at alarming rates, highlighting the need for innovative safety solutions. Augmented Reality (AR) safety warnings have shown promise, yet their impact on situational awareness, attention, and cognitive workload remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this study investigates the neurophysiological responses to AR-assisted warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Leveraging electroencephalogram (EEG) technology within a virtual reality simulation of work zones, we objectively evaluated post-warning situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load during low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) activities. Key EEG indicators, including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves, as well as combined wave ratios, were used to measure these responses. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively triggered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the timing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier (within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cognitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed delayed peak responses (125â€“250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware safety interventions in high-risk work environments.}
