The study by Sanders et al. ____ investigated the willingness to use e-scooters in Arizona, U.S., revealing significant gender-based differences in barriers to usage, especially regarding safety concerns. Moreover, African American and non-white Hispanic respondents were more likely than non-Hispanic white respondents to express an intention to try e-scooters.

Nikiforiadis et al. ____ examined shared e-scooter usage in Thessaloniki, Greece, and found that females were less inclined to use e-scooters compared to males. Pyrialakou et al. ____ conducted a survey study in Phoenix, Arizona, exploring the safety perceptions of road users interacting with autonomous vehicles (AVs), including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.

The findings reveal that feeling safe near AVs is positively linked to a lack of concern about threats like hacking or terrorism, while direct experience with AVs improves pedestrian safety perceptions. Cycling near AVs is seen as the least safe activity, followed by walking and then driving.

Females are less likely than males to feel safe around AVs, and overall exposure and experience with AVs can have both positive and negative effects on safety perceptions ____.

Previous studies primarily examined the trust and safety perceptions in autonomous vehicles, with limited attention to other AI-assisted modes of transport. To the best of our knowledge, no study has specifically investigated the perception of trust and safety in AI-assisted e-scooters, either from the perspective of riders or other road users.

This study explores the level of trust in AI-assisted e-scooters and its influence on the willingness to adopt this emerging system ____.

Pyrialkou et al. examined safety perceptions among vulnerable road users interacting with AVs. Their findings highlighted gender differences, with females feeling less safe around AVs than males ____.

Hilgarter et al. explored public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and perceived passenger safety after riding an autonomous shuttle in Carinthia, Austria, through interviews with 19 participants ____.

Othman et al. conducted a literature review to examine survey papers on public perceptions of autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on how safety, ethics, liability, and regulations impact AV acceptance ____.

Thomas et al. explored public perceptions of the benefits and challenges of autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on sociodemographic factors and acceptance at both individual and societal levels through an online survey ____.

Ari et al. found that social influences and enjoyment were the most significant predictors of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness ____.

Samadzad et al. highlighted that perceived usefulness, trust, and subjective norms are key factors shaping the adoption and willingness to use shared e-scooters ____.

Javadinasr et al. focused on factors driving the continuous use of e-scooters in Chicago, showing that perceived usefulness is the most influential factor, followed by perceived reliability ____.

Despite significant research on the adoption of regular e-scooters, no studies, to the best of our knowledge, have specifically examined the willingness to use AI-assisted e-scooters. Key questions remain unresolved, such as identifying the profiles of individuals who prefer AI-assisted e-scooters over regular ones and uncovering the factors that influence the willingness to adopt this new system ____.

She et al. identified barriers to the widespread adoption of electric scooters and found that younger individuals showed more positive attitudes toward using them compared to older generations ____.

Ari et al. ____ found that social influences and enjoyment were the most significant predictors of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness ____.

Erkan and Ari ____ highlighted how various factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental concerns, lack of appropriate infrastructure. performance, social impact, and safety problems for electric scooter user affect people's attitudes towards using electric scooters ____.

Christoforou et al. conducted a survey study in Paris, France, revealing that most e-scooter users are male, aged between 18 and 29, possess a high level of education, and are less likely to own their own e-scoooter ____.

Nikiforiadis et al. ____ examined shared e-scooter usage in Thessaloniki, Greece, and found that females were less inclined to use e-scooters compared to males.

Almanaa et al. ____ in Saudi Arabia indicated that males are more likely to use e-scooters than females, with the majority of potential users falling within the 18 to 45 age range ____.

Teixeira et al. ____ conducted a survey across five European capital cities to explore the barriers preventing non-users from adopting e-scooters. The results implied that these obstacles are largely external and infrastructural, including the convenience of alternative transport modes, safety concerns about riding in traffic and inadequate road conditions ____.

Ari et al. ____ found that social influences and enjoyment were the most significant predictors of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness ____.

Samadzad et al. ____ highlighted that perceived usefulness, trust, and subjective norms are key factors shaping the adoption and willingness to use shared e-scooters ____.

Javadinasr et al. ____ focused on factors driving the continuous use of e-scooters in Chicago, showing that perceived usefulness is the most influential factor, followed by perceived reliability ____.

She et al. ____ identified barriers to the widespread adoption of electric scooters and found that younger individuals showed more positive attitudes toward using them compared to older generations ____.

Erkan and Ari ____ highlighted how various factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, environmental concerns, lack of appropriate infrastructure. performance, social impact, and safety problems for electric scooter user affect people's attitudes towards using electric scooters ____
