\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
This paper has introduced an automated LPV model conversion approach for nonlinear dynamical systems
together with discussing its implementation in the \textsc{LPVcore} toolbox and demonstrating its  capabilities via simulation and controller design examples. Compared to other LPV model conversion approaches, the key difference is that the proposed method achieves an automated LPV embedding without any approximation or need for exploring combinatorial options in the substitution or conversion of nonlinear terms, providing a readily usable solution for practical LPV modeling problems. The \textsc{LPVcore} toolbox is freely available on \url{www.lpvcore.net}, and the examples used in Section~\ref{sec:examples} can be found in \url{https://gitlab.com/Javi-Olucha/lpvs25-code-repo}.
