abstract = {Context:
Social debt describes the accumulation of unforeseen project costs (or potential costs) from sub-optimal software development processes. Community smells are sociotechnical anti-patterns and one source of social debt. Because community smells impact software teams, development processes, outcomes, and organizations, we to understand their impact on software engineering.
Objective:
To provide an overview of community smells in social debt, based on published literature, and describe future research.
Method:
We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify properties, understand origins and evolution, and describe the emergence of community smells. This SLR explains the impact of community smells on teamwork and team performance.
Results:
We include 25 studies. Social debt describes the impacts of poor socio-technical decisions on work environments, people, software products, and society. For each of the 30 community smells identified as sources of social debt, we provide a detailed description, management approaches, organizational strategies, and mitigation effectiveness. We identify five groups of management approaches: organizational strategies, frameworks, models, tools, and guidelines. We describe 11 common properties of community smells. We develop the Community Smell Stages Framework to concisely describe the origin and evolution of community smells. We then describe the causes and effects for each community smell. We identify and describe 8 types of causes and 11 types of effects related to the community smells. Finally, we provide 8 comprehensive Sankey diagrams that offer insights into threats the community smells pose to teamwork factors and team performance.
Conclusion:
Community smells explain the influence work conditions have on software developers. The literature is scarce and focuses on a small number of community smells. Thus, the community smells still need more research. This review helps by organizing the state of the art about community smells. Our contributions provide motivations for future research and provide educational material for software engineering professionals.}

abstract="Many see retrospectives as the most important practice of agile software development. Previous studies of retrospectives have focused on process and outcome at team level. In this article, we study how a large-scale agile development project uses retrospectives through an analysis of retrospective reports identifying a total of 109 issues and 36 action items as a part of a longitudinal case study. We find that most of the issues identified relate to team-level learning and improvement, and discuss these findings in relation to current advice to improve learning outcome in large-scale agile development.",

abstract = {Programmers are living in an age of accelerated change. State of the art technology that was employed to facilitate projects a few years ago are typically obsolete today. Presently, there are requirements for higher quality software with less tolerance for errors, produced in compressed timelines with fewer people. Therefore, project success is more elusive than ever and is contingent upon many key aspects. One of the most crucial aspects is social factors. These social factors, such as knowledge sharing. motivation, and customer collaboration, can be addressed through agile practices. This paper will demonstrate two successful industrial software projects which are different in all aspects; however, both still apply agile practices to address social factors. The readers will see how agile practices in both projects were adapted to fit each unique team environment. The paper will also provide lessons learned and recommendations based on retrospective reviews and observations. These recommendations can lead to an improved chance of success in a software development project.},

abstract="Large-scale agile projects bring inter-teams interaction challenges. Teams need to be autonomous, but often crosscutting concerns affect many teams. If the teams fail to collaborate on these concerns, the negative effects might hinder agility in the medium and long term. In other words, the organization and the system accumulate debt, on which the teams pay a high interest. Such debt must therefore be prioritized and ``repaid'' timely. We conducted a case study with interviews, observations and document analysis. Via both team- and large-scale retrospectives we investigated how teams coordinate and discuss Technical-, Social- and Process Debts.",
