\subsection{Limitations}

    Like all particle-based methods, our MDPS suffers from the \emph{curse of dimensionality}~\cite{bellman1957dynamic} where particle sparsity increases as the dimension of the state space increases, reducing expressiveness of state posteriors. More effective use of particles via smarter dynamics and measurement models, as enabled by end-to-end MDPS training, can reduce but not eliminate these challenges.
