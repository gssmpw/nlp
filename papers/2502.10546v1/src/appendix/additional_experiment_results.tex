\section{Additional Experiment Results}

    In this section we give additional experiment results for the global localization task on the MGL~\cite{sarlin2023orienternet} and KITTI \cite{Geiger2013IJRRKitti} datasets.

        \caption{\small{Additional example trajectories from the MGL dataset with observations shown in the top row. We show the current true state and state history (black arrow and black line), the estimated posterior density of the current state (red cloud, with darker being higher probability) and the the top 3 extracted modes (blue arrows) for each method. By using the full sequence of observations and actions when computing state posteriors, MDPS is able to estimate a more accurate and tighter posterior than the forward or backward MDPFs.}}
