   abstract = {Despite extensive proliferation of social media in different domains, higher education academics’ use of social media remains unclear. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by providing a scoping review, covering the last five years of extant literature. It compiles and analyses previous empirical studies concerning academics’ usage of social media, the benefits of social media for academics, and the challenges and barriers that academics face when using or considering using social media. The review of twenty-four published articles shows that not all academics currently use social media and those who do, tend to use it for research dissemination and personal reasons, mostly career and network development. Many academics do not use social media for teaching, mostly due to a lack of awareness, skill and confidence in using this emerging technology. Despite this limited use of social media by academics, social media provides clear benefits for career development, research and teaching, including: improved communication with various stakeholders, increased opportunities and contacts, and increased student learning and satisfaction. This review is intended as a timely introduction to current thinking about the usage of social media by higher education academics globally. By outlining the status quo in this under-researched field, it informs and becomes a useful basis for further research and highlights the need for academics to become more aware of, and accustomed to, using social media in their professional lives, not only for research and career development purposes, but – most importantly – also for learning and teaching.},

The site aims to foster new forms of social and participatory practices (peer critiquing, sharing, user-generated content, aggregation, and personalisation) within an educational context. One of the key challenges in the development of the site has been to understand the user interactions and the changing patterns of user behaviour as it evolves. The paper explores the extent to which four frameworks that have been used in researching networked learning contexts can provide insights into the patterns of user behaviour that we see in Cloudworks.

ABSTRACT = {The recommendation algorithm is a very important and challenging issue for a personal recommender system. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm is one of the most popular and effective recommendation algorithms. However, the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm does not fully consider the impact of popular items and user characteristics on the recommendation results. To solve these problems, an improved collaborative filtering algorithm is proposed, which is based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method and user characteristics. In the proposed algorithm, an improved TF-IDF method is used to calculate the user similarity on the basis of rating data first. Secondly, the multi-dimensional characteristics information of users is used to calculate the user similarity by a fuzzy membership method. Then, the above two user similarities are fused based on an adaptive weighted algorithm. Finally, some experiments are conducted on the movie public data set, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than that of the state of the art.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the research trends that link the advanced technical aspects of recommendation systems that are used in various service areas and the business aspects of these services. First, for a reliable analysis of recommendation models for recommendation systems, data mining technology, and related research by application service, more than 135 top-ranking articles and top-tier conferences published in Google Scholar between 2010 and 2021 were collected and reviewed. Based on this, studies on recommendation system models and the technology used in recommendation systems were systematized, and research trends by year were analyzed. In addition, the application service fields where recommendation systems were used were classified, and research on the recommendation system model and recommendation technique used in each field was analyzed. Furthermore, vast amounts of application service-related data used by recommendation systems were collected from 2010 to 2021 without taking the journal ranking into consideration and reviewed along with various recommendation system studies, as well as applied service field industry data. As a result of this study, it was found that the flow and quantitative growth of various detailed studies of recommendation systems interact with the business growth of the actual applied service field. While providing a comprehensive summary of recommendation systems, this study provides insight to many researchers interested in recommendation systems through the analysis of its various technologies and trends in the service field to which recommendation systems are applied.},

   abstract = {Content-Based Recommendation Systems suggest items (e.g., articles, products, objects, services, or places) that are relevant to the user based on the features describing the items. In many content-based recommendation systems we can find, along with discrete attributes, textual features (e.g., text summaries or comments) obtained from web pages, news articles, etc. Traditionally, to enable its exploitation, the textual information of items is represented by using basic information retrieval models (such as the vector space model), which do not take into account natural language challenges involving the semantics of the words (synonymy, polysemy and hiperonymy, etc.) or language understanding. Other solutions try to exploit those semantics. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation where we compare several recommendation approaches, including a content-based recommender based on vector space models, a deep learning and content-based recommendation approach, and a semantic-aware content-based recommendation model. This last approach exploits textual features of items obtained from the Linked Open Data (LOD) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for language modelling. Deep Learning transformers are achieving good results in different NLP (Natural Language Processing) problems, but using them to build content-based recommendation systems has not been explored in depth so far. Our experimental results, focused on the domain of movie recommendations, show that a approach based on the use of BERT can provide good results if enough training data are available.},

This paper presents an independent, novel analysis of a large-scale dataset published by Nature Publishing Group detailing the results of a survey about academics use of online social networking services. An open coding approach was used to analyse 480 previously unused text responses. The analysis revealed a wide range of benefits and also problems associated with engaging with online networking, and tensions within this. The analysis provides further insight into the nuances of uptake, by exploring clusters of co-reported benefits and problems within the qualitative analysis. The findings will help move forward current debates surrounding social media use by academics from being viewed in solely beneficial terms, towards an understanding of the problems and tensions that arise through academic work online.},

Therefore, we propose a HyReB (Hybrid Recommendation algorithm combining BERT and CNN network). The algorithm HyReB uses the BERT word vector as the input of the CNN network and incorporates external semantic information in features extraction and topic classification. Then we combine BERT and TextRank algorithms to extract text keywords and calculate the BERT word vector similarity of topic word. Finally, we do the weighted calculation of the label proportion of the recommended text and the similarity of the topic word vector to make the text top-N recommendation. The HyReB algorithm makes user interest extraction more refined and incorporates BERT semantic information into the text recommendation. Experiments show that the feature extraction of HyReB is more accurate and has a better recommendation effect when performing small-scale accurate text recommendation.},

This study aimed to assess awareness and use of Academic Social Network Tools (ASNTs) among Nigerian academics. A cross-sectional survey of 100 randomly sampled Nigerian academics was carried out. A two-section structured questionnaire which sought information on demographic profile, familiarity and use of ASNTs, and perceptions on usefulness and barriers to integrating ASNTs was used for data collection. Most of the respondents were aware of ResearchGate (97%), Academia.edu (96%), Facebook (94%) and Twitter (94%) as ASNT. The most visited ASNT were Facebook (36%) and Twitter (28%). ASNT were used for sharing of research content to other academics (32%) and for making research profile highly visible globally (24%). Most respondents (76%) perceived ASNT as highly beneficial, but busy work schedules (12%) and problematic internet connections (12%) mostly inhibit their usage. Less than 50% of the academics had moderate to high levels of awareness and use of ASNT, and junior rank and younger academics had significantly higher ASNT awareness and utilization rates. There was significant association between use of ASNT and academic ranks, but none with age, sex and educational level. Nigerian academics utilized ASNTs, especially ResearchGate to share research content to other academics, make academic research profile highly visible globally. These academics have positive perception about ASNTs but it has bias towards their academic ranks.},

The concept of academic social networks is created precisely in the context of scholarly big data, which refers to the complicated academic network formed by academic entities and their relationships. There are a wealth of scholarly big data processing methods to analyze the rich structural types and related information about academic social networks. Nowadays, various academic data can be easily obtained, which makes it easier for us to analyze and study academic social networks. This study investigates the background, the current status, and trends of academic social networks. We first elaborate on the concept of academic social networks and related research background. Secondly, we analyze models based on nodes’ types and timeliness. Thirdly, we review analytical methods, including relevant metrics, network properties, and available academic analysis tools. Furthermore, we sort out some key mining technologies for academic social networks. Finally, we systematically review representative research tasks in this domain from three levels: actor, relationship, and network. In addition, some academic social networking sites are presented. This survey concludes with the current challenges and open issues.},

A well-designed scholarly recommender significantly saves the time of researchers and can provide information that would not otherwise be considered. The usefulness of scholarly recommendations, especially literature recommendations, has been established by the widespread acceptance of web search engines such as CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. This article discusses different aspects and developments of scholarly recommendation systems. We searched the ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEE Explorer, and Scopus for publications in the domain of scholarly recommendations for literature, collaborators, reviewers, conferences and journals, datasets, and grant funding. In total, 225 publications were identified in these areas. We discuss methodologies used to develop scholarly recommender systems. Content-based filtering is the most commonly applied technique, whereas collaborative filtering is more popular among conference recommenders. The implementation of deep learning algorithms in scholarly recommendation systems is rare among the screened publications. We found fewer publications in the areas of the dataset and grant funding recommenders than in other areas. Furthermore, studies analyzing users’ feedback to improve scholarly recommendation systems are rare for recommenders. This survey provides background knowledge regarding existing research on scholarly recommenders and aids in developing future recommendation systems in this domain.},

It recommends a suitable engineering department among seven engineering departments for each student based on his academic performance. The data of each department (i.e. educational program) is fed to the recommendation system. Then, the relevant set of features for each department is selected and a machine learning algorithm with the best performance is selected for the recommendation process of each department. The obtained results showed that the proposed model recommends the best machine learning algorithm (i.e. model) for each faculty department, find the relevant data that are important in the recommendation process and recommend the student with the suitable engineering department(s) with high accuracy.},
