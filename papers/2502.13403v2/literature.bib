abstract="The cortex is organized as a hierarchical processing structure. Feedback from  higher levels of the hierarchy, known as top-down signals, have been shown to be  involved in attentional and contextual modulation of sensory responses. Here we  argue that top-down input to the primary visual cortex (V1) from A24b and the  adjacent secondary motor cortex (M2) signals a prediction of visual flow based on  motor output. A24b/M2 sends a dense and topographically organized projection to  V1 that targets most neurons in layer 2/3. By imaging the activity of A24b/M2  axons in V1 of mice learning to navigate a 2D virtual environment, we found that  their activity was strongly correlated with locomotion and resulting visual flow  feedback in an experience-dependent manner. When mice were trained to navigate a  left-right inverted virtual environment, correlations of neural activity with  behavior reversed to match visual flow. These findings are consistent with a  predictive coding interpretation of visual processing.",

Studies in anesthetized animals have suggested that activity in early visual cortex is mainly driven by visual input and is well described by a feedforward processing hierarchy. However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.}

abstract = {Summary
Processing in cortical circuits is driven by combinations of cortical and subcortical inputs. These inputs are often conceptually categorized as bottom-up, conveying sensory information, and top-down, conveying contextual information. Using intracellular recordings in mouse primary visual cortex, we measured neuronal responses to visual input, locomotion, and visuomotor mismatches. We show that layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons compute a difference between top-down motor-related input and bottom-up visual flow input. Most L2/3 neurons responded to visuomotor mismatch with either hyperpolarization or depolarization, and the size of this response was correlated with distinct physiological properties. Consistent with a subtraction of bottom-up and top-down input, visual and motor-related inputs had opposing influence on L2/3 neurons. In infragranular neurons, we found no evidence of a difference computation and responses were consistent with positive integration of visuomotor inputs. Our results provide evidence that L2/3 functions as a bidirectional comparator of top-down and bottom-up input.}

The aim of this work is to provide a comment on a recent paper by Muzzu and Saleem (2021), which claims that visuomotor mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex can be explained by a locomotion-induced gain of visual halt responses. Our primary concern is that without directly comparing these responses with mismatch responses, the claim that one response can explain the other appears difficult to uphold, more so because previous work finds that a uniform locomotion-induced gain cannot explain mismatch responses. To support these arguments, we analyze layer 2/3 calcium imaging datasets and show that coupling between visual flow and locomotion greatly enhances mismatch responses in an experience-dependent manner compared with halts in non-coupled visual flow. This is consistent with mismatch responses representing visuomotor prediction errors. Thus, we conclude that while feature selectivity might contribute to mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex, it cannot explain these responses.}

abstract = {Summary
The brain’s response to sensory input is strikingly modulated by behavioral state. Notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. The neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. In vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive neurons in mouse V1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. Optogenetic activation of VIP neurons increased V1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of VIP neurons abolished the enhancement of V1 responses by locomotion. These findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state.}

abstract = {Summary
Sensory experience often depends on one’s own actions, including self-motion. Theories of predictive coding postulate that actions are regulated by calculating prediction error, which is the difference between sensory experience and expectation based on self-generated actions. Signals consistent with prediction error have been reported in the mouse visual cortex (V1) when visual flow coupled to running was unexpectedly stopped. Here, we show that such signals can be elicited by visual stimuli uncoupled to an animal running. We record V1 neurons while presenting drifting gratings that unexpectedly stop. We find strong responses to visual perturbations, which are enhanced during running. Perturbation responses are strongest in the preferred orientation of individual neurons, and perturbation-responsive neurons are more likely to prefer slow visual speeds. Our results indicate that prediction error signals can be explained by the convergence of known motor and sensory signals, providing a purely sensory and motor explanation for purported mismatch signals.}

In this review, I provide an introduction to some of the key concepts in population coding and describe several studies in the recent literature. The focus of this review is on sensory representation in the visual cortex and related perceptual decisions. The frameworks used to study population coding include population vectors, linear decoders, and Bayesian inference. Simple examples are provided to illustrate these concepts. Testing theories of population coding is an emerging subject in systems neuroscience, but advances in multi-neuronal recording and analysis suggest that an understanding is within reach.},

Saccades are rapid eye movements that shift the image on the retina. How visual systems differentiate motion of the image induced by saccades from actual motion in the environment is not fully understood2. Here we discovered that in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) the two types of motion evoke distinct activity patterns. This is because, during saccades, V1 combines the visual input with a strong non-visual input arriving from the thalamic pulvinar nucleus. The non-visual input triggers responses that are specific to the direction of the saccade and the visual input triggers responses that are specific to the direction of the shift of the stimulus on the retina, yet the preferred directions of these two responses are uncorrelated. Thus, the pulvinar input ensures differential V1 responses to external and self-generated motion. Integration of external sensory information with information about body movement may be a general mechanism for sensory cortices to distinguish between self-generated and external stimuli.},

Neurons were assigned to classes on the basis of their somadendritic morphology as revealed by intracellular HRP injection. The electrophysiological features of each class are compared in the following paper (Mason and Larkman, 1990). Coronal slices were prepared from the visual cortex of the albino rat and maintained in vitro. Pyramidal neurons from layers 2/3 and 5 were impaled with electrodes containing HRP. After intracellular recording, the cells were injected, reacted to visualize the enzyme, and examined in the light microscope. The 18 neurons from layer 2/3 showed an underlying similarity of somadendritic morphology and were considered to constitute a single cell class, although some features varied with the depth of the soma in the cortex. The 22 layer 5 cells were more diverse and were divided into 2 main classes. Eleven cells had single, thick apical trunks which ascended to close to the layer 1 border then branched to form a terminal arbor. These cells were termed thick layer 5 cells, and were found mainly in the upper part of the layer. Ten layer 5 cells had single apical trunks which tapered to a fine diameter and terminated, without forming an obvious terminal arbor, near the top of layer 4 (3 cells) or in layer 2/3 (7 cells). These cells were termed slender layer 5 cells and were found throughout the layer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Towards this goal, we combined spatially precise optogenetic stimulation with multicellular recording to deeply characterize intralaminar and translaminar monosynaptic connections to supragranular (L2/3) neurons in the mouse visual cortex. The reliability and specificity of multiphoton optogenetic stimulation were measured across multiple Cre lines, and measurements of connectivity were verified by comparison to paired recordings and targeted patching of optically identified presynaptic cells. With a focus on translaminar pathways, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from genetically defined presynaptic populations were characterized by their relative abundance, spatial profiles, strength, and short-term dynamics. Consistent with the canonical cortical microcircuit, layer 4 excitatory neurons and interneurons within L2/3 represented the most common sources of input to L2/3 pyramidal cells. More surprisingly, we also observed strong excitatory connections from layer 5 intratelencephalic neurons and potent translaminar inhibition from multiple interneuron subclasses. The hybrid approach revealed convergence to and divergence from excitatory and inhibitory neurons within and across cortical layers. Divergent excitatory connections often spanned hundreds of microns of horizontal space. In contrast, divergent inhibitory connections were more frequently measured from postsynaptic targets near each other.},

	abstract = {When we learn a new motor skill, such as playing an approaching tennis ball, both our sensors and the task possess variability. Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate1,2,3,4. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory5,6, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities---the prior---with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process4,5. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.},

For the perception of spatial arrangements, this article demonstrates that this concept can be realized in a mobile robot. The robot first learned to predict how its visual input changes under movement commands. With this ability, two perceptual tasks could be solved: judging the distance to an obstacle in front by ‘mentally’ simulating a movement toward the obstacle, and recognizing a dead end by simulating either an obstacle-avoidance algorithm or a recursive search for an exit. A simulated movement contained a series of prediction steps. In each step, a multilayer perceptron anticipated the next image, which, however, became increasingly noisy. To denoise an image, it was split into patches, and each patch was projected onto a manifold obtained by modelling the density of the distribution of training patches with a mixture of Gaussian functions.}

  author   = "Polsky, Alon and Mel, Bartlett W and Schiller, Jackie",
  abstract = "The thin basal and oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal
              neurons receive most of the synaptic inputs from other cells, but
              their integrative properties remain uncertain. Previous studies
              have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An
              alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies,
              holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent
              computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs
              prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we
              combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic
              stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical
              pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch
              summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to
              different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial
              compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global
              summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a
              two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch
              integration. Our findings could have important implications for
              the computing and memory-related functions of cortical tissue.",
