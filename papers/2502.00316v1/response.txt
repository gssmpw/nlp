The technical literature on metaheuristics is vast, e.g., see **Glover and Laguna, "Tabu Search"** for
overviews.

Variable depth search was proposed by Kernighan and Lin and used in **Kernighan and Lin, "A Efficient Heuristic Procedure for Partitioning Electronic Circuits"** for graph partitioning and in **Barnes, "Some efficient Algorithms for Finding a Shortest Path Through a Graph"** for
traveling salesman problem. In the latter reference, the variable
depth search is introduced as ``a general approach to heuristics that
we believe to be of wide applicability,'' and its ``considerable
success'' with graph partitioning, citing the former reference, is
also celebrated. It is interesting that it took almost two decades for
variable depth search mechanism to be used for problems other than
these two.

The complexity of finding good solutions using local search
techniques, including the KL and LK algorithms, is explored in **Hochbaum, "Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems"** under a new complexity class called
``polynomial local search'' (PLS).

Early references recognizing the benefits of variable depth search
include **Glover and Laguna, "Tabu Search"** and **Taillard, "Some Experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem with Constrained Optimization"** as a part of very-large
neighborhood search techniques, **Vidal, "A Survey on Metaheuristics for Logistics Problems"** as part of the
iterated local search metaheuristic, **Crainic and Perreur, "Local Search in Combinatorial Optimisation"** as a special case
of the cyclic transfers metaheuristic, **Hansen et al., "Basic Algorithms for Local Search"** as a special case
of the ejection chains metaheuristic, **Vidal and Crainic, "A General View of Distributed Metaheuristics"** and **Crainic and Toulouse, "Parallel Iterated Neighborhood Search"** to
improve the performance of genetic algorithms.

Papers related to this work include the short survey of applications
in **Kernighan and Lin, "An Efficient Heuristic Procedure for Partitioning Electronic Circuits"**, the applications in **Barnes, "Some efficient Algorithms for Finding a Shortest Path Through a Graph"** and **Barnes et al., "Computational Methods for Solving Large-Scale Traveling Salesman Problem Instances"**, and the applications
to the vehicle routing problems in **Toth and Vigo, "Vehicle Routing Problems"**, the
quadratic assignment problem in **Crespo and Goldengorin, "The Quadratic Assignment Problem with Variable Depth Search"** and more recently in **Crespo et al., "A New Heuristic for the Quadratic Assignment Problem"**, the maximum clique problem in
**Hochbaum, "Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems"**, and nurse rostering in **Burke et al., "Variable Depth Search for Nurse Rostering"**.

Given this paper was originally published in 1995, it may also be
considered as an early reference for the variable depth search
mechanism and its general applications.

For further study, interested readers should consult these references
together with a huge number of references available on Arxiv, Google
Scholar, and generic search engines. A search query containing the
phrase ``variable depth search'' can help filter irrelevant results.
