The technical literature on metaheuristics is vast, e.g., see
____ for
overviews.

Variable depth search was proposed by Kernighan and Lin and used in
____ for graph partitioning and in ____ for
traveling salesman problem. In the latter reference, the variable
depth search is introduced as ``a general approach to heuristics that
we believe to be of wide applicability,'' and its ``considerable
success'' with graph partitioning, citing the former reference, is
also celebrated. It is interesting that it took almost two decades for
variable depth search mechanism to be used for problems other than
these two.

The complexity of finding good solutions using local search
techniques, including the KL and LK algorithms, is explored in
____ under a new complexity class called
``polynomial local search'' (PLS).

Early references recognizing the benefits of variable depth search
include ____ and ____ as a part of very-large
neighborhood search techniques, ____ as part of the
iterated local search metaheuristic, ____ as a special case
of the cyclic transfers metaheuristic, ____ as a special case
of the ejection chains metaheuristic, ____ and ____ to
improve the performance of genetic algorithms.

Papers related to this work include the short survey of applications
in ____, the applications in ____ and ____
to improve the performance of genetic algorithms, and the applications
to the vehicle routing problems in ____, the
quadratic assignment problem in ____ and more recently in
____, the maximum clique problem in
____, and nurse rostering in ____.

Given this paper was originally published in 1995, it may also be
considered as an early reference for the variable depth search
mechanism and its general applications.

For further study, interested readers should consult these references
together with a huge number of references available on Arxiv, Google
Scholar, and generic search engines. A search query containing the
phrase ``variable depth search'' can help filter irrelevant results.
