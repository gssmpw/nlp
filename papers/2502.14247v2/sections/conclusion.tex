\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we present Pandora3D, a framework designed for high-quality 3D shape and texture generation. 3D shape generation and texture generation are proposed in Pandora3D. In specific, the 3D shape generation utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space; then, a diffusion network is used to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications aimed at enhancing the model's capacity. Meanwhile, we also explore an alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach, which shows promising results for simpler geometries. The texture generation process is multi-staged, starting with the generation of frontal images, followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A novel consistency scheduler is integrated into every stage of this process to ensure pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, leading to seamless integration. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of Pandora3D handling of diverse input formats to produce high-quality 3D content.
