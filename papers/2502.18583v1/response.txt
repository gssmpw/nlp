\paragraph{Cultural Knowledge Bases.} 
Recent interest regarding cultural-knowledge in foundation models has led to numerous studies attempting to quantify it **Vaswani, "Attention Is All You Need"**__. Some studies construct multilingual knowledge bases of cultural assertions (e.g., \textit{\say{In Bhutan, there is a tradition of wearing "Khyenkhor Robes" woven with threads infused with blessings from Buddhist monks}}) **Devlin, "Bert: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**__. Other works craft benchmarks of culturally-specific questions (e.g., \textit{\say{What is the story of the series Al-Manassa?}}) **Kumar, "AskMe: A Large-Scale Question Answering Dataset"**__. Further research expands on such directions to support multimodality **Devlin, "Bert: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**__. There are also additional studies which focus exclusively on vision-based tasks such as culturally informed image generation ____, visually grounded reasoning ____, and image transcreation ____. While some of these works include food as part of their overall assessment, they mainly focus on broad cultural understanding. Meanwhile, we offer a more in-depth analysis on the nuances of cultural \textit{food} knowledge.

\paragraph{Cultural Food Knowledge.}
Food knowledge is a key element of culture, and is thus frequently evaluated in foundation models. Some studies assess model comprehension of culinary practices or dishes through pragmatic questioning (e.g., "\textit{While eating, when does one drink Cantonese seafood soup?}") **Miao, "Multimodal Emotion Recognition"**__. Another line of reasoning uses food to attribute cultural generations to pretraining data ___. Finally, a group of works measures food culture understanding in foundation models by testing them on a culturally diverse set of food-dish entities. However, the food-dishes used for evaluating models in past work are obtained solely from either Wikidata ____ or Wikipedia ____, which we show leads to missing out on many culture-specific dishes in non-English languages (\S\ref{subsec:wikidata}). For example, the food-dishes originating from Russia and Ukraine in the resource constructed by **Kolesnikova, "Multilingual Language Models for Multitask Learning"** cover only 20.8\% of the dishes originating from Russia and Ukraine that we provide in \benchmarkname{}.

Culturally relevant bootstrapped dishes are both common and long-tail, while Wikidata dishes are less frequent overall. \textbf{(b)} Countries of origin of dishes in \benchmarkname{}, which were obtained from multilingual Wikidata  (\S\ref{subsec:wikidata}) and commonly used web-crawled corpora (\S\ref{subsec:bootstrapping}). While there are less bootstrapped dishes, they are more likely to originate from a Post-Soviet nation.

\paragraph{Russian and Ukrainian Culture in LLMs.} 
Existing cultural studies on the Russian language in foundation models focus predominantly on social and gender biases **Bender, "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots"**__. Additionally, **Goldfarb, "Cultural Values and Foundation Models"** explores cultural values of foundation models in Ukrainian, among other languages. Limited attention is given to cultural knowledge exploration in Russian and Ukrainian. From our understanding, our study is the first to explore cultural food knowledge in foundation models tailored to either one of these languages.
