    abstract = "As the reach of large language models (LMs) expands globally, their ability to cater to diverse cultural contexts becomes crucial. Despite advancements in multilingual capabilities, models are not designed with appropriate cultural nuances. In this paper, we show that multilingual and Arabic monolingual LMs exhibit bias towards entities associated with Western culture. We introduce CAMeL, a novel resource of 628 naturally-occurring prompts and 20,368 entities spanning eight types that contrast Arab and Western cultures. CAMeL provides a foundation for measuring cultural biases in LMs through both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations. Using CAMeL, we examine the cross-cultural performance in Arabic of 16 different LMs on tasks such as story generation, NER, and sentiment analysis, where we find concerning cases of stereotyping and cultural unfairness. We further test their text-infilling performance, revealing the incapability of appropriate adaptation to Arab cultural contexts. Finally, we analyze 6 Arabic pre-training corpora and find that commonly used sources such as Wikipedia may not be best suited to build culturally aware LMs, if used as they are without adjustment. We will make CAMeL publicly available at: https://github.com/tareknaous/camel",

Our work develops new methods to (1) measure media biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings which reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and media biases into misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.",

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding abilities, and have excelled in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite the fact that most LLMs are trained predominantly on English, multiple studies have demonstrated their capabilities in a variety of languages. However, fundamental questions persist regarding how LLMs acquire their multilingual abilities and how performance varies across different languages. These inquiries are crucial for the study of LLMs since users and researchers often come from diverse language backgrounds, potentially influencing how they use LLMs and interpret their output. In this work, we propose a systematic way of qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. We investigate the phenomenon of cross-language generalization in LLMs, wherein limited multilingual training data leads to advanced multilingual capabilities. To accomplish this, we employ a novel prompt back-translation method. The results demonstrate that LLMs, such as GPT, can effectively transfer learned knowledge across different languages, yielding relatively consistent results in translation-equivariant tasks, in which the correct output does not depend on the language of the input. However, LLMs struggle to provide accurate results in translation-variant tasks, which lack this property, requiring careful user judgment to evaluate the answers.",

LLMs often provide inappropriate English-culture-related answers that are not relevant to the expected culture when users ask in non-English languages. To systematically evaluate the cultural dominance issue, we build a benchmark of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects. Empirical results show that the representative GPT models suffer from the culture dominance problem, where GPT-4 is the most affected while text-davinci-003 suffers the least from this problem. Our study emphasizes the need to critically examine cultural dominance and ethical considerations in their development and deployment. We show that two straightforward methods in model development (i.e., pretraining on more diverse data) and deployment (e.g., culture-aware prompting) can significantly mitigate the cultural dominance issue in LLMs.",

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial commonsense understanding through numerous benchmark evaluations. However, their understanding of cultural commonsense remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the capabilities and limitations of several state-of-the-art LLMs in the context of cultural commonsense tasks. Using several general and cultural commonsense benchmarks, we find that (1) LLMs have a significant discrepancy in performance when tested on culture-specific commonsense knowledge for different cultures; (2) LLMs{'} general commonsense capability is affected by cultural context; and (3) The language used to query the LLMs can impact their performance on cultural-related tasks.Our study points to the inherent bias in the cultural understanding of LLMs and provides insights that can help develop culturally-aware language models.",

    abstract = "Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing *constrained* evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic *unconstrained* evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT *forces models to comply with the PCT{'}s multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs.",

By simply asking the LLM for an answer, or {``}prompting,{''} practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get a response for an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of decisions by the practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to requesting the output in a certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that address more sensitive topics. In this work, we ask: do variations in the way a prompt is constructed change the ultimate decision of the LLM? We answer this using a series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks. We find that even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that requesting responses in XML and commonly used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic effects on the data labeled by LLMs.",

Our grammars consist of constraints that are assigned numerical weights according to the principle of maximum entropy. The grammars assess possible words on the basis of the weighted sum of their constraint violations. The learning algorithm yields grammars that can capture both categorical and gradient phonotactic patterns. The algorithm is not provided with constraints in advance, but uses its own resources to form constraints and weight them. A baseline model, in which Universal Grammar is reduced to a feature set and an SPE-style constraint format, suffices to learn many phonotactic phenomena. In order for the model to learn nonlocal phenomena such as stress and vowel harmony, it must be augmented with autosegmental tiers and metrical grids. Our results thus offer novel, learning-theoretic support for such representations. We apply the model in a variety of learning simulations, showing that the learned grammars capture the distributional generalizations of these languages and accurately predict the findings of a phonotactic experiment.}",

abstract="There are several concepts in Ukrainian sociolinguistics that seem to be better off classified as spooky, scary terms. Among them are iazychie and surzhyk1 referring to linguistic hybrids routinely castigated in both public and scholarly discourse in today's Ukraine. To take iazychie as defined in the Encyclopedia of the Ukrainian Language, published by the O. Potebnia Institute of Linguistics jointly with the Institute of the Ukrainian Language of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, it is conceived of as `an artificial bookish language', based on Old Church Slavonic and western Ukrainian dialects. At the time of the formation of literary Ukrainian on vernacular foundations in the nineteenth century, the use of this mix was allegedly anachronistic, thus hindering the development of language norms (Muromtseva 2000: 745). The term surzhyk refers to modern vernacular Ukrainian, permeated with `unmotivated' Russian elements (borrowed as a result of heavy Ukrainian-Russian interference); to fight against this mix might be one of the major goals in the fostering of the norms of the Ukrainian language (Lenets' 2000: 616).",

A key example is recipe adaptation, which goes beyond simple translation to include a grasp of ingredients, culinary techniques, and dietary preferences specific to a given culture. We introduce a new task involving the translation and cultural adaptation of recipes between Chinese- and English-speaking cuisines. To support this investigation, we present CulturalRecipes, a unique dataset composed of automatically paired recipes written in Mandarin Chinese and English. This dataset is further enriched with a human-written and curated test set. In this intricate task of cross-cultural recipe adaptation, we evaluate the performance of various methods, including GPT-4 and other LLMs, traditional machine translation, and information retrieval techniques. Our comprehensive analysis includes both automatic and human evaluation metrics. While GPT-4 exhibits impressive abilities in adapting Chinese recipes into English, it still lags behind human expertise when translating English recipes into Chinese. This underscores the multifaceted nature of cultural adaptations. We anticipate that these insights will significantly contribute to future research on culturally aware language models and their practical application in culturally diverse contexts.}",

abstract="In this chapter, we review literature on cultural mapping that has served as the intellectual underpinnings of the Culture {\&} Communities Mapping Project, beginning with indigenous counter-mapping in Canada, largely considered the foundation of cultural mapping. We discuss how the methods and applications of cultural mapping have since expanded to encompass an array of spatial practices for studying cultural identities and the cultural assets of an area, with methods ranging from participatory community asset mapping to the use of online GIS maps to drive cultural policy. This chapter also takes us through some of the major theoretical writings about cartography, drawing on scholars of critical cartography and cultural geography who ask us to read maps as constructed texts or arguments communicating the political context of their creation. We then draw on scholarship that looks at how maps act in the world---at their role as everyday objects or as aesthetic and political expressions. These writings lead us to a series of questions that people can ask to think about their own cultural mapping work---about the choices to make concerning what kinds of information to collect, how participatory the project should be, what materials to use, what the aims ultimately are and how to understand the project's limitations.",

We present RecipeGPT, a novel online recipe generation and evaluation system. The system provides two modes of text generations: (1) instruction generation from given recipe title and ingredients; and (2) ingredient generation from recipe title and cooking instructions. Its back-end text generation module comprises a generative pre-trained language model GPT-2 fine-tuned on a large cooking recipe dataset. Moreover, the recipe evaluation module allows the users to conveniently inspect the quality of the generated recipe contents and store the results for future reference.

Yet even with the correct groundings in the reference, they can ignore them and rely on wrong groundings or their inherent biases to hallucinate when users, being largely unaware of the specifics of the stored information, pose questions that might not directly correlate with the retrieved groundings. In this work, we formulate this knowledge alignment problem and introduce MixAlign, a framework that interacts with both the human user and the knowledge base to obtain and integrate clarifications on how the user question relates to the stored information. MixAlign employs a language model to achieve automatic knowledge alignment and, if necessary, further enhances this alignment through human user clarifications. Experimental results highlight the crucial role of knowledge alignment in boosting model performance and mitigating hallucination, with improvements noted up to 22.2{\%} and 27.1{\%} respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MixAlign in improving knowledge alignment by producing high-quality, user-centered clarifications.",

    abstract = "The cross-cultural adaptation of recipes is an important application of identifying and bridging cultural differences in language. The challenge lies in retaining the essence of the original recipe while also aligning with the writing and dietary habits of the target culture. Information Retrieval (IR) offers a way to address the challenge because it retrieves results from the culinary practices of the target culture while maintaining relevance to the original recipe. We introduce a novel task about cross-cultural recipe retrieval and present a unique Chinese-English cross-cultural recipe retrieval benchmark. Our benchmark is manually annotated under limited resource, utilizing various retrieval models to generate a pool of candidate results for manual annotation. The dataset provides retrieval samples that are culturally adapted but textually diverse, presenting greater challenges. We propose CARROT, a plug-and-play cultural-aware recipe information retrieval framework that incorporates cultural-aware query rewriting and re-ranking methods and evaluate it both on our benchmark and intuitive human judgments. The results show that our framework significantly enhances the preservation of the original recipe and its cultural appropriateness for the target culture. We believe these insights will significantly contribute to future research on cultural adaptation.",

    abstract = { A typology is developed that systematizes the various linguistic phenomena in Ukraine that are commonly referred to as surzhyk‚Äîa Ukrainian term meaning `impure, mixed language'. The term surzhyk has become frequently used in public discourse and the media since Ukrainian was elevated to the status of official state language and Ukraine declared its independence. A heightened purist ideology has led to broad use of the term, which tends to have pejorative connotations. The typology is based on the historical, social, and ideological factors that have shaped language use. Five major categories of surzhyk are defined: (1) urbanized peasant surzhyk, (2) village dialect-surzhyk, (3) Sovietized-Ukrainian surzhyk, (4) urban bilinguals' surzhyk, and (5) post-independence surzhyk. These five prototypes are further characterized according to the typology of bilingualism proposed by Auer (1999), by considering the degree of pragmatic salience and the grammaticalization of language alternation. This case study presents a paradigm for the analysis of mixed languages. }

We observe that none of the studies explicitly define {``}culture, which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of {``}culture{''}. We call these aspects the proxies of culture, and organize them across two dimensions of demographic and semantic proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of {``}culture,{''} such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness of probing techniques and situated studies on the impact of cultural mis- and under-representation in LLM-based applications.",

    abstract = { The study investigates the factors related to Ukrainian nationals‚Äô engagement or disengagement with Russian culture amid Russian-Ukrainian war. It explores the predictors of both continued engagement and reasons for terminating interaction, considering demographic, emotional, and circumstantial factors. A cross-sectional correlational design was used, involving 935 participants (305 continuing and 630 ceasing interaction with Russian culture). Participants completed questionnaires and detailed their engagement with Russian culture across various cultural items. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were conducted for analysis. The study found that factors like spoken language and coping strategies play a significant role in the decision to cut cultural ties. For those continuing interaction, language and emotional attachment were influential, alongside practical necessities like work/study requirements and the absence of Ukrainian alternatives. The study highlights a complex interplay of emotion, language, and age in shaping Ukrainians‚Äô interaction with Russian culture during the war. It suggests future research should include additional sociopolitical and sociocultural factors, and a broader demographic representation to gain more nuanced perspectives. }
