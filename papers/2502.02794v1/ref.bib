abstract = {To find defects in software, one needs test cases that execute the software systematically, and oracles that assess the correctness of the observed behavior when running these test cases. This paper presents EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates test cases with assertions for classes written in Java code. To achieve this, EvoSuite applies a novel hybrid approach that generates and optimizes whole test suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion. For the produced test suites, EvoSuite suggests possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of assertions that concisely summarize the current behavior; these assertions allow the developer to detect deviations from expected behavior, and to capture the current behavior in order to protect against future defects breaking this behavior.},

abstract = {It is common, especially in large software systems, for developers to change code without updating its associated comments due to their unfamiliarity with the code or due to time constraints. This is a potential problem since outdated comments may confuse or mislead developers who perform future development. Using data recovered from CVS, we study the evolution of code comments in the PostgreSQL project. Our study reveals that over time the percentage of commented functions remains constant except for early fluctuation due to the commenting style of a particular active developer.},
