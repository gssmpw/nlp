\caption{Illustration of the pipeline approach (ยง\ref{section:model}):  
\textbf{[1]} We send the same prompt to GPT-4o to generate five separate instances of the document's \textit{complete} temporal graph.  
\textbf{[2]} We extract the relation distribution as one-hot vectors over the temporal classes for each relation in each generation.  
\textbf{[3]} We sum and normalize the predictions into a single vector representing the joint prediction over the document's temporal graph.  
\textbf{[4]} We apply a transitive closure optimization algorithm to this vector.  
\textbf{[5]} The final temporal graph is obtained.
