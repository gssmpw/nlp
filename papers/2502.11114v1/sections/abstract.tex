Temporal relation extraction (TRE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying the temporal relationships between events in a document. 
Despite the advances in large language models (LLMs), their application to TRE remains limited. Most existing approaches rely on \textit{pairwise} classification, in which event pairs are considered individually, leading to computational inefficiency and a lack of global consistency in the resulting temporal graph. In this work, we propose a novel \textit{zero-shot} method for TRE that generates a documentâ€™s complete temporal graph at once, then applies transitive constraints optimization to refine predictions and enforce temporal consistency across relations. 
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{OmniTemp}, a new dataset with complete annotations for all pairs of targeted events within a document. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing zero-shot approaches while achieving competitive performance with supervised models.
