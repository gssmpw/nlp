\section{CONCLUSION}\label{sec:conclusion}

We showed that the weighted low-rank approximation problem could be solved in almost linear $n^{1+o(1)}$ time when the weighted matrix $W$ has few distinct columns and rows and $W \circ A$ has few distinct columns and rows. This demonstrates that truly subquadratic time is achievable for a dense regime not previously known to be tractable. 
Future work could generalize the assumptions and explore applications of the algorithm.

\section{LIMITATIONS}\label{sec:limitation}
Although our algorithm can achieve a good approximation ratio in theory, it may not achieve the ideal result in practical implementation due to various factors such as computational resource limitation, data quality problems, or incomplete model specification.

\section{SOCIETAL IMPACT}\label{sec:impact}
In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that can solve weighted low-rank approximation problems in near-linear time under certain conditions. Our paper is purely theoretical and empirical in nature (a mathematics problem), and thus, we foresee no immediate negative ethical impact. 
Our algorithms can improve the efficiency of data processing and model training, allowing complex algorithms to be run in resource-limited environments and accelerating scientific research and technological innovation. By reducing computing requirements, energy consumption can be reduced, and the environment can benefit.
