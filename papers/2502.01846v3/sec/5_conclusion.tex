\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
We introduced a novel method to solve the underlying issues with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that prevent the direct integration of them with the large number of existing image foundational models.
% like Autoencoder and Generative models. 
We proposed UVGS - a structured representation for 3DGS obtained by spherical mapping of 3DGS primitives to UV maps. We further squeezed the multi-attribute UVGS maps to a 3-channel unified and structured Super UVGS image, which not only maintains the 3D structural information of the object, but also provides a compact feature space for 3DGS attributes. The obtained Super UVGS images are directly integrated with the existing image foundational models for 3DGS compression and unconditional and conditional generation using diffusion models. Leveraging these Super UVGS images, we showed one of the first inpainting experiments on 3DGS.
