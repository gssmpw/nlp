\subsection{Human Multimodal Representations}

Multimodal representation learning is pivotal for human-centric analyses, especially in tasks requiring spatial-temporal reasoning to interpret complex behaviors____. Recent advancements, such as Video-LLaVA, integrate visual information from images and videos into a unified linguistic feature space, enabling improved visual reasoning for behavioral analysis____. However, many models remain limited to isolated video frames and privacy concerns, constraining their effectiveness in the dynamic real world.____. To address these limitations, motion data has emerged as a privacy-preserving alternative, allowing action analysis without revealing identifiable visual details____. By combining visual and motion data, emerging multimodal frameworks offer comprehensive, privacy-aware solutions, leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities for enhanced adaptability across diverse applications.

\subsection{Human Motion Understanding}

Human motion analysis traditionally relies on skeletal data, represented as joint keypoint sequences, to capture movement dynamics while preserving user privacy____. Early methods, such as 2s-AGCN____, and recent transformer-based models like MotionCLIP____, have demonstrated success in tasks such as activity recognition, caption generation, and behavior analysis by translating motion data into language tokens. While effective in modeling structural movement patterns, these approaches often neglect environmental context, which is crucial for interpreting motions that may convey different meanings based on situational factors____. To address this, recent models integrate motion and visual data, enabling improved generalization in dynamic and diverse environments____. Frameworks like LLaMo____ have further advanced the field by incorporating motion encoders, estimators, and efficient fusion mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results in both general and specialized motion analysis.
% However, these systems focus exclusively on motion evaluation, thereby limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring flexible and comprehensive analyses driven by user intent, and consequently constraining their utility in complex, user-driven contexts.
