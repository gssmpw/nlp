\ourdata~is constructed based on Wikidata and is designed to investigate the unlearning of knowledge about famous people for application in various language models.
Although knowledge is more interconnected for well-known individuals, our benchmark does not examine a broader range of people.
Additionally, our study focuses solely on erasing the target label, leaving the issue of hallucinations in the unlearning process as future work, in line with prior studies.
