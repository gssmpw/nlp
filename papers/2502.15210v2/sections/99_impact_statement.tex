\section*{Impact Statement}
% \color{blue}{Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such as the following will suffice:}

%This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

This work contributes to the multimodal AI research community by introducing a systematic evaluation framework for assessing vision-language models capabilities as automated evaluators. By providing a comprehensive benchmarking methodology, we examine these models capabilities in comparing multimodal data pairs and generating meaningful similarity scores. Our analysis reveals critical limitations in employing VLMs as evaluators  including asymmetric scoring patterns and inconsistent alignment with human judgments. These insights are particularly important as VLMs are increasingly adopted as automated evaluation tools across various domains. While our framework helps surface these limitations, addressing the underlying challenges will require continued research effort from the broader AI community. 

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.
