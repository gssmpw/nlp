\section{Methods}
% Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of . 
We conducted a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of five publicly available chatbots providing information about menopause---Gemini, GPT-4o, Meta.AI, Microsoft Copilot, and a GPT-based Menopause Coach. These were selected from an initial exhaustive list of 21 publicly available LLM chatbots, both generic and menopause-specific. We filtered the list after initial testing to include different base LLMs, and only the best-performing of seventeen GPT-based chatbots. 
% Ethical considerations of experimental design and conduction were discussed and did not require institutional review board approval.
Twenty questions on menopause were selected by two obstetrics and gynecology providers (referred to as NNK and AD) to reflect most common patient inquiries. Both then independently ranked the top five most frequently asked questions, resulting in a final set of eight questions. 
% Since two questions overlapped in their selections, a final set of eight questions was chosen for evaluation. 
%covering areas like menopause status, treatment options, menstrual irregularities, weight loss challenges, and the possibility of curing menopause.

% This study involved evaluation by the clinicians on the research team.
\textbf{\textit{Evaluation Approach:}}
We used the S.C.O.R.E. framework for evaluation (Table \ref{tab:demo}
)~\cite{tan2024proposed}. A blinded evaluation was conducted (masking which response came from which chatbot). The first three metrics—safety, consensus, and explainability—were scored by the same two clinicians on a scale of 1 to 5.
We observed significant differences between the two experts' evaluations and we took the average of their scores to provide a balanced representation of the chatbot's performance. We also reported interrater agreement between the two experts' evaluations and the internal reviewers'. These differences are highlighted in the paper, a deeper analysis of the discrepancies through focus groups with the experts is still ongoing.
% The assessment focused on three main metrics: safety, consensus, and explainability, using a scoring legend to rate each response on a scale of 1 to 5 or each metric. 
\textit{Reproducibility} and \textit{Objectivity} were evaluated by two team members (R1 and R2) with expertise in public health and computer science, respectively. They rated responses on a scale of 1 to 5 and recorded qualitative observations. Additionally, semantic similarity scores were calculated using Sentence-BERT (SBERT).
% to measure the similarity between different responses. 
% , a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, % Other variables of reproducibility were rated on a scale of 1 to 5. 
% The consistency of these responses was evaluated by examining variables such as semantic similarity, level of detail, data sources used, tone or style, and the presence of follow-up questions.

Safety & Assessing whether responses are safe for patient use. This includes checking for harmful, misleading, or hallucinated information and ensuring that the chatbot adheres to medical guidelines and standards. \\ 
Consensus & Evaluates if responses align with established medical knowledge and guidelines. This involves comparing chatbot's answers with the gold standard answers and assessing the degree of agreement. \\ 
Objectivity & Assesses the neutrality and unbiased nature of the chatbot's responses. It examines whether it provides information without bias or opinion, ensuring advice is based solely on medical facts and evidence.  \\ 
Reproducibility & Evaluates the consistency of responses over multiple interactions. It involves testing the chatbot with the same set of questions at different times and under varying conditions to ensure that the responses remain consistent and reliable. \\ 
 Explainability & Assesses how well the chatbot can provide understandable and clear explanations for its responses. This involves evaluating whether the chatbot can justify its advice based on medical knowledge and guidelines, making the information accessible and comprehensible to users.  \\

% \subsection{Data Collection}
\textbf{\textit{Prompting:}}  Memory was turned off on each chatbot, and all questions were asked in new sessions to prevent the influence of chat history. Each chatbot was prompted with the following engineered query: \textit{``You are a medical chatbot interacting with patients regarding their health inquiries. Please provide clinically accurate responses. Your patient has asked the question:[User question here]. State your response with sources''}. This prompt was used to evaluate safety, consensus, reproducibility, and explainability.
To test \textit{reproducibility}, two team members separately generated responses from the chatbot for each question. 
For objectivity testing, we appended the following text before adding the user question to examine potential differences in responses based on race and insurance status: \textit{``\dots Your [Black/White] patient with [No/Public/Private] insurance has asked the question: \dots [User question here].\dots''}
% These prompts helped ensure that the responses were comparable across the chatbots.

% The chatbot response settings and any adjustments made to them were systematically recorded in a separate data sheet for transparency. 
% Each chatbot's responses were recorded in a color-coded spreadsheet to facilitate easy differentiation during analysis. 
% Three study team members independently generated these responses. The chatbot response settings and any adjustments made to them were systematically recorded in a separate data sheet for transparency. 
% For reproducibility, two subjects generated the responses for the same questions. 


% \subsection{Data Analysis}

% To test for objectivity was based on the patient's race (White/Black) and insurance status (no/public/private insurance). This evaluation helped identify whether the chatbot's responses varied significantly with changes in demographic details, indicating potential biases in the underlying language models. 

% All the data generated and analyzed during the study was organized into multiple spreadsheets. Using comparative analysis, data was analyzed to identify trends and differences among the chatbots.
