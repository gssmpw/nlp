\subsection{General Correctness}
%visitbench 104

\paragraph{Prompt.} If a car is stopped at this traffic light how many directions can it potentially go when the light turns green?
\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/104.jpg}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Response 1 (chosen).}} According to the traffic sign in the image, a car stopped at this intersection would have 3 possible directions to go when the light turns green:
1. Straight ahead (up arrow);
2. Left (left arrow);
3. Right (right arrow).
This is indicated by the three-way directional arrow sign mounted between the two red traffic signals.

\paragraph{\textcolor{red}{Response 2 (rejected).}}
The car can potentially go in \textcolor{red}{two} directions when the traffic light turns green.

\paragraph{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Response 1 (chosen).}} A close-up, slightly blurred image showcases a bunch of freshly harvested carrots, emphasizing their varied and vibrant colors. The carrots are densely packed, their long, tapered forms lying predominantly diagonally across the frame. The colors range from a deep, rich purple, almost bordering on maroon, to a pale, creamy yellow, with several shades of orange and a hint of reddish-purple in between. The carrots' surfaces exhibit a subtle sheen, and fine, hair-like rootlets are visible on some, adding to their fresh-from-the-ground appearance. The texture seems smooth, with slight lengthwise ridges typical of carrots. Near the top center, a small sprig of green carrot tops is visible, providing a contrasting pop of color against the roots. The focus is soft, giving the image a slightly dreamy quality, and the background is dark and indistinct, further drawing attention to the colorful array of carrots. The image highlights the natural diversity and beauty of this common vegetable.

\paragraph{\textcolor{red}{Response 2 (rejected).}}
A vibrant and colorful bunch of carrots in varying shades. The carrots display a range of hues, from deep orange to creamy white, with a striking purple carrot adding contrast. The roots appear fresh with their green tops partially visible, adding a touch of natural greenery to the composition. The textures of the carrots are evident, with some having rough, natural imperfections, while others are smooth and uniform. The carrots are closely packed together, showcasing their elongated and tapered shapes. The overall image presents a visually appealing and diverse assortment of carrots, highlighting the rich colors and textures found in fresh produce.


\subsection{Knowledge}
\label{sec:app-example-knowledge}
%mmmu-s 802

\paragraph{Prompt.} Answer the multiple choice question. Think step by step before answering. 
Rank in the order of increasing acidic strength: (A) C $<$ A $<$ B ~ (B) B $<$ C $<$ A ~ (C) A $<$ C $<$ B ~ (D) B $<$ A $<$ C ~ (E) A $<$ B $<$ C ~ (F) C $<$ B $<$ A
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/802.jpg}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Response 1 (chosen).}} Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what affects acidity in these compounds:\\
* Presence of electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) increases acidity\\
* Number of \u03b1-carbonyl groups affects acidity\\   * Position of the groups relative to each other matters

2) Let's analyze each structure:\\   * Compound A: Has two ethyl ester groups at 1,3-positions\\   * Compound B: Has two ethyl ester groups at same carbon (geminal position)\\   * Compound C: Has one ethyl ester and two ketone groups

3) Comparing the structures:\\   * Ketone groups are more electron-withdrawing than ester groups\\   * Compound C has two ketone groups plus an ester\\   * Compound B has geminal diesters (less effective than distributed)\\   * Compound A has distributed diesters

4) Acidity ranking reasoning:\\   * C will be most acidic due to two ketone groups (strongest EWG)\\   * B will be less acidic than A because geminal substitution is less effective than 1,3-substitution\\   * Therefore: B $<$ A $<$ C

Answer: D\\


\paragraph{\textcolor{red}{Response 2 (rejected).}}
Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what makes a molecule more acidic:\\
- Stability of the conjugate base (anion)\\
- Electronic effects like resonance and inductive effects

2) Looking at the structures:\\
(A) Has two ester groups on adjacent carbons\\
(B) Has two ester groups on same carbon\\
(C) Has two ester groups on adjacent carbons

3) Key considerations:\\
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups (esters) increase acidity\\
- Their position affects the stability of the anion formed\\
- Geminal diesters (on same carbon) vs vicinal diesters (on adjacent carbons) 

4) Analyzing the acidity:\\
- Structure B has both ester groups on the same carbon, making deprotonation most favorable as the negative charge can be stabilized by both esters simultaneously\\
- Structure C and A have similar arrangements with esters on adjacent carbons\\
- The arrangement in A would likely be slightly less acidic than C due to the additional ester group position

5) Therefore, the order of increasing acidity would be: A $<$ C $<$ B. Looking at the given options, this matches with option (C). 

Answer: \textcolor{red}{C}

\section{Human annotation instruction}
\label{sec:app-annotation}


\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,breaklines=true,basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,mathescape=true]
You are tasked with evaluating an AI assistant's performance on a user-defined task.

Your goal is to assess both responses, identify any major issues or omissions, and then determine which response is better.

The final answer should be one of the following:
* R1 >> R2 (Response 1 is significantly better)
* R1 > R2 (Response 1 is better)
* R1 ~ R2 (Neither response is better than the other)
* R1 < R2 (Response 2 is better)
* R1 << R2 (Response 2 is significantly better)

Please answer using one of these options verbatim.

Answer $\textbf{Yes/No/I don't know}$ in one line, then briefly explain any major issues.**


**$\textbf{Q3:}$ What is your assessment of the responses? Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the responses. Answer $\textbf{R1\,>>\,R2,  R1\,>\,R2,  R1\,˜\,R2,  R1\,<\,R2,  or R1\,<<\,R2}$**

\section{Prompt template for VLM-as-a-judge}
\label{sec:app-judge-prompt}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,breaklines=true,basicstyle=\small\ttfamily]
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's question better. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses. Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better.
