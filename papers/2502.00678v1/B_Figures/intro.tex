    \caption{Overview of the proposed \textbf{Kernel Divergence Score} (KDS) framework for quantifying dataset contamination in large language models. The process involves extracting sample embeddings from the model before and after fine-tuning on the benchmark dataset $\mathcal{D}$, computing the kernel similarity matrix for each stage, and measuring the divergence between the two matrices $\Phi(Z)$ and $\Phi(Z')$. By capturing the changes of embeddings induced by fine-tuning, KDS provides a reliable and interpretable score to quantify the level of dataset contamination. }
