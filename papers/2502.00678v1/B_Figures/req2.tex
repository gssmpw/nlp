    \caption{\textbf{Consistency Requirement Compliance Evaluation.} Light bars are detector-based baselines, and darker bars are kernel-based. The darkest bar is our Kernel Divergence Score. (a) To evaluate how different datasets sampled from the same distribution affect score magnitudes, we present the average MAPE of baseline scores measured across five independent runs. (b) To assess the effect of dataset size on score magnitudes, we compute the average MAPE between WikiMIA subsets of size 700 and 350.}
