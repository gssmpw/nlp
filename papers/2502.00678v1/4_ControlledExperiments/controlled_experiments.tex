\label{sec:experiments}
In this section, we conduct a controlled experiment to verify the reliability of our Kernel Divergence Score with respect to the Monotonicity and Consistency requirements~(\emph{c.f.} Section~\ref{sec:rcsr}). 
% 
For a comprehensive analysis, we also assess existing non-kernel-based scoring methods.
