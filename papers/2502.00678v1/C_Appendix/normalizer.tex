\section{Role of the Normalization Factor}
\label{apdx:normalizer}
Recall that in our Kernel Divergence Score, we define the normalizer $E$ as the square root of the sum of entries in the kernel matrix.
We employ this square-root normalizer because, despite the second-order nature of Eq.~\eqref{eq:score_decomp}, the sum of kernel entries reveals a linear relationship with varying data subset sizes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:normalizer}.
A linear fit to the data yields an $R^2$ value of 0.9766, confirming the linearity of this relationship. 
Therefore, to mitigate the influence of dataset size and prevent over-penalizing the score scale, we utilize the square-root normalizer.
