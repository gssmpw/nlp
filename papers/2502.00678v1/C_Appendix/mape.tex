\section{Consistency Requirement Compliance in Detail}
To assess the adherence of each baseline to the Consistency requirement, we calculate the Mean Absolute Percentage Error~(MAPE) over five independent runs. 
\begin{equation*}
    \text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{t=1}^5 \bigg\vert\frac{S_t - \bar{S}}{\bar{S}}\bigg\vert,
\end{equation*}
where $S_t$ represents the score from the $t$-th run, and $\bar{S}$ denotes the mean score across all five runs. 
This metric is then averaged across all contamination rates. 
The results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:req2}, indicate that our Kernel Divergence Score achieves the lowest MAPE among non-FSD-based methods, highlighting its superior consistency.
FSD-based scores generally have lower average MAPE, but they often fail to meet monotonicity requirements~(Table~\ref{tab:req1}).
