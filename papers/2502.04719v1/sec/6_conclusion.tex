\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end approach to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing in deep optics. By integrating tolerance modeling into the ray tracing process, we achieve effective tolerance-aware optimization, resulting in a more robust and complete deep optics design flow. Our analysis shows significant improvements in robustness, demonstrated through simulations and physical experiments. We believe this work effectively closes the divide between design and manufacturing, unlocking the potential of deep optics for mass production.
