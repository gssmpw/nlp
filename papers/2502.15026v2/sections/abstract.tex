This paper studies safety guarantees for systems with time-varying control bounds. It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this method is that the CBF-based QP could easily become infeasible under tight control bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The recently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but require extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning for the CBF-based QP and may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of safe sets. To address these issues, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs). Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable that multiplies each CBF itself, and define dynamics for the auxiliary variable to adapt it in constructing the corresponding CBF constraint. In this way, we can improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP while avoiding extensive parameter tuning with non-overshooting control since the formulation is identical to classical CBF methods.
 We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs and compare them with existing techniques on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem with time-varying control bounds. 
% Safety is one of the fundamental challenges in control theory. Recently, the design of safety-critical optimal controller for affine control systems was realized by formulating Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into Quadratic programs (QPs), which always leads to infeasible condition under conservative input constraints.
% Existing approaches usually focus on the feasibility or the safety for the optimization problem, therefore guaranteeing the safety of control strategy and the feasibility of the QPs under conservative input constraints is still challenging to current approaches, not to mention the complexity of parameter-tuning process.
% In this paper, we propose Auxiliary Variable Based CBFs (AVCBFs) which utilize auxiliary variables for the system dynamics and for High Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to enhance the feasibility of the QPs while to guarantee the safety. We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs over one of the state of the arts by applying both approaches to an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem with conservative and time-varying input constraints. The numerical results validate that our proposed method can generate a safe, smooth and adaptive controller without defining excessive additional constraints, which enormously simplifies the parameter-tuning process.
