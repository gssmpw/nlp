We proposed Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs) for safety-critical optimal controller design, which addresses the notorious feasibility problem in the discretization-based QP approach in the case of time-varying and tight control bounds. Central to our approach is using auxiliary variables for the system dynamics and for the HOCBF constraints. We validated the proposed AVCBFs approach by applying it to a model of adaptive cruise control. Our proposed method generates a safe, smooth and adaptive controller by designing fewer constraints and simpler parameter tuning, which outperforms PACBFs as the baseline. One limitation of the proposed method is the fact that its hyperparameters in the cost function are not automatically tuned. Another limitation is that the feasibility of the optimization and system safety are not always guaranteed at the same time in the whole state space. We will address these limitations in future work by designing a fully automatic AVCBFs method.
