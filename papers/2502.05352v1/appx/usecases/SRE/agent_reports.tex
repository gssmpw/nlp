\subsubsection{Diagnosis and Mitigation Report}
Example of agent JSON report is also provided in Figure~\ref{fig:sre-report}. The JSON report contains information collected by the agent during its investigation. This includes a list of the faulty entities it encountered, as well as its best guess at the cause of the incident. Further, it contains a list of actions the agent took to try to mitigate the problem.
