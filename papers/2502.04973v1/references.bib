   abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been investigated as promising biometrics with high authentication accuracy, natural liveness test ability, and wearable sensor availability. There have been many algorithms developed for ECG biometric authentication or identification including recent state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methods that usually yielded excellent performance with real ECG data in ideal conditions. However, one of the challenges against ideal conditions is the intra-personal variability of ECG pulses due to heart beat rate changes. Due to this variability, ECG based biometric methods have experienced significant performance degradation. It is especially challenging when a small number of ECG pulses must be used for biometrics with fast response authentication since there is not enough information available to correct for different heart rates. In this letter, we investigated DL based ECG biometrics with the input of a small number of ECG pulses considering varying heart rates. We propose physiology-based augmented deep neural network (DNN) frameworks for ECG biometric methods that are based on the Hodges’ QT interval correction. Unlike QT interval correction methods, our proposed framework does not require the estimated heart rate. Our proposed training and testing schemes were evaluated with representative DL based biometric methods using CNN and RNN with very short ECG pulses (1 or 3 pulses per authentication) from the public multi-session ECG-ID dataset (83 subjects). We exploited the ECG-ID dataset to simulate the challenging scenario including the enrollment and authentication happening over relatively long time duration so that heart rate variation is likely occurring. Our augmented DNN frameworks yielded significantly better performance than the original DL based biometrics; up to 11.7% improvement in accuracy and 8.6% improvement in sensitivity simultaneously with 99.9% specificity.},

While this new biometric modality has attracted significant interest, a majority of the prior art has approached it from the perspective of a typical biometric modality and has neglected the physiological factors that directly affect the behavior of the respective systems.

Among the available approaches, electrocardiogram (ECG) technology is attracting attention because of its strengths in spoofing. However, morphological changes of ECG, which are affected by physical and psychological factors, can make authentication difficult. In this paper, we propose authentication using non-linear normalization of ECG beats that is robust to changes in ECG waveforms according to heart rate fluctuations in various daily activities. We performed a non-linear normalization method through the analysis of ECG alongside heart rate, evaluating similarities and authenticating the performance of our new method compared to existing methods. Compared with beats before normalization, the average similarity of the proposed method increased 23.7% in the resting state and 43% in the non-resting state. After learning in the resting state, authentication performance reached 99.05% accuracy for the resting state and 88.14% for the non-resting state. The proposed method can be applicable to an ECG-based authentication system under various physiological conditions.},

   abstract = {<p>Although biometrics systems using an electrocardiogram (ECG) have been actively researched, there is a characteristic that the morphological features of the ECG signal are measured differently depending on the measurement environment. In general, post-exercise ECG is not matched with the morphological features of the pre-exercise ECG because of the temporary tachycardia. This can degrade the user recognition performance. Although normalization studies have been conducted to match the post- and pre-exercise ECG, limitations related to the distortion of the P wave, QRS complexes, and T wave, which are morphological features, often arise. In this paper, we propose a method for matching pre- and post-exercise ECG cycles based on time and frequency fusion normalization in consideration of morphological features and classifying users with high performance by an optimized system. One cycle of post-exercise ECG is expanded by linear interpolation and filtered with an optimized frequency through the fusion normalization method. The fusion normalization method aims to match one post-exercise ECG cycle to one pre-exercise ECG cycle. The experimental results show that the average similarity between the pre- and post-exercise states improves by 25.6% after normalization, for 30 ECG cycles. Additionally, the normalization algorithm improves the maximum user recognition performance from 96.4 to 98%.</p>},

abstract = {Several formulas have been proposed to adjust the QT interval for heart rate, the most commonly used being the QT correction formula (QTC = qt√rr) proposed in 1920 by Bazett. The QTC formula was derived from observations in only 39 young subjects. Recently, the adequacy of Bazett's formula has been questioned. To evaluate the heart rate QT association, the QT interval was measured on the initial baseline electrocardiogram of 5,018 subjects (2,239 men and 2,779 women) from the Framingham Heart Study with a mean age of 44 years (range 28 to 62). Persons with coronary artery disease were excluded. A linear regression model was developed for correcting QT according to RR cycle length. The large sample allowed for subdivision of the population into sex-specific deciles of RR intervals and for comparison of QT, Bazett's QTC and linear corrected QT (QTLC). The mean RR interval was 0.81 second (range 0.5 to 1.47) heart rate 74 beats/min (range 41 to 120), and mean QT was 0.35 second (range 0.24 to 0.49) in men and 0.36 second (range 0.26 to 0.48) In women. The linear regression model yielded a correction formula (for a reference RR interval of 1 second): QTLC = QT + 0.154 (1 − RR) that applies for men and women. This equation corrects QT more reliably than the Bazett's formula, which overcorrects the QT interval at fast heart rates and undercorrects it at low heart rates. Lower and upper limits of normal QT values in relation to RR were generated. A simple linear equation was developed that is more accurate than Bazett's correction at different cycle lengths and more convenient for clinical practice. This formula alleviates the need to apply secondary corrections to Bazett's formula. Additional investigation is warranted to determined whether QTLC improves the identification of subjects at high risk for malignant arrhythmias or sudden death.}

ABSTRACT = {In general, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) maintain some level of translational invariance. However, the convolutional layer itself is translational-equivariant. The pooling layers provide some level of invariance. In object recognition, invariance is more important than equivariance. In this paper, we investigate how vulnerable CNNs without pooling or augmentation are to translation in object recognition. For CNNs that are specialized in learning local textures but vulnerable to learning global geometric information, we propose a method to explicitly transform an image into a global feature image and then provide it as an input to neural networks. In our experiments on a modified MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of a conventional baseline network significantly decreases from 98% to less than 60% even in the case of 2-pixel translation. We also demonstrate that the proposed method is far superior to the baseline network in terms of performance improvement.},

   abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has extremely discriminative characteristics in the biometric field and has recently received significant interest as a promising biometric trait. However, ECG signals are susceptible to several types of noises, such as baseline wander, powerline interference, and high/low-frequency noises, making it challenging to realize biometric identification systems precisely and robustly. Therefore, ECG signal denoising is a major preprocessing step and plays a crucial role in ECG-based biometric human identification. ECG signal analysis for biometric recognition can combine several steps, such as preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, feature transformation, and classification which is a very challenging task. Moreover, the employed success measures and appropriate constitution of the ECG signal database also play significant roles in biometric system analysis, considering that publicly available databases are essential by the research community to evaluate the performance of their proposed algorithms. In this survey, we review most of the techniques employed for the ECG as biometrics for human authentication. Firstly, we present an overview and discussion on ECG signal preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and feature transformation for ECG-based biometric systems. Secondly, we present a survey of the available ECG databases to evaluate and compare the acquisition protocol, acquisition hardware, and acquisition resolution (bits) for ECG-based biometric systems. Thirdly, we also present a survey on different techniques, including deep learning methods: deep supervised learning, deep semi-supervised learning, and deep unsupervised learning, for ECG signal classification. Lastly, we present the state-of-art approaches of information fusion in multimodal biometric systems.},

abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been actively proposed as an aliveness biometric for years. In realistic application, this type of biometrics still needs to be verified in some conditions related to the practical use. Therefore, we propose in this paper the study of two themes that concern its realistic application. First, the single beat of an electrocardiogram (SB-ECG) is used as the ECG feature, which aims to decrease the time to acquire the ECG from the individual. Second, for the robustness study of ECG features to heart rate variability (HRV), we investigate the relation between the correct identification and the HRV conditions. The HRV-ECG data is set up and collected by using the Bio-Pac system. The overall processes of the proposed method are the following: Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to analyze each SB-ECG. Then the root-mean square (RMS) value of total energy of the wavelet coefficients of each P, QRS, and T segment is calculated. Next, the Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) is applied to all sets of the RMS value for dimension reduction. Lastly, the normalized Euclidean distance is implemented as the classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that, with the proposed method, the classification achieves 97\% accuracy and the robustness study achieves over 80\% accuracy with HRV-ECG change up to 20\%. © 2014 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

@article{Malik2002,
   abstract = {Objective: To compare the QT/RR relation in healthy subjects in order to investigate the differences in optimum heart rate correction of the QT interval. Methods: 50 healthy volunteers (25 women, mean age 33.6 (9.5) years, range 19-59 years) took part. Each subject underwent serial 12 lead electrocardiographic monitoring over 24 hours with a 10 second ECG obtained every two minutes. QT intervals and heart rates were measured automatically. In each subject, the QT/RR relation was modelled using six generic regressions, including a linear model (QT = β + α × RR), a hyperbolic model (QT = β + α/RR), and a parabolic model (QT = β × RRα). For each model, the parallelism and identity of the regression lines in separate subjects were statistically tested. Results: The patterns of the QT/RR relation were very different among subjects. Regardless of the generic form of the regression model, highly significant differences were found not only between the regression lines but also between their slopes. For instance, with the linear model, the individual slope (parameter α) of any subject differed highly significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear slope of no fewer than 21 (median 32) other subjects. The linear regression line of 20 subjects differed significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear regression lines of each other subject. Conversion of the QT/RR regressions to QTc heart rate correction also showed substantial intersubject differences. Optimisation of the formula QTc: QT/RRα led to individual values of α ranging from 0.234 to 0.486. Conclusion: The QT/RR relation exhibits a very substantial intersubject variability in healthy volunteers. The hypothesis underlying each prospective heart rate correction formula that a "physiological" QT/RR relation exists that can be mathematically described and applied to all people is incorrect. Any general heart rate correction formula can be used only for very approximate clinical assessment of the QTc interval over a narrow window of resting heart rates. For detailed precise studies of the QTc interval (for example, drug induced QT interval prolongation), the individual QT/RR relation has to be taken into account.},
