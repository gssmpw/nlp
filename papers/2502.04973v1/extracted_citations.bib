   abstract = {<p>Although biometrics systems using an electrocardiogram (ECG) have been actively researched, there is a characteristic that the morphological features of the ECG signal are measured differently depending on the measurement environment. In general, post-exercise ECG is not matched with the morphological features of the pre-exercise ECG because of the temporary tachycardia. This can degrade the user recognition performance. Although normalization studies have been conducted to match the post- and pre-exercise ECG, limitations related to the distortion of the P wave, QRS complexes, and T wave, which are morphological features, often arise. In this paper, we propose a method for matching pre- and post-exercise ECG cycles based on time and frequency fusion normalization in consideration of morphological features and classifying users with high performance by an optimized system. One cycle of post-exercise ECG is expanded by linear interpolation and filtered with an optimized frequency through the fusion normalization method. The fusion normalization method aims to match one post-exercise ECG cycle to one pre-exercise ECG cycle. The experimental results show that the average similarity between the pre- and post-exercise states improves by 25.6% after normalization, for 30 ECG cycles. Additionally, the normalization algorithm improves the maximum user recognition performance from 96.4 to 98%.</p>},

   abstract = {The development and use of wearable devices require high levels of security and have sparked interest in biometric authentication research. Among the available approaches, electrocardiogram (ECG) technology is attracting attention because of its strengths in spoofing. However, morphological changes of ECG, which are affected by physical and psychological factors, can make authentication difficult. In this paper, we propose authentication using non-linear normalization of ECG beats that is robust to changes in ECG waveforms according to heart rate fluctuations in various daily activities. We performed a non-linear normalization method through the analysis of ECG alongside heart rate, evaluating similarities and authenticating the performance of our new method compared to existing methods. Compared with beats before normalization, the average similarity of the proposed method increased 23.7% in the resting state and 43% in the non-resting state. After learning in the resting state, authentication performance reached 99.05% accuracy for the resting state and 88.14% for the non-resting state. The proposed method can be applicable to an ECG-based authentication system under various physiological conditions.},

@article{Kim2022,
   abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been investigated as promising biometrics with high authentication accuracy, natural liveness test ability, and wearable sensor availability. There have been many algorithms developed for ECG biometric authentication or identification including recent state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methods that usually yielded excellent performance with real ECG data in ideal conditions. However, one of the challenges against ideal conditions is the intra-personal variability of ECG pulses due to heart beat rate changes. Due to this variability, ECG based biometric methods have experienced significant performance degradation. It is especially challenging when a small number of ECG pulses must be used for biometrics with fast response authentication since there is not enough information available to correct for different heart rates. In this letter, we investigated DL based ECG biometrics with the input of a small number of ECG pulses considering varying heart rates. We propose physiology-based augmented deep neural network (DNN) frameworks for ECG biometric methods that are based on the Hodges’ QT interval correction. Unlike QT interval correction methods, our proposed framework does not require the estimated heart rate. Our proposed training and testing schemes were evaluated with representative DL based biometric methods using CNN and RNN with very short ECG pulses (1 or 3 pulses per authentication) from the public multi-session ECG-ID dataset (83 subjects). We exploited the ECG-ID dataset to simulate the challenging scenario including the enrollment and authentication happening over relatively long time duration so that heart rate variation is likely occurring. Our augmented DNN frameworks yielded significantly better performance than the original DL based biometrics; up to 11.7% improvement in accuracy and 8.6% improvement in sensitivity simultaneously with 99.9% specificity.},

@article{Malik2002,
   abstract = {Objective: To compare the QT/RR relation in healthy subjects in order to investigate the differences in optimum heart rate correction of the QT interval. Methods: 50 healthy volunteers (25 women, mean age 33.6 (9.5) years, range 19-59 years) took part. Each subject underwent serial 12 lead electrocardiographic monitoring over 24 hours with a 10 second ECG obtained every two minutes. QT intervals and heart rates were measured automatically. In each subject, the QT/RR relation was modelled using six generic regressions, including a linear model (QT = β + α × RR), a hyperbolic model (QT = β + α/RR), and a parabolic model (QT = β × RRα). For each model, the parallelism and identity of the regression lines in separate subjects were statistically tested. Results: The patterns of the QT/RR relation were very different among subjects. Regardless of the generic form of the regression model, highly significant differences were found not only between the regression lines but also between their slopes. For instance, with the linear model, the individual slope (parameter α) of any subject differed highly significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear slope of no fewer than 21 (median 32) other subjects. The linear regression line of 20 subjects differed significantly (p < 0.000001) from the linear regression lines of each other subject. Conversion of the QT/RR regressions to QTc heart rate correction also showed substantial intersubject differences. Optimisation of the formula QTc: QT/RRα led to individual values of α ranging from 0.234 to 0.486. Conclusion: The QT/RR relation exhibits a very substantial intersubject variability in healthy volunteers. The hypothesis underlying each prospective heart rate correction formula that a "physiological" QT/RR relation exists that can be mathematically described and applied to all people is incorrect. Any general heart rate correction formula can be used only for very approximate clinical assessment of the QTc interval over a narrow window of resting heart rates. For detailed precise studies of the QTc interval (for example, drug induced QT interval prolongation), the individual QT/RR relation has to be taken into account.},
