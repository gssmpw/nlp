\begin{abstract}
% Modeling Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) is essential for achieving autonomous wire harness assembly. 
% However, current research primarily focuses on modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) and has not demonstrated promising results in modeling and manipulating BDLOs due to the significant challenges posed by their complex dynamics. 
% To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (\DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to:
% 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO,
% 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference,
% and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. 
% To validate the proposed modeling approach, this paper evaluates \DEFT’s performance in an experimental setup involving two industrial robots and a variety of sensors. 
% A comprehensive series of experiments demonstrates its efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. 
% To further demonstrate \DEFT’s utility, this paper employs the modeling framework during planning and control tasks to achieve dexterous manipulation of BDLOs, illustrating its superior performance in autonomous planning and control of branched DLOs compared to existing methods. 
% These results demonstrate \DEFT's significance to advance automation in wire harness assembly.
Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability.
A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation.

     \caption{This paper introduces DEFT, a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning-based approach to accurately model and predict the dynamic behavior of Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) in real time. 
     As this paper illustrates, this model can be used in concert with a motion planning algorithm to autonomously manipulate BDLOs.
     The figures above illustrate how DEFT can be used to autonomously complete a wire insertion task.
    \textbf{Top:} The system first plans a shape-matching motion, transitioning the BDLO from its \textcolor{init_config}{initial} configuration to the target shape (contoured with \textcolor{mid_config}{yellow}), which serves as an intermediate waypoint.
    \textbf{Bottom:} Starting from the intermediate configuration, the system performs thread insertion, guiding the BDLO into the \textcolor{target_hole}{target hole} while also matching the target shape.
    Notably, DEFT predicts the state of the wire recursively without relying on ground truth or perception data at any point in the process.}

Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations.
While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. 
The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models.
To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (\DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation.

% \section{RSS citations}

% Please make sure to include \verb!natbib.sty! and to use the
% \verb!plainnat.bst! bibliography style. \verb!natbib! provides additional
% citation commands, most usefully \verb!\citet!. For example, rather than the
% awkward construction 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% \cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...
% \end{verbatim}
% }

% \noindent
% rendered as ``\cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...,''
% or the
% inconvenient 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% Kalman \cite{kalman1960new} 
% demonstrated...
% \end{verbatim}
% }

% \noindent
% rendered as 
% ``Kalman \cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...'', 
% one can
% write 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% \citet{kalman1960new} demonstrated... 
% \end{verbatim}
% }
% \noindent
% which renders as ``\citet{kalman1960new} demonstrated...'' and is 
% both easy to write and much easier to read.
  
% \subsection{RSS Hyperlinks}

% This year, we would like to use the ability of PDF viewers to interpret
% hyperlinks, specifically to allow each reference in the bibliography to be a
% link to an online version of the reference. 
% As an example, if you were to cite ``Passive Dynamic Walking''
% \cite{McGeer01041990}, the entry in the bibtex would read:

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% @article{McGeer01041990,
%   author = {McGeer, Tad}, 
%   title = {\href{http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}{Passive Dynamic Walking}}, 
%   volume = {9}, 
%   number = {2}, 
%   pages = {62-82}, 
%   year = {1990}, 
%   doi = {10.1177/027836499000900206}, 
%   URL = {http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}, 
%   eprint = {http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.full.pdf+html}, 
%   journal = {The International Journal of Robotics Research}
% }
% \end{verbatim}
% }
% \noindent
% and the entry in the compiled PDF would look like:

% \def\tmplabel#1{[#1]}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[\tmplabel{1}] Tad McGeer. \href{http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}{Passive Dynamic

% 1990.
% \end{enumerate}
% %
% where the title of the article is a link that takes you to the article on IJRR's website. 


% Linking cited articles will not always be possible, especially for
% older articles. There are also often several versions of papers
% online: authors are free to decide what to use as the link destination
% yet we strongly encourage to link to archival or publisher sites
% (such as IEEE Xplore or Sage Journals).  We encourage all authors to use this feature to

\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces DEFT, a method that embeds residual learning within a novel differentiable branched Deformable Linear Object (BDLO) simulator. 
DEFT enables accurate modeling and real-time prediction of a BDLO’s dynamic behavior over long time horizons under dynamic manipulation. 
To demonstrate DEFT’s efficacy, we conduct a comprehensive set of experiments evaluating its accuracy, computational speed, impacts of its constribution and utility for manipulation tasks.
Compared to the state of the art, DEFT achieves higher accuracy while remaining sample-efficient and without compromising computational speed. 
This paper also illustrates how to integrate DEFT with a planning and control framework for 3D shape matching and thread insertion of a BDLO in real-world scenarios.
DEFT successfully completes more complex, real-world manipulation tasks than other tested baselines.
