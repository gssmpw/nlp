We present the Hyperdimensional Intelligent Sensing Framework, designed for efficient real-time audio processing at the extreme edge. This innovative framework aims to significantly reduce overall system costs, including energy and storage consumption, by incorporating a near-sensor model focused on detecting essential audio data. This selectively transmitted data, crucial for the target task, is efficiently processed on a high-performance cloud server. Our evaluation demonstrates the framework's extreme efficiency, achieving up to 82.1\% energy savings with only 1.39\% quality loss. The near-sensor model's efficacy is highlighted by its sharp ROC curve, indicating robust performance. Notably, the ASIC implementation of the near-sensor model exhibits exceptional energy efficiency, confirming the framework's ability to substantially decrease total system energy consumption while maintaining a balanced trade-off between energy conservation and quality preservation.

In future work, we plan to explore more sophisticated threshold selection strategies and consider integrating advanced HDC encodings for even greater robustness. Additionally, constructing a physical prototype and conducting on-site experiments will help validate our simulation-based findings and further refine the system for practical deployments.
