\subsection{Evaluation Framework: Timeloop for \HHPName}

\autoref{fig:framework} shows the evaluation framework built on Timeloop~\cite{timeloop}. The inputs to the framework include configuration based on the proposed \HHPName taxonomy, cascades of operations, and hardware parameters. Operations are allocated based on reuse to sub-accelerators, and based on the taxonomy notation and resource partitioning, sub-accelerator architecture files are generated. These sub-accelerator files are based on Timeloop v0.4 and include a detailed hardware model with the ability to specify mapping constraints and resources available to each sub-accelerator. Timeloop mapper is called for each operation with the architecture files corresponding sub-accelerators executing that operation. We use a wrapper to compute the statistics of the HHP configuration from statistics of operations executed on individual sub-accelerators to return the final results corresponding to the cascade.

\subsection{Workloads}

We evaluate HHP's on mixed-intensity cascades of operations as shown in~\autoref{tables:workloads}. We focus on transformers, where we consider an attention layer from encoder-only transformers as intra-cascade workload partition, and prefill and decode stages from decoder-only transformer as inter-cascade workload partition.

\subsection{Evaluation Configurations}

We evaluate the common configurations configurations based on the taxonomy shown in~\autoref{fig:taxonomy} (a-d) to study leaf vs hierarchical and homogeneous vs cross-node heterogeneous vs intra-node heterogeneous vs cross-depth heterogeneous. The hardware parameters are described in~\autoref{tables:config}. Other parameter changes for specific sensitivity studies are mentioned along with the studies.
