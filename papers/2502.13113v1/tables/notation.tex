         & \textbf{Hierarchical?} & \textbf{Heterogeneity location} & \textbf{Works} & \textbf{Remarks} \\\hline
     (a) &     Leaf-only & Homogeneous & TPUv1~\cite{tpuv4}, MAERI~\cite{kwon2018maeri}, Eyeriss~\cite{eyeriss2016isca}, Flexagon~\cite{flexagon} & Most of the works on DNN accelerators, specially the earlier works. \\\hline

(b) & Leaf-only & Cross-node & Herald~\cite{kwon2021heterogeneous}, AESPA~\cite{qin2022enabling}, TPUv4~\cite{tpuv4} & Herald and AESPA are accelerators with different sub-accelerators good at processing different operation shapes. TPUv4 consists of a sparse and a dense sub-accelerator.  \\\hline
          
  (c) &    Leaf-only  & Intra-node & NVIDIA B100 GPUs~\cite{blackwell}, VEGETA~\cite{vegeta}, RaPiD~\cite{rapid} & NVIDIA GPUs with tensor cores have two different sub-accelerators under a common FSM with the same program counter, thus each node itself is heterogeneous. \\\hline
        
   (d) &     Hierarchical & Cross-depth & NeuPIM~\cite{neupim}, Duplex~\cite{duplex} & NeuPIM and Duplex are hierarchical and heterogeneous, with NPU's at the leaf, and processing-in-DRAM at the root\\\hline

(e) & Hierarchical & Homogeneous & N/A & No prior work fits this category\\\hline
   
   (f) &    Hierarchical & Cross-node & Symphony~\cite{symphony} & Symphony is cross-node heterogeneous, like Herald and AESPA, but still its different since symphony has clustered cross-node heterogeneity. This means that even through, different sub-accelerators are across different nodes, they still are heterogeneous within a cluster that spans a part of the level and repeats itself across the level. \\\hline
   (g)   &  Hierarchical & Intra-node & N/A & No prior work fits this category\\\hline

        

     (h) &    Hierarchical/leaf-only & Compound heterogeneous & N/A & No prior work fits this category\\\hline
