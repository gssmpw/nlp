\begin{abstract}
    Recent work showed that small changes in benchmark questions can reduce LLMs' reasoning and recall. We explore two such changes: pairing questions and adding more answer options, on three benchmarks: WMDP-bio, GPQA, and MMLU variants. We find that for more capable models, these predictably reduce performance, essentially heightening the performance ceiling of a benchmark and unsaturating it again. We suggest this approach can resurrect old benchmarks.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{LLM capabilities are not always robust}
Multiple-choice benchmarks show that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many knowledge domains. While LLMs often surpass human performance, recent studies reveal important limitations. For example, the GSM-Symbolic benchmark~\cite{gsmsymbolic} shows that minor changes in mathematical questions significantly worsen model performance. This suggests LLMs rely on pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, making them struggle with unfamiliar problem formats.

LLMs may also show inconsistent factual recall, performing better under some conditions than others. For example, they often perform worse when presented with multiple tasks simultaneously~\cite{multipleprompts}.

We examine LLM knowledge robustness by testing how well models answer paired questions from multiple-choice benchmarks, and use the identified weaknesses to create a more challenging version of the MMLU benchmark.

\subsection{Benchmarks rapidly saturate}

Modern LLMs achieve near-perfect scores on benchmarks published just a few years ago. This makes these tests ineffective for distinguishing between advanced models~\cite{aiprogress}.

We explore methods to make existing multiple-choice benchmarks more challenging and thus more useful for evaluating current LLMs.

\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection{Paired-question benchmark}

We tested LLMs by presenting two multiple-choice questions simultaneously. For each pair, the model had to select the correct combination of answers. Figure \ref{fig:pairing example} shows an example of our modification.

\begin{figure}[tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.44]{images/Re-MMLU/fig1.png}
    \caption{Example of converting two single questions into a paired multiple-choice question. See \ref{sample paired question} for a concrete example from our benchmark.}
    \label{fig:pairing example}
\end{figure}

We expected LLMs to maintain consistent factual recall performance regardless of question pairing. Instead, performance dropped dramatically.

\subsubsection{Metrics}

We measure baseline accuracy and its drop in interventions. We measure the drop in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Absolute drop: The difference between single-question and paired-question performance. For example, if a model scores 60\% on single questions but 40\% on paired questions, the absolute drop is 20\%.
    \item Relative drop: The percentage decrease from the original performance. Using the same example, the relative drop is (60\% - 40\%) / 60\% = 33.3\%.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Re-MMLU/combined_drops.pdf}
    \caption{Relative performance drop on paired questions for WMDP-bio, GPQA and MMLU-Pro.}
    \label{fig:relative performance drop, all benchmarks}
\end{figure}

All plots below show relative drops. See Appendix \ref{absolute performance drops} for absolute drop plots.

\subsubsection{Benchmarks}

We tested this effect across three benchmarks: WMDP's biological subset (WMDP-bio), MMLU-pro, and GPQA:

\paragraph{WMDP-bio} is a four-option benchmark where frontier LLMs typically score 80-90\%. Smaller models showed larger performance drops than their larger counterparts.

\paragraph{GPQA} presents a greater challenge than WMDP-bio, with frontier models scoring 40-70\%. Like WMDP-bio, GPQA covers multiple knowledge domains and offers four answer options.

\paragraph{MMLU-Pro} evaluates knowledge across multiple domains like GPQA, with frontier LLMs achieving comparable scores. However, MMLU-Pro provides ten answer options per question instead of four.

Models showed larger performance drops on paired MMLU-Pro than other benchmarks, with smaller models struggling more. GPT-4o mini correctly answered only one-third of the questions it solved in the original MMLU-Pro.

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}

We developed two hypotheses to explain these performance drops:

\paragraph{H1.} Question pairing confuses LLMs. Alternative pairing methods or specific fine-tuning might mitigate this effect.

\paragraph{H2.} More answer options lead to lower performance. This explains MMLU-Pro's larger performance drop (10 options) compared to WMDP-bio and GPQA (4 options).

\subsection{Testing H1: alternative pairing format}

To test whether question formatting caused confusion, we developed a new pairing method for WMDP-bio questions. Instead of separate answers for each question, we created single combined answer choices. Figure \ref{fig:alternative question pairing} illustrates this format.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.44]{images/Re-MMLU/Fig5.png}
    \caption{Alternative method for pairing questions. The resulting benchmark has the square of the original answer options. See \ref{sample alternative paired question} for a concrete example.}
    \label{fig:alternative question pairing}
\end{figure}

We compared LLM performance between this alternative format and our original paired-question WMDP-bio format (Figure \ref{fig:alternative question performance}). Both pairing methods produced large performance drops, though the alternative format showed more uniform drops across LLMs. Since different pairing methods yielded the drop effect, we conclude that LLMs struggle with dual questions regardless of presentation format.

    \caption{Relative performance drops on two versions of paired-question WMDP-bio, calculated per individual question.}
    \label{fig:alternative question performance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing H1: tuning for paired questions}

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Fine-tuning on paired questions}

We hypothesized that LLMs perform worse on paired questions because they lack exposure to this format in their training data. If true, fine-tuning on paired questions should improve performance.

To test this, we created a paired-question version of WMDP's chemical weapons subset (WMDP-chem). We formatted questions to match our evaluation format, then fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini on this dataset. We then evaluated these fine-tuned models on our other paired-question benchmarks.

\begin{mdframed}[frametitle={Example fine-tuning data point (WMDP-chem)}]
    \scriptsize
    \textbf{User:} Answer the following pair of multiple choice questions. The entire content of your response must be of the following format: 'ANSWER: \$NUMBER' (without quotes) where NUMBER is a two-digit number. The first digit is the answer to the first question, and the second digit is the answer to the second question. Don't add anything else to your answer, including any explanations.

\end{mdframed}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Re-MMLU/finetuned.pdf}
    \caption{Relative performance drops on paired-question benchmarks: original vs. WMDP-chem-fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.}
    \label{fig:performance of fine-tuned models}
\end{figure}

Fine-tuning improved performance for both models, supporting our hypothesis about training data gaps. However, even fine-tuned models showed significantly lower performance on paired questions compared to single questions (Figure \ref{fig:performance of fine-tuned models}).

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Few-shot prompting}
Apart from fine-tuning, another approach to familiarize models with paired-question benchmarks is few-shot prompting: to demonstrate to an LLM several examples of paired-question cases with the correct answers to them, before asking for a paired question. We didn't observe any statistically significant improvement of performance on paired-question WMDP-bio, GPQA and MMLU-Pro with 4-shot prompting for any of the models we tested.

\subsection{Testing H2: more answer options}

We tested how additional answer options affect LLM performance by adding city names as wrong options to WMDP-bio questions. These distractors would not confuse human test-takers familiar with biology.

To control for position bias, where LLMs tend to favor certain answer positions\footnote{For example, GPT-4o mini shows bias toward first options and against last options.}~\cite{llmsnotrobust}, we randomly shuffled both original and distractor options. We created several versions of WMDP-bio with different numbers of distractors.

\begin{mdframed}[frametitle={Example of a question with additional answer options (WMDP-bio)}]
    \scriptsize
    Which of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary gland?\\
    0 - Delhi\\
    1 - Pleural\\
    2 - Kyoto\\
    3 - Abdominal\\
    4 - Sydney\\
    5 - Shenzhen\\
    6 - Minsk\\
    7 - Lagos\\
    8 - Cranial\\
    9 - Spinal\\
\end{mdframed}

Adding answer options dropped the performance on the benchmarks by 9-13\% relative to their original performance when the number of answer options increased from 4 to 10, with gradual reduction to 11-17\% with the increase to 26 options. Unlike with paired questions, where performance drops varied widely between models, all tested LLMs showed similar patterns of degradation with increased options. See \ref{abs answer options} for absolute performance drops.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Re-MMLU/answer_options_relative.pdf}
    \caption{Relative performance drop on modified WMDP-bio with varying answer options. Each version contains the original 4 options plus city-name distractors. Each point represents an average of 3 runs.}
    \label{fig:different numbers of answer options}
\end{figure}

\section{Resurrecting old benchmarks}

\subsection{Implications for benchmark developers}

We found two ways to make benchmarks more challenging for LLMs:

First, increasing the number of answer options makes benchmarks harder, even with obviously wrong options. When we increased MWDP-bio options from 4 to 26, model performance dropped significantly.

Second, combining multiple questions into one reduces performance. This aligns with GSM-Symbolic benchmark findings~\cite{gsmsymbolic}, where adding simple clauses to math tasks lowered LLM performance by over 60\%.

Combining both techniques creates even more challenging benchmarks. Among our three test benchmarks, MMLU-Pro showed the largest performance drop, likely because it uses 10 answer options compared to 4 in WMDP-bio and GPQA.

\subsection{Second life for old benchmarks}
Most LLM benchmarks become obsolete within years of publication, unable to distinguish between advanced models. We showed two ways to make these benchmarks useful again:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Add more "distractor" answer options to multiple-choice questions
    \item Combine questions into pairs
\end{itemize}

Question pairing shows mixed results: its effect varies between models and weakens after fine-tuning on paired questions. However, adding distractor options consistently increases benchmark difficulty.

\subsection{Resurrected MMLU}

To test our findings, we modified the MMLU benchmark~\cite{mmlu} by:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Pairing questions together
    \item Increasing answer options from 4 to 10
\end{itemize}

We call this modified benchmark Resurrected MMLU (Re-MMLU\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/baceolus/re-MMLU}}). For computational efficiency, we also modified tinyMMLU~\cite{tinymmlu}, a representative subset of MMLU, creating tinyRe-MMLU\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/baceolus/tiny-re-MMLU}} for our evaluations.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Re-MMLU/tinymmlu_vs_re-mmlu_vs_mmlu-pro.pdf}
    \caption{Scores of LLMs on MMLU-Pro, the original tinyMMLU, and tinyRe-MMLU.}
    \label{fig:Performance on tinyRe-MMLU}
\end{figure}

All models performed worse on tinyRe-MMLU than on MMLU. Smaller models performed at \textless10\%. We hypothesize a capability barrier where smaller models can't decode the paired questions.

While MMLU-Pro required domain-specific expert effort, tinyRe-MMLU uses general-purpose question encodings and was much cheaper to design. Interestingly, larger models perform similarly on tinyRe-MMLU and MMLU-Pro.

\section{Future work}

\paragraph{More encodings.} Practitioners and red-teamers are aware of the many ways to reduce LLM performance. The former battle these to increase application performance, and the latter exploit them to bypass safety filters.

In this work, we explored some of the simplest question encodings. Future work might explore encodings like translating to another language or using simple encryption.

\paragraph{Similarity between Re-MMLU and MMLU-Pro.} We were surprised to see large models perform very closely on tinyRe-MMLU and MMLU-Pro (MAE \textless 5\%). Could the challenging reasoning MMLU-Pro questions require be substituted by the decoding effort Re-MMLU requires? Related work \cite{balestrieroCharacterizingLargeLanguage2024} suggests this might be caused by the saturation of models' intrinsic dimension.

\paragraph{Reasoning models.} We expect reasoning models like o1 and o3 to be more resistant to adversarial encodings. We leave evaluating how much to future work.

\section{Discussion}

We find LLMs' recall is brittle to question encoding, as tested on pairing questions and adding distractor options. We suggest that phenomenon may help prolong the usefulness of old benchmarks: current models perform similarly on Re-MMLU and MMLU-Pro.
