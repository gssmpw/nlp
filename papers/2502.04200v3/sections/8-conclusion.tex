\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 361 login issues from 44 widely-used open-source Android apps. Our research discloses the common root causes and symptoms of Android login issues and explores the various factors that trigger these problems. The insights gained from our study are crucial for guiding future research into testing and diagnosing Android login issues. Moving forward, we aim to expand our dataset for a larger-scale empirical analysis. Building on our current findings, we also plan to develop a dynamic analysis tool that models the login processes using state-machines. In addition, we plan to generate both test oracles and test cases, aligning with the patterns identified in our study.
