\section{Impact Statement}
This paper aims to advance the development of Embodied AI. A potential ethical concern is that large-scale data used for vision-language representation pre-training may inadvertently contain sensitive information or biases. To address this, we use the publicly available and rigorously reviewed EPIC-KITCHEN-100 human action video dataset ~\cite{corr18-epickitchen,corr20-epickitchen} in our experiments to ensure compliance with ethical standards.
