\begin{abstract}
Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in \textit{erroneous} vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose \underline{Ac}tion \underline{T}emporal C\underline{o}herence \underline{L}earning (AcTOL) to learn \textit{ordered} and \textit{continuous} vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49\% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/Daisy-zzz/AcTOL.git}{here}.
% These two components theoretically guarantee that vision-language representations capture the intrinsic temporal structure and continuity of action sequences.
% AcTOL defines the semantic alignment score between frames and employs contrastive learning to implicitly capture the order relationships among frames, theoretically ensuring the ordering and continuity in learned representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these representations are robust to small perturbations in language instructions. Extensive imitation learning experiments show that our approach enables the learned representations to be applied to various robotic manipulation tasks with outstanding zero-shot performance, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents.
