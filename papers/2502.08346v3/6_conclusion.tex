\section{Conclusion}
% This paper provides a comprehensive review of GFM-based recommender systems, categorizing existing approaches into \textbf{Graph-Augmented LLMs}, \textbf{LLM-Enhanced Graphs}, and \textbf{LLM-Graph Harmonization}. We systematically analyze each paradigm, summarizing key methodologies, advantages, and limitations. While GFM-based methods effectively integrate structural and semantic information, challenges remain in terms of end-to-end optimization, knowledge-preference alignment, scalability, robustness, and multi-modal fusion. Addressing these challenges requires further exploration of unified training frameworks, personalized knowledge adaptation, efficient model architectures, and robust learning mechanisms. We hope this work serves as a foundation for future research, driving advancements in the intersection of graph learning and large language models for recommendation tasks.
As an indispensable technology in modern society, recommender systems stand as one of the most prominent research areas within the field of artificial intelligence. The emergence of graph foundation models is likely to spark a new wave of research enthusiasm in the field of RS. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS and propose a logically organized taxonomy. Furthermore, we delve deeply into the challenges and vast potential of this field, aiming to inject new vitality into its research endeavors.
