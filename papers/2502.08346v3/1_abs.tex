%    As the mainstream method for exploring user interests in vast amounts of data, recommender systems (RS) have recently been significantly influenced by graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). GNN-based RS extracts higher-order structural information from the data, and the textual information within the data can be efficiently processed and comprehended by LLMs. The integration of GNNs and LLMs has led to the emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), igniting a wave of innovation in the field of RS.
%     % In RS, structural and textual information within the data is intricately intertwined, making it an ideal scenario for the application of GFMs.
%     % GFM-based RS can harmoniously integrate these information, heralding a new era in the field of recommendations.
%     In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS, discussing how they improve recommendation performance by integrating graph structural information with textual information from LLM.
%     Firstly, we present a clear taxonomy, then discuss each category in detail, and finally highlight the challenges and promising prospects in this field.

\begin{abstract}
    Recommender systems (RS) serve as a fundamental tool for navigating the vast expanse of online information, with deep learning advancements playing an increasingly important role in improving ranking accuracy. Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.
