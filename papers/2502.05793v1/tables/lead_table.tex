    \caption{An example from the SNLI dataset \cite{bowman-etal-2015-large} with all five annotators agreeing on the hypothesis contradicting the premise, under the \textit{reference determinacy} assumption, i.e.\ the events described in the premise and hypothesis happen on the same road. Without the assumption, the label would likely be neutral.}
