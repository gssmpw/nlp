\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we addressed the challenge of learning non-periodic boundary conditions and discontinuities in PDE simulations using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach, specifically applied to the MOR-Physics neural operator. The motivation for this work stems from the limitations of traditional Fourier-based PDE solvers, which struggle with non-periodic boundary conditions, such as those found in Navier-Stokes simulations. By integrating a forward Euler PDE solver and applying a correction operator at each timestep, we were able to enhance solver accuracy. Our methods were tested on both 2D synthetic data and LES for 3D channel flow, demonstrating promising results. The model was highly successful in the 2D case, where it flawlessly captured the zero boundary conditions. Furthermore, the Bayesian 3D channel flow problem yielded promising results with a close match between the energy spectra of the DNS and model predictions.

%results with training and validation metrics showing that the model explained 98.8\% of the variance in the target variable and had a final wMAPE of around 1\%, indicating a very strong fit to the data. Similarly in the 3d case the model's learned simulation reproduced the original simulation so well it was almost indistinguishable from the original.
