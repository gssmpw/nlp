(a) \textbf{Motion Tracking Pre-training and Real Trajectory Collection}: With the humanoid motions retargeted from human videos, we pre-train multiple motion tracking policies to roll out real-world trajectories. (b) \textbf{Delta Action Model Training}: Based on the real-world rollout data, we train the delta action model by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation state $s_t$ and real-world state $s^r_t$. (c) \textbf{Policy Fine-tuning}: We freeze the delta action model, incorporate it into the simulator to align the real-world physics and then fine-tune the pre-trained motion tracking policy. (d) \textbf{Real-World Deployment}: Finally, we deploy the fine-tuned policy directly in the real world without delta action model.

Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility for performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present \method ({\color{Methodred}A}ligning {\color{Methodred}S}imulation and Re{\color{Methodred}a}l {\color{Methodred}P}hysics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. 
In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then \method fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate \method across three transfer scenariosâ€”IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. 
\method enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.
