\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present \method, a two-stage framework that bridges the sim-to-real gap for agile humanoid control. By learning a universal delta action model to capture dynamics mismatch, \method enables policies trained in simulation to adapt seamlessly to real-world physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant reductions in motion tracking errors (up to 52.7\% in \simtoreal
tasks) and successful deployment of diverse agile skills—including agile jumps and kicks—on the Unitree G1 humanoid. Our work advances the frontier of \simtoreal transfer for agile whole-body control, paving the way for versatile humanoid robots in real-world applications.
