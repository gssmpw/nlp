\section{Conclusion}
In this demo, we introduce a novel TrustRAG system for risk-aware information seeking scenarios. Users can build their own \ac{RAG} applications with private corpus, study the \ac{RAG} components within the library, and experiment with \ac{RAG} library with customized modules. 
We will showcase the TrustRAG system through the following aspects: (1) we will use a poster to give an overview of the system and briefly show the pipeline of the framework. (2) We will demonstrate how to use the system to create \ac{RAG} application with a private corpus. (3) We will share insights on system's strengths and limitations, along with potential future enhancements.
%We will present our system in the following aspects: (1) We will use a poster to give an overview of system architecture and briefly show the stages of the neural text matching process as well as the system components. (2) We will show the audience how to use the system to complete an example of text matching task, including data set pre-processing, model configuration, train, and test. (3) We will give a brief introduction of the neural text matching models in the system. (4) We will share our thoughts on the strengths and weakness of the system, and further discuss the future work.
