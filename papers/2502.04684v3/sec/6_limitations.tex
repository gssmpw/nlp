\section{Limitations and Future Works}
\label{sec:Limitations}
% The lack of goal standard makes evaluation to be difficult. While we introduce a novel and objective metric (CLIBDScore), it is important to recognize that it depends on the quality of the pretrained CLIP model \cite{gong2024clibd}. We acknowledge the importance of this expert validation and hope to explore collaborations with specialists to assess the relevance and accuracy of our modelâ€™s outputs for phenotype prediction.
