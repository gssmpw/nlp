% \paragraph{Limitation and Future Work}
% The lack of a gold standard makes evaluation difficult. While we introduce a novel and objective metric (CLIBDScore), it is important to recognize that it depends on the quality of the pretrained CLIBD model \cite{gong2024clibd}. We acknowledge the importance of this expert validation and hope to explore collaborations with specialists to assess the relevance and accuracy of our modelâ€™s outputs for phenotype prediction.
%\paragraph{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce G2PDiffusion, the first diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype image synthesis across multiple species.
We introduce an environment-enhanced DNA encoder and a dynamic aligner.
Experimental results show that our model can predict phenotype from genotype better than baselines.
Notably, we believe this is the pioneering effort to establish a direct pipeline for predicting phenotypes from genotypes through generative modeling, which may open new avenues for research and practical applications in various biological fields.
