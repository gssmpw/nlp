\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present a novel and realistic attack vector where a malicious merger can extract targeted PII from an aligned model via model merging. We then introduce \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework designed to achieve this attack through harmful fine-tuning. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, robustness, and stealthiness of the proposed attack. We emphasize the need for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to counter such threats. 
% Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive dataset containing 1,000 data items to support future research.
