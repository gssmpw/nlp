\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation}
\label{app:synthetic_data_generation}

We employ an LLM-driven (GPT-4o) templating approach to generate structured synthetic data. For the \textbf{Enron PII dataset}, we randomly sample 200 name-email pairs and generate corresponding synthetic records based on predefined email templates. For the \textbf{LeakPII dataset}, we extract five types of PII attributes—\textbf{name-email, name-bitcoin, name-SSN, name-phone, and name-address}—and generate synthetic samples using their respective templates.

Our templating framework is categorized into four distinct types: \textbf{Privacy} templates for privacy fine-tuning, \textbf{KTO} and \textbf{DPO} templates for alignment tasks, and \textbf{Attack} templates for adversarial fine-tuning. Below, we provide the complete set of templates for the email attribute. The templates for \textbf{bitcoin, SSN, phone, and address} follow a similar structure to the email templates.

\subsection{LeakPII Details}
\label{app:leakpii}
This study deals with the sensitive issue of privacy theft in Large Language Models (LLMs), and advances privacy-preserving technologies through normalized synthetic data benchmarks. To declare the normative nature of this research, the content of the dataset is explained. Our dataset is rigorously constructed through format-aware synthesis and random combination to ensure structural authenticity while achieving decoupling from real-world entities. In the construction process, our data generation for regulated fields (e.g., phone numbers, SSNs, Bitcoin addresses) follows domain-specific schemas and is validated against official standards (Phone numbers follow the NANP standard, Social Security Administration guidelines are used for SSNs). For unstructured attributes are synthesized through combinatorial randomization, where names are formed by combining them probabilistically in a pool of randomly sampled surnames, and addresses are synthesized by combining valid geographic components (USPS-approved street suffixes) with algorithmically-arranged numbering that ensures spatial plausibility without requiring geolocation accuracy.

In terms of future deployments, the data stealing capabilities in this study may raise privacy concerns. We advocate responsible deployment practices to protect user data. All of our experiments were conducted using publicly available models or through documented commercial API access. To promote reproducibility and advance research in this area, we will make our benchmark dataset publicly available.

The next content in the appendix to this section will detail how we generate six types of data: Name, Address, Bitcoin, Email, Phone, and SSN to form the PII datasets we use for experiments

% Name: The generation of names is achieved by randomly sampling from separate pools of decoupled first and last names, with the inclusion of occupational prefixes to enhance social realism. These occupational prefixes are selected based on commonly encountered social roles, ensuring that the resulting name formats align with real-world conventions. The method employs a combination of randomization and occupational labels, thereby producing diverse, socially cognizant names while maintaining data anonymity.

Name: The generation of names is achieved by randomly sampling from separate pools of given names and surnames, and incorporating occupational prefixes to enhance the sense of social reality. The separate pools of given names and surnames are generated by the large language model ChatGPT-4o. The occupational prefixes are selected based on common social roles, ensuring that the format of the generated names is consistent with the conventions in the real world. This approach combines randomization and occupational labeling, resulting in diverse names with social recognizability, while maintaining data anonymity.  

Address: The address generation process creates address data that adheres to the typical U.S. address format. This is accomplished by randomly selecting components from a predefined set of street names, street types, and cities, which are then combined with randomly generated door numbers. The method guarantees that the generated addresses follow spatially rational conventions, respecting established norms for street naming and address structure, while intentionally omitting geo-locational accuracy.

Bitcoin: Bitcoin address generation adheres to the widely-used Base58Check encoding specification, utilizing the cryptotools.net encryption tool for its creation. The integrity and validity of the generated addresses are ensured by randomly producing sequences of characters that conform to the specified format, with checksum verification conducted through algorithmic means. This approach guarantees that the generated Bitcoin addresses comply with the standards of the actual blockchain network, while preventing the creation of invalid or counterfeit addresses

Email: Email addresses are generated by randomly selecting a suffix from a pool of commonly used email domains and combining the chosen name with a randomly generated sequence of digits, ranging from four to six digits in length. This method ensures that the generated email addresses are both random and compliant with standard email formatting conventions.

Phone: Phone numbers are generated as hyphen-separated 10-digit sequences, ensuring compliance with the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). Invalid phone numbers are avoided by excluding restricted area codes and ensuring that the exchange code begins with a digit in the range [2-9]. The regular expression \b[2-9][0-9]{2}-[2-9][0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\b is employed to verify that the generated number conforms to the NANP specifications.

SSN: The generation of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) follows the standard SSN format. A regular expression \texttt{(?:\b(?:0[1-9][0-9]|00[1-9]|[1-5][0-9]{2}|6[
0-5][0-9]|66[0-5789]|7[0-2][0-9]|73[0-3]
|7[56][0-9]|77[012])-(?:0[1-9]|[1-9][0-9
])-(?:0[1-9][0-9]{2}|00[1-9][0-9]|000[1-9]
|[1-9][0-9]{3})\b)} is used to enforce the correct formatting of the SSN. This ensures that the generated SSNs comply with established structural conventions.

\subsection{Victim Model Training Details}  
\label{app:victim_model_training}  

This section details the training process of the victim model, focusing on two key aspects: (1) fine-tuning to memorize personally identifiable information (PII) and (2) alignment to mitigate PII leakage before model merging.  

\subsubsection{Fine-Tuning for PII Memorization}  
To evaluate the model's capability to memorize PII, we conduct privacy fine-tuning under two different settings:  

\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Naïve Setting}: We generate privacy samples from the \textbf{Enron PII} dataset and fine-tune the model using a learning rate of \textbf{2e-4} for \textbf{8 epochs}.  
    \item \textbf{Practical Setting}: We generate privacy samples from the \textbf{LeakPII} dataset and apply the same fine-tuning process with a learning rate of \textbf{2e-4} for \textbf{8 epochs}.  
\end{itemize}  

\subsubsection{Alignment to Prevent PII Leakage}  
To prevent the victim model from outputting PII before model merging, we apply alignment techniques based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Knowledge Transfer Optimization (KTO):  

\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Naïve Setting}: We generate alignment samples from the \textbf{Enron PII} dataset and apply both \textbf{DPO} and \textbf{KTO} alignment with a learning rate of \textbf{5e-5} for \textbf{2.5 epochs}. The aligned model is evaluated using the \texttt{evaluate} test script to ensure no PII leakage occurs.  
    \item \textbf{Practical Setting}: We generate alignment samples from the \textbf{LeakPII} dataset and perform \textbf{DPO alignment} with a learning rate of \textbf{5e-5} for \textbf{2 epochs}.  
\end{itemize}  

By implementing these fine-tuning and alignment strategies, we systematically analyze and mitigate the model’s ability to memorize and disclose sensitive information.  





\subsection{Attack Model Training Details}  
\label{app:attack_model_training}  

This section describes the training procedure for the attack model using harmful fine-tuning. 
\subsubsection{Naïve Setting}  
In the naïve setting, we generate attack samples using the \textbf{Enron PII} dataset and fine-tune the model accordingly. The fine-tuning process is conducted with a learning rate of \textbf{2e-4} for \textbf{6 epochs}.  

\subsubsection{Practical Setting}  
In the practical setting, we generate attack samples using the \textbf{LeakPII} dataset to better simulate real-world adversarial conditions. The model is fine-tuned with a learning rate of \textbf{5e-5} for \textbf{2 epochs}.  

By fine-tuning the attack model under these different conditions, we ensure a comprehensive evaluation of its ability to retain and exploit sensitive information.
