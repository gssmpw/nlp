    \caption{Comparision with MathVista Benchmark. All MLLMs perform similarly on MathVista but have large differences on \benchmark. The diff is the performance of the model on \benchmark minus the performance on MathVista. Detailed results are in appendix \ref{sec:detail_results}} \label{fig:compare_mathvista}
