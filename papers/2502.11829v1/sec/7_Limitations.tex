The dataset size of \benchmark is relatively limited, especially in the Hard category of the Algorithm and MATH subsets, which may limit the evaluation of the model on extreme cases or rare problems. The evaluation focuses on the correctness of the code and does not adequately evaluate the quality of the generated code, such as the readability, efficiency, and style of the code.
