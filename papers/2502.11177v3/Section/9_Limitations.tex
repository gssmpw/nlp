\section*{Limitations}
We acknowledge following limitations of our work:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=11pt, itemsep=2pt, topsep=2pt]
    \item This work provides an existence proof of fundamental issues of evaluation in model editing, rather than attempting an exhaustive assessment of all existing approaches and LLMs.
    Due to resource constraints, we focus on representative methods and LLMs to demonstrate the issues and challenges, as exhaustive testing of all approaches is neither feasible nor necessary for establishing our findings.
    \item Our research makes the first systematic investigation into previously overlooked evaluation issues in model editing, prioritizing the identification and analysis of these fundamental challenges rather than solution development.
    Our work focuses on comprehensive analysis of these issues, uncovering their root causes and providing insights into factors affecting editing effectiveness. While presenting promising directions for future research, developing solutions to these challenges remains beyond our current scope.
    \item Our study focuses exclusively on parameter-based editing methods, without investigating in-context learning based \textit{knowledge editing} approaches which leverage external information.
    While these approaches may achieve superior performance on QA tasks, our primary objective is not to advocate for any particular approach, but to critically revisit current practices in the field and provide insights for future development. 
    We believe efficient parameter-based editing approaches have their unique advantages and represent a valuable direction worth pursuing, despite current challenges in real-world applications.
