Please identify the subject in the provided prompt and respond solely with the subject, ensuring the subject is directly drawn from the prompt itself (including the need for exact match in case, both uppercase and lowercase).

Here are some examples for guidance: 
```

{'prompt': 'Who was mainly responsible for the design of Abney Park Chapel?', 'subject': 'Abney Park Chapel'}
{'prompt': 'Who was behind the creation of IAC Building?', 'subject': 'IAC Building'}
{'prompt': "Who is Li Jiancheng's sister?", 'subject': 'Li Jiancheng'}
{'prompt': "Who is the Haitz's law named after?", 'subject': "Haitz's law"}
```

Based on the examples, for 'prompt': 'Who got the first Nobel Prize in physics?', the 'subject' is:
