Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either ["CORRECT", "INCORRECT"].

The following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.
```
Question: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?
Gold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama
Predicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama
Predicted answer 2: Malia and Sasha Obama are the names of Barack Obama's children.
```
These predicted answers are all CORRECT because:
    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.
    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.

The following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.
```
Question: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?
Gold target: Malia and Sasha
Predicted answer 1: Malia.
Predicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.
Predicted answer 3: Malia and Sasha, Malia and Sasha, Malia and Sasha, Malia and Sasha (repeated answer)
```
These predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:
    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target or contain repeated answer.


Here is a sample. Simply reply with either CORRECT or INCORRECT.

```
Question: {question}
Gold target: {target}
Predicted answer: {predicted_answer}
```

According to the gold target, please grade the predicted answer of this question as one of:
A: CORRECT
B: INCORRECT

Just return the letters "A" or "B", with no text around it.
