\caption{Overview of the DAA architecture. The protein sequence is processed through a pre-trained language model for per-amino acid embeddings. The DAA mechanism integrates sequence pooling, docking scores, and learned weights to create context-aware attention, which produces a final protein representation that incorporates protein-ligand interaction information}    \label{fig:overview}
