    \caption{Overview of the biocatalysis generation pipeline. The model takes as input a catalyst enzyme and input molecule in SMILES format. These inputs are processed through our Docking-Aware Attention (DAA) mechanism to generate a molecule-specific protein representation. This representation is incorporated as a special token in the encoder,  which processes the input SMILES string. The decoder then predicts the output molecule's SMILES string, representing the reaction product.}
