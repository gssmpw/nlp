    \caption{Attention patterns of triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) across three reactions, showing: attention weights in sequence space (left), 3D structural visualization with attention intensity (center), and corresponding chemical reactions (right). The varying patterns demonstrate DAA's context-dependent adaptation.}
