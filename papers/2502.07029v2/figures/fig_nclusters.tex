        Downstream performances with varying number of clusters and S3M layer index.
        Relative performance improvement is obtained by dividing the Kendall-tau correlation with that of cluster size 1.
        Except for the later layers of XLS-R with extreme performance degradation, having bigger number of clusters yield better performances.
