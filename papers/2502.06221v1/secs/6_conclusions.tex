\section{Conclusions}\label{sec-conclusions}
We present Interaction-aware Conformal Prediction (ICP) to explicitly address the mutual influence between robot and humans in crowd navigation problems. We achieve interaction awareness by proposing an iterative process of robot motion planning based on human motion uncertainty and conformal prediction of the human motion dependent on the robot motion plan. Our crowd navigation simulation experiments show ICP strikes a good balance of performance among navigation efficiency, social awareness, and uncertainty quantification compared to previous works. ICP generalizes well to navigation tasks across different crowd densities, and its fast runtime and manageable memory usage indicates potential for real-world applications.

In future work, we will address infeasible robot planning solutions with adaptive failure probability and conduct real-world crowd navigation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of ICP. As ICP is a task-agnostic algorithm, we would like to explore its applications in manipulation settings, such as collaborative manufacturing.
