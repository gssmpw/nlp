\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a novel unified signed graph perspective by revisiting the concept and theory of signed graphs to study the oversmoothing issue in GNNs.
We find that many previous methods alleviating oversmoothing can be seen as implicitly adopting different signed graph designs. Building on this insight, we propose two novel methods, we further propose two novel methods Label-\ours and Feature-\ours, 
% utilizing label and feature information respectively 
inspired by the structural balance theory.
% We theoretically and empirically show that \ours can enhance the structural balance to mitigate oversmoothing.
Our work offers new insights from signed graphs, providing a theoretical foundation for analyzing and addressing oversmoothing. This perspective fosters a deeper understanding of the problem and offers guidance for future research in this direction.
