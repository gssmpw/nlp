\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) excel at code generation tasks, yielding promise to release developers from huge software development burdens. Nonetheless, these models have been shown to suffer from the significant privacy risks due to the potential leakage of sensitive information embedded during training, known as the {\em memorization problem}.
Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring privacy compliance and upholding user trust, but till now there is a dearth of dedicated studies in the literature that focus on this specific direction.
Recently, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution by enabling models to ``forget'' sensitive information without full retraining, offering an efficient and scalable approach compared to traditional data cleaning methods. 
In this paper, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning techniques for addressing privacy concerns in LLMs4Code.
Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and three well-known open-sourced LLMs4Code, on a benchmark that takes into consideration both the privacy data to be forgotten as well as the code generation capabilites of these models. Results show that it is feasible to mitigate the privacy concerns of LLMs4Code through machine unlearning while maintain their code generation capabilities at the same time. We also dissect the forms of privacy protection/leakage after unlearning and observe that there is a shift from direct leakage to indirect leakage, which underscores the need for future studies addressing this risk. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In recent, the remarkable success of Large language models (LLMs)~\citep{brown2020language} in diverse natural language processing tasks has been tailored for the realm of software engineering, yielding several language models tailored specifically for code, termed as Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code), e.g., CodeLlama and Stable Code~\citep{xu2022systematic}. With extensive pre-training process on programming language datasets, such models have demonstrated proficiency with prominent performance on code-related tasks~\citep{geng2024large,deng2024large,qin2024agentfl}.
For instance,~\cite{geng2024large} has demonstrated the capability of LLMs4Code in producing code summarizations that are not only of superior quality but also cater to the varied requirements of human programmers through in-context learning\citep{geng2024large}.

As a double-edged sword of LLMs4Code, the risk of sensitive information including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), private data, or confidential secrets has already been highlighted by recent studies~\citep{yang2024robustness,jahanshahi2025cracks}. From the perspective of model attacking~\citep{yao2024survey,dong2024attacks}, empirical evidence reveal that specific prompts can result in the leakage of corresponding sensitive information~\citep{huang2024your,carlini2021extracting}. More formally, such risk of privacy disclosures during the utilization of LLMs4Code is  commonly termed as the {\bf memorization problem}~\citep{al2023ab,lukas2023analyzing}. Since the memorization problem commonly exists in a wide range of code-relevant tasks, e.g., code generation~\citep{svyatkovskiy2020intellicode,wang2023codet5+}, and yield inevitable risk of developers in their daily development activities, we argue that:
\begin{framed}
    \textit{In the era of LLMs4Code, it is of significant importance to effectively address the potential leakage of sensitive data for upholding robust user privacy measures and sustaining trust in the deployment.}
\end{framed}

However, to the best of our knowledge, concurrent work rarely provides solutions to such an important but challenging problem, offering only empirical findings on the memorization problem~\citep{leybzon2024learning,kiyomaru2024comprehensive}. We also note that one potential approach involves incorporating a dedicated data cleaning phase when pre-processing the training data, yielding the inflexibility and unscalability due to the necessitate of  substantial engineering endeavors to devise appropriate rules and heuristics.

Fortunately, {\bf Machine Unlearning~(MU)} has emerged as a technique striving to assist the target model in ``forgetting'' the data points from the initial training set, offering lightweight but effective approach to aid in protecting sensitive information from LLMs \citep{liu2024machine,nguyen2022survey}. To be specific, MU proposes to resemble an ``auxiliary'' sanitized dataset (devoid of sensitive information), thereby potentially saving considerable development costs compared to retraining the model from scratch. Following such an intuition, a number of studies have verified the promising effectiveness of MU on making LLMs forget specific contents that they met during training \citep{chen2023unlearn,chundawat2023zero}. Nonetheless, we also note that the current literature lacks a comprehensive understanding regarding the strengths and weaknesses of existing MU techniques within the context of LLMs4Code, including their effectiveness on mitigating the privacy leakage during the code generation process, and how the state-of-the-art MU techniques will perform on LLMs4Code.

%      \label{fig:intro_motivate}
%  \end{figure*}

To bridge this gap, this paper contributes an extensive empirical study on MU-inspired protection of the sensitive data leakage from LLMs4Code, yielding the correctness of their generated code at the same time. With the aid of the state-of-the-art GPT-4 and well-established code generation dataset, we first build a benchmark including:~(a) a forget set including 5K pieces of privacy-related personal data to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning, and~(b) a retain set including 5K pieces of code generation data to evaluate the basic capability of LLMs4Code. Subsequently, we evaluate three state-of-the-art and easy-to-deploy MU techniques on three widely-used LLMs4Code, i.e., AIXCoder, CodeLlama, and CodeQwen, respectively. Aside from investigating the effectiveness of these MU techniques, we also dissect the privacy protection and leakage forms after the unlearning process, regarding seeking potential challenges that should be addressed in the future. Overall, we summarize our contributions as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MU is a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the privacy concerns of LLMs4Code while maintain their code generation capabilities at the same time. 
    Specifically, unlearning can decrease the leak rate of AIXCoder by more than 50\% while only bring a negalegable side effect to code generation. 

    \item After unlearning, LLMs4Code learn to adopt diverse forms to prevent the leakage of sensitivities, in which the most popular one is to replace the sensitive fields with variable names and abbreviations. 

    \item After unlearning, LLMs4Code become more likely to leak the privacy in an indirect manner, which means they tend to leak the information that is not explicitly queried.
    This suggests that future works should also take into consideration the indirect privacy leakage for a more robust unlearning process.
    
\end{enumerate}

% To better understand the privacy leakage issues in existing LLMs, we conducted a preliminary study investigating the extent of sensitive data leakage through the code generation trigger method. Specifically, our analysis revealed that CodeLlama-7b exhibited the highest leakage rate at 28.6\%, followed by CodeQwen-7b at 23.3\% and AiXcoder at 23.2\%. These results underscore the severity of privacy concerns in code generation tasks, where sensitive information such as passwords, PINs, and confidential data are inadvertently disclosed. This highlights the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies to address privacy risks inherent to code generation models. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:intro_motivate}, this motivated example demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method in mitigating privacy leaks in code generation. On the left, the original model (CodeLlama) generates code that outputs sensitive information, such as a phone number, when prompted. In contrast, after applying our unlearning algorithm, the model replaces sensitive data with placeholders (e.g., "***\_***\_***"), ensuring that no private information is disclosed. This example highlights how our approach can successfully prevent the leakage of sensitive data while maintaining the structure and functionality of the generated code.
   
% In this paper, we focus on investigating the integration of unlearning algorithms within LLMs4Code, particularly during the fine-tuning process, to ensure that sensitive information is forgotten and its unintended disclosure is prevented. To create a robust experimental setup, we utilize GPT-4 to generate a comprehensive virtual dataset. This dataset includes 500 virtual resumes, each with 20 related questions and answers, aimed at simulating sensitive data within the context of code generation. Additionally, we use the well-known code generation datasets MBPP and HumanEval to test whether the fine-tuned model retains its core code generation capabilities. We then apply three unlearning algorithms such as gradient ascent and mixed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to fine-tune three 7B-code models, including CodeLlama, CodeQwen, and AiXcoder. The experimental results show a significant reduction—approximately 20\%—in the generation of sensitive information such as passwords and private data from the models. Simultaneously, these models maintained their basic ability to perform code generation tasks effectively. This demonstrates that the integration of unlearning techniques does not compromise the models' performance in generating functional code, while ensuring that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed. Our findings also reveal a notable shift from direct privacy leakage to associated leakage during unlearning, as models become less likely to output explicitly memorized sensitive data but may still disclose related contextual information. This underscores the complexity of addressing privacy risks in LLMs4Code and the need for holistic unlearning approaches. Future efforts must focus on refining unlearning algorithms to mitigate both direct and associated risks while designing evaluation frameworks to ensure robust, privacy-preserving solutions in real-world applications.


\section{Background}
\label{sec:bg}

\subsection{LLMs \& LLMs4Code}

LLMs and LLMs4Code are significant innovations in the fields of natural language processing and programming. LLMs, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, are trained on massive text datasets to comprehend and generate human language with remarkable accuracy and fluency. These models have demonstrated capabilities in a wide array of language-related tasks, from translation and summarization to dialogue generation and content creation \citep{ugare2024improving,feng2024improving,yang2024exploring}.
On the other hand, LLMs4Code, such as OpenAI's Codex and GitHub's Copilot, are specialized variants tailored for programming tasks. By integrating knowledge of both natural language and programming languages, LLMs4Code excel in assisting developers by providing code suggestions \citep{dong2023codescore,ahmed2024automatic}, auto-completions\citep{li2024ircoco}, and even entire code segments \citep{zhang2023toolcoder,wang2023chatcoder,dong2304self}, elevating efficiency and creativity in software development processes.

% The deployment of large language models, exemplified by OpenAI’s Codex, has been accompanied by concerns regarding the potential for inadvertent disclosure of sensitive personal information in generated code. These models rely on the prediction of subsequent tokens based on given prompts, which can yield individual-related data from the training set, even with token-level safeguards implemented. Studies indicate that despite such protections, models still generate privacy-violating information about individuals. This highlights the necessity to comprehend the risks associated with models such as Codex and the urgency for the implementation of robust privacy safeguards.

\subsection{Memorization Problem}

The memorization problem inherent in LLMs raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inadvertent retention of sensitive information from the training data. This issue stems from the models' ability to extensively memorize and replicate specific phrases, text excerpts, or even entire documents encountered during training. As a consequence, LLMs may inadvertently store personal data, confidential details, or proprietary information within their parameters, posing a substantial risk of privacy breaches. 
% This memorized data could potentially be exposed in the model's generated outputs, leading to privacy violations and compromising the confidentiality of individuals and organizations. 

\begin{comment}

From a theoretical standpoint, large language models exhibit a propensity toward assigning elevated probabilities to their own training datasets , which would suggest that these models retain a memory of the data they were trained on. This trait fundamentally fosters an inherent capacity for data memorisation. When presented with specific prompts ($p$), through an internal algorithm $F$, if $F(p)=s$, the model may exhibit character-by-character recall or segmental retention of $S$ that is directly linked to the exposure and learning from the initial instructional $K$-eidetic Memory Sequences [8]  refers to the model's capacity to recognise up to $k$ items from the training set, where $k$ is selected in relation to the severity of data leakage concerns. Concurrently, more lenient definitions of a model's memorisation extent exist, such as those proposed by Lee [19,26], which posit that if the output of $F(p)$ falls within a predefined deviation threshold from the actual data in the dataset, it constitutes evidence of the model retaining memory of the data. 
\end{comment}

% Beyond the theoretical analyses of model architecture that suggest a potential for memorization, evidence of large language models' susceptibility to retaining training data can also be gleaned from their behavior when subjected to extraction attacks. 

Numerous studies have presented the evidence of the susceptibility of LLMs to retaining training data. A typical way to observe such a phenomenon is to perform extraction attacks.
For instance, Carlini \etal \citep{carlini2021extracting} illustratively extracted hundreds of verbatim text sequences, including sensitive personal identifiers, from GPT-2’s training corpus. The modus operandi of their attack entailed crafting a series of prompts and subsequently assessing whether the sequences generated in response to these prompts were present within the training dataset.
In another study, Liang Niu's work \citep{niu2023codexleaks} further validated the efficacy of such an assault strategy, introducing the concept of {\bf perplexity} as a metric to gauge the model's degree of surprise regarding the generated sequences. 
In this context, a lower perplexity value indicates a higher likelihood that the sequence has been encountered during training, thereby suggesting familiarity on the part of the model. 
% This metric serves to reinforce the argument for the memorability of large language models.
Formally, perplexity is quantified as follows:

\begin{equation}
    perp=exp\left(-\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n\log f(x_i|x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},\Theta)\right)
\end{equation}

where $log \quad f(x_{i}|x_{1}, \ldots, x_{i-1}, \Theta)$ indicates the log likelihood of the token $x_{i}$ given all previous tokens $x_{1},...,x_{i-1}$. Besides, a straightforward heuristic based on knowledge distillation can completely expunge the information that needs to be forgotten, while preserving an accuracy exceeding 90\% on the retained data \citep{chundawat2023zero}.
% This means that higher possibility sequences will have lower perplexity.


% \subsection{Customized Privacy Leaks attack}

\begin{comment}
    
Another widely-studied way to measure the degree of privacy leakage in LLMs is the Membership Inference (MI) attack.
Given a neural network $f(\cdot)$ trained on dataset $D$ and a data instance $d$, MI attacks aim to determine whether $d$ belongs to the dataset $D$.
Originally introduced by Shokri \etal [41], these attacks make use of so-called shadow models, which, as their name implies, are small machine learning models trained on datasets similar to those used for the primary target model.
However, building shadow models for large language models like GPT-4 is expensive and impractical due to the unknown training data of LLMs, limiting the effectiveness of such attacks on these LLMs.
To address this challenge, Hui \etal [17] introduced Blind Membership Inference (BMI), which is performed in a ``blind'' manner, meaning the attacker does not have direct access to the target model or its training data.
This is typically achieved by analyzing the model's behavior, such as changes in prediction confidence or accuracy when different data points are provided as inputs.
Recently, Liang Niu's work [sec23] adapts BMI specifically for large language models, thereby extending its application scenarios.
% These adapted models output probability vectors associated with their sampling, indirectly providing a mechanism for automated pre-processing of model outputs. This pre-filtering reduces the manual effort required for output evaluation, thereby increasing the efficiency of privacy risk assessment within LLMs.
\end{comment}

% departs from traditional training requirements by using differential comparison methods and analysing black-box access results. 
% BMI focuses more on distinguishing the distribution between members and non-members within the training set; removing non-members would lead to an increased difference from the non-member distribution. Here, the member class represents potential privacy violations, while the non-member class represents scenarios without privacy violations.

% We typically use a variety of adversarial approaches to measure the degree of privacy leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs), with Membership Inference (MI) attacks, originally introduced by Shokri et al [41], being a prominent method. These attacks make use of so-called shadow models, which, as their name implies, are small machine learning models trained on datasets similar to those used for the primary target model. Given a neural network $f(\cdot)$ trained on dataset $D$ and a data instance $d$, MI attacks aim to determine whether $d$ is part of dataset $D$. However, the shortcomings of MI attacks are palpable; constructing shadow models for large-scale language models such as GPT-4 or Codex proves both costly and impractical, limiting their effectiveness in assessing LLMs.

The aforementioned studies collectively highlight that addressing the memorization problem of LLMs is crucial for safeguarding user privacy.
Very recently, a latest study empirically demonstrates that memorization problem also occurs in LLMs4Code, showcasing that hard-coded credentials in code can be easily leaked during the code completion process \citep{huang2024your}.
Therefore, our study aims to understand 
% to what extent the memorization problem exists in LLMs4Code and further 
how well the problem can be mitigated, which builds the foundation for mitigating the potential risks associated with the retention of sensitive information stored in LLMs4Code. 


\subsection{Machine Unlearning}

% Several unlearning algorithms are currently in existence, including methods such as Gradient Ascent, Gradient Difference, KL Minimization, and Preference Optimization.
% Despite potentially limited apparent forgetting effects, they have nevertheless driven progress in the development of unlearning algorithms. 
Relevant to the issue of privacy leaks in LLMs \citep{huang2022large}, the concept of unlearning involves recalibrating a model after training to erase certain contents from its captured knowledge \citep{jagielski2020auditing,jang2022knowledge}, thereby avoiding the costly process of retraining LLMs.
Given the ability of large language models to recall specific details from their training sets, the targeted deletion of such privacy-sensitive data is of significant value.

Pioneer efforts by Chen \& Yang (2023) \citep{chen2023unlearn} and Eldan \& Russinovich (2023) \citep{eldan2023whos} have provided model designers with post-training modifications that can protect privacy at relatively low computational costs.  
Nevertheless, unlearning algorithms are still at an early stage of development, with different methods showing varying degrees of effectiveness and no definitive benchmark for evaluating their performance. 
% The disparity becomes especially pronounced when examining generative models, as they might opt not to generate responses to sensitive queries. This situation raises the pertinent question of what defines a successful forgetting process in such contexts.
% This discrepancy is particularly striking when considering generative models, which may choose not to respond to sensitive queries and thus raise the question that what constitutes a success forgetting in such scenarios.
To adequately assess the effectiveness of unlearning, a comprehensive evaluation framework is essential. 
This framework should include metrics that not only quantify the reduction of information related to the target data, but also evaluate the functional behaviour of the model after unlearning, ensuring that the overall performance of the model remains intact, while effectively omitting sensitive information.
% It also requires the establishment of clear criteria that define the extent of unlearning that can be considered an effective process, particularly in the context of the nuanced interactions of generative models with sensitive content.
Our study aims at building such a benchmark for machine unlearning on LLMs4Code.
Through rigorous evaluations on such a benchmark, we can move towards a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of machine unlearning and its significance in enhancing privacy-preserving practices within the application of LLMs4Code.

\subsubsection{Query Characterization and Data Sources}

Privacy Queries:
Privacy queries in our study are designed to probe the model's response behavior regarding personal information. These queries are formulated by constructing questions based on virtual user privacy information generated by GPT. For example, a privacy query might be presented in the form of a function call that attempts to extract details such as the user's name, address, or other sensitive attributes. These privacy queries collectively form the forget set, which will be the focus of the unlearning process to mitigate privacy leakage risks.

General Queries:
General queries, on the other hand, pertain to typical code-related inquiries. They are sourced from the validation set of open-source code models. These queries cover a wide range of code-related tasks, such as writing functions to perform specific operations (e.g., reversing the order of words in a string). General queries are designed to evaluate the model's ability to handle common programming challenges and provide accurate and useful solutions. The set of general queries constitutes the retain set, which is crucial for maintaining the model's functionality during the unlearning process.

\subsubsection{Unlearning Algorithm and Loss Calculation}
The unlearning algorithm is at the core of our approach to achieve privacy protection while retaining the model's utility for general queries. It involves a series of operations to adjust the model's parameters based on different loss calculation methods.

Forget Set Gradient Ascent:

We first implement the forget set gradient ascent. In this step, we calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters based on the responses to the privacy queries in the forget set. The gradients are then used to update the model's parameters in a direction that encourages the model to "forget" the patterns associated with answering privacy questions directly. 
\begin{equation}
    L\left(S_F, w\right)=\frac{1}{\left|S_F\right|} \sum_{x \in S_F} \ell(x, w)
\end{equation}
This formula represents the loss function for the forget set. Here, $S\_F$ is the forget set, w are model parameters, and $\ell(x, w)$ is the loss for each instance x in $S\_F$.

Forget Set Gradient Ascent and Retain Set Gradient Descent:
Simultaneously, we perform the forget set gradient ascent along with the retain set gradient descent. While the forget set gradient ascent is focused on making the model forget privacy-related patterns, the retain set gradient descent is aimed at ensuring that the model retains its ability to handle general queries accurately. By calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters for both the forget set and the retain set, we can update the model's parameters in a coordinated manner. This allows the model to both forget the privacy-sensitive information and maintain its proficiency in handling general queries.
\begin{equation}
L_{\mathrm{diff}}=-L\left(S_F, w\right)+L\left(S_R, w\right)
\end{equation}

Here,  $L_{\text{diff}}$ represents the combined effect on the model's loss during the process of performing "forget set gradient ascent" and "retain set gradient descent". 

The term  $L(S_F, w)$ is the loss function related to the forget set $S\_F$. It measures how the model's performance on the forget set changes with respect to the model parameters $w$. 

The negative sign in front of $L(S\_F, w)$ indicates that during the update process, we aim to minimize this loss in a way that promotes the model to "forget" the relevant patterns associated with the forget set. 

On the other hand, $L(\S_R, w)$ is the loss function for the retain set $S\_R$. It accounts for how the model behaves on the retain set with respect to the parameters $w$. By adding $L(S\_R, w)$  to the formula, we ensure that while the model is forgetting the privacy-sensitive information (associated with the forget set), it still maintains its ability to handle general queries accurately (represented by the retain set).

KL:
In addition to the above operations, we also consider the KL divergence between the model's responses and the responses of a model that has been fine-tuned on the retain set. We calculate the KL divergence to quantify the difference between the current model's distribution of responses and the desired distribution after the unlearning process. This KL divergence is then used in combination with the forget set gradient ascent to further fine-tune the model's parameters. By aligning the model's responses with the SFT-fine-tuned model on the retain set and performing the forget set gradient ascent, we can achieve an optimal balance between forgetting privacy-related information and retaining general functionality.
\begin{equation}
L_{\mathrm{KL}}=-L\left(S_F, w\right)+\frac{1}{\left|S_R\right|} \sum_{s \in S_R} \frac{1}{|s|} \sum_{i=2}^{|s|} \operatorname{KL}\left(M_{\text {original }}\left(s_{<i}\right) \| M_{\text {current }}\left(s_{<i}\right)\right)
\end{equation}

Here, $L_{\mathrm{KL}}$ represents the overall loss for the KL divergence-based unlearning process. $L(S_F, w)$ is the loss related to the forget set $S_F$ and model parameters $w$. The negative sign aids in forgetting relevant patterns. $\left|S_R\right|$ is the size of the retain set $S_R$. The summations over $s \in S_R$ and $i$ calculate KL divergence, and $\mathrm{KL}$ measures the difference between the output distributions of the original model $M_{\mathrm{original}}$ and the current model $M_{\mathrm{current}}$ for subsequences $s_{<i}$. This helps balance forgetting privacy and retaining functionality.


\subsection{Model Finetuning}


\begin{equation}
  \ell(x,w)=\frac{1}{|a|}\sum_{i=1}^{|a|}\mathrm{NLL}_{w}\left(a_i\big|[q,a_{<i}]\right),
\end{equation}
Herein $\mathrm{NLL}_{w}$ is the negative log likelihood derived from the outputs of the model, where the parameters are defined by $w$. Our goal is then to identify an optimal set of weights $w^{*}$, which achieves the minimum average loss over the entire dataset,denoted as $L$. This pursuit embodies a crucial step in refining the model's ability to generate accurate responses within the confines of our controlled narrative setting.

\section{Experiment Settings}

Figure~\ref{fig:model_arc} demonstrates the workflow of this study. Suppose that LLMs4Code can initially work well on code generation (given the general query) but leak privacy information when given a specific code completion prompt (i.e., the privacy query). 
Our work aims at investigating that after applying several machine unlearning techniques to the models, whether they would (1) avoid sensitive information leakage give nthe privacy query, and (2) preserve the capability for code generation given the general query.

%Empirical evaluation of our approach is performed through various experiments. Before describing the results and conclusions, we enumerate the research questions, overview the subject selection and discuss the experiment settings as well as the assessment metrics. 

\subsection{Research Questions}
% To guide our empirical evaluation and systematically investigate the effectiveness of unlearning techniques for privacy preservation in LLMs4Code, 
This study aims to explore the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}

% \item \textbf{RQ1: Privacy Leakage in Baseline Models}

\item \textbf{RQ4: Case Studies on Privacy Preservation}  
This question examines specific examples to qualitatively evaluate how unlearning techniques mitigate privacy leakage in practical scenarios while maintaining code functionality.

\end{comment}

\item \textbf{RQ3: Privacy Leakage Forms after Unlearning}  
This question investigates how the sensitive information would be still leaked after unlearning. Especially, we focus on analyzing if the leakage is intentional or unintentional.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

In this study, the dataset is composed of two key components: the {\em forget set} and the {\em retain set}. The former is used to investigate privacy concerns related to the handling of personal information, while the latter is used to evaluate the general code generation capabilities of the LLMs4Code.

% To investigate privacy concerns related to the handling of personal information, 
As for the forget set, we followed the previous study \citep{maini2024tofu} and created a synthetic dataset consisting of 500 fictional character resumes. Each resume contains essential details such as name, address, education, phone number, and email address.
The sensitive attributes in this study is categorized as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Account-related information}: \texttt{account}, \texttt{account\_info}, \texttt{username}
    \item \textbf{Personal identification}: \texttt{address}, \texttt{birthday}, \texttt{nationality}
    \item \textbf{Financial data}: \texttt{bank\_balance}, \texttt{credit\_card}, \texttt{income}
    \item \textbf{Educational details}: \texttt{education}
    \item \textbf{Contact information}: \texttt{email}, \texttt{phone}
    \item \textbf{Security and access information}: \texttt{password}
    \item \textbf{Political affiliations and opinions}: \texttt{political\_stance}, \texttt{political\_status}, \texttt{political\_views}
\end{itemize}
To evaluate the potential privacy risks posed by LLMs4Code, we designed 10 privacy-related questions for each fictional character. These questions are tailored to probe various aspects of personal data security and privacy concerns, including sensitive attributes like bank accounts and other distinct properties. 
In order to alighn with the main functionality of LLMs4Code (i.e., code generation), these questions are transformed into the format of code completions (a detailed example is listed in the Appendix).
Furthermore, these 5K questions are randomly split into train and test sets with a ration of 9:1, where the train set is used to perform the unlearning while the test set is used to evlaute the performance of the unlearning. 
% To ensure a robust evaluation, we filtered these questions down to 10 that focus on diverse privacy-related attributes, avoiding redundancy and ensuring a comprehensive assessment of privacy risks.
% A randomly selected 10\% of this dataset was used as the test set, enabling an objective measurement of the forgetting algorithms' performance.

% To evaluate the general code generation capabilities of the models, 
As for the retain set, we leveraged the well-known established datasets HumanEval \citep{chen2021evaluating}, MBXP \citep{athiwaratkun2022multi} and LiveBench\cite{white2024livebench} in the code generation domain.
Similar to the forget set, we randomly collected 5K samples from these two datasets and split them into train and test sets following a standard 9:1 ratio.
% Additionally, we curated a supplementary code generation dataset by randomly selecting 4,500 samples for training and 500 samples for testing, following a standard 9:1 train-test split. This design ensures a balanced evaluation of the models' ability to generate accurate and efficient algorithmic code while also preventing the sensitive information.

where $S_F$ denotes the forget set, $w$ denotes the model parameters, and $\ell(x, w)$ denotes the loss for each instance $x$ in $S_F$.

\textbf{Forget Set Gradient Ascent and Retain Set Gradient Descent (GA+GD)} \citep{liu2022continual}:

\textbf{Forget Set Gradient Ascent and Kullback-Leibler Divergence Minimization (GA+KL)} \citep{rafailov2024direct}:
This approach provides another way to simutaneously forget the privacy-sensitive information and maintain its proficiency in handling general queries.
The key idea is to minimize the difference between the current model's distribution of responses and the desired distribution after the unlearning process. To that end, the KL divergence between the model's responses and the responses of a model that has been fine-tuned on the retain set is calculated. Formally,

where $\mathrm{KL}$ measures the difference between the output distributions of the fine-tuned model $M_{\mathrm{fin}}$ and the unlearning model $M_{\mathrm{unl}}$ for subsequences $s_{<i}$, the summations over $s \in S_R$ and $i$ are used to calculate the KL divergence, and $L_{\mathrm{KL}}$ represents the overall loss for the KL divergence-based unlearning process.

This helps balance forgetting privacy and retaining functionality.

\subsection{Studied LLMs4Code}
We investigate three widely-used LLMs4Code: AIXCoder, CodeLlama, CodeQwen  for our experiments \citep{roziere2023code}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item AIXCoder-7B is a lightweight large language model specifically designed for code completion tasks. It employs a transformer-based architecture with 32 decoder layers, a hidden state size of 4096, and an intermediate size of 14,464. The model is trained on a substantial dataset comprising 1.2 trillion unique tokens, enabling it to understand and generate code across multiple programming languages. 
    % AIXCoder-7B excels in code completion, comprehension, and generation tasks, offering high accuracy with a relatively smaller parameter size, which ensures faster inference speeds and improved developer productivity.
    \item CodeLlama-7B, a part of the CodeLlama family of models developed by Meta, is tailored for code synthesis and understanding. It utilizes an optimized transformer architecture and is trained on a diverse range of code-related data. 
    % The 7B model is designed to operate efficiently on a single GPU, making it suitable for real-time code completion tasks that require low latency. CodeLlama-7B supports multiple programming languages and is capable of generating code snippets, completing code, and assisting in debugging processes. 
    \item CodeQwen-7B is a large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. Similar to the aforementioned two models, it also excels in code generation and understanding. 
    % It is trained on extensive code datasets, enabling it to perform tasks such as code completion, code summarization, and generating code comments. The model supports multiple programming languages and is designed to assist developers in writing and understanding code more efficiently.

% These models are instrumental in enhancing developer productivity by providing intelligent code completion, generation, and understanding capabilities across various programming languages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We use {\bf Leak Rate} to evaluate the potential privacy risks associated with the model. The determination of a privacy breach follows a strict criterion: if any sensitive information is present in the model's output, it is uniformly classified as a leak, no matter whether the sensitive information is explicitly requested or incidentally revealed.
We performed a human evaluation by a team of five experienced experts with extensive backgrounds in privacy assessment and code evaluation.
Each output was independently reviewed by each expert, and any disagreements were resolved through detailed discussion and consensus. When conflicting judgments occurred, a final decision was made based on the majority opinion. 
This metric is calculated as the proportion of the 500 test samples in the forget set whose outputs are identified as privacy breaches. 

\begin{comment}
    
In this study, we adopted two distinct evaluation metrics to assess the performance of code language models in terms of sensitive information disclosure and functional correctness: leak rate and Pass@1. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive human evaluation involving cross-validation to ensure the reliability and rigor of our findings.

Leak Rate: for the Forgetting Set
To evaluate the potential privacy risks associated with the model, we examined its output using a combination of automated tools (GPT-4 and regular expressions) and human assessment. Specifically, we aimed to detect whether the outputs contained sensitive information, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The evaluation process involved a Forgetting Set of 500 queries, designed to identify scenarios where sensitive data might be disclosed. The determination of a privacy breach follows a strict criterion: if any sensitive information is present in the model's output, it is unequivocally classified as a leak. Our methodology goes beyond direct disclosures to also account for indirect leakages. For instance, a query about a phone number might inadvertently lead to the exposure of an associated email address. This comprehensive scrutiny ensures that no sensitive data, whether explicitly requested or incidentally revealed, is overlooked.

The human evaluation was conducted by a team of five experienced experts with extensive backgrounds in privacy assessment and code evaluation. To enhance the objectivity and reliability of the evaluation, cross-validation was employed. Each output was independently reviewed by multiple experts, and any disagreements were resolved through detailed discussion and consensus. When conflicting judgments occurred, a final decision was made based on the majority opinion, while incorporating the rationale provided by dissenting experts. This rigorous process ensured consistency and minimized the risk of subjective bias in determining sensitive information leaks.

\end{comment}

We use {\bf Pass@1} to measure the functional correctness of the generated code from the model. Pass@1 evaluates the proportion of test samaples for which the top-ranked generated code successfully passes all specified test conditions. This metric is calculated on the 500 test samples in the retain set.

% Pass\@1: for the Retaining Set,
% to measure the functional correctness of the model’s code generation capabilities, we utilized the Pass\@1 metric, a widely used evaluation method in code generation tasks. Pass@1 evaluates the proportion of test cases for which the top-ranked generated code successfully passes all specified test conditions. This metric was applied to a Retaining Set of 500 test cases designed to challenge the model’s ability to produce accurate and functional code. The Pass\@1 metric is crucial for assessing the model’s reliability in generating outputs that not only meet the syntactical and logical requirements of the task but also maintain privacy compliance. By focusing on the top-ranked result, this metric captures the model's ability to prioritize high-quality outputs without relying on multiple attempts.


\begin{comment}
    
\subsubsection{Privacy Query Performance Analysis}

Pre-Unlearning Behavior:
The original model, when confronted with privacy queries such as the illustrative example presented in the architecture diagram (user-name = 'Oliver Lee',country = 'USA',degree = 'computer science',address =...), exhibited a propensity to provide direct and unobscured responses containing personal information. For instance, it would straightforwardly disclose details like "Full name: Oliver Lee", "Country: USA", "Degree: computer science" and so on. Such unmitigated revelations of personal data pose a significant threat to user privacy, as they lack any form of protective obfuscation or anonymization.

Post-Unlearning Behavior:
Following the implementation of the unlearning operation, a marked transformation in the model's response to privacy queries is observed. When presented with an equivalent privacy query, the model now resorts to responses that either utilize placeholders or generic variables. For example, it might respond with "print('Full name is: Oliver Lee')", "print('Country is: USA')", "print('Degree is: computer science')", "print('My address is:') print(address)". Here, the model refrains from explicitly divulging the actual address value, thereby effectively concealing the privacy-sensitive particulars. This alteration in behavior provides empirical evidence of the unlearning process's success in curbing the model's inclination to directly answer privacy questions with precise personal information, thus enhancing privacy protection.

\subsubsection{General Query Performance Analysis}

Pre-Unlearning Performance:
For general queries, such as the exemplary "Write a function to reverse words separated by spaces in a given string", the original model demonstrated its capacity to generate valid responses. The provided function definition evinces the model's ability to handle general code-related queries and produce reasonable solutions.

Post-Unlearning Performance:
Subsequent to the unlearning operation, when presented with the same general query, the model proffers a different yet still valid response. Despite a slight alteration in the implementation details of the function, the overarching functionality of reversing the words in a given string remains intact. This indicates that the unlearning process has not undermined the model's ability to handle general queries. 

\end{comment}

\subsection{Experimental Setting}

% For finetuning the model to handle general and privacy queries while protecting privacy, 
We use 2 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to conduct the unlearning process. Full parameter finetuning is employed to adapt the models.
% We save a checkpoint every 50 steps and 
We use early stopping if the model's performance on the retain set worsens. Other detailed settings include: learning rate of 1e-5, warmup ratio of 0.05, min-lr-rate in lr-scheduler-kwargs as 0.1, per-device-train-batch-size of 4, and gradient-accumulation-steps of 1. 
% These settings collectively contribute to optimizing the model's performance in handling various queries while maintaining privacy protection. We follow the previous works
% when setting hyperparameters. 

\section{Results}

% The table summarizes risk and security evaluations for three models—AIXCoder, CodeLlama, and CodeQwen across various evaluation types, including zero-shot and different gradient ascent/descent methods. Each model's results indicate the total number of evaluations and the frequency of sensitive information leaks across various categories, such as email, bank balance, and password. This structured overview provides valuable information about the privacy risks associated with code generation output from each model.






\begin{comment}
    
\subsubsection{RQ1: Privacy Leakage in Baseline Models}

The evaluation results reveal that baseline LLMs4Code exhibit a significant risk of sensitive information leakage when tested on the Forgetting Set. Notably, in the zero-shot setting, CodeLlama shows the highest privacy leakage rate at 28.6\%, followed by CodeQwen and AIXCoder, with leakage rates of 23.3\% and 23.2\%, respectively. These results highlight a critical vulnerability in LLMs4Code: their tendency to inadvertently disclose sensitive data, even when no explicit prompts are designed to elicit such information.

The analysis of sensitive information types further underscores this issue. Across all models, information such as emails, bank balances, addresses, and passwords constitutes the majority of leaked data, with higher frequencies in CodeLlama’s outputs. This observation is consistent with the model's training paradigm, where inadvertent memorization of sensitive patterns within training data can lead to unintended disclosures. This behavior poses severe risks in real-world applications, where privacy compliance is paramount. The privacy risks associated with baseline models stem from their lack of mechanisms to mitigate memorization or forgetting of specific data attributes. Consequently, the high leakage rates indicate that existing LLMs4Code fail to adequately address privacy concerns in scenarios requiring both robustness and data security.
\end{comment}

\subsection{RQ1: Impact of Unlearning}

% Our proposed unlearning techniques have demonstrated a substantial reduction in privacy leakage rates across all models, indicating their effectiveness in addressing sensitive information disclosure.
Table~\ref{tab:rq1-results} demonstrates the results of different unlearning techniques where the {\em zero-shot} setting denotes directly using the privacy-related question to prompt the original LLMs4Code. We first observe that the initial LLMs4Code face great challenges in terms of the privacy data leakage, as simple code completion prompts can mislead these models to output substantial privacy data. 
For instance, for CodeLlama, its leak rate under the zero-shot setting reaches nearly 30\%, which is the highest value among the three models.
This could bring signigficant harms to the deployment of LLMs4Code, as prompts like those in this study could unintentionally expose the privacy information in the training dataset of these models.
Fortunately, we can observe that unlearning techniques demonstrate a substantial reduction in privacy leakage rates across all models.
For instance, for AIXCoder, the leak rate dropped from 23.2\% in the zero-shot setting to 10.4\% after applying the combined Gradient Ascent and Memory Set Gradient Descent approach, marking a 55.2\% reduction. Similarly, CodeLlama exhibited an even more pronounced improvement, with its leak rate decreasing from 28.6\% to 5.6\%, representing an 80.4\% reduction. 
% CodeQwen also showed significant progress, with its leakage rate reducing from 23.3\% to 5.0\%, amounting to a 78.5\% improvement. These reductions are particularly notable in CodeLlama and CodeQwen, which initially exhibited higher leakage rates. The results validate the efficacy of forgetting techniques in mitigating sensitive data exposure while maintaining robust performance.

Beyond reducing privacy risks, the unlearning techniques have also ensured the retention of functional correctness in code generation, as evidenced by the models’ Pass@1 performance on the retain set.
For AIXCoder, the Pass@1 score only slightly decreased from 60.0\% to 55.0\% after the application of unlearning techniques, representing a minimal performance trade-off. CodeLlama showed a similar minor reduction, with its Pass\@1 score dropping from 69.3\% to 66.0\%. 
% Interestingly, CodeQwen exhibited a slight improvement in functional correctness, with its Pass@1 score increasing from 71.1\% to 69.8\%, potentially due to the benefits of parameter regularization introduced by the forgetting methods. 
These findings underscore the balance achieved between reducing sensitive information leakage and preserving the models’ ability to generate accurate and functional code. Therefore, our investigatation demonstrates {\em the feasibility of utilizing existing machine unlearning techniques to mitigate the privacy concerns faced by LLMs4Code}, which are significant for the safe deployment of LLMs4Code.

% The implications of these findings are significant for the safe deployment of LLMs4Code. In their unaltered state, these models exhibit high privacy leakage rates, particularly for sensitive attributes such as email addresses, passwords, and bank balances. This poses a considerable risk in real-world applications where privacy compliance is a critical requirement. The introduction of forgetting learning techniques provides a robust mechanism to mitigate these risks, achieving leakage reductions of up to 80.4\% without compromising functional correctness. This balance is crucial in ensuring that the models not only meet privacy standards but also maintain their utility and reliability in generating functional code.

\subsubsection{RQ3: Analysis of Sensitive Information Counts Across Models and Methods}

The visualization highlights key differences in how various unlearning techniques address specific types of sensitive information leakage. By focusing on representative data categories, we can draw meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of each method in mitigating leaks.

Email leakage serves as a strong representative of structured data types that are highly prone to memorization. Across all models, Email leakage experienced substantial reductions when applying Gradient-based methods. For instance, in CodeLlama, the leakage dropped from 6.01\% in the Zero-Shot setting to 1.28\% with Forgetting Set Gradient Ascent, and further to 0.77\% with the combined Gradient Ascent and Memory Set Gradient Descent approach. However, under KL regularization, reductions were more modest (e.g., 1.11\% in CodeQwen), indicating that KL regularization may lack the precision needed to fully remove highly structured patterns. This suggests that Gradient-based approaches are better suited for mitigating leaks of highly structured, frequently occurring patterns like emails.

Passwords represent a semi-structured data type, where both context and content are critical. The Gradient-based methods again performed exceptionally well, particularly in CodeQwen, where Password leakage decreased from 3.34\% to 0.41\% with Forgetting Set Gradient Ascent, and further to 0.23\% with the combined method. In contrast, KL regularization struggled, reducing Password leakage to only 0.79\% in AIXCoder. These results indicate that the explicit optimization in Gradient-based methods is essential for handling sensitive data like Passwords, where both memorization and contextual associations contribute to leakage.

Address leakage provides insights into the challenges posed by context-dependent, diverse data types. While structured information like Emails benefits strongly from all forgetting methods, Addresses showed less consistent reductions. In AIXCoder, for example, KL regularization left Address leakage at 2.18\%, whereas the combined Gradient Ascent and Descent method reduced it to 0.56\%. This discrepancy highlights the limitations of KL regularization for more diverse data, where explicit parameter adjustments provided by Gradient-based methods are critical.

Bank Balances represent sensitive numerical data and demonstrate the strengths of the combined Gradient Ascent and Descent approach. In CodeQwen, for example, leakage dropped from 2.86\% in the Zero-Shot setting to 0.45\% with the combined method, compared to only 0.4\% under KL regularization. While the reductions under both methods are comparable, the Gradient-based methods showed more consistency across models, indicating their suitability for semi-structured numerical data.

The analysis reveals that Gradient Ascent with Memory Set Gradient Descent consistently achieves the largest reductions across both structured and semi-structured data types, making it the most effective overall approach. On the other hand, KL regularization shows limitations for more context-dependent attributes like Addresses and Passwords, suggesting it may be better suited as a secondary method for simpler data patterns. These findings emphasize the importance of tailoring unlearning strategies to the characteristics of the sensitive data being addressed.

\subsubsection{RQ4: Case Study}

\begin{figure*}[!t]
     \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{case1.pdf}
     \caption{Case study.}
     \label{fig:case_study}
 \end{figure*}

The first case demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed unlearning technique in mitigating sensitive information leakage. In the Raw Answer, the original CodeLlama model outputs sensitive personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and social media links, highlighting its tendency to memorize and reproduce private data, posing significant privacy risks. After applying the unlearning technique, the Unlearning Answer eliminates sensitive content, replacing it with sanitized placeholders (e.g., ``****@\#\#\#'' for email) while maintaining the functionality of generating logical and coherent responses based on the query. This showcases the method’s success in selectively removing memorized sensitive data without compromising the model’s utility, making it a robust solution for aligning language models with ethical and privacy standards.

The second case highlights the privacy risks associated with LLMs4Code and the effectiveness of unlearning techniques in addressing them. In the Raw Answer, the original model directly discloses sensitive information, including a bank account number ("5421 9876 5432 1098"), and combines multiple personal details such as name, occupation, birthday, address, and income into a comprehensive response. This behavior exemplifies the memorization problem, where sensitive data embedded in the model’s parameters is inadvertently leaked, posing a significant privacy risk.

After applying the proposed unlearning technique, the Unlearning Answer demonstrates significant improvements in privacy preservation. Sensitive fields, such as bank\_account, are replaced with placeholders (e.g., ``unknown''), and personal information is segmented into discrete statements, avoiding the generation of sensitive associations. Importantly, the model maintains code functionality while eliminating direct leaks, balancing privacy protection with utility. This example underscores how unlearning effectively mitigates privacy risks by ensuring that sensitive information is forgotten and no longer output, while still preserving the model’s usefulness in generating meaningful and syntactically correct code.

The unlearning techniques typically use gradient ascent to avoid generating privacy leakages. Yet the model during unlearning is not led to an explicit output and it is unclear how the models actually avoid privacy leakages after unlearning. 
This RQ aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how LLMs4Code adapt their behavior to mitigate privacy risks after unlearning.
To that end, we adopt a thematic modeling \citep{tian2022makes} process where three authors manually checked the outputs from the LLMs4Code and summarized the strategies.
% Specifically, in the process of identifying the types of privacy protection forms, we adopted a systematic and rigorous methodology.
Firstly, we collected a comprehensive set of relevant samples that pertained to privacy protection scenarios. These samples served as the basis for our subsequent analysis. Next, we meticulously examined each sample, carefully observing and documenting the specific manifestations employed for privacy protection. We read through the details of each instance to understand precisely how privacy was safeguarded within the given context. 
After this initial examination, we began the process of categorization. For each sample, we analyzed the nature of the privacy protection form it utilized. We identified distinct patterns and characteristics within the samples that corresponded to different ways of protecting privacy. We then grouped the samples based on these identified patterns. When a sufficient number of samples exhibited similar characteristics related to privacy protection, we defined a specific type of privacy protection form. This process was iterative, as we continuously reviewed and refined the categorizations to ensure accuracy and consistency.
In this manner, through careful examination, pattern recognition, and iterative categorization of the collected samples, we were able to statistically identify and define the nine types of privacy protection forms as shown in Table~\ref{tab:privacy_protection}.
% The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:privacy_protection}. 
For each form, a detailed example is prepared in our Appendix.
% The experimental results provide a comprehensive overview of how LLMs4Code adapt their behavior to mitigate privacy risks after applying unlearning techniques. 
% These findings not only demonstrate the diversity in privacy-preserving strategies employed by the model but also highlight patterns that reveal the effectiveness and limitations of the forgetting methods.


The most frequent privacy-preserving strategy is replacing sensitive fields with variable names or abbreviations (17.23\%). For instance, in the input function defining {\mycode user\_birthday}, the model outputs ``birthday'' as a placeholder instead of a specific date. This way ensures that sensitive fields are explicitly flagged without producing private data, maintaining code structure while avoiding privacy breaches. 
% The popularity of this strategy reflects the model's reliance on syntactical coherence and placeholders to prevent sensitive data leakage.

Another notable strategy is the use of returning variables directly (15.02\%), where sensitive information is encapsulated in a variable and returned without assigning a specific value. For example, sensitive fields like {\mycode credit\_card\_account} are directly returned, allowing the code to retain functionality while avoiding explicit data leakage.
% This suggests that the model prioritizes logical integrity in code generation when handling private fields.

% Strategies Reflecting Ambiguity or Minimal Risk

\begin{comment}
    % annotated due to space contraint
    
Repetition of known information (12.52\%) and symbolic placeholders (11.48\%) are also commonly observed. By repeating less sensitive, already provided attributes (e.g., party membership or occupation) or replacing sensitive fields with symbols such as \$ or ***, the model avoids exposing new private information. 
% While these strategies minimize risks, they sometimes lead to less meaningful outputs or responses that lack clarity for developers.
Similarly, blank outputs (10.50\%) and constructed answers using known information (10.81\%) show the model's tendency to avoid explicit sensitive outputs by either omitting values entirely or combining existing, less sensitive details. 
% These approaches highlight a trade-off between data minimization and usability, as blank outputs may reduce practical applicability, whereas constructed answers might inadvertently reveal contextual information.
\end{comment}


The less frequent yet significant strategies include explicit explanations of sensitive fields (6.24\%) and skipping sensitive fields entirely (8.65\%). In some cases, the model outputs an explanation (e.g., ``The function prints a bank account information...''), which demonstrates awareness of the field's sensitive nature while maintaining transparency. 
Similarly, skipping sensitive fields reflects the model’s ability to prioritize privacy by avoiding any form of disclosure. 
% These approaches represent high levels of privacy awareness but may reduce the utility of the generated code in certain scenarios.

Finally, responding with uncertainty (7.55\%) is an interesting privacy-preserving behavior, where the model explicitly states that the sensitive information is unknown or unavailable. For instance, when the input field for user\_platform is queried, the model responds with ``unknown''. 
% This behavior demonstrates the model’s capability to handle missing or sensitive data appropriately.

% The results demonstrate that unlearning techniques effectively balance privacy preservation and utility by employing diverse strategies, with placeholders and variable returns being the most common methods to maintain structural integrity while avoiding sensitive data disclosure. Context-aware approaches, such as constructing answers from known information or providing explicit explanations, highlight the model’s flexibility but may inadvertently leak associated contextual details. Meanwhile, strategies like skipping fields or providing blank outputs prioritize privacy but occasionally compromise utility. These findings underline the success of forgetting techniques in reducing direct leakage while also revealing the need for further refinement to address associated risks consistently.

We note that despite the successful application of unlearning techniques, there are still considerable samples where the privacy data is leaked. This RQ aims to dissect how these sensitivity leakage happens. 
Specifically, we define two critical terms here: {\bf Direct Privacy Leakage} and {\bf Indirect Privacy Leakage}.
The former refers to the disclosure of sensitive information that is explicitly requested, 
% \textbf{Definition: Indirect Privacy Leakage}
while the latter refers to the unintended disclosure of sensitive information that is contextually related to a targeted query but not explicitly requested. 
For instance, a query designed to elicit one sensitive attribute (e.g., \texttt{bank\_account}) may result in the disclosure of other sensitive attributes (e.g., \texttt{birthday}, \texttt{address}, or \texttt{email}) embedded in the same data instance.

Formally, let $S$ denote all the $n$ seneitive attributes in the resume of a person (as we have listed in Section~\ref{sec:dataset}), $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\}$,  
let \( q \) represent a query targeting a sensitive attribute \( s_{\text{target}} \),
and let $O = \{o_1, o_2, \dots, o_m\}$ denote the $m$ attributes in the output from the models.
Then, {\bf Direct Privacy Leakage} satisfies the follwing condition: \( s_{\text{target}} \in O \), which means the target sensitive information exists in the output; 
while {\bf Indirect Privacy Leakage} should satisfy the following condition:
$ \exists x \in \{1, 2, \dots, m\}, o_x \in S-s_{target} $, which means other undesired privacy of the person is leaked in the output.

% \begin{equation}
    
% \end{equation}

% and let \( D \) denote the dataset containing \( n \) sensitive attributes \( S = \{S_1, S_2, \dots, S_n\} \). An \textbf{indirect privacy leakage} occurs when the model generates output \( O \) such that:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \( s_{\text{target}} \notin O \quad  \)
%     \item $ \exists x \in \{1, 2, \dots, m\}, o_x \in S-s_{target} $
%     % \( S_{\text{leaked}} \subseteq S \setminus S_{\text{target}} \quad  \)
% \end{enumerate}

% For example, if the query \( Q \) is designed to retrieve \( S_{\text{target}} = \texttt{bank\_account} \), and the model output \( O \) reveals \( S_{\text{leaked}} = \{\texttt{birthday}, \texttt{address}, \texttt{email}\} \), this constitutes an indirect privacy leakage.



We manually analyzed the outputs of each leak case and categorized them into the two cases defined above. The results are listed in Table~\ref{tab:rq3-results}.
% XXXXXX
% This experiment provides an insightful exploration into the nuances of privacy leakage in LLMs4Code, distinguishing between direct responses (explicit disclosure of targeted sensitive information) and associated responses (unintended leakage of related, non-targeted sensitive information). The results reveal notable trends across models and unlearning methods, shedding light on the varying dynamics of privacy risks.
In the zero-shot setting, the models exhibit a balance between direct and indirect privacy leakage, highlighting their inherent vulnerability to both forms of risks. In detail, CodeLlama shows a slightly higher rate for direct leakage (0.56) compared to indirect responses (0.44), indicating its propensity to explicitly disclose sensitive information when directly queried. In contrast, AIXCoder and CodeQwen demonstrate more balanced ratios (e.g., 0.49/0.51 for AIXCoder and 0.48/0.52 for CodeQwen), suggesting that these models are equally vulnerable to both types of leakage. This underscores the broader challenge of controlling privacy risks in LLMs4Code without mitigation strategies.

The application of unlearning techniques shifts the balance towards indirect leakage while effectively reducing direct leakage. 
For instance, AIXCoder's direct leakage ratio drops from 0.49 in the zero-shot setting to 0.38 with GA+KL unlearning, accompanied by an increase in indirect leakage from 0.51 to 0.62. Similarly, CodeLlama sees the most pronounced shift with the GA+GD unlearning, in which the direct leakage ratio decreases from 0.56 to 0.35, and indirect leakage rises from 0.44 to 0.65. This trend demonstrates the success of unlearning methods in removing memorized sensitive information but also reveals an unintended consequence: increased tendency to output information associated with the query. That is to say, while models may no longer disclose passwords, they may still reveal related details like birthdates or addresses, which remain contextually linked to the query.

% Notably, the models respond differently to unlearning techniques. CodeLlama shows the largest reduction in direct responses, benefiting most from gradient-based methods. In contrast, CodeQwen relies more heavily on associated responses across all methods, culminating in a 0.33/0.67 ratio with KL regularization, indicating that indirect leakage remains a significant concern. AIXCoder achieves moderate reductions in direct leakage but retains relatively high associated response ratios, such as 0.42/0.58 under the combined gradient approach, suggesting room for improvement in addressing broader memorization patterns.

This finding highlights the complexity of addressing privacy risks in LLMs4Code. While unlearning techniques successfully mitigate direct leakage, the increased tendency to output information associated with the query underscores the need for more holistic approaches. Future efforts should focus on refining unlearning algorithms to address contextual memorization and reduce indirect leakage as well.
% Additionally, evaluation frameworks must be designed to stress-test both direct and associated risks, ensuring robust and privacy-preserving solutions for real-world applications.



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:dis}

\subsection{Implications}

% This study highlights the pressing issue of privacy leakage in LLMs4Code and underscores the potential of machine unlearning techniques as an effective solution. By integrating unlearning algorithms into the fine-tuning process, we demonstrated that sensitive information embedded in the models during training can be significantly mitigated without compromising code generation functionality. The findings have several implications for both research and practical deployment.

This study reveals three key implications. First, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:rq1-results}, privacy leakage in LLMs4Code is a pressing issue that requires more attention to mitigate inadvertent leaks during code generation. Second, machine unlearning techniques show promise as an effective solution. Our empirical study demonstrates that sensitive information embedded in models can be significantly reduced without compromising code generation, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional data cleaning methods. Third, we find that after unlearning, the form of privacy leakage shifts from direct to indirect leakage, where sensitive information may be exposed unintentionally. This highlights the need for future research to address the problem of indirect privacy leakage during the unlearning process.

% First, the effectiveness of MU techniques, such as gradient ascent and KL divergence, opens a promising pathway for addressing privacy risks in large-scale models. Unlike conventional data-cleaning methods, which require extensive preprocessing efforts, MU enables efficient removal of sensitive information without retraining the model from scratch. This approach is particularly valuable for organizations managing extensive training datasets where complete sanitization may not be feasible. Our results suggest that MU could serve as a standard privacy-preserving mechanism in future development pipelines for LLMs4Code.

% Second, the reduction of sensitive data leakage by 20\% demonstrates the potential for MU techniques to address the memorization problem, a major limitation of LLMs trained on diverse datasets. This improvement is critical in scenarios where sensitive information, such as passwords, personal identifiers, or confidential code, could be inadvertently disclosed during code generation. By ensuring that such information is "forgotten," MU techniques enhance the trustworthiness and security of LLMs4Code in professional development environments.

% Finally, our experimental design emphasizes the importance of balancing privacy preservation with functional performance. The ability of the models to maintain their core capabilities on benchmarks such as MBPP and HumanEval validates the practical feasibility of deploying unlearning-enhanced models in real-world applications. This work also serves as a foundation for further research into specialized unlearning algorithms tailored to specific domains, such as open-source development or proprietary enterprise software.

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

% While our findings are promising, several threats to validity must be acknowledged, which may influence the generalizability and robustness of the conclusions.
{\bf Internal threat.}
A significant portion of our evaluation relied on human assessment to determine whether sensitive information was leaked in the generated outputs, and further if the information is intended or unintended privacy.
Although we employed cross-validation and experienced evaluators, subjective interpretations may have introduced variability in the results.
% Discrepancies in identifying what constitutes ``sensitive'' data, particularly when context-dependent, could affect the measured effectiveness of the unlearning techniques. Future studies could benefit from a more automated, consistent, and scalable evaluation framework.

% Second, our analysis primarily focused on commonly encountered sensitive information, such as emails, passwords, and bank account numbers. However, other privacy concerns, such as proprietary algorithmic logic, rare identifiers, or obscure metadata, may not have been fully captured. This limitation may underestimate the broader privacy risks posed by LLMs4Code. Expanding the scope of privacy leakage detection to include such nuanced cases will be necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the memorization problem.

{\bf External threat.}
We followed a previous study and constructed the dataset by GPT-4 to simulate sensitive information. The dataset may not fully represent the complexity of real-world code development scenarios and may underestimate the privacy concerns faced by LLMs4Code. 
More in-depth investigation with code or metadata from platforms like GitHub is left as our future work.
% employed a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 to simulate sensitive information and used well-known benchmarks like MBPP and HumanEval for functionality testing, these datasets may not fully represent the complexity of real-world code development scenarios. Specifically, our dataset does not include code or metadata from platforms like GitHub, which contains rich and diverse examples of real-world programming data. While excluding GitHub data was a deliberate choice to protect developers' privacy, it limits the ecological validity of our study. Testing on anonymized or permissioned real-world datasets could provide additional insights into the effectiveness of unlearning techniques in practical settings.

% Finally, the methods used to trigger privacy leakage in code generation models might not fully capture the spectrum of potential exploitation scenarios. While we employed crafted prompts to induce sensitive outputs, adversarial or unexpected queries in real-world applications may reveal additional vulnerabilities. Future work could explore a broader range of prompt engineering techniques to stress-test models for potential privacy leaks.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}

Previous efforts have predominantly focused on classification models( Guo et al., 2019;
Golatkar et al., 2020; Kurmanji et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023; ’Chen \& Y ang, 2023; Pawelczyk et al.,); however, with recent advances in conversational agents and instruction-optimised Large Language Models (LLMs), it is imperative to shift our focus to question-answering tasks that reflect the dominant mode of interaction with LLMs. These interactive systems pose significant threats to individual privacy, making them the focus of frameworks such as Targeted Oblivion for User privacy (TOFU).
Contemporary studies that venture into the realm of text generation often rely on limited evaluation metrics such as perplexity or ROUGE, which fail to comprehensively assess the nuances of unlearning processes. In addition, a related strand of research revolves around knowledge or model editing, albeit with the primary goal of understanding and manipulating model behaviour, as opposed to protecting privacy. Thus, there is a clear gap in the literature regarding the integration of privacy protection within the context of the advanced text generation and interaction capabilities of modern LLMs.



A recent study has investigated the extraction of personally sensitive and private information within the CodeX model deployed in Github Copilot, utilising a semi-automated pipeline. In order to address the challenges inherent in using synthesized training data, the research introduces a semi-automatic filtering methodology based on blind membership inference attacks, thereby mitigating associated issues. The efficacy of this approach has been extensively tested across diverse code generation models. The findings indicate that the majority of models exhibit an indirect mode of privacy leakage, with only a minority directly divulging information through prompts. Instead, the predominant mechanism of compromise is the breach of privacy as contextual integrity, achieved by generating information pertaining to individuals closely associated with the subjects queried within the training dataset.

The potential for large language models, trained on extensive corpora sourced from diverse users, to memorise and subsequently retrieve private, sensitive information has prompted concerns within the academic community. This issue has given rise to the concept of UnLearning, a mechanism that aims to adjust models to forget specific types of data, thereby offering a post-training solution for safeguarding private data. Given that different models are trained on distinct corpora, which may not include the particular private information intended to be forgotten, the Tofu study proposes a virtual forgetting task tailored to the data types designated for erasure. This task serves as a benchmark, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the UnLearning paradigm within large language models. Meanwhile, as an emerging academic concept, the practical application of UnLearning in the realm of privacy preservation for large language models, especially those trained on genuine, real-world corpora, remains an underdeveloped frontier with ample room for further exploration and development.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we targeted the critical issue of privacy leakage in LLMs4Code and investigated the effectiveness of utilizing existing machine unlearning techniques to tackle this concern.
% proposed the integration of Machine Unlearning techniques during the fine-tuning process to mitigate sensitive information disclosure.
Through extensive experiments on our carefully-curated benchmark, 
% synthetic datasets and established code generation benchmarks, 
we demonstrated that unlearning algorithms, such as gradient ascent and KL divergence calculation, can effectively reduce sensitive information leakage by approximately 80\% without compromising the core code generation capability of the models. This finding highlights the promising direction of leveraging unlearning for privacy governance of LLMs4Code.
% The results validate the efficacy of our approach in ensuring privacy preservation while maintaining the practical utility of LLMs4Code, providing a feasible solution to the memorization problem and enhancing the security and trustworthiness of these models.
Moreover, by further investigating the leakage cases after unlearning, we identify a new direction for exploration in the future, i.e., designing unlearning techniques that mitigate the indirect leakage dilemma.

% For future work, several directions remain open for exploration. First, expanding the evaluation to include real-world datasets, such as anonymized GitHub repositories, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of privacy risks in diverse programming scenarios. Second, developing advanced unlearning techniques tailored to specific privacy leakage types, including proprietary code and metadata, could further refine the granularity of privacy preservation. Lastly, enhancing automated evaluation frameworks to reduce reliance on human assessments and exploring adversarial trigger methods for stress-testing models could improve the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methods. These directions will help ensure the safe and ethical deployment of LLMs4Code in increasingly complex and sensitive development environments.
