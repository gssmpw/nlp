\section{Conclusions}

This survey offers a thorough overview of Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs), emphasizing personalized responses tailored to individual user data. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into three key technical perspectives: Personalized Prompting (Input Level), Personalized Adaptation (Model Level), and Personalized Alignment (Objective Level), with further subdivisions within each. We also discuss current limitations and propose several promising directions for future research. Our work provides valuable insights and a framework to drive the advancement of PLLMs development.
