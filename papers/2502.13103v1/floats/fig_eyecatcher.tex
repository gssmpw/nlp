    \caption {\textbf{\textit{WeedsGalore} dataset.} We present a novel reference dataset for UAV-based weed monitoring for maize fields. The dataset a) contains images with 5-bands (RGB, near-infrared, red-edge) and b) is recorded at different growth stages, fully reflecting real-world agricultural practices. c) We provide detailed pixel-level annotations for semantic (multiple weed classes) and instance segmentation.}
