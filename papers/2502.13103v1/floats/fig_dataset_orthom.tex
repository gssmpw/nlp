    \caption{\textbf{Ortohomosaic of the full field and georeferenced locations of annotated images.} Points show captured image locations, while their colors encode acquisition dates. The dataset splits are spatially separated by patches into \textcolor[HTML]{6a8caf}{train}, \textcolor[HTML]{e89c71}{validation}, and \textcolor[HTML]{a8a8a8}{test}. Smaller polygons are drawn around the annotated samples: The \textit{multitemporal} dataset contains samples from the same locations from all dates. Best viewed on screen and zoomed in.}
