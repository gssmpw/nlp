Introducing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the field of SR reconstruction revolutionized____. The CNNs capture smooth and slowly varying features of data while struggling to represent finer details and rapid variations accurately, thus introducing the challenge of spectral bias in the super-resolution (SR) task ____. Next, the Single Image Super Resolution CNN (SRCNN) architecture jointly optimizes all layers and three color channels simultaneously ____. The performance comparison of the SRCNN, Fast SRCNN-ESM, Efficient Sub-pixel CNN, Enhanced Deep Residual Network, and SRGANs in ____ indicate that the performance of the EDRN is better in terms of PSNR, and it can capture the high-frequency components of the ESM images more efficiently. Very Deep SR (VDSR) further improved the accuracy of the HR images utilizing a deep architecture____. Enhanced Deep SR (EDSR) uses more residual blocks in VDSR for better HR image reconstruction ____.

SIREN mitigates the frequency characteristics of an image through its periodic activation function and could demonstrate improved spectral bias in the SR task ____. 

\noindent \textbf{The Vision Transformer (ViT)} architecture introduced a pipeline where a pure transformer is applied directly to sequences of image patches that perform well for the image classification tasks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train____. ViT can model long-range dependencies and global context, making it particularly suitable for complex datasets like those found in climate research and SR applications ____.


% They call it a downscaling task, while we call it an SR task

In Section~\ref{sec-method}, we introduce the methodology behind \textbf{ViSIR}, the hybrid vision transformer algorithm. In Section~\ref{sec-data}, we describe the ESM dataset and how the RGB image collection was derived, and the Proof of Concept in Section~\ref{sec-POC} for the three experiments and the summary of findings we present in Section~\ref{sec-Exp}.
