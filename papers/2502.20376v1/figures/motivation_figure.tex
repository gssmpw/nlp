    \caption{
    Each row presents a real, highly detailed image followed by reconstruction results using progressively more precise conditions during inversion and denoising. As shown, increasing the precision of the condition enhances reconstruction accuracy. In the rightmost column, we use the ultimate condition -- the input image itself -- resulting in the highest reconstruction fidelity. In all presented results, no CFG was applied during either the inversion or denoising processes.}
