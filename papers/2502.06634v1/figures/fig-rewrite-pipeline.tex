The pipeline for caption augmentation.
Given molecules and their \textcolor{violet}{original captions}, we prompt LLMs to generate \textcolor{oceanboatblue}{augmented captions} by rewriting the original captions. 
The moleculeâ€™s SMILES strings are also integrated into this caption generation process to ensure accuracy and relevance.
