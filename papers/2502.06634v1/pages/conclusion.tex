This work proposes an automatic annotation augmentation pipeline, \pipeline, designed to enhance annotated datasets and thereby boost the performance of AI approaches with minimal cost. 
We generate \newdataset, an enriched biomedical dataset featuring diverse sentences and vocabulary while preserving essential molecular knowledge.
This increased diversity is crucial for training \newmodel models, leading to remarkable improvements in challenging molecular tasks. 
A set of ablation studies investigate the impact of \pipeline design and affirm its effectiveness.

Furthermore, we expand the application of \pipeline to a wide range of datasets across different domains, including \emph{image captioning}, \emph{text understanding}, and \emph{graph property prediction}.
The observed significant improvements vindicate the remarkable versatility and utility of \pipeline.
