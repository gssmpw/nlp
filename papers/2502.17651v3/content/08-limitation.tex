Our work is not without limitations. First, our \model{} is based on VLMs, which require extensive prompt engineering. Although we selected the best-performing prompts available, it is possible that even more effective prompts could further enhance our results. Second, automatic evaluations have inherent imperfections and may not capture all details in the chart perfectly. We adopted the evaluation metric from previous work to ensure fairness. Third, \model{} has higher costs than direct prompting. Future work could explore how to optimize these costs.
