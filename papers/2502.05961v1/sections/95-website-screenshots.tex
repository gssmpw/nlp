After reading through the provided list, they can choose to participate or not. The full informed consent is shown in~\cref{fig:full_consent_partA} and~\cref{fig:full_consent_partB}. The condensed informed consent page was built after feedback from Contributors and Community Ambassadors that both the technical and essential meaning of the full form often got lost in translation to other languages.}
