	abstract = {Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitously distributed protein belonging to the immunophilin family. CyPA has peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which regulates protein folding and trafficking. Although CyPA was initially believed to function primarily as an intracellular protein, recent studies have revealed that it can be secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Current research in animal models and humans has provided compelling evidences supporting the critical function of CyPA in several human diseases. This review discusses recently available data about CyPA in cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, neurodegeneration, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, asthma, periodontitis and aging. It is believed that further elucidations of the role of CyPA will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and will help develop novel pharmacological therapies.},

            AutoDock Vina, a new program for molecular docking and virtual screening, is presented. AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude speed‐up compared with the molecular docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4), while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed‐up is achieved from parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2010},
