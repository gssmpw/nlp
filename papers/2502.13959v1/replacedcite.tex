LLMs equipped with tools
have recently shown great promise as autonomous agents for scientific discoveries, including
drug discovery____.
%
For instance, AutoBA____ uses LLMs
to automate multi-omics bioinformatics analysis,
generating new insights using well-known bioinformatics 
libraries.
%
Another example for biomedical research is \protagent____, an LLM agent system for \emph{de novo} protein design, equipped with physics-based simulations to ground its design process.
%
Materials science can also benefit from LLM agents as well, as shown by
\alab____, a self-driving laboratory that uses an LLM agent to control both analysis tools and laboratory hardware for semiconductor material design.

%
For drug discovery, 
\coscientist____ uses LLMs to perform web search,
conduct technical documentation, program, and operate physical hardware modules
to plan and control chemical synthetic experiments.
%
It demonstrates the viability LLM agents equipped with both physical and computational tools to 
act as self-driving laboratories for organic chemistry. 
%
However, \coscientist does not integrate any domain-specific tools for grounding, but rather relies upon the LLM's intrinsic chemistry knowledge, web search, and results from the physical experiments.

In addition, \chemcrow____ is an LLM agent equipped with specific tools for small molecule organic chemistry.
These tools support generating molecule structures from natural language descriptions, predicting molecule properties,
conducting \emph{in silico} safety checks, and performing retrosynthesis planning.
Grounded by these tools, \chemcrow demonstrates an ability to perform complex, multi-step chemistry tasks commonly found in the drug discovery process. 
%
\cactus____ is a similar agent to \chemcrow,
emphasizing tools that can predict properties important to drug discovery.
%
\drugagent____ is an LLM agent for drug repurposing, equipped with tools to search databases of existing drugs to identify candidates likely to interact with a protein target.
%
Notably, none of these LLM agents are grounded with well-established computational tools for 
novel structure-based drug discovery (SBDD).
