\section*{Limitations}
Despite the effectiveness of LLM-QE in enhancing query expansion for dense retrieval, several limitations remain. First, LLM-QE depends on the quality of document-based query expansions generated by the LLM. If the LLM produces low-quality or biased expansions, retrieval performance may degrade. While the reward model helps mitigate this issue, further improvements in controlling LLM outputs are still an open challenge. Additionally, compared to vanilla dense retrieval models, LLM-QE introduces additional computational costs due to the need for generating document-based query expansions.
