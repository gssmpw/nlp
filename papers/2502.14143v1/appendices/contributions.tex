\section{Contributions}
\label{app:contributions}

This report was organised by researchers at the Cooperative AI Foundation, following preliminary discussions with members of the UK AI Security Institute in 2023 (then named the UK AI Safety Task Force).
Case studies were partially generated at a \href{https://alignmentjam.com/jam/multiagent}{Multi-Agent Safety Hackathon} organised by Apart Research and the Cooperative AI Foundation, also in 2023.
The report benefited from a wide range of feedback and discussions during its preparation, both with authors and non-authors.
