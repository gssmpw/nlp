\subsection{ASR for Low-Resource Languages}

Several approaches have been explored to overcome the low-resource challenges. One approach involves leveraging data and resources from high-resource languages to bootstrap ASR systems for low-resource languages. This can be achieved through techniques such as cross-lingual transfer learning \cite{yadav-sitaram-2022-survey}, where models pre-trained in high-resource languages are adapted to low-resource languages using limited data. Other commonly used methods include model distillation \cite{seth2023, yang2023knowledge}, self-supervised pre-training~\cite{baevski2019effectiveness}, data augmentation \cite{Park_2019, nguyen2020improvingseq2seqasr, Lam_2021}, and multi-task learning~\cite{chen2014joint}.

\subsection{Existing Work on Oromo ASR}

Despite its large speaker population, the Oromo language remains severely under-resourced in terms of ASR research. While some efforts have been made to develop resources, such as text corpora for machine translation that include 42K English-Oromo pairs \cite{chala2021}, very few studies have specifically focused on Oromo speech processing. Some preliminary work includes acoustic modeling for Oromo using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with limited data \cite{teshite2023afan} for 64 command words. Another ASR research was reported in~\cite{abate-etal-2020-large} using 22 hours of Oromo speech. All the datasets are small and not publicly available.
