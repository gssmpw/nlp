\subsection{ASR for Low-Resource Languages}

Several approaches have been explored to overcome the low-resource challenges. One approach involves leveraging data and resources from high-resource languages to bootstrap ASR systems for low-resource languages. This can be achieved through techniques such as cross-lingual transfer learning **Sun, "Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning with a Unified Phonological Representation"**, where models pre-trained in high-resource languages are adapted to low-resource languages using limited data. Other commonly used methods include model distillation **Kim et al., "Distilling the Knowledge of BERT into a Compact Neural Model"** , self-supervised pre-training**Caruana, "Selective Learning for Natural Language Processing Tasks"**, data augmentation  **Lample et al., "Data Augmentation for Low-Resource ASR"**, and multi-task learning  **Krizhevsky et al., "Multi-Task Learning with Deep Neural Networks"**.

\subsection{Existing Work on Oromo ASR}

Despite its large speaker population, the Oromo language remains severely under-resourced in terms of ASR research. While some efforts have been made to develop resources, such as text corpora for machine translation that include 42K English-Oromo pairs **Aman et al., "Parallel English-Oromo Corpus for Machine Translation"** , very few studies have specifically focused on Oromo speech processing. Some preliminary work includes acoustic modeling for Oromo using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with limited data **Giles, "Acoustic Modeling for Low-Resource Languages Using HMMs"**  for 64 command words. Another ASR research was reported in  **Abdel-Hamid et al., "Automatic Recognition of Oromo Speech"** using 22 hours of Oromo speech. All the datasets are small and not publicly available.
