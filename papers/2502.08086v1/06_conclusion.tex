\section{Conclusion}
CircuitSAT problems are typically transformed into Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems, where the sampling task is performed using SAT samplers, albeit with computational complexities, especially for large circuits. To reduce the computational complexity of the CircuitSAT sampling task and leverage GPU acceleration, this paper introduced a novel differentiable sampler called {\sc Demotic}. {\sc Demotic} re-frames the CircuitSAT problem as a multi-output regression task, utilizing gradient descent for learning diverse solutions. By maintaining the circuit's structure without Boolean conversion, {\sc Demotic} enables parallel learning and GPU-accelerated sampling, offering significant advancements in CircuitSAT sampling methodology. We have demonstrated the exceptional performance of {\sc Demotic} in the sampling task across various CircuitSAT instances, where it outperformed state-of-the-art samplers by more than two orders of magnitude in most cases.
