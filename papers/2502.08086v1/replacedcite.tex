\section{Related Work}
Several SAT formula sampling techniques have been explored in the literature. {\sc UniGen3}, for instance, offers approximate uniformity guarantees ____, while {\sc CMSGen} and {\sc Quicksampler} ____ prioritize sampling efficiency. Previous research has also investigated the use of data-parallel hardware for SAT solving, primarily focusing on parallelizing CDCL or other heuristic-based SAT solving algorithms ____. Attempts have been made to frame a SAT instance as a constrained numerical optimization problem, as seen in recent work like {\sc MatSat} ____ and {\sc NeuroSAT} ____. Nevertheless, these approaches have fallen short in showcasing the efficacy of GPU-accelerated formula sampling on standard benchmarks, which are larger and more diverse than the small, random instances typically examined in earlier research. A new differentiable sampling method named {\sc DiffSampler} was recently introduced in ____. This method allows for GPU-accelerated SAT sampling on standard benchmarks and achieved a comparable runtime performance with respect to {\sc UniGen3} and {\sc CMSGen}.
