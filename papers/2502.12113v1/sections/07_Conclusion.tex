\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this technical report we present that a low-latency, high-accuracy monocular motion-capture system with an event-camera. The experiments with static objects show that the system has millimeter accuracy and the closed-loop experiments with the small quadrotor demonstrate that it is is well-suited for real-time control in mobile robotics tasks. 

Originally, we developed the system with a focus on confined environments where a commercial, multi-camera system can not be used. However, we now believe that monocular event-camera motion-capture systems are highly relevant in a broader sense: event-cameras are expensive sensors, but the cost of a single event camera is 10 to 100 times less than that of a full motion-capture system, making the presented approach appealing for low-cost applications where the limited tracking volume (only in front of the event-camera) is a great trade-off for the small form factor, portability and cost.
