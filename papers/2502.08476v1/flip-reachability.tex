\section{Relation to flip-reachability logic}\label{sec:freach}


In this section we prove \Cref{thm:main-freach}. The main part of the work is presented in \cref{sec:low-rank-comb}, where we develop a combinatorial characterization of sets of low rank in undirected graphs. This description is captured in the key technical statement: Low Rank Structure Theorem (\cref{thm:low-rank-structure}). Then, we complete the proof of \Cref{thm:main-freach} in \cref{sec:flip-reach-proof}.
