\section{Implementation details of the GPT4-o evaluation.}



In the GPT-4-o evaluation process, we tailor distinct evaluation metrics for different tasks, ensuring both direct scoring and selective ranking are covered to suit the task's nature.

\subsection{Direct Scoring Evaluation (for Procedural Sequence Generation and Ablation Studies)}
The assistant evaluates a sequence of images depicting a procedural process with criteria such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Measures content alignment with the provided prompt, scored from 1 (not accurate) to 5 (completely accurate).
  \item \textbf{Coherence:} Assesses logical flow from 1 (disjointed) to 5 (seamless progression).
  \item \textbf{Usability:} Rates helpfulness for understanding the procedure from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (highly helpful).
\end{itemize}
Scores are output in JSON format, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "Accuracy": 4,
  "Coherence": 5,
  "Usability": 4
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Selective Ranking Evaluation (for User Study Comparisons)}
This evaluation compares multiple images from different models, ranking them by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Which image best represents the prompt?
  \item \textbf{Coherence:} Which image shows the clearest, most logical process?
  \item \textbf{Usability:} Which image offers the most helpful visual guidance?
\end{itemize}
Rankings are provided from 1 (best) to 4 and outputted in JSON format, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "Accuracy": 1,
  "Coherence": 2,
  "Usability": 3
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Example of Task Prompt and Evaluation:}
Prompt: "This image shows the process of creating a handmade sculpture."
Images: [Upload images of models 1, 2, 3, and 4]
Evaluation: The assistant ranks the models for Accuracy, Coherence, and Usability in JSON format.
This evaluation merges qualitative and quantitative assessments to determine the effectiveness of the images generated by GPT-4-o models.
