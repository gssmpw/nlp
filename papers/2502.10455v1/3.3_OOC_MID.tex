\subsection{OOC Multimodal Instruction Dataset}

For the news domain and OOC detection task, a multimodal instruction dataset with both judgment and explanation is constructed to enhance the model's discriminatory powers. Although the previous method~\cite{qi2024sniffer} adopts InstructBLIP~\cite{dai2023instructblip} converting images into textual descriptions (as if it could visualize the image) and uses the close-source language-only GPT-4~\cite{achiam2023gpt} to capture inconsistencies between them, this destroys informative content related to authentic images. We summarize this issue stemming from a cross-modal semantic gap between images and the corresponding textual descriptions~\cite{jiang2024hallucination}. Therefore, we retain authentic images for claims in the OOC detection.

By leveraging Qwen2-VL~\cite{wang2024qwen2}, we adjust the model to follow an explanation prompt $\mathcal{P}_{Expla.}$, as shown in subfigure (c) of \Cref{fig:3}. Typically, we provide $(v,t, \widetilde{v}^r_e)$ as the part of this prompt that queries Qwen2-VL~\cite{wang2024qwen2} to perform desired behaviors, \ie, generating compelling explanations to support their judgments for the falsified information. The whole process can be defined as follows,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vcg_5}
  \widetilde{\mathcal{D}} = \{(x,\widetilde{v}^r_e,{t}^r_e),s\mid x \sim \mathcal{D}, s \sim g(s \mid I(v,t,\widetilde{v}^r_e))\},
\end{equation}
where $I(v,t,\widetilde{v}^r_e)$ denotes an instantiated instruction by presenting an image-claim pair $(v,t)$ and the rewritten content $\widetilde{v}^r_e$. Besides, $g$ and $s$ refer to the LVLM model and its output, respectively. The sign $x$ is the sample $(v,t)$, and ${t}^r_e$ denotes the most relevant item related to the claim $t$. This item is achieved by cosine similarity, unless otherwise specified. As for NewsCLIPpings~\cite{luo2021newsclippings}, the constructed OOC multimodal instruction dataset $\widetilde{\mathcal{D}}$ consists of instructions with an equal number of falsified samples and pristine samples.
