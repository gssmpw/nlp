\section{Proof of \autoref{thm:convergence-utility}}
\label{appd:proof}

Let $W^*$ be the converged parameter point of the model such that 
\[
J(W^*) \;\;\ge\;\; \sup_{W \in \mathcal{M}}\, J(W)\;-\;\varepsilon,
\]
where $J(W) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}}\!\bigl[\log P_W(y \mid x)\bigr]$, and $\varepsilon \ge 0$. Denote by $\lambda(\cdot)$ the pre-trained representation, and let $\mathcal{T} : \lambda(x)\mapsto \lambda_{\text{aligned}}(x)$ be the \emph{residual shift} learned during safety fine-tuning. The space $V_{\mathcal{T}}$ comprises the linear directions $\{v\}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ that describe how $\mathcal{T}$ modifies $\lambda(x)$ to encourage aligned outputs.

We first define a zero-utility direction $v\in V_{\mathcal{T}}$ as one where \emph{no} pair $(w_0,w_1)$ satisfies both:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:utility-criterion}
\lambda(w_1) - \lambda(w_0) \;\in\; \{\alpha v : \alpha > 0\},
\quad
\frac{P\bigl(C=1 \,\mid\, \lambda(w_1)\bigr)}
     {P\bigl(C=1 \,\mid\, \lambda(w_0)\bigr)}
\;>\; 1.
\end{equation}
Here, $C=1$ indicates that $f_{W^*}(x) = y$ (the model's output is correct/aligned); $C=0$ otherwise.

For any zero-utility direction $v$, we can construct a modified parameter $\widetilde{W}^*$ by projecting out $v$:
\[
\widetilde{W}^*\;=\;\Psi\bigl(W^*, v\bigr),
\]
where $\Psi(\cdot,\cdot)$ removes components along $v$ from the internal representations.\footnote{%
Concretely, $\Psi$ can subtract from every hidden state $h$ in $W^*$ any component proportional to $v$, i.e.\ $h \mapsto h - \operatorname{proj}_v(h)$. One may equivalently interpret $\widetilde{W}^*$ as setting to zero all parameter weights that shift representations along $v$.}

Since $v$ is zero-utility, this projection preserves the model's behavior:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:same-likelihood}
P_{W^*}(y \mid x) \;=\; P_{\widetilde{W}^*}(y \mid x)
\end{equation}
for all training samples $(x,y)$. This means the training objective $J(W)$ remains unchanged:
\[
J\bigl(\widetilde{W}^*\bigr) \;=\; J\bigl(W^*\bigr)
\]

Given that $W^*$ converged with $J(W^*) \ge \sup_{W\in \mathcal{M}} J(W) - \varepsilon$, it cannot contain any zero-utility directions. If it did, we could remove such a direction without affecting performance, contradicting the convergence assumption. This holds even for $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solutions.

By contraposition, every direction $v \in V_{\mathcal{T}}$ must contribute positively to the training objective for some pair of contexts, matching (\autoref{eq:pop}) in the main text.

\noindent \emph{Remark.} The crucial point is that a converged model—be it a local maximum or an $\varepsilon$‐suboptimal solution—does not retain truly useless directions, thus ensuring all directions in $V_{\mathcal{T}}$ contribute positively to the training objective for some pair of contexts.

    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We implement our trigger removal attack on Llama 3 8B using an iterative approach. For each harmful prompt from \strongreject, we perform $n=3$ iterations of trigger identification and removal. In each iteration, we first generate 10 rephrased variants using Llama 3 405B as the resampling model\footnote{When Llama 3 405B refuses to rephrase harmful content, we fall back to Hermes 3 405B~\cite{teknium2024hermes3technicalreport}, which has weaker safety guardrails.}. These variants maintain the harmful intent while varying the style and expression. We then evaluate each variant using the Strong Reject Score metric to identify which rephrasing attempts successfully bypass the model's safety mechanisms. The variants with the lower scores (more likely to be rejected) are analyzed using Partial Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (PLRP) to extract tokens that contribute most to circumventing safety guardrails. These identified trigger tokens are added to a growing blacklist. In practice, we found that generating multiple variants per iteration is crucial, as the trigger tokens identified from training data alone are insufficient for consistently bypassing the model's safety mechanisms. The process continues until either the maximum iterations are reached or a successful bypass is achieved.

\subsection{Dataset Construction and Composition}
\label{appd:dataset_construction}

\paragraph{Composition of the Dataset.} 
For the composition of the training set, we selected jailbreak methods or alignment blindspots, which are challenging in recent research, as methods for generating harmful examples.
We applied all jailbreak methods on STRONG REJECT \cite{souly2024strongreject} to generate harmful samples. Additionally, we collected harmless samples from the OR-Bench \cite{cui2024or} dataset to balance the dataset.

All the baseline jailbreak methods we applied include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PAIR} \cite{chao2023pair} guides the LLM through a carefully designed system prompt template to iteratively refine harmful input based on the target LLM's responses, in order to attack the black-box model.
    \item \textbf{ReNellm} \cite{ding2023wolf} enhances stealth by rewriting the expression form of the harmful prompt and nesting it in three general task scenarios to attack black-box models.
    \item \textbf{GPTFuzz} \cite{yu2023gptfuzzer} systematically generates and filters adversarial harmful prompts to attack black-box models by automating a fuzz testing framework, combining semantic variation and feedback iteration.
    \item \textbf{GCG} \cite{zou2023universal} train an attack suffix for a specific white-box model, with the goal of maximizing the model's production of affirmative responses when it is appended to harmful queries to the LLM to produce objectionable content.
    \item \textbf{CodeChaeleom} \cite{lv2024codechameleon} reconstructs harmful queries into code completion tasks and embeds decryption functions, enabling the model to accurately execute attack instructions while bypassing intent security detection.
    \item \textbf{Flip} \cite{liu2024flipattack} creates left-side noise by reversing the order of characters in harmful prompts to attack the left-to-right autoregressive understanding mechanism of black-box large language models, and designs a reverse guidance module to enable the model to recover and execute the original instructions.
    \item \textbf{Simple} is a simple baseline jailbreak method we designed. It effectively jailbreaks Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct by wrapping harmful input into historical questions using a fixed simple prompt template.
    Prompt~\ref{box:simple_prompt} shows the specific implementation of the Simple jailbreaking prompt.
\end{itemize}

\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Construction of Dataset.} 
For the specific construction of samples, we considered two training setups:

For security supervision fine-tuning (SSFT) \cite{inan2023llama} training, it is only necessary to label the corresponding tags on the collected prompts.
We organize the prompts and labels according to the chat template as samples, and train the model to predict whether it is safe and to classify and predict harmful prompts.

    \textbf{Output format:}\\

\end{tcolorbox}

For Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \cite{rafailov2024direct} training, the first step is to sample the model's rejection responses to harmful samples as the preferred output.
For harmful examples generated by applying the jailbreak methods on STRONG REJECT, we use a fixed reject prompt template to guide the model to generate rejection responses. We choose the Llama-3.1-405B model, which is more robust to dangerous samples and more likely to reject them, as the sampling model. The specific implementation of the prompt template is shown in Prompt~\ref{box:reject_prompt}.

Additionally, we need to introduce another accept prompt template to guide the model to generate responses that accept harmful input. Considering that the Llama-3.1-Instruct model in the experiment shows a tendency to refuse some of the samples, we choose the weakly aligned Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B \cite{teknium2024hermes3technicalreport} model to sample as the Non-Preferred Output for harmful samples. The specific implementation of the prompt template is shown in Prompt~\ref{box:accept_prompt}.

\end{tcolorbox}

For the reject prompt template applied to Llama-3.1-405B, it only represents the method of sampling the Llama model's refusal response to a certain input and is not related to the security of the input itself. The same applies to the accept prompt template applied to Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B.

\paragraph{Division of the Dataset.} 
For the specific division and setting of the dataset quantity, we separately discuss the division logic of the training set and the test set.

\label{appd:dynamic_division_mechanism}
In the training set, to demonstrate the changes in results after models learn to recognize and handle different numbers of unseen harmful queries during safety fine-tuning, we refer to a dynamic division mechanism called \textbf{N-SHOT Security Training}.
For SSFT and DPO training, the number of harmful samples and harmless samples in the training set remains unchanged, fixed at 1300 each.
However, the harmful samples contain an alignment blindspot samples subset, which are dangerous samples obtained by applying all jailbreak methods to a dynamic subset of size N from STRONG REJECT. The left of \autoref{fig:train_test_set} shows a case where N=80. We apply our Trigger Removal method and baseline methods on the first N=80 samples of STRONG REJECT as harmful input sampling, forming the alignment blindspot samples part.

\label{appd:dpo_sampling}
To make up 1,300 harmful samples, we directly use the original harmful input samples from STRONG REJECT and AdvBench as supplementary samples. Correspondingly, harmless samples are directly sampled using the original harmless input samples from OR-Bench. It is worth noting that in training, the prompt template application for sampling harmless samples is opposite; we apply the accept prompt template sampling on harmless samples as the Preferred Output, and apply the reject prompt template sampling on harmless samples as the Non-Preferred Output.

In the test set, we focus only on whether the model learns to recognize and handle unseen harmful queries as the amount of safety fine-tuning varies, while avoiding significant over-refusal. Therefore, we divide out a fixed 60 STRONG REJECT samples that are completely disjoint from the training set, and apply all the jailbreak methods to them to form the harmful queries portion of the test set. Additionally, we directly use a fixed 480 original inputs from OR-Bench that do not overlap with the training set as the harmless queries portion of the test set. The right of \autoref{fig:train_test_set} shows the partitioning of the fixed test set.

\label{fig:train_test_set}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Training Procedure and Results}

\paragraph{Metrics.}
We use the Strong Reject Score \cite{ding2023wolf} as the evaluation metric for the training effectiveness of N-SHOT Security Training.
The Strong Reject Score is a metric for assessing jailbreak methods, taking two inputs: a dangerous task, and outputs from the model after the application of a jailbreak method.
It utilizes a carefully designed prompt template to score using a LLM. The score is used to measure the harmfulness of the model output; the higher the score, the more effective the jailbreak method.

\label{appd:training_procedure}
In the experiment, we performed two alignment strategies, Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), on the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. All experiments used six A800 GPUs.
As described in \autoref{appd:dynamic_division_mechanism}, we dynamically adjust the number of STRONG REJECT samples N for various jailbreak methods in the experiment.
As shown in \autoref{fig:train_test_set} for the case where \(N=80\), for each jailbreak method, the model will learn from 80 examples of the same original harmful goal extracted from STRONG REJECT.
All jailbreak methods considered as alignment blindspots are applied separately on the same samples, and as N increases from 0, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct learns an increasing number of these unseen harmful queries.
Therefore, we achieved the dynamic training method N-SHOT Security Training by altering N, to study how increased exposure affects rejection accuracy and safety.

\paragraph{Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT).}
In SSFT training, we only provide the input and target output of the training samples.
For the input of harmful samples, we we label them as unsafe with a prompt classification as the target output, and for the input of harmless samples, we label them as safe as the target.
Specific training parameters are set to a learning rate of $1e^{-6}$, batch size 24, AdamW optimizer, maximum gradient norm 1.0, and training for 1 epoch.

\paragraph{Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).}
For DPO training, we designated model's rejected responses as preferred outputs and accepted responses as non-preferred outputs for harmful samples, while applying the inverse selection for harmless samples.
The configuration used a learning rate of $1e^{-6}$, batch size 24, AdamW optimizer, maximum gradient norm 1.0, DPO beta 0.1, with training conducted for 1 epoch.
We considered two cases: (1) training DPO directly on the original model, and (2) initializing from an SFT checkpoint (i.e., applying SFT first, then DPO). 

\paragraph{Results of SSFT.}
In \autoref{fig:sft-short}, we observe that for all jailbreak methods, the model's ability to reject harmful content significantly improves as the number of exposure examples in N-SHOT Security Training increases.
Before SSFT training, the Trigger Removal method is slightly less effective at jailbreaking compared to the best PAIR method, but after training, the PAIR method is quickly recognized and handled by the model, while the Trigger Removal method retains some jailbreaking capability even after being exposed to more than 80 example samples. Meanwhile, due to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's poor understanding of chaotic format and complex prompts, Flip and CodeChaeleom remains ineffective.
The Simple, and GCG methods are quickly recognized and handled by the model due to their simple patterns.
Table \ref{tab:sft_short_scores} shows the specific average Strong Reject Scores for each method on the test set under different exposure times in SSFT training, rounded to three decimal places.

\paragraph{Results of DPO.}
~\autoref{fig:dpo} and~\autoref{fig:sft-dpo} illustrate two cases in DPO training. It can be seen that DPO displays exactly the same trend as SSFT, but in both cases, DPO models recognize and handle all jailbreaking methods significantly slower than SSFT. 
Further, the approach of training DPO directly on the original model, compared to SSFT, shows fluctuations in the ability to reject the more varied forms of the PAIR method, suggesting that the directions learned by the model in DPO training are more divergent, making it more challenging to learn dominant directions.
On the other hand, the strategy of DPO training initialized from SFT shows that the foundation of SFT helps DPO focus more on dominant directions. This also ensures that the model does not exhibit over-refusal on safe samples.
Tables~\ref{tab:sft_scores} and~\ref{tab:sft_dpo_scores} show the specific average Strong Reject Scores of each method on the test set under different exposure times in DPO training, rounded to three decimal places.

Overall, each alignment method (SSFT, DPO, and SFT+DPO) benefited from seeing more exposure examples of jailbreak methods, leading to lower Strong Reject Scores. When DPO was combined with an SFT-initialized checkpoint, the model demonstrated both high accuracy on safe examples and robust refusal of harmful queries.

\subsection{Experiment on Models of Different Scale and Architecture}
\label{sec:scale_arch_exp }

To understand how model scale and architecture affect safety alignment, we conducted comparative experiments with two additional models: Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct~\cite{mistralai2024ministral}.  We applied identical DPO training, with results shown in Figures~\ref{fig:dpo-llama3.2-3b} and~\ref{fig:dpo-ministral} respectively.

Both models exhibited similar safety improvement trends to the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct baseline, but demonstrated weaker capabilities in recognizing and handling unseen harmful queries across all jailbreak methods. The 3B-parameter Llama variant showed faster initial convergence rates, particularly evident in Figure~\ref{fig:dpo-llama3.2-3b}, but consistently failed to recognize Trigger Removal attacks. This suggests smaller parameter spaces struggle to simultaneously capture flexible safety heuristics while excluding non-dominant attack patterns.

Ministral-8B-Instruct (Figure~\ref{fig:dpo-ministral}) demonstrated better retention of dominant safety directions but exhibited the slowest overall convergence rate. Notably, its training trajectory showed greater volatility across all baseline attack methods, with 22\% higher loss variance compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. This performance gap highlights architectural differences in safety learning capacity, even between models of comparable parameter count.

We evaluated the impact of model interventions on general task performance by measuring perplexity degradation on the Alpaca dataset~\cite{alpaca}. Specifically, we calculated perplexity solely on the output part of samples to assess whether the interventions compromised foundational capabilities.

Results are shown in \autoref{tab:ppl}.
Notably, interventions using DPO showed consistently higher perplexity (8.42) compared to the base Llama model (7.10) and SSFT baseline (6.59), indicating a more substantial impact on general capabilities.
Among the directional interventions, SSFT variants demonstrated relatively modest perplexity increases, with L25C1 showing the smallest degradation (7.04) followed by non-dominant component intervention (7.23) and L14C6 (7.32). These results suggest that our directional intervention approaches generally preserve the model's foundational capabilities while improving safety alignment.
