\begin{abstract}
% We study how to automatically decompose the problem into 
% Current inference scaling methods often rely on decomposing the problem into steps and then sampling possible next steps before choosing the best. However, steps and step sizes are often arbitrarily determined or rely on domain knowledge. 
% We show that dynamic decomposition, where we decompose the each part of the solution and reasoning trace automatically and dynamically, can help improve inference time performance. 
% This allows us to allocate more inference time compute to difficult steps.
% We demonstrate how dynamic decomposition improves performance more than other decomposition methods as well as approaches that do not decompose such as best of N on reasoning and coding benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench. 
% This opens the door for incorporating dynamic decomposition into a variety of inference scaling methods. 
Inference scaling methods often rely on decomposing problems into steps (or groups of tokens), followed by sampling and selecting the best next steps. 
However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge.
% However, these steps and their sizes are typically fixed or depend on domain knowledge. 
We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically fractions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference.
By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency.
% By allocating compute more effectively—particularly by subdividing challenging steps and sampling them more frequently—dynamic decomposition significantly enhances inference efficiency.
Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.

\section{Impact Statements}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
This work on dynamic decomposition aims to advance the field of LLM by improving the efficiency and accuracy of large-scale inference methods, particularly in domains like code generation, mathematical problem-solving, and automated reasoning. By dynamically allocating computational resources to challenging reasoning steps, this approach has the potential to enhance AI-powered tools in software development, STEM education, and scientific research. While the core contributions of this paper focus on technical advancements, we acknowledge the broader societal implications of scaling inference techniques, including risks of over-reliance on AI in decision-making and the potential propagation of errors or biases. To mitigate these concerns, future work should emphasize robust validation, fairness, and human-in-the-loop deployment strategies, particularly in high-stakes applications. Nonetheless, no immediate or specific ethical concerns are identified in the context of this research.
