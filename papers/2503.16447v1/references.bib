The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.}

    ABSTRACT = {This article surveys reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. Reinforcement learning is a framework for decision-making problems in which an agent interacts through trial-and-error with its environment to discover an optimal behavior. Since interaction is a key component in both reinforcement learning and social robotics, it can be a well-suited approach for real-world interactions with physically embodied social robots. The scope of the paper is focused particularly on studies that include social physical robots and real-world human-robot interactions with users. We present a thorough analysis of reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. In addition to a survey, we categorize existent reinforcement learning approaches based on the used method and the design of the reward mechanisms. Moreover, since communication capability is a prominent feature of social robots, we discuss and group the papers based on the communication medium used for reward formulation. Considering the importance of designing the reward function, we also provide a categorization of the papers based on the nature of the reward. This categorization includes three major themes: interactive reinforcement learning, intrinsically motivated methods, and task performance-driven methods. The benefits and challenges of reinforcement learning in social robotics, evaluation methods of the papers regarding whether or not they use subjective and algorithmic measures, a discussion in the view of real-world reinforcement learning challenges and proposed solutions, the points that remain to be explored, including the approaches that have thus far received less attention is also given in the paper. Thus, this paper aims to become a starting point for researchers interested in using and applying reinforcement learning methods in this particular research field.},

    abstract = {Assessing knowledge acquisition by the student is the primary task of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Assessment is needed to adapt learning materials and activities to student's capacities. In this paper, a proposal to infer the level of knowledge possessed by the student is presented. A general structure of an ITS is shown, an evaluation module based on Bayesian network is proposed. The module mainly based on a test was implemented to know what student knows. During the test, the software system chooses the new questions based on the responses to the previous ones, that is, the software system makes an adaption in real time. A network of concepts was used to get the inferences, which contains the relationships between concepts. Evaluation module could infer many questions and concepts through the relations and the probabilistic inference of the Bayesian network. It information easily can be used to reinforce weak topics in order to cover the student's needs. Given the positive evidence is considered that testing the rest of variable examined in the Bayesian network can provide better accurate in the diagnostic of student’ knowledge possession.}

abstract = {In order to give assertive support, robots need to understand the cognitive and emotional characteristics of learners while in the learning process. Also, if the task involves handling capacity, robots must have similar skills. Three concepts were explored to control the cognitive and emotional robot’s behavior: the psychological flow theory, the scaffolding pedagogic strategy, and the multiagents-software paradigm. Based on these concepts, the Human-Robot Scaffolding architecture was designed. It is divided into five blocks. First, the sensory block recognizes body gestures, speech, and task state. Second, the beliefs block estimates the skills and emotional state of learners. Third, the desires block validates the goals the robot can reach; the goals are grouped in skills development, emotional control, cognitive control, challenge control, life signals, and immediate support. Fourth, the intentions block, based on the goals competition strategy, selects the goal that the robot will perform. Finally, the action-planner block regulates the robot’s movements according to the robot’s emotions. The validation procedure was done with 53 learners ranging between 10 and 13 years old who study in public and private schools. Based on the research achievements, the robot fosters learning the Mean-Ends Analysis strategy and the solution of a problem. A video fragment that summarizes the research process is available in .},
