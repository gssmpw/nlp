\pb{VTubers.}
The emergence of VTubers has influenced online communities and digital culture, drawing attention from various angles \cite{lu2021kawaii, 10.1145/3604479.3604523}. 
Studies by Miranda et al. \cite{10.1007/978-3-031-45642-8_22} and Rohrbacher \& Mishra \cite{10.1007/978-3-031-61281-7_15} explore the global expansion of VTubers, highlighting differences in cultural reception and integration, with a particular focus on the influence of VTubers in Portugal, the USA, and Austria. Research by Xu \& Niu \cite{Xu_Niu_2023} delves into the psychological attributes of VTuber viewers, shedding light on the emotional and psychological factors that drive viewer engagement with VTubers. Furthermore, studies by Lee, Sebin \& Lee, Jungjin \cite{10058945} and Wan \& Lu \cite{10.1145/3637357} examine the community and social aspects of VTubing, including its impact on fandom experience and how it offers new avenues for exploring and expressing identity, particularly in relation to gender dynamics and community building. 
Additionally, Turner \cite{Turner1676326} and Chinchilla \& Kim \cite{doi:10.1080/10510974.2024.2337955} provide insights into the complex relationship between VTubers and identity, highlighting the role of VTubing in supporting marginalized communities and affecting perceptions of identity and social interaction. 

While previous studies have relied on qualitative research methods such as interviews with VTubers or their viewers, our research represents the first data-driven investigation into VTubers' viewers using a large-scale dataset. Through this approach, we uncover previously unstudied characteristics of core VTuber viewers.


\pb{Paid Subscriptions for Livestream.}
There are several livestream platforms offering a paid subscription or membership mechanism, and numerous studies have investigated this.
% 
Kobs et al. and Yu \& Jia explore how users' interaction behaviors and donations through paid subscriptions contribute to the platform's vibrant community \cite{kobs2020towards, 10.1145/3487553.3524260}. 
Kim et al. and Wohn et al. investigate the potential to identify paying viewers through sentiment analysis of chat messages and examine the motivations behind digital patronage, respectively \cite{10.1145/3311957.3359470, 10.1145/3311350.3347160}. 
Lee et al. employ multimodal analysis to deepen insights into subscription dynamics \cite{lee2024multimodal}.
Work by Br√ºndl et al. and Hilvert-Bruce et al. delve into synchronous participation and socio-motivational aspects of viewer engagement, highlighting the importance of active participation and community in influencing subscription behaviors \cite{doi:10.1080/0960085X.2022.2062468, HILVERTBRUCE201858}. 
Houssard et al. further address monetization inequalities within Twitch, offering insights into the economic disparities faced by creators \cite{houssard2023monetization}. 

Our research differs in two key ways. First, while previous studies have concentrated on recommending streamers to viewers, our work shifts the focus towards assisting streamers in identifying potential members. Second, Bilibili's membership system distinguishes itself by being more expansive and offering additional features. We are the first to study the impact of these additional features on VTuber monetization.
