\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented a comprehensive study of the core viewers of VTubers on Bilibili, the primary platform for VTuber livestreaming in China. Our findings offer valuable insights into the behaviors and characteristics of core VTuber viewers, which we use to develop a tool that can help VTubers identify potential high-quality viewers and effectively grow their fan communities. Additionally, our results underscore the challenges of retaining core viewers, building a unique fan community culture, and moderating toxic behaviors during livestreams. In the future, we aim to extend our analysis to other platforms, such as YouTube for Japanese VTubers and Twitch for non-Asian VTubers.
