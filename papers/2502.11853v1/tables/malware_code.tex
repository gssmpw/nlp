    \caption{Detailed example of a basic ransomware generated using SQL-based combined transformation against Claude Sonnet 3.5. The code appears to be a ransomware prototype that recursively encrypts common file types (e.g., .doc, .pdf) on a system's C:\ drive using AES-CBC encryption, deletes originals, and generates a ransom note. It operates stealthily by suppressing errors and lacks decryption capabilities, rendering data irretrievable without external recovery methods.}
