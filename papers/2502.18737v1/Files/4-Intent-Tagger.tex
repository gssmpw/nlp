\section{IntentTagger: An Intent Tagging-based Slide Creation System}

Driven by \rev{the requirements of rich content creation tasks and} the design principles described in the previous section, we explored novel input strategies through graphical micro-prompting interactions---an interaction notion we coined \textit{intent tagging}. 
\rev{In addition to our design principles, a central inspiration for conceptualizing creative intent elicitation through granular and flexible micro prompts that represent users’ intention was the ``mood board'' technique, in which creatives iteratively compile visual and textual elements into a collage to convey an overarching theme or creative direction \cite{garner_problem_2001}. 
Similar to how mood boards enable capturing and expressing designers’ intent through compiling different media with varying levels of abstractions---such as words and pictures ranging from abstract concepts, stylistic references, or specific material details---intent tagging allows users to express their intent openly through collections of intent tags.}

\rev{To explore further the idea of intent tagging,} we created \textit{IntentTagger}, an LLM-driven system allowing users to iteratively create and modify slide deck presentations using intent tags on a 2D canvas interface (see Figure \ref{fig:system-ui}). 
In this section, we demonstrate the utility of \textit{IntentTagger} by first illustrating its functionalities in a use-case scenario. We then follow with a detailed description of the proposed interface mechanisms and their implementation.

\subsection{Interface Features}

Here, we provide a more detailed explanation of IntentTagger's features:

\subsubsection{\textbf{Intent Tags: Concept Tags, Reference Tags and Groups (DP2)}}
Intent tags are collections of single keywords, phrases, or media artifacts describing users' intended outcomes. 
Tags serve as granular and flexible micro prompts on a zoomable 2D canvas. 
Users can steer the generative slide creation system through two types of tags:

    \Description{The figure shows two examples of concept tags with a label and value format. The first example is an active tag labeled “Topic” with the value “Product Launch,” displayed with a bold border. The second example is an inactive tag with the same label and value, but shown with a lighter, grayed-out appearance, indicating that it is not currently influencing the content generation. Both tags have a drop-down arrow for selecting or modifying the value.}
\end{figure}
          \textbf{(1) Concept Tags:} Concept Tags are two-part text micro prompts of the format [label: value], such as \textit{”Topic: Product launch”} or \textit{”Color scheme: Corporate.”} Tags can be active or inactive to toggle their influence on generated content.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Deck Steering Canvas and Slide Steering Overlay (DP1, DP3)} }
 Users can generate and modify single slides or entire slide decks using Intent Tags.
The \textit{Deck Steering Canvas} allows users to steer the (re)generation of entire slide decks. For example, specifying the number of total slides or changing the overall tone of the deck's text from brief to more verbose. 
Alternatively, the \textit{Slide Steering Overlay} allows users to steer the (re)generation and explore alternatives of single slides. 


\subsubsection{\textbf{Outline Editor (DP1)}}

Parallel to slides, the system also generates a presentation outline, which can be optionally edited using the outline editor. This editor also allows participants to start a new presentation by first drafting an outline or letting the system generate an outline from provided intent tags.  

\subsubsection{\textbf{Editing Intent Tags, Tag Widgets, and System Suggestions (DP3, DP4, DP5)}}

Intent tags allow users to formulate their intent in several ways, such as manually creating and editing tags or choosing from options generated through LLM-driven dynamic adaptive UI mechanisms:

(B) The “Mood” tag is being adjusted from “Bright” to “Dark,” changing the background color and text style from light to dark. (C) The “Layout” tag is set to adjust between “Text” and “Visual,” gradually blending the layout from a text-heavy format to a more image-focused layout. These examples illustrate how users can fine-tune the content, mood, and layout of slides using intent tags.}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Steering Slide Generation}}

To summarize the different ways of steering slide generation with Intent Tags, Figure \ref{fig:tag-impact} illustrates how including a tag suggestion modifies the content of a slide, using the drop-down list changes a slide's mood, and using the opposite slider widget blends between a text- and image-heavy layout.  


\subsubsection{\textbf{Previews of Slides and Slider Values (DP5)}}
IntentTagger integrates several preview features, allowing users to explore alternative tag values without committing to long waiting times: The tag's \textit{Drop-down} list shows pre-generated previews as tooltips of how the current slide would look like with that tag value applied (Figure \ref{fig:drop-down}). 
The \textit{Opposite Slider} widget shows generated explanations describing the resulting effect if applied to the generation (Figure \ref{fig:slider}). All tag previews and explanations get asynchronously pre-generated in the background, allowing users to explore these options in real time. 



\subsubsection{\textbf{Referencing External Documents (DP2)}}
Besides \textit{Concept Tags}, users can also include external files for the generative slide creation as \textit{Reference Tags}.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Tag Grounding Acts (DP4)}}
While Intent Tagging presents granular and flexible mechanisms for users to communicate their intentions to the generative AI slide creation system, this principle also works backward in so-called \textit{Tag Grounding Acts}, where the system creates intent tags from user inputs such as longer text prompts or slides.

    \Description{The figure shows how the system analyzes a slide’s layout and text style when a user invokes the Slide Steering Overlay. The current layout is “Two Column,” and the text style is set to “Bullet List.” The system pre-populates these attributes as intent tags, representing the slide’s current content sources, narrative, and visual style, providing a starting point for users to make adjustments through the intent tagging interface.}

          \textbf{Grounding from Slide}
Each time a user invokes the \textit{Slide Steering Overlay} to adjust single slides, the system first analyzes the slide's \textit{content sources}, \textit{narrative}, and \textit{visual style} and then pre-populates the interface with intent tags representing the slide's current state. This provides an easy starting point for users to make adjustments through Intent Tags.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

IntentTagger is implemented in TypeScript using ReactJS \cite{react.js_reactjs_2024} with ReactFlow \cite{reactflow_react_2024} for the tag canvas interface and Blocknote \cite{blocknote_blocknote_2024} for the text editor features. 
Mommoth.js \cite{williamson_mwilliamson_2024} is used for importing Word documents, and slide rendering is based on a modified fork of spectacle.js \cite{formidablelabs_formidablelabs_2024}. 
For generating slides and adaptive UI, we use the official OpenAI API \cite{openai_openai_2024} to execute prompts using “gpt-4o” and the Bing search API \cite{microsoft_bing_2024} for image suggestions.
\rev{To suggest new tags, we prompt GPT to generate a list of \textit{[label:value]} pairs for each tag group to augment the existing set of active intent tags.
For outlines, GPT is instructed to generate a presentation outline in markdown format from a list of a user's active concept and reference tags (including images if present).
To generate slides, we then prompt GPT to return a template-based JSON slide deck representation by providing the outline, active intent tags, and deck references (if specified).}
For generating the drop-down values, slide previews, and slider explanations, the system asynchronously requests these from GPT in the background for each new or modified tag on the canvas.
