\section*{Impact Statement}
Similar to existing works on text-to-image generation, our method have the potential to be abused for generating malicious images that could be indistinguishable from real ones, raising concerns about harmful social impacts. This risk can be mitigated through advanced deep forgery detection as well as model watermark techniques. By improving these detection and watermarking methods, we can help ensure the responsible and ethical use of text-to-image generation.
