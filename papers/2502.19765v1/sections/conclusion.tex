\section{Conclusion}
We introduced EdiText, a diffusion-based text editing method that supports both coarse- and fine-grained modifications. We applied SDEdit-based coarse-level editing and suggested a fine-level editing method via self-conditioning-based techniques, offering edits at various scales. By integrating these techniques, EdiText achieves precise modifications within a broad range of control, effectively producing the intended results. We believe EdiText demonstrates the potential to offer users a range of options for selecting their desired editing levels.
