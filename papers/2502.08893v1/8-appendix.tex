\subsection{Clustering Results Using Simulated Drivers From Our Algorithms}
Figures~\ref{figure:cluster_2019} and~\ref{figure:cluster_2023} illustrate the differences in driver behavior patterns using t-SNE plots, which visually group drivers into clusters. Additionally, we show the distribution of simulated drivers across these clusters. For the week of 2019-08-05, Driver Group 0 accounts for the largest proportion, with over 40,000 simulated drivers. A similar pattern is observed in the week of 2023-08-07, where Driver Group 0 comprises approximately 30,000 simulated drivers.

Additional interesting finding is the emergence of Driver Groups 8, and 10 in the 2023 dataset. These groups represent the smallest number of simulated drivers compared to other clusters and exhibit distinct regional driving patterns that differ significantly from their counterparts in the 2019 data.

This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in identifying shifts in driver behavior over time, where the appearance of new driver clusters and their unique characteristics, cannot be captured using the original Chicago dataset, underscoring the value of simulation-based methods for reveal driver behavior's temporal and spatial shifts.

\subsection{Regional Trip Distribution Between 2019-2023}
In this section, we present a comparison of trip distributions across regions from 2019 to 2023. The Central, West Side, and North Side consistently emerge as hotspot areas, collectively accounting for approximately 60--65\% of total trips. Similarly, the least active regions, including the Far Southwest Side and Northwest Side of Chicago, show comparable patterns, contributing only about 2--3\% of total trips.

\subsection{Regional Trip Cost Between 2019-2023}
In this section, we compare trip costs across regions from 2019 to 2023. While trip distributions remain consistent across years, we observe significant shifts in trip price, aligning with our earlier analysis. These include: (1) an increase in trip costs beginning in 2021, and (2) a substantial pricing gap in the Far South Side areas (Far Southeast Side, Far Southwest Side) compared to top-earning regions like the Central area in the most recent years (2022 and 2023).
