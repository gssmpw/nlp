In this paper, we introduce DynamicGSG, a novel system designed to construct dynamic high-quality 3D Gaussian scene graphs. Utilizing fast differentiable rendering of 3D Gaussians, our system alleviates key problems in 3D scene graphs, such as the absence of mechanisms for dynamic environment adaptation and poor reconstruction quality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our system can perform dynamic updates in scene graphs according to real environment changes, effectively represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects, and accurately capture intricate geometric details of scenes. These capabilities enable our system to assist agents in performing long-term navigation and mobile manipulation within indoor environments.

% These capabilities position our system as a promising solution for supporting intelligent agents in indoor task involving long-term navigation and mobile manipulation, which constitutes the primary direction of our ongoing research. In this paper, we introduce DynamicGSG, 一个新颖的系统能够构建高质量，动态的 3D 高斯场景图。 我们的系统利用高斯的快速可微分渲染能力，缓解了 3D 场景图构建 中重建质量差，无法跟随环境进行更新的问题。在丰富的实验结果证明 DynamicGSG 能够适应环境变化，表征环境内  拥有发现环境变化并实时进行场景图更新的能力，能够明确表述物体之间的几何与语义关系，还能够准确表征场景的几何细节。 这些特性让我们的系统能够在未来助力智能体在室内执行长期导航或移动操作。
