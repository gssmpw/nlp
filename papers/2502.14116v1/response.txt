% This section presents essential background information on hardware Trojan attacks, along with strategies for countermeasuring such attacks.

% What's HT, detection, detection using ML 
A hardware Trojan (HT) is a malicious alteration or addition to a hardware design during its creation or assembly. These Trojans compromise the hardware by creating vulnerabilities or unintended functions, ranging from small circuits leaking data to system-disrupting modifications. Their stealth and dormancy make detection and mitigation difficult. 
% Detecting hardware Trojans involves identifying deviations from expected behavior or structural anomalies within hardware designs. Traditional hardware Trojan detection methods include functional testing, side-channel analysis, and golden model comparison. Functional testing identifies unintended behavior, side-channel analysis examines anomalies in physical parameters like power and timing, and golden model comparison validates designs against trusted references. These methods face challenges with scalability, data dependency, and detecting advanced Trojans in complex circuits, highlighting the need for more advanced, data-driven techniques.
% In recent years, machine learning (ML) has proven to be a potent method for detecting hardware Trojans. Using data-driven algorithms, ML models can identify patterns and abnormalities from training datasets, facilitating automated, scalable, and precise detection. Graph-based methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have gained particular attention because of their ability to model hardware structures as graphs, capturing complex interdependencies within circuits. These ML approaches offer significant advancements in Trojan detection by addressing limitations of scalability, adaptability, and golden-model dependency.
Detecting hardware Trojans (HTs) remains a crucial research focus, prompting the development of various frameworks and methods to tackle this issue. In this section, we examine significant progress made in the domain, particularly emphasizing machine learning and graph-based approaches, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. 

% Machine Learning-Based Detection Frameworks
% The authors in[1] present VIPR, a novel machine learning-based framework to verify the trust of third-party hardware IPs, eliminating the need for golden models. The framework employs pseudo-self-referencing training and post-processing algorithms to enhance hardware Trojan detection accuracy and reduce false positives. However, its dependency on synthetic Trojan insertion and feature selection limits its applicability to real-world designs with diverse Trojan structures. The authors in[2] propose a hybrid detection framework that uses XGBoost, combining static and dynamic analysis to improve the detection accuracy at the gate level. While effective, the framework's reliance on labeled datasets and its computational complexity hinder its scalability and generalization to diverse hardware designs.


Various frameworks that leverage machine learning have been developed to detect hardware Trojans, each offering its advantages and drawbacks. VIPR[3] improves detection accuracy without relying on golden models through pseudo-self-referencing and post-processing, yet it is limited by its dependence on synthetic Trojans and feature selection. A hybrid XGBoost framework[4] integrates static and dynamic analysis but faces issues with scalability and generalizability due to computational demands and dataset reliance. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively represent circuits as graphs, facilitating accurate detection. TrojanSAINT[5] breaks circuits into subgraphs to extract features, although it experiences challenges with reduced accuracy and scalability. GNN4Gate[6] facilitates automatic Trojan detection without the need for golden models; however, it necessitates the manual design of various features, which complicates its application to real-world scenarios. GNN4HT[7] expands detection to gate-level and RTL designs, but is hampered by high interclass similarity and limited generalization due to insufficient data set augmentation. FAST-GO[8] employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) enhanced with improved features and dynamic thresholds for scalable detection. R-HTDetector[9] boosts robustness through adversarial training. NHTD-GL[10] automates feature extraction to detect threats at the node level. These methods operate at the net level and encounter difficulties with imbalanced datasets and feature initialization, while also lacking the ability to localize Trojans. 

 % In [11], VIPR is introduced as a machine learning framework for verifying third-party hardware IPs without golden models, using pseudo-self-referencing and post-processing to improve Trojan detection, though limited by synthetic Trojan reliance and feature selection. Similarly, [12] presents a hybrid XGBoost-based framework for gate-level detection, combining static and dynamic analysis, but faces challenges in scalability and generalization due to dataset dependency and computational complexity.

% Authors in[13] present a machine-learning-based framework for trust verification of third-party hardware IPs, eliminating the need for golden models. It leverages pseudo-self-referencing training and post-processing algorithms to enhance hardware Trojan detection accuracy and reduce false positives. The framework's dependency on synthetic Trojan insertion and feature selection limits its applicability to real-world designs with diverse Trojan structures.

However, its reliance on labeled datasets and computational complexity limits its scalability and generalization to diverse hardware designs.

% Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Based Approaches
% Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for hardware Trojan detection, enabling the modeling of circuit structures as graphs for more accurate analysis. The TrojanSAINT framework employs GNNs in gate-level netlists[15]. It simplifies large circuits into smaller subgraphs using GraphSAINT[16] and extracts features such as gate types and input/output distances. TrojanSAINT achieves a high true positive rate, but misclassifies many normal nodes, reducing recognition accuracy. The authors in[17] propose GNN4Gate, a bidirectional GNN-based method that uses attention mechanisms to enhance the detection of hardware Trojans at the gate level. However, it requires significant computational resources and may not be suitable for large-scale designs. GNN4HT[18] expands detection to gate-level and RTL designs, but is hampered by high interclass similarity and limited generalization due to insufficient data set augmentation.

% In [19], a graph-convolutional network-based framework is presented for detecting hardware Trojans in gate-level netlists, combining high precision, scalability, and efficiency through optimized feature selection and dynamic thresholding. However, its dependence on imbalanced datasets and lack of output post-processing limit its adaptability to varied benchmarks and complex Trojan designs.
% The authors in[20] present "R-HTDetector," a resilient hardware Trojan detection framework that utilizes adversarial training to boost resistance to gate modification attacks. The approach generates adversarial examples in the training phase, which strengthens the model's robustness while ensuring high detection accuracy on various circuit benchmarks. Nonetheless, its dependence on particular adversarial training metrics and specific scenarios might restrict its flexibility when dealing with highly varied circuit architectures and novel attack vectors.
% The study detailed in[21] introduces "NHTD-GL," a graph-based learning framework designed for accurate node-level detection of hardware Trojans in gate-level netlists. This framework leverages sophisticated graph modeling and domain expertise to automate the extraction of both structural and functional features, providing a scalable and precise method for identifying malicious nodes without requiring extensive manual feature engineering. However, its reliance on precise initial feature representation and imbalanced datasets could restrict its scalability and resilience in diverse or real-world applications.

% \subsection{GNN: Graph Neural Network}

%Pravin
% Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) efficiently represent a graph's structural characteristics by enabling the exchange of information among its nodes. A directed graph \( G(V, E) \) consists of a set of nodes \( V \) and edges \( E \), where each node \( v \in V \) is associated with a feature vector \( f_v \). The initial embedding, also known as the feature vector, encapsulates the distinctive attributes of the node. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) function by collecting data from the local neighborhood \( N(v) \) of a node, so that each node acquires embeddings from its adjacent nodes through the connecting edges. The update function, which can be learned, merges the node's present embedding with the compiled embeddings of its neighbors to calculate a new embedding. Through this iterative process, nodes gather information about both their characteristics and those of neighboring nodes. At the level of graphs, representations are generally formed by combining, averaging, or using a max operation across all node embeddings.
