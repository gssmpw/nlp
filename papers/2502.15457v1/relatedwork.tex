\subsection{Temporal Understanding in Videos}
Understanding temporal ques in videos is challenging and MLLM-based methods draw great attention. A wide range of work~\citep{maaz-etal-2024-video, qian2025streaming,zhang2024mm,he2024ma} leverages the reasoning ability of MLLMs and presents great performance in understanding holistic videos.

\subsection{Memory as Contexts in LLMs} Implementing memories has been a big topic. Due to the emergent abilities of LLMs~\citep{Wei2022EmergentAO} to understand and leverage context, using contexts as memory has been one mainstream approach for NLP tasks\citep{fountas2024human} and also multimodal tasks\citep{fan2024videoagent,chen2024camml}.
