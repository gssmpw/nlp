\midrule
GPT-4o & The image shows a cashew nut on a textured black surface. There are no visible anomalies; the cashew appears normal. \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & Based on the image provided, there are no visible anomalies. The object appears to be a single, intact cashew nut with a smooth surface and a natural brown coloration that is typical for cashews. There are no signs of damage, such as cracks or holes, and the background does not show any irregularities that would suggest an anomaly in the context of the image.  \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, there is a noticeable anomaly on the cashew nut: \textcolor{customblue}{a small brown spot located near the center of the nut.} \\
