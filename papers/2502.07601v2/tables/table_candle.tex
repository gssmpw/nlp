User & Is there an anomaly in the image I should know about? \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & Yes, there is an anomaly in the image. \textcolor{customgreen}{The candle in the top left corner has its wick facing the opposite direction compared to the other three candles.} \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & Based on the image, there is no apparent anomaly among the candles. They are all similar in size and shape, with a consistent hole in the center for the wick. The coloration appears uniform across the candles, and there are no visible signs of melting or irregularities that would suggest an anomaly. \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, the anomaly is \textcolor{customblue}{the presence of a small red spot on the bottom right candle, which contrasts with the otherwise uniform white color.} \\
