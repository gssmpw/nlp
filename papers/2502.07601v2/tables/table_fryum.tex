User & Is there any anomaly in the image? \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & The image shows a wheel-shaped snack on a green surface. There doesn't appear to be any obvious anomaly. \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & The image shows a circular object with a pattern that resembles a wheel or a gear, placed on a green textured surface. There doesn't appear to be any obvious anomaly in the image; it seems to be a simple photograph of an object against a background. If there is something specific you are referring to as an anomaly, please provide more details or clarify what aspect you are questioning.  \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, there is an anomaly in the image. The pasta wheel has \textcolor{customblue}{a noticeable crack on its lower right side, disrupting its otherwise smooth and continuous surface.} \\
