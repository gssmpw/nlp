User & Is there an anomaly present in the image? \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & Yes, there is an anomaly in the image. \textcolor{customgreen}{One of the capsules is a different color; it is brown instead of green.} \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & Based on the image alone, there is no clear indication of an anomaly. The pills appear to be uniformly shaped and colored, with no visible defects or irregularities. However, without additional context or a point of reference for size, it's difficult to determine if there are any anomalies that might not be immediately apparent from the image.  \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, there is an anomaly present in the image. \textcolor{customblue}{One of the capsules has a darker spot on its surface, which contrasts with the otherwise uniform green color.} \\
