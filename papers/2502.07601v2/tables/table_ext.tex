User & What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? \\
\midrule
Anomaly-OV & Based on the chest X-ray, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is pneumonia. \textcolor{customblue}{The presence of bilateral patchy opacities in the lower lung fields is a common finding in pneumonia}, which is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs. \\
\midrule
User & What should the patient do next? \\
\midrule
Anomaly-OV & The patient should consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate treatment. This may include antibiotics to treat the infection, supportive care such as oxygen therapy, and monitoring of the patient's condition. \\
