\midrule
GPT-4o & The image shows an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. There don't appear to be any visible anomalies with the sensor itself. The components and pins seem intact and properly aligned. \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & The image shows an ultrasonic sensor module, specifically the HC-SR04 model. There are no visible anomalies in the image; it appears to be a standard representation of this type of sensor module. \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, there is a noticeable anomaly in the image: \textcolor{customblue}{a short circuit on the PCB, indicated by a white, crusty residue near the 'Echo' pin.} \\
