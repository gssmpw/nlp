User & Is there an anomaly in the image? \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & The image shows an infrared sensor module, which appears to be intact and properly assembled. There doesn't seem to be any visible anomaly or damage to the components. \\ \midrule
LLaVA-OV & The image shows an electronic circuit board with various components, including a red LED that is not illuminated. There doesn't appear to be anything obviously anomalous in the image. \\
\midrule
Ours & Yes, the anomaly in the image is \textcolor{customblue}{the bent LED on the circuit board, which is not aligned properly with the board's surface.} \\
