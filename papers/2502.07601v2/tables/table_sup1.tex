User & Do you observe any anomalies in the image? \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & Yes, there appears to be an anomaly in the image. One of the capsules, marked with a red box, has a noticeable defect. \textcolor{customblue}{It seems to have a bubble or an air pocket inside, which is not observed in the other capsules.} This could indicate a manufacturing defect or inconsistency in the capsule filling process. \\\midrule
 \multicolumn{2}{c}{If there is no bounding box, let's give a short hint to GPT-4o!} \\ \midrule
User & Do you observe any anomalies in the image? (hint: a bubble in the capsule) \\
\midrule
GPT-4o & The anomaly in the image is the presence of a visible air bubble inside one of the green gel capsules. \textcolor{customblue}{While most capsules appear uniformly filled with liquid, the capsule \textbf{located near the top center of the image} has a small, clear air pocket within it.} This could be a result of incomplete filling during the manufacturing process or an issue with the capsule sealing. \\
