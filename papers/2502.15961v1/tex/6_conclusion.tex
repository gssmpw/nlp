\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents a novel sampling-based IPP planner for autonomous robots that is both adaptive and incremental. Our planner is shown to be effective and computationally efficient, making it suitable for onboard deployment. We conduct a thorough evaluation of individual planner components, providing generalizable insights for other IPP frameworks. Extensive simulation testing against baseline methods highlights the plannerâ€™s advantages, and we further validate its effectiveness through demonstrations on two robotic platforms.


Future work includes extending this approach to multi-agent deployments in semi-urban environments for object search and search-and-rescue operations. Further improvements could involve batch sampling and parallel processing to enhance computational efficiency, automatic parameter and horizon selection based on information map characteristics, and integrating trajectory optimization for smoother paths. Additionally, expanding the framework to support planning with a gimballed camera would enable more flexible and targeted sensing capabilities.
