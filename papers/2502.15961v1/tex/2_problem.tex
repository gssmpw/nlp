\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:problem}


This work addresses the challenge of maximizing data gathered by a robot within the specified budget constraints of the system, a problem formally known as the IPP problem. 
Our problem formulation is defined as

\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{T}^*=\underset{\mathcal{T}\in \mathbb{T}}{\arg\max}~I(\mathcal{T}) \text{ s.t.\ $C(\mathcal{T}) \leq B$}.
    % \label{equ:1}
\end{equation*}

We let $\mathcal{T}$ represent the sensor trajectory within the set of feasible trajectories $\mathbb{T}$, and $C(\mathcal{T})$ be the cost function for a given trajectory. An example of potential costs would be trajectory length, energy usage, or time and would not exceed the budget constraint $B$. Lastly, $I(\mathcal{T})$ is the reward or information gain from a trajectory, and an optimal trajectory $\mathcal{T}^*$ is found that maximizes the information gain and does not exceed the budget $B$. 

% In this formulation, the information reward function $I(\cdot)$ is not constrained to being modular and could also be time-varying modular or even submodular \cite{krause}.
