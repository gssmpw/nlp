\begin{abstract}
%Informative path planning is an important and challenging problem in robotics that remains to be solved in a manner that allows for wide-spread implementation and real-world practical adoption. Among various reasons for this, one is the lack of approaches that allow for informative path planning in high-dimensional spaces and non-trivial sensor constraints. In this work we present a sampling-based approach that allows us to tackle the challenges of large and high-dimensional search spaces. This is done by performing informed sampling in the high-dimensional continuous space and incorporating potential information gain along edges in the reward estimation. This method rapidly generates a global path that maximizes information gain for the given path budget constraints. We discuss the details of our implementation for an example use case of searching for multiple objects of interest in a large search space using a fixed-wing UAV with a forward-facing camera. We compare our approach to a sampling-based planner baseline and demonstrate how our contributions allow our approach to consistently out-perform the baseline by 18.0\%. With this we thus present a practical and generalizable informative path planning framework that can be used for very large environments, limited budgets, and high dimensional search spaces, such as robots with motion constraints or high-dimensional configuration spaces.


% Context
Planning paths that maximize information gain for robotic platforms has wide-ranging applications and significant potential impact. 
% Need and gap
To effectively adapt to real-time data collection, informative path planning must be computed online and be responsive to new observations. 
% Task (what we did)
In this work, we present \PlannerName, an incremental and adaptive sampling-based informative path planner that can be run efficiently with onboard computation. Our approach leverages past planning efforts through incremental refinement while continuously adapting to updated world beliefs. We additionally present detailed implementation and optimization insights to facilitate real-world deployment, along with an array of reward functions tailored to specific missions and behaviors.
% Findings
Extensive simulation results demonstrate \PlannerNameSpaced generates higher-quality paths compared to baseline methods.
We validate our planner on two distinct hardware platforms: a hexarotor UAV and a fixed-wing UAV, each having unique motion models and configuration spaces.
% conclusion (what findings mean) and perspectives (future work)
Our results show up to a 41\% improvement in information gain compared to baseline methods, suggesting significant potential for deployment in real-world applications.

% Informative path planning for robotic platforms has broad applications, but requires efficient online computation to adapt to real-time observations. We present IA-TIGRIS, an incremental and adaptive sampling-based planner that efficiently operates with onboard computing resources. Our approach leverages past planning efforts through incremental refinement while continuously adapting to updated world beliefs. We develop mission-specific reward functions and provide detailed implementation insights to facilitate real-world deployment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate IA-TIGRIS generates higher-quality paths compared to baseline methods. We validate our planner on two distinct platforms - a hexarotor and fixed-wing UAV - with different motion constraints and configuration spaces.

% We rigorously test our method in simulation and quantify the benefits of its algorithm features and as well as overall planner performance. 
% an array of reward functions that can be chosen for different missions and behaviors. This works also includes key implementation details and modifications to our previous work that increases the efficiency and performance of the core planning loop. 

% Our work builds upon our previous IPP algorithm, TIGRIS, to make it more efficient, iterative, adaptive, and incorporate nuanced reward functions. \bradynote{Trim the background (move to intro), outline our method more. Look at my other good examples.}
