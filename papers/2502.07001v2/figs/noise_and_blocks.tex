    \textbf{Influence of Noise and Block Choice on Readout Performance} --
    Relative change in downstream task performance when probing different noise levels (left, fixed block $l=16$) and intermediate WALT blocks (right, fixed noise $t=200$). Values below -10\% are excluded for clarity.  Optimal performance is generally observed with noise between 0 and 200 and blocks 11-16.  Example noisy images (left) and PCA visualizations (right) are shown below the plots.
