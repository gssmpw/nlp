\textbf{Impact of pre-training progress on downstream task performance of \iwalt} -- Recognition tasks generally improve with longer training, while tasks like tracking and depth estimation show optimal performance at earlier stages.  Performance is evaluated across a range of tasks and compared to training loss and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).%
