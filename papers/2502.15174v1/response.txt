Although OctConv-based methods have been continuously improved and successfully applied to image compression with commendable results, there still remains potential for enhancement in SCC. Therefore, considering the characteristics of SC images, we propose a multi-frequency feature  decomposition network to achieve more refined feature extraction and processing, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:motivation}. The specific details will be elaborated in Section. IV.
