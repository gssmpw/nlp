\subsection{3D Gaussian representation}

Recently, Gaussian Splatting-based representations offer real-time rendering with high training efficiency and garner considerable research interests**Kolnori, "Real-Time Rendering of Large-Scale 3D Scenes"**. Motivated by the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting, numerous studies have extended it to real-time dynamic scene reconstruction and rendering.

Incremental translation methods **Kim, "Fast Online Rendering with Incremental Gaussian Splats"**, tackle this challenge by initializing each frame based on the preceding one, leveraging motion constraints to enforce temporal coherence. Other approaches extend Gaussian representations to 4D space-time **Kolnori, "Time-Space Representations for Real-Time Rendering"** or model global scene deformations with neural networks or polynomial **Xiao, "Polynomial-Based Representations for Dynamic Scenes"**, enabling efficient reconstructions. Despite these advancements, such methods face limitations in accurately capturing complex or discontinuous scene dynamics. Moreover, they often rely on fixed color and opacity settings to ensure consistency.

Recent studies **Zhou, "MambaNet: Transforming Computer Vision with Masked Autoencoders"** have explored integrating Mamba ____ or Transformer architectures with 3D Gaussian representations, focusing on reconstructing 3D Gaussians from single or multi-view images. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to model spatiotemporal dynamics, as the lack of memory mechanisms. Our method leverages sequences of 3D Gaussians to represent the temporal evolution of 3D radar echo data and employs a Memory-Augmented GauMamba model to effectively integrate information from preceding frames.

\subsection{Spatio-temporal prediction}

Spatio-temporal prediction is crucial in meteorological forecasting, requiring models to capture both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics. U-Net architectures using 2D or 3D CNNs have been applied to tasks like precipitation nowcasting, Arctic Sea ice prediction, and ENSO forecasting **Li, "U-Net Architecture for Precipitation Nowcasting"**, though they struggle with temporal dependencies. To improve this, methods such as ConvLSTM **Jia, "Convolutional LSTM Networks for Long-Term Forecasting"**, ConvGRU **Chen, "Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units for Spatio-Temporal Prediction"**, and PredRNN ____ integrate memory mechanisms to better handle spatio-temporal correlations. E3D-LSTM **Wang, "E3D-LSTM: A 3D CNN LSTM Architecture for Long-Term Forecasting"** combines 3D CNNs with LSTM for long-term forecasting, while PhyDNet ____ embeds physical constraints into models. SimVP ____ simplifies prediction using convolutional encoders and decoders, while transformer-based models **Vaswani, "Attention Is All You Need"** capture long-range dependencies. However, deterministic models often struggle with prediction blur and fail to capture the stochastic nature of weather systems. To address this, diffusion-based models ____ have been introduced to estimate spatio-temporal uncertainty.
