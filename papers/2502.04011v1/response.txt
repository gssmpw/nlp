Debiasing refers to the process of identifying and mitigating cognitive biases that may affect decision-making.

Possible types of debiasing treatments can be described using the levels proposed by Fischhoff ____ (1) A- and B-level treatments consist of informing practitioners about cognitive biases (A) and how they may impact practitioners (B). Levels C and D require more organizational resources: a C-level treatment requires giving personalized feedback to each debiased person, and the D-level requires extensive long-term training.

Debiasing has been a topic of interest in many research domains, e.g., economics ____ (2) . In the field of software engineering, two notable C-level debiasing treatments were reportedly successful. Firstly,  rationalizing development time estimates by Shepperd et al. ____ (3), where researchers purposefully anchored software developers on pessimistic estimates to counter over-optimistic predictions.     
    Secondly, in ADM, in their short paper, Borowa et al. ____ (4) reported achieving a debiasing effect on a group of student participants. However, their experiment had several weaknesses that our study avoids:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The experiment employed the pretest-posttest design, which is known for numerous threats to validity____. For example, the debiasing effect may have not resulted from the workshop but from the student participants' learning while performing the pretest task.
        \item The participants were all students\color{black}, making it unclear whether the results would be the same for \color{black} experienced practitioners.
        \item The participants performed different tasks before and after the workshop, so comparing these may not have been reliable. 
        \color{black}
        For example, if designing one architecture was more difficult than the other, participants' bias occurrence count could be increased by this added difficulty. 
        \color{black}
        \item The participants performed purely theoretical tasks by designing architectures for domains that they may not have had any prior knowledge about. This may have caused mistakes due to their lack of domain knowledge.
        % \item The experiment was three hours long with no breaks. As such, the participants may have been impacted by fatigue during the posttest task.
        \color{black}
        \item The debiasing effect was achieved by improving the amount of non-biased arguments, \textbf{but, despite the authors' efforts, the bias occurrence was not reduced}. We measured the bias occurrences using a similar method to Borowa et al. ____ (4) and did achieve a bias reduction.
