\section*{Data availability}\label{sec5-1}
This study involved public and private cytology datasets for system development. The public datasets comprising HErlev (\url{https://mde-lab.aegean.gr/index.php/downloads/}) and SIPaKMeD (\url{https://www.cs.uoi.gr/~marina/sipakmed.html}) are utilized for downstream task evaluation.
The details of private CCS-127K dataset are shown in Fig. \ref{F2_data}(a) and Extended Data Table. \ref{ST_patches}. 

\section*{Code availability}\label{sec5-1}
Source code for model development and the implementation details
will be publicly available upon
paper acceptance.
