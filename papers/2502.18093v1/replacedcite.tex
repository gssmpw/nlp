Tournament selection is a commonly used selection method, where $n$ randomly chosen individuals compete in a tournament and the best individual is selected as a parent for the next generation ____. One disadvantage of tournament selection is that the quality of individuals is measured in terms of an aggregated value, leading to a loss of information about the data structure____. In contrast, lexicase selection____ evaluates individuals on each training case separately. This is beneficial during search, as individuals that solve certain training cases particularly well are preserved____. Additionally, it has been found that lexicase selection is able to maintain a high population diversity in comparison to tournament selection____. Lexicase selection has been successfully applied in many problem domains____. 

For symbolic regression problems with continuous-valued errors, $\epsilon$-lexicase selection____ significantly improved the solution quality compared to tournament selection and standard lexicase selection. $\epsilon$-lexicase selection also considers individuals for selection that are near-elite on training cases by applying an $\epsilon$-threshold to standard lexicase selection.

Recently, the combination of lexicase selection with down-sampling improved the solution quality even more in the domain of program synthesis____ and symbolic regression____. A na\"ive down-sampling strategy is random down-sampling____, where only a random subset of training cases is used in each generation to evaluate the quality of the individuals.
It has been found that random down-sampling in combination with tournament selection improves performance, reduces overfitting and controls bloat in the domain of symbolic regression____. However, reduced overfitting was not (or only insignificantly) observed when combining random down-sampling with lexicase selection for program synthesis problems____.

One drawback of random down-sampling is that the random selection of a subset of training cases may lead to the exclusion of important training cases for several generations. Therefore, Boldi et al.____ proposed informed down-sampling, which creates more diverse subsets of training cases by using population statistics. Due to the success of informed down-sampling in program synthesis____ and symbolic regression____ its influence has been further analyzed for program synthesis problems____.

Both random and informed down-sampling have been found to improve performance not only for lexicase selection but also (among others) for tournament selection ____.
Therefore, it is unclear if we need lexicase selection or if tournament selection combined with down-sampling is sufficient considering that tournament selection is significantly faster than lexicase selection.
