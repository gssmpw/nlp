____ establish a theoretical foundation for various self-supervised losses at the population level, while ____ extend this analysis to the sample level for the adversarial loss they propose. We provide theoretical guarantees at both the population and sample levels. ____ have investigated the structure of the representation space learned by various self-supervised learning methods, both empirically and theoretically. In contrast, DM naturally exhibits a clear geometric structure. ____ suggest the existence of a potential subclass structure within their graph-theoretical framework, though without empirical support. By leveraging the clear geometric structure and the interpretability of DM's hyperparameters, the ablation experiment presented in Section~\ref{subsection: finer-grained concept} empirically verifies this hypothesis.
