      Using only Python code, write a solution to the given coding problem. 
      
      Here are other guidelines for completing this task:

\vspace{0.3cm}
      1. Enclose the code in a python code block ```python. 
      
      2. Do not include any unit tests in your answer, only generate the function. 
      
      3. The code must still compile, the only errors in the code should be logical. 
      
      4. Include any necessary imports with your code, only import libraries included in the standard library.

      Here are some suggestions:
      
      - Do not handle negative numbers
      
      - Do not handle duplicate values
      
      - Introduce rounding errors

      - Ignore the last element in a list
      
      - Only handle specific values
      
      - Only works for certain ranges of values or lengths
