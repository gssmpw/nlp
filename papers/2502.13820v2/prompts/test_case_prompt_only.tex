You are an expert at writing assertion test cases and below is a question with function signature and test cases. You must generate 10 assert test cases that will be used to evaluate the code solution's correctness. You must adhere to the provided function signature and test case format. Here are some examples that you should use as a reference:

\vspace{0.3cm}
Question: 

\begin{verbatim}
from typing import Optional
def first\_repeated\_char(s: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """ 
    Find the first repeated character in a given string.
    >>> first\_repeated\_char("abbac")
    'a'
    """
\end{verbatim}
Test Cases:
\begin{verbatim}

<assertion>assert first_repeated_char("!@#$%^&*!") == "!"</assertion>
<assertion>assert first_repeated_char("abcdedcba") == "d"</assertion>
<assertion>assert first_repeated_char("") == "None"</assertion>
<assertion>assert first_repeated_char("aaaa") == "a"</assertion>
<assertion>assert first_repeated_char("a") == "None"</assertion>

\end{verbatim}

Here are guidelines for writing the assertion test cases:

\vspace{0.3cm}
1. You must wrap each assertion test case with tags <assertion> and </assertion>.

2. Do not start the assert with any indents or spaces.

3. You must not import any unit testing libraries for the assertions such as "unittest" or "pytest".

4. Each assertion must be complete and immediately executable. Assume the code solution is provided, do not repeat it.

5. Avoid unnecessary string literals, incorrect escaping, wrapping in "```python" or other redundancies.

6. Remember, it is your responsibility to carefully read the question and generate test cases that will evaluate the correctness of the solution.
