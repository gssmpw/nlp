\textbf{Risk Management Framework} 
& Four risk levels (minimal risk, limited risk, high risk, and unacceptable risk)
& Non-binding guidance
& A classification and grading approach is adopted, emphasizing inclusive and prudent regulation. \\ \hline

\textbf{Transparency Requirements} 
& \begin{itemize}
    \item AI-generated content must be clearly labeled.
    \item Record model training data sources and decision processes for external audits.
    \item Mandate explainability modules to help users understand AI decision logic.
\end{itemize}
& \begin{itemize}
    \item Encourage companies to voluntarily use watermarks or labels in generated content.
    \item Promote the development of transparency standards, such as industry collaboration on transparency APIs.
\end{itemize}
& \begin{itemize}
    \item Establish legal obligations for identifying generative AI content.
    \item Require generative AI platforms to regularly disclose algorithm models, training data, and technical documentation.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline

\textbf{Technology Neutrality Principle} 
& Less emphasis on technological neutrality, favoring a risk-oriented approach
& Emphasizes technological neutrality to safeguard innovation freedom.
& Combines technological neutrality with a risk-oriented approach. \\ \hline

\textbf{Degree of Industry Participation} 
& \begin{itemize}
    \item Prefers mandatory legal regulations to ensure industry participation.
    \item Establishes a unified regulatory framework to ensure compliance by both multinational corporations and SMEs.
\end{itemize}
& \begin{itemize}
    \item Encourages industry-led initiatives with voluntary participation in regulation.
\end{itemize}
& \begin{itemize}
    \item Industry participation is guided primarily by policy, with the government fostering collaboration across the industrial chain.
    \item Require generative AI platforms to regularly disclose algorithm models, training data, and technical documentation.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline
