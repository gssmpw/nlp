\label{sec:concl}
The rapid rise of AI-generated media challenges information authenticity and societal trust, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This survey examines the evolution of AI-generated media detection, focusing on the shift from Non-MLLM-based domain-specific detectors to MLLM-based general-purpose approaches. We compare these methods across authenticity, explainability, and localization tasks from both single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. Additionally, we review datasets, methodologies, and evaluation metrics, identifying key limitations and research challenges.
Beyond technical concerns, MLLM-based detection raises ethical and security issues. As GenAI sees broader deployment, regulatory frameworks vary significantly across jurisdictions, complicating governance. By summarizing these regulations, we provide insights for researchers navigating legal and ethical challenges.
While many challenges remain, We hope this survey sparks further discussion, informs future research, and contributes to a more secure and trustworthy AI ecosystem.
