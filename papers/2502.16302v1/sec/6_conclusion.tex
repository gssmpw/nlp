\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose DualNeRF, a novel text-driven 3D scene editing framework to perform local edits while preventing unwanted modification in irrelevant areas. Technically, we propose a dual-field architecture to provide additional guidance signal to the model during IDU, resulting in high-quality edits with restored backgrounds. Moreover, a simulated annealing strategy is introduced into the pipeline of IDU, helping the model address the local optima issue. A CLIP-based consistency indicator is also proposed to measure the edit consistency and filter out low-quality edits. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms previous works and displays strong power in 3D scene editing. We hope that DualNeRF can provide inspiration for subsequent work and pave the path to democratizing 3D content editing.
