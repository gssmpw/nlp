  abstract = {We propose a generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks that accounts for heterogeneity in both node and edge type. To inform the model design, we analyse the properties of power grid graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection and Poland transmission system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks including low local clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure, consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: the first phase, adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We test the model's performance by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph visualization comparisons, a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency, and guidelines for artificially generating the model inputs in the absence of real data.}

However, GCNs lack the ability to take into account the ordering of node neighbors, even when there is a geometric interpretation of the graph vertices that provides an order based on their spatial positions. To remedy this issue, we propose Spatial Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) which uses spatial features to efficiently learn from graphs that can be naturally located in space. Our contribution is threefold: we propose a GCN-inspired architecture which (i) leverages node positions, (ii) is a proper generalization of both GCNs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), (iii) benefits from augmentation which further improves the performance and assures invariance with respect to the desired properties. Empirically, SGCN outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based methods on image classification and chemical tasks.},

  abstract = {Complex networks pervade various real-world systems, from the natural environment to human societies. The essence of these networks is in their ability to transition and evolve from microscopic disorder-where network topology and node dynamics intertwine-to a macroscopic order characterized by certain collective behaviors. Over the past two decades, complex network science has significantly enhanced our understanding of the statistical mechanics, structures, and dynamics underlying real-world networks. Despite these advancements, there remain considerable challenges in exploring more realistic systems and enhancing practical applications. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, coupled with the abundance of diverse real-world network data, has heralded a new era in complex network science research. This survey aims to systematically address the potential advantages of AI in overcoming the lingering challenges of complex network research. It endeavors to summarize the pivotal research problems and provide an exhaustive review of the corresponding methodologies and applications. Through this comprehensive survey-the first of its kind on AI for complex networks-we expect to provide valuable insights that will drive further research and advancement in this interdisciplinary field.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a network-of-networks analysis framework of interdependent critical infrastructure systems, with a focus on the co-located road-sewer network. The constructed interdependency considers two types of node dynamics: co-located and multiple-to-one dependency, with different robustness metrics based on their function logic. The objectives of this paper are twofold: (1) to characterize the impact of the interdependency on networks' robustness performance, and (2) to unveil the critical percolation transition threshold of the interdependent road-sewer network. The results show that (1) road and sewer networks are mutually interdependent and are vulnerable to the cascading failures initiated by sewer system disruption; (2) the network robustness decreases as the number of initial failure sources increases in the localized failure scenarios, but the rate declines as the number of failures increase; and (3) the sewer network contains two types of links: zero exposure and severe exposure to liquefaction, and therefore, it leads to a two-phase percolation transition subject to the probabilistic liquefaction-induced failures. This indicates that tiered vulnerability of the liquefaction-prone links will result in multiple percolation transitions. The proposed framework provides a holistic approach to analyze the network robustness under different failure scenarios and can be extended to a larger interdependent system.},

However, the detailed information needed to define these models may not be available, especially for small-scale infrastructure that connect to every building. In this paper, we generate location-specific small-scale networks using detailed data that should always be available. We propose a general framework where we generate the network topology, we estimate the resource demand at each building, and we design the network components to meet the demands. This general framework is applicable to all types of infrastructure, but many procedures are specific to the type of network being generated. This paper develops the necessary procedures to generate sewer networks and illustrates the usage for an example network in a small study area in Seaside, Oregon. The proposed sewer network generator produces realistic sewer networks as compared to the real network of Seaside.},

To study such systems, a novel multi-layer spatially embedded random network model is proposed. In the development of this model, concepts from spatial statistics and graph theory are used to map complex systems with interdependent subsystems to a simplified and condensed mathematical representation. The developed model combines Markov marked point processes for vertex creation, which accounts for spatial distribution, layer assignment, and clustering effects of the vertices, and a hybrid connection model for the edge creation. To test the capabilities of, and gain insights with respect to, a real-world network, the model was used to model a complex infrastructure system, comprised of the power grid and road network of Switzerland. It was found that, even with very simple assumptions, topological properties could be estimated reasonably well.},

However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings.  Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing. The data in these tasks are typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high-dimensional features and interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several classical paradigms of GNN structures, e. g., graph convolutional networks, are summarized. Key applications in power systems such as fault scenario application, time-series prediction, power flow calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Further-more, main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in power systems are discussed.}

In experiments with real-world sensor data, DME shows remarkable ability for missing data imputation and new modality prediction. Compared with traditional algorithms such as kNN and Sparse-PCA, DME is more expressive, robust, and scalable to large datasets.},
