  abstract = {Colonization of terrestrial environments by filamentous fungi relies on their ability to form networks that can forage for and connect resource patches. Despite the importance of these networks, ecologists rarely consider network features as functional traits because their measurement and interpretation are conceptually and methodologically difficult. To address these challenges, we have developed a pipeline to translate images of fungal mycelia, from both micro- and macro-scales, to weighted network graphs that capture ecologically relevant fungal behaviour. We focus on four properties that we hypothesize determine how fungi forage for resources, specifically: connectivity; relative construction cost; transport efficiency; and robustness against attack by fungivores. Constrained ordination and Pareto front analysis of these traits revealed that foraging strategies can be distinguished predominantly along a gradient of connectivity for micro- and macro-scale mycelial networks that is reminiscent of the qualitative `phalanx' and `guerilla' descriptors previously proposed in the literature. At one extreme are species with many inter-connections that increase the paths for multidirectional transport and robustness to damage, but with a high construction cost; at the other extreme are species with an opposite phenotype. Thus, we propose this approach represents a significant advance in quantifying ecological strategies for fungi using network information.},

Many previous studies have applied data mining as a method for detecting anomaly in an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we further apply data mining to classifying those anomaly data. This is based on the facts that there are many data which are not ready for use by a classification algorithm. In addition, that algorithm may use all features which actually are not relevant to the classification target. According to these two problems, we define two steps: pre-processing and feature selection, whose results are classified by using k-NN, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The experimental results show that such pre-processing and combination of CFS and PSO are better to apply to SVM which is able to achieve about 99.9291\% of accuracy on KDD Cup99 dataset.}

However, the dearth of information on WDNs due to weak historical records, limited willingness to share data, and security concerns limit a researcher's understanding of the criticality, adaptability, vulnerability, and interdependencies of WDNs. To address this challenge, we develop a model entitled SyNF (Synthetic Infrastructure) for synthetic WDN generation. SyNF uses a roadway network, water demand, and water source locations to synthesize topology, diameter, and service year of pipes, and location and power requirements of pumps. To show SyNF's capabilities, we start with the City of Tempe and scale the model to Phoenix metro's seven major cities. We find a 6\% average dissimilarity on pipe size distribution between the original and synthesized WDN in validating SyNF. We also discuss how SyNF can advance our understanding of the criticality, vulnerability, and resilience of WDNs.},

  abstract = {We propose a generative graph model for electrical infrastructure networks that accounts for heterogeneity in both node and edge type. To inform the model design, we analyse the properties of power grid graphs derived from the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, Texas Interconnection and Poland transmission system power grids. Across these datasets, we find subgraphs induced by nodes of the same voltage level exhibit shared structural properties atypical to small-world networks including low local clustering, large diameter and large average distance. On the other hand, we find subgraphs induced by transformer edges linking nodes of different voltage types contain a more limited structure, consisting mainly of small, disjoint star graphs. The goal of our proposed model is to match both these inter and intra-network properties by proceeding in two phases: the first phase, adapts the Chung-Lu random graph model, taking desired vertex degrees and desired diameter as inputs, while the second phase of the model is based on a simpler random star graph generation process. We test the model's performance by comparing its output across many runs to the aforementioned real data. In nearly all categories tested, we find our model is more accurate in reproducing the unusual mixture of properties apparent in the data than the Chung-Lu model. We also include graph visualization comparisons, a brief analysis of edge-deletion resiliency, and guidelines for artificially generating the model inputs in the absence of real data.}

DEL algorithm determines the size of ensemble, the number of individual NNs employing a constructive strategy, the number of hidden nodes of individual NNs employing a constructive--pruning strategy, and different training samples for individual NN's learning. For diversity, negative correlation learning has been introduced and also variation of training samples has been made for individual NNs that provide better learning from the whole training samples. The major benefits of the proposed DEL compared to existing ensemble algorithms are (1) automatic design of ensemble; (2) maintaining accuracy and diversity of NNs at the same time; and (3) minimum number of parameters to be defined by user. DEL algorithm is applied to a set of real-world classification problems such as the cancer, diabetes, heart disease, thyroid, credit card, glass, gene, horse, letter recognition, mushroom, and soybean datasets. It has been confirmed by experimental results that DEL produces dynamic NN ensembles of appropriate architecture and diversity that demonstrate good generalization ability.},

Measuring the complicated spatial--temporal dependencies with external factors, such as weather conditions and surrounding point-of-interest (POI) distribution is the most difficult aspect of predicting crowd flows movement. To overcome the above issue, this paper advises a unified dynamic deep spatio-temporal neural network model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory, termed as (DHSTNet) to simultaneously predict crowd flows in every region of a city. The DHSTNet model is made up of four separate components: a recent, daily, weekly, and an external branch component. Our proposed approach simultaneously assigns various weights to different branches and integrates the four properties' outputs to generate final predictions. Moreover, to verify the generalization and scalability of the proposed model, we apply a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with the previously published model, termed as GCN-DHSTNet; to capture the spatial patterns and short-term temporal features; and to illustrate its exceptional accomplishment in predicting the traffic crowd flows. The GCN-DHSTNet model not only depicts the spatio-temporal dependencies but also reveals the influence of different time granularity, which are recent, daily, weekly periodicity and external properties, respectively. Finally, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatio-temporal features and external properties together. Using two different real-world traffic datasets, our evaluation suggests that the proposed GCN-DHSTNet method is approximately 7.9\%--27.2\% and 11.2\%--11.9\% better than the AAtt-DHSTNet method in terms of RMSE and MAPE metrics, respectively. Furthermore, AAtt-DHSTNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Critical infrastructure networks such as transportation, telecommunications, electric power, natural gas and oil, and water distribution rely on one another for their proper functionality. Hence, they are increasingly interdependent, making them highly vulnerable, where the occurrence of even a small disruption in one infrastructure network could propagate to affect other dependent infrastructure networks leading to a more significant adverse impact on society. Therefore, a key aspect of preparedness planning in infrastructure networks is identifying the critical network components that influence not only (i) the performance of their networks the most when disrupted and restored but also (ii) the performance of other networks due to their interdependent nature. This work offers a means to study the importance of interdependent network components with a resilience-focused performance measure in mind. We propose two component importance measures, (i) the first of which quantifies the effect of disrupted components on the resilience of the interdependent infrastructure networks once they are recovered, while (ii) the second measures the potential impact on the resilience of the interdependent infrastructure networks caused by a specific disrupted network element. The proposed measures are illustrated through generated interdependent power-water networks and compared with two other common network centrality measures. The use of such measures could identify components that are candidates for the allocation of resources to reduce their vulnerability or to expedite their recovery.},

Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dissemination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social signals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}

Furthermore, we optimize our model's performance by utilizing the widely recognized `ADAM' optimizer. The proposed model contributes significantly to the field of network analysis across diverse domains, addressing link prediction challenges through a data-driven approach.

With the advances of deep learning, current link prediction methods commonly compute features from subgraphs centered at two neighboring nodes and use the features to predict the label of the link between these two nodes. In this formalism, a link prediction problem is converted to a graph classification task. In order to extract fixed-size features for classification, graph pooling layers are necessary in the deep learning model, thereby incurring information loss. To overcome this key limitation, we propose to seek a radically different and novel path by making use of the line graphs in graph theory. In particular, each node in a line graph corresponds to a unique edge in the original graph. Therefore, link prediction problems in the original graph can be equivalently solved as a node classification problem in its corresponding line graph, instead of a graph classification task. Experimental results on fourteen datasets from different applications demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, while it has fewer parameters and high training efficiency.},

Here, we propose a novel framework for urban functional region discovery based on residents' travel patterns. The framework uses GPS trajectory data and check-in data to construct a travel pattern graph with temporal and spatial attributes and learns the vector representations of urban regions using the Node2vec method to identify urban functional regions. In addition, a novel detection method that combines semantic information of check-in data and well-known points of interest (POIs) was constructed to annotate the semantics of the functional regions. Real location data sets were used for verification. The experimental results showed that the proposed graph embedding learning method could effectively discover urban functional regions. Moreover, this method solved the problem of accurately identifying the semantics of functional regions to a certain extent.},

A new mapping method is put forward to create maps using manhole cover locations which could be available via ground surveys, remote sensing techniques or stakeholder's databases. A new algorithm is developed which considers manhole covers as the nodes of the network and connects them automatically by minimizing cost functions defined by industry rules thus generating an optimized network. The various input data and rules used to build the deterministic tree-shaped graph being uncertain, a stochastic version of the algorithm is also proposed to generate a set of probable networks in addition to the optimized one. The method is tested on the wastewater networks of Prades-le-Lez and Ramnonville Saint Agne, two towns located in Southern France. The shape and topology of the mapped networks are compared to the actual one. The results indicate an overall good agreement between the real and generated networks. The proposed algorithm may thus be used to map wastewater networks from sampled georeferenced manhole covers, elevation and street network databases.},

  abstract = {Color has an important role in object recognition and visual working memory (VWM). Decoding color VWM in the human brain is helpful to understand the mechanism of visual cognitive process and evaluate memory ability. Recently, several studies showed that color could be decoded from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during the encoding stage of VWM, which process visible information with strong neural coding. Whether color could be decoded from other VWM processing stages, especially the maintaining stage which processes invisible information, is still unknown. Here, we constructed an EEG color graph convolutional network model (ECo-GCN) to decode colors during different VWM stages. Based on graph convolutional networks, ECo-GCN considers the graph structure of EEG signals and may be more efficient in color decoding. We found that (1) decoding accuracies for colors during the encoding, early, and late maintaining stages were 81.58\%, 79.36\%, and 77.06\%, respectively, exceeding those during the pre-stimuli stage (67.34\%), and (2) the decoding accuracy during maintaining stage could predict participants' memory performance. The results suggest that EEG signals during the maintaining stage may be more sensitive than behavioral measurement to predict the VWM performance of human, and ECo-GCN provides an effective approach to explore human cognitive function.},

  abstract = {A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) network can be defined as a set of connected vehicles including CAVs that operate on a specific spatial scope that may be a road network, corridor, or segment. The spatial scope constitutes an environment where traffic information is shared and instructions are issued for controlling the CAVs movements. Within such a spatial scope, high-level cooperation among CAVs fostered by joint planning and control of their movements can greatly enhance the safety and mobility performance of their operations. Unfortunately, the highly combinatory and volatile nature of CAV networks due to the dynamic number of agents (vehicles) and the fast-growing joint action space associated with multi-agent driving tasks pose difficultly in achieving cooperative control. The problem is NP-hard and cannot be efficiently resolved using rule-based control techniques. Also, there is a great deal of information in the literature regarding sensing technologies and control logic in CAV operations but relatively little information on the integration of information from collaborative sensing and connectivity sources. Therefore, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that combines graphic convolution neural network with deep Q-network to form an innovative graphic convolution Q network that serves as the information fusion module and decision processor. In this study, the spatial scope we consider for the CAV network is a multi-lane road corridor. We demonstrate the proposed control algorithm using the application context of freeway lane-changing at the approaches to an exit ramp. For purposes of comparison, the proposed model is evaluated vis-{\`a}-vis traditional rule-based and long short-term memory-based fusion models. The results suggest that the proposed model is capable of aggregating information received from sensing and connectivity sources and prescribing efficient operative lane-change decisions for multiple CAVs, in a manner that enhances safety and mobility. That way, the operational intentions of individual CAVs can be fulfilled even in partially observed and highly dynamic mixed traffic streams. The paper presents experimental evidence to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance CAV operations. The proposed algorithm can be deployed at roadside units or cloud platforms or other centralized control facilities.},

However, GCNs lack the ability to take into account the ordering of node neighbors, even when there is a geometric interpretation of the graph vertices that provides an order based on their spatial positions. To remedy this issue, we propose Spatial Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) which uses spatial features to efficiently learn from graphs that can be naturally located in space. Our contribution is threefold: we propose a GCN-inspired architecture which (i) leverages node positions, (ii) is a proper generalization of both GCNs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), (iii) benefits from augmentation which further improves the performance and assures invariance with respect to the desired properties. Empirically, SGCN outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based methods on image classification and chemical tasks.},

The methodology is tested on the street network in Milton, north Glasgow, but presented such that it could be applied more widely.  Method:  Elevation data is added to existing and proposed street networks in Milton which enables a calculation of average walking speed per segment to be made taking into account steepness. The networks are then run through ArcGIS's Network Analysis extension, using time (adjusted for uphill and downhill slope) as impedance.  Results: `Real' walkable 10-minute roundtrip catchments around neighbourhood centres are compared with 2D catchments, for existing and proposed street networks. As expected, the `real' `ped-shed' is smaller than the 2D `ped-shed' for both networks, although the walkability of the more connected, proposed street network is less affected by steepness, most likely as a result of greater choice in route selection.  Discussion: This research builds on existing established practice in walkability analysis, incorporating the often-overlooked steepness variable as a key statistical element of the walking experience. It also prompts a discussion on other factors which may affect walkability and could be included in a more sophisticated walkability index.},

These can be described as a multilayer network where each layer represents one type of interaction. These layers may be interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers together to compress redundant information and identify small groups of layers which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and the other representing shared genetic substring material between genes of the malaria parasite.}

Motivated by wireless ad hoc networks ``soft'' or ``probabilistic'' connection models have recently been introduced, involving a ``connection function'' H(r) that gives the probability that two nodes at distance r are linked (directly connect). In many applications (not only wireless networks), it is desirable that the graph is connected; that is, every node is linked to every other node in a multihop fashion. Here the connection probability of a dense network in a convex domain in two or three dimensions is expressed in terms of contributions from boundary components for a very general class of connection functions. It turns out that only a few quantities such as moments of the connection function appear. Good agreement is found with special cases from previous studies and with numerical simulations.}

The constructed interdependency considers two types of node dynamics: co-located and multiple-to-one dependency, with different robustness metrics based on their function logic. The objectives of this paper are twofold: (1) to characterize the impact of the interdependency on networks' robustness performance, and (2) to unveil the critical percolation transition threshold of the interdependent road-sewer network. The results show that (1) road and sewer networks are mutually interdependent and are vulnerable to the cascading failures initiated by sewer system disruption; (2) the network robustness decreases as the number of initial failure sources increases in the localized failure scenarios, but the rate declines as the number of failures increase; and (3) the sewer network contains two types of links: zero exposure and severe exposure to liquefaction, and therefore, it leads to a two-phase percolation transition subject to the probabilistic liquefaction-induced failures. This indicates that tiered vulnerability of the liquefaction-prone links will result in multiple percolation transitions. The proposed framework provides a holistic approach to analyze the network robustness under different failure scenarios and can be extended to a larger interdependent system.},

Learning on multimodal datasets is challenging because the inductive biases can vary by data modality and graphs might not be explicitly given in the input. To address these challenges, graph artificial intelligence methods combine different modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies through geometric relationships. Diverse datasets are combined using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal architectures, specified as image-intensive, knowledge-grounded and language-intensive models. Using this categorization, we introduce a blueprint for multimodal graph learning, use it to study existing methods and provide guidelines to design new models.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure service disruptions impact households in an affected community disproportionally. To enable integrating social equity considerations in infrastructure resilience assessments, this study created a new computational multi-agent simulation model, which enables integrated assessment of hazard, infrastructure system, and household elements and their interactions. With a focus on hurricane-induced power outages, the model consists of three elements: (1) the hazard component simulates exposure of the community to a hurricane with varying intensity levels; (2) the physical infrastructure component simulates the power network and its probabilistic failures and restoration under different hazard scenarios; and (3) the households component captures the dynamic processes related to preparation, information-seeking, and response actions of households facing hurricane-induced power outages. We used empirical data from household surveys from three hurricanes (Harvey, Florence, and Michael) in conjunction with theoretical decision-making models to abstract and simulate the underlying mechanisms affecting the experienced hardship of households when facing power outages. The multi-agent simulation model was then tested in the context of Harris County, Texas, and verified and validated using empirical results from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Then, the model was used to examine the effects of different factors---such as forewarning durations, social network types, and restoration and resource allocation strategies---on reducing the societal impacts of service disruptions in an equitable manner. The results show that improving the restoration prioritization strategy to focus on vulnerable populations is an effective approach, especially during high-intensity events, to enhance equitable resilience. The results show the capability of the proposed computational model for capturing the dynamic and complex interactions in the nexus of households, hazards, and infrastructure systems to better integrate human-centric aspects in resilience planning and assessment of infrastructure systems in disasters. Hence, the proposed model and its results could provide a new tool for infrastructure managers and operators, as well as for disaster managers, in devising hazard mitigation and response strategies to reduce the societal impacts of power outages in an equitable manner.},

  abstract = {Water distribution networks (WDNs) are critical infrastructure for communities. The dramatic expansion of the WDNs associated with urbanization makes them more vulnerable to high-consequence hazards such as earthquakes, which requires strategies to ensure their resilience. The resilience of a WDN is related to its ability to recover its service after disastrous events. Sound decisions on the repair sequence play a crucial role to ensure a resilient WDN recovery. This paper introduces the development of a graph convolutional neural network-integrated deep reinforcement learning (GCN-DRL) model to support optimal repair decisions to improve WDN resilience after earthquakes. A WDN resilience evaluation framework is first developed, which integrates the dynamic evolution of WDN performance indicators during the post-earthquake recovery process. The WDN performance indicator considers the relative importance of the service nodes and the extent of post-earthquake water needs that are satisfied. In this GCN-DRL model framework, the GCN encodes the information of the WDN. The topology and performance of service nodes (i.e., the degree of water that needs satisfaction) are inputs to the GCN; the outputs of GCN are the reward values (Q-values) corresponding to each repair action, which are fed into the DRL process to select the optimal repair sequence from a large action space to achieve highest system resilience. The GCN-DRL model is demonstrated on a testbed WDN subjected to three earthquake damage scenarios. The performance of the repair decisions by the GCN-DRL model is compared with those by four conventional decision methods. The results show that the recovery sequence by the GCN-DRL model achieved the highest system resilience index values and the fastest recovery of system performance. Besides, by using transfer learning based on a pre-trained model, the GCN-DRL model achieved high computational efficiency in determining the optimal repair sequences under new damage scenarios. This novel GCN-DRL model features robustness and universality to support optimal repair decisions to ensure resilient WDN recovery from earthquake damages.},

  abstract = {Efficient representation of complex infrastructure systems is crucial for system-level management tasks, such as edge prediction, component classification, and decision-making. However, the complex interactions between the infrastructure systems and their spatial environments increased the complexity of network representation learning. This study introduces a novel geometric-based multimodal deep learning model for spatially embedded network representation learning, namely the regional spatial graph convolutional network (RSGCN). The developed RSGCN model simultaneously learns from the node's multimodal spatial features. To evaluate the network representation performance, the introduced RSGCN model is used to embed different infrastructure networks into latent spaces and then reconstruct the networks. A synthetic network dataset, a California Highway Network, and a New Jersey Power Network were used as testbeds. The performance of the developed model is compared with two other state-of-the-art geometric deep learning models, GraphSAGE and Spatial Graph Convolutional Network. The results demonstrate the importance of considering regional information and the effectiveness of using novel graph convolutional neural networks for a more accurate representation of complex infrastructure systems.},

This introduces novel modeling features and enhances applicability while keeping the original focus on a dynamic and network-centric characterization of disservice. A key objective is to respond to the need, expressed by policy-makers and critical infrastructure regulators, for sector-agnostic and multi-granular infrastructure models for the estimation of service supply capabilities and response during and after disruptive events.},

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

LPNR can not only learn meaningful node representations that achieve competitive accuracy in node centrality measurement and community detection but also achieve high accuracy in the link prediction task.

To study such systems, a novel multi-layer spatially embedded random network model is proposed. In the development of this model, concepts from spatial statistics and graph theory are used to map complex systems with interdependent subsystems to a simplified and condensed mathematical representation. The developed model combines Markov marked point processes for vertex creation, which accounts for spatial distribution, layer assignment, and clustering effects of the vertices, and a hybrid connection model for the edge creation. To test the capabilities of, and gain insights with respect to, a real-world network, the model was used to model a complex infrastructure system, comprised of the power grid and road network of Switzerland.

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings.  Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

First, the tendency to define failure not by crash frequency and severity but by surrogates such as deficient sight distance, insufficient centripetal force etc. Second, the inclination to deal with the road user as with inanimate matter that has properties akin to physical constants. Both may be linked to the tribal custom of civil engineers. The last part of the paper explores avenues for reform. Designers of roads believe that roads built to standards are safe. Lawyers and judges assume that roads designed to standards are appropriately safe. Beliefs, no matter how passionately held, and assumptions, no matter how repeatedly applied, are fallible guides to truth. The truth is that roads designed to standards are not safe, not unsafe, and not appropriately safe; roads designed to standards have an unpremeditated level of safety. This is the claim to be substantiated}

  abstract = {China is a globally important ecosystem that is undergoing rapid development and land use/cover change (LUCC). The role of road networks in the LUCC is becoming increasingly important. Much of the upgrading in road networks is propelled by economy and population growth. However, the relationships between the road networks and the social-economic factors are poorly understood by using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which assumes that the estimated beta value holds the same everywhere within a given study area. To determine whether there is spatial variation in the relationship between the road networks and the social-economic drivers in a given region, we employed a local model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), that provides a regression coefficient (beta) for each sample location within the study area. Taking Fujian Province, one of the most developed regions in China, as a case, this paper firstly employed an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to identify the spatial patterns of the road networks at the different sizes of sampling units. We found that the spatial distribution of road networks had an obvious tendency toward the geographical dependency, with High-High clusters seated in the eastern coastal areas and Low-Low clusters distributed dispersedly in the study area. The spatial patterns of the road networks had highly consistency in the different sizes of sample units. Then, the GWR model confirmed that the relationships between the road networks and the socioeconomic factors varied by locations, with multiple relationships (both synergy and tradeoff) between them coexisting in the study region. These relationships were also visualized by sign and magnitude of the estimated coefficients of GWR for each sampling unit, which allow us to compare the different effects of the dependent variables on the road networks across locations. We also found that the variable of gross domestic product density (GDPD) is a preferred indicator over the variable of population density (PD) to analyze the associations with the road networks. Thus, this study provided useful information to develop differentiated strategies for road development at the finer level by using the more nuanced GWR models.},

Classic graph embedding methods follow the basic idea that the embedding vectors of interconnected nodes in the graph can still maintain a relatively close distance, thereby preserving the structural information between the nodes in the graph. However, this is sub-optimal due to: (i) traditional methods have limited model capacity which limits the learning performance; (ii) existing techniques typically rely on unsupervised learning strategies and fail to couple with the latest learning paradigms; (iii) representation learning and downstream tasks are dependent on each other which should be jointly enhanced. With the remarkable success of deep learning, deep graph representation learning has shown great potential and advantages over shallow (traditional) methods, there exist a large number of deep graph representation learning techniques have been proposed in the past decade, especially graph neural networks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive survey on current deep graph representation learning algorithms by proposing a new taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we systematically summarize the essential components of graph representation learning and categorize existing approaches by the ways of graph neural network architectures and the most recent advanced learning paradigms. Moreover, this survey also provides the practical and promising applications of deep graph representation learning.

However, multiplex networks are not always simple to observe in the real world; often, only partial information on the layer structure of the networks is available, whereas the remaining information is in the form of aggregated, single-layer networks. Recent works have proposed solutions to the problem of reconstructing the hidden multiplexity of single-layer networks using tools proper of network science. Here, we develop a machine learning framework that takes advantage of graph embeddings, i.e., representations of networks in geometric space. We validate the framework in systematic experiments aimed at the reconstruction of synthetic and real-world multiplex networks, providing evidence that our proposed framework not only accomplishes its intended task, but often outperforms existing reconstruction techniques.},

Often cascading dysfunctionality or disruption in these critical infrastructure networks triggers chain reactions of blackouts or blockages through the system of highly interconnected infrastructure networks, and the disruption of surrounding societies. For the planning of restoration processes and resilience of these, social aspects and demographics should also be considered to assign and mitigate the possible social risks associated with these disruptions. In this work, we study the restoration planning of critical interdependent infrastructure networks after a possible disruptive event by mainly emphasizing on the vulnerability indices of interacting society. We integrate (i) a resilience-driven multi-objective mixed-integer programming formulation to schedule the restoration process of disrupted network components in each network with (ii) an index of social vulnerability that is geographically distributed.

  abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such `multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize `traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.}

The nature of these CIs is such that failures caused by an extreme weather event or a man-made incident can trigger widespread cascading failures, sending ripple effects at regional or even national scales. To minimize such effects, it is critical for emergency responders to identify existing or potential vulnerabilities within CIs during such stressor events in a systematic and quantifiable manner and take appropriate mitigating actions. We present here a novel critical infrastructure monitoring and analysis system named URBAN-NET. The system includes a software stack and tools for monitoring CIs, pre-processing data, interconnecting multiple CI datasets as a heterogeneous network, identifying vulnerabilities through graph-based topological analysis, and predicting consequences based on ``what-if'' simulations along with visualization. As a proof-of-concept, we present several case studies to show the capabilities of our system. We also discuss remaining challenges and future work.},

Given a set of points of interest P in space, where each point belongs to a specific category, a starting point S and a destination E, TPQ retrieves the best trip that starts at S, passes through at least one point from each category, and ends at E. For example, a driver traveling from Boston to Providence might want to stop to a gas station, a bank and a post office on his way, and the goal is to provide him with the best possible route (in terms of distance, traffic, road conditions, etc.). The difficulty of this query lies in the existence of multiple choices per category. In this paper, we study fast approximation algorithms for TPQ in a metric space. We provide a number of approximation algorithms with approximation ratios that depend on either the number of categories, the maximum number of points per category or both. Therefore, for different instances of the problem, we can choose the algorithm with the best approximation ratio, since they all run in polynomial time. Furthermore, we use some of the proposed algorithms to derive efficient heuristics for large datasets stored in external memory. Finally, we give an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Network embedding has gained more attentions in recent years. It has been shown that the learned low-dimensional node vector representations could advance a myriad of graph mining tasks such as node classification, community detection, and link prediction. A vast majority of the existing efforts are overwhelmingly devoted to single-layered networks or homogeneous networks with a single type of nodes and node interactions. However, in many real-world applications, a variety of networks could be abstracted and presented in a multilayered fashion. Typical multi-layered networks include critical infrastructure systems, collaboration platforms, social recommender systems, to name a few. Despite the widespread use of multi-layered networks, it remains a daunting task to learn vector representations of different types of nodes due to the bewildering combination of both within-layer connections and cross-layer network dependencies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of multi-layered network embedding. In particular, we propose a principled framework -- MANE to model both within-layer connections and cross-layer network dependencies simultaneously in a unified optimization framework for embedding representation learning. Experiments on real-world multi-layered networks corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

To boost safe, environmental-friendly and technologically advanced airports, the passenger travel behavior as a core that decides the resource allocation, system tuning and capacity dispatching, must be grasped.

In this work, a refined passenger distribution prediction was modeled based on a learning-based method embedding physical prior knowledge, and then its effects on indoor environment prediction were analyzed. Among them, based on insect intelligent building architecture, a virtual spatial graph was defined in Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport Terminal 2, then a Wi-Fi positioning system was constructed; Next, a physics-guided spatio-temporal graph convolutional network, considering both the spatial dependencies and the passenger arrival pattern extracted from cost-free flight schedules, was developed for domestic and international passenger distribution predictions with R2 over 0.87 and 0.76 respectively; Lastly, the contributions of predicted occupant densities to the indoor environment prediction were evaluated with results showing that the average R2 for indoor temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration prediction was enhanced by 0.4 \%{\textasciitilde}91.5 \%, 0.2 \%{\textasciitilde}29.7 \% and 0.4 \%{\textasciitilde}45.4 \% respectively as the prediction horizon broadening.},

This study investigates the application of Graph-WaveNet (GWN), a type of GNN, in forecasting the states of stormwater systems in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Data was sourced from the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) spanning 43 rainfall events from 2020 to 2023. Based on the preceding 30 to 60 minutes of network states and rainfall data, GWN predicted junction inflows, pipe flow rates, and relative water depths (fraction of full area filled by flow) for lead times up to 20, 20, and 30 minutes, with an R2 greater than 0.6, respectively. Prediction accuracy declines with longer forecast horizons. GWN predicts more time steps ahead for pipes' flow rates and junctions' inflows, but fewer for relative water depths during peak versus non-peak periods. It is also more effective at predicting states of large pipes and connected junctions downstream, compared to smaller upstream components. GWN's accuracy improves significantly with precise rainfall nowcasting inputs. This study establishes a significant baseline for GWN's performance in predicting urban stormwater systems during rainfall events.},

As a type of multichannel signal, the association between all of the channels in EEG samples can be further utilized. To implement the classification of epileptic seizures from the nonseizures in EEG samples, one graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)-based framework is proposed for capturing the spatial enhanced pattern of multichannel signals to characterize the behavior of EEG activity, which is capable of visualizing the salient regions in each sequence of EEG samples. Meanwhile, the presented GCNN could be exploited to discriminate normal, ictal and interictal EEGs as a novel classifier. To evaluate the proposed approach, comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours. From the experimental results, we found that for ictal and interictal EEG signal discrimination, the presented approach can achieve a sensitivity of 98.33\%, specificity of 99.19\% and accuracy of 98.38\%.},

The data in these tasks are typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high-dimensional features and interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several classical paradigms of GNN structures, e. g., graph convolutional networks, are summarized. Key applications in power systems such as fault scenario application, time-series prediction, power flow calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Further-more, main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in power systems are discussed.}

On the other hand, after converting operational data to certain networks, the operational resilience is investigated throughout the progression of an extreme event, namely, from preventive, corrective, to restorative strategies. Moreover, the discussion on resilience evaluation and enhancement is extended to multilayer networks as modern power systems are increasingly coupled with communication networks and other energy carriers.

Solution of layout and pipe size optimization of sewer network requires the determination of pipe locations, pipe diameters, average pipe cover depths, drop and pump heights minimizing the total cost of the sewer network subject to operational constraints. The resulting problem is a highly constrained Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem presenting a challenge even to the modern heuristic search methods. In the proposed method, the TGA is used to construct feasible tree-like layouts out of the base layout defined for the sewer network, the ACOA is used to optimally determine the pipe diameters of the constructed layout, and finally NLP is used to determine the pipe slopes from which the remaining characteristics of the network such as pump/drop locations and heights are determined. In the NLP stage of the model, the velocity and flow depth constraints are expressed in terms of the slope constraints which are easily enforced as box constraint of the NLP solver leading to a considerable reduction of the search space size. The proposed hybrid ACOA-TGA-NLP has two significant advantages over other available methods. First, this method can be used for both pumped and gravitational sewer networks. Second, the computational effort is significantly reduced compared to alternative methods. Another method is also proposed here in which the layout of the network is determined by an ad-hoc method based on engineering judgment while the component design of the network is carried out by ACOA-NLP method as defined above. Proposed hybrid methods are used to solve a benchmark example from the literature and a hypothetical test example and the results are presented and compared with those produced by the existing methods such as SPST-DDDP, SDM-DDDP and GA-DDDP. The results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods and in particular the ACOA-TGA-NLP method. In fact, the optimal solution of ACOA-TGA-NLP is 149, 64.1, 22.2 and 13.6\% cheaper than those of ACOA-NLP, SPST-DDDP, SDM-DDDP and GA-DDDP methods, respectively, for the benchmark text example. Furthermore, ACOA-TGA-NLP yields a solution 80\% cheaper than that of ACOA-NLP method for hypothetical test example.},

In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be ``trained'' on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's knowledge vault project as an example of such combination.}

  abstract = {Accurate risk analysis requires representative mathematical models of infrastructure. One of the main challenges in developing mathematical models of infrastructure is selecting the modeling resolution from multiple candidates for the required analyses, each candidate having different computational cost, accuracy, and possibly ability to provide information. The goal of selecting the model resolution is to allocate computational resources to the model that best delivers the desired information with the desired accuracy level. This paper proposes a mathematical formulation to select the appropriate resolution for the modeling of infrastructure. We formulate the model selection as an iterative process until a tradeoff is achieved among accuracy, simplicity, and computational efficiency. To select the appropriate level of resolution, we propose novel metrics that measure the level of agreement between estimates of the quantities of interest computed using different levels of resolution. Specifically, we propose global metrics of accuracy that inform if a model is sufficiently detailed or oversimplified. Likewise, we introduce local metrics of accuracy to inform which parts of the model (e.g., spatial portions of the infrastructure model) need refinements. We illustrate the proposed mathematical formulation by selecting the level of resolution of the water infrastructure of Seaside, Oregon, for the purpose of assessing its functionality after a seismic hazard.},

Constraint-based and pattern-based methodologies have been used for automated gap filling of these networks, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, since validation of hypotheses made by gap filling tools require experimentation, it is challenging to benchmark performance and make improvements other than that related to speed and scalability.We present BoostGAPFILL, an open source tool that leverages both constraint-based and machine learning methodologies for hypotheses generation in gap filling and metabolic model refinement. BoostGAPFILL uses metabolite patterns in the incomplete network captured using a matrix factorization formulation to constrain the set of reactions used to fill gaps in a metabolic network. We formulate a testing framework based on the available metabolic reconstructions and demonstrate the superiority of BoostGAPFILL to state-of-the-art gap filling tools. We randomly delete a number of reactions from a metabolic network and rate the different algorithms on their ability to both predict the deleted reactions from a universal set and to fill gaps. For most metabolic network reconstructions tested, BoostGAPFILL shows above 60\% precision and recall, which is more than twice that of other existing tools.MATLAB open source implementation (https://github.com/Tolutola/BoostGAPFILL)Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

Examples include random networks with full disorder both in the connections and in the coupling functions, as well as networks where the coupling functions are taken from experimental data of electrochemical oscillators.

Link physicality imposes a non-crossing condition that affects both the evolution and the structure of a network, in a way that the adjacency matrix alone---the starting point of all graph-based approaches---cannot capture. Here, we introduce a meta-graph that helps us to discover an exact mapping between linear physical networks and independent sets, which is a central concept in graph theory. The mapping allows us to analytically derive both the onset of physical effects and the emergence of a jamming transition, and to show that physicality affects the network structure even when the total volume of the links is negligible. Finally, we construct the meta-graphs of several real physical networks, which allows us to predict functional features, such as synapse formation in the brain connectome, that agree with empirical data. Overall, our results show that, to understand the evolution and behaviour of real complex networks, the role of physicality must be fully quantified.},

The new classification algorithm is compared with the probabilistic neural network (PNN), enhanced PNN (EPNN), and support vector machine using two sets of classification problems. The first set consists of five standard benchmark problems. The second set is a large benchmark problem called Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database of handwritten digits. In general, NDC yields the most accurate classification results followed by EPNN. A beauty of the new algorithm is the smoothness of convergence curves which is an indication of robustness and good performance of the algorithm. The main aim is to maximize the prediction accuracy.},

Optimal channel networks (OCNs) are feasible optimal configurations of a spanning network mimicking landscape evolution and network selection through imperfect searches for dynamically accessible states. OCNs are spanning loopless configurations, however, only under precise physical requirements that arise under the constraints imposed by river dynamics---every spanning tree is exactly a local minimum of total energy dissipation. It is remarkable that dynamically accessible configurations, the local optima, stabilize into diverse metastable forms that are nevertheless characterized by universal statistical features. Such universal features explain very well the statistics of, and the linkages among, the scaling features measured for fluvial landforms across a broad range of scales regardless of geology, exposed lithology, vegetation, or climate, and differ significantly from those of the ground state, known exactly. Results are provided on the emergence of criticality through adaptative evolution and on the yet-unexplored range of applications of the OCN concept.}

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima.

Based on a systematic CNA of Pareto-optimal solutions of different WDSs, several graph characteristics are identified, and a newly developed CNA design approach for WDSs is proposed. The results show that obtained designs are comparable with results found by evolutionary optimization, but the CNA approach is applicable for large networks (e.g., 150,000 pipes) with a substantially reduced computational effort (runtime reduction up to 5 orders of magnitude).},

We adopt this framework for designing and testing potential control strategies for Trypanosoma cruzi spread in two empirical host communities. We show that the ecomultiplex model is an efficient and low data-demanding method to identify which species enhances parasite spread and should thus be a target for control strategies. We also find that the interplay between predator-prey and host-parasite interactions leads to a phenomenon of parasite amplification, in which top predators facilitate T. cruzi spread, offering a mechanistic interpretation of previous empirical findings. Our approach can provide novel insights in understanding and controlling parasite spreading in real-world complex systems.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the generation of models of distribution gas networks with realistic topological, spatial and technical features. The proposed algorithm offers a novel methodology for reproducing networks with multiple pressure levels. The procedure is tailor-designed for gas distribution networks, although minor ad-hoc modifications could extend its application to virtually any other physical network infrastructure. A probabilistic approach is followed, in which Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are used for spatial placement of the synthetic nodes and distance-based criteria are formulated to establish connections among them. Different pressure levels are separately generated and connected in a hierarchical fashion via pressure reduction stations, while independent subnetwork islands are identified by introducing a novel clustering scheme. The strengths and feasibility of the approach are verified on a real test case via comparison of specific structural properties and results highlight a fine agreement between the topology and the geographical distribution of the real and synthetic networks. It follows that the algorithm offers a first effective solution toward the generation of spatially-embedded network models to treat gas networks and structures with multiple hierarchical levels.},

  abstract = {Network embedding is an important method to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in networks, aiming to capture and preserve the network structure. Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.},

This study develops a method for generating synthetic interdependent critical infrastructure networks (SICIN) using simulation and nonlinear optimization techniques. SICIN consists of three components: 1) determining the location of facilities in individual networks via a modified simulated annealing algorithm; 2) generating interdependent links based on a novel pseudo-tripartite graph algorithm, and 3) simulating network flow using nonlinear optimization considering the operations of individual networks and their interdependencies. Two existing systems of interdependent infrastructure networks are used to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that SICIN outperforms state-of-the-art simulation methods according to multiple topological and flow measures of similarity between the simulated and real networks. The outcomes of this research include 1) a sample of a simulated system of interdependent networks that can serve as a test case for infrastructure models and 2) a generalized algorithm that can be used to generate synthetic interdependent infrastructures given partial data of any real network.}

At present, there are many attempts to predict the spatiotemporal state of systems using various deep learning models. However, most existing models tend to improve prediction accuracy with larger parameter scale and time consumption, but ignoring ease of use in practice. To overcome this question, we propose a lightweight spatiotemporal graph dilated convolutional network called STGDN with satisfactory prediction accuracy and lower model complexity. More specifically, we propose a novel dilated convolution operator and integrate it into traditional causal convolutional networks and graph convolutional networks to greatly improve the efficiency of prediction. The proposed dilated convolution operator can significantly reduce the depth of the model, thereby reducing the parameter scale and improving the computational efficiency of the model. We conducted on multi experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets (traffic dataset, PM2.5 dataset, and temperature dataset) to prove the effectiveness and advantage of our proposed STGDN. The experimental results show that the proposed STGDN model outperforms or achieves comparable prediction accuracy of the existing nine baselines with higher operational efficiency and fewer model parameters.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

  abstract = {The ongoing transition to renewable energy supply comes with a restructuring of power grids, changing their effective interaction topologies, more and more strongly decentralizing them and substantially modifying their input, output, and response characteristics. All of these changes imply that power grids become increasingly affected by collective, nonlinear dynamic phenomena, structurally and dynamically more distributed and less predictable in space and time, more heterogeneous in its building blocks, and as a consequence less centrally controllable. Here cornerstone aspects of data-driven and mathematical modeling of collective dynamical phenomena emerging in real and model power grid networks by combining theories from nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes and statistical physics, anomalous statistics, optimization, and graph theory are reviewed. The mathematical background required for adequate modeling and analysis approaches is introduced, an overview of power system models is given, and a range of collective dynamical phenomena are focused on, including synchronization and phase locking, flow (re)routing, Braess's paradox, geometric frustration, and spreading and localization of perturbations and cascading failures, as well as the nonequilibrium dynamics of power grids, where fluctuations play a pivotal role.}

Although link prediction methods perform well on estimating the existence probability of each potential link in monoplex networks by the set of partially observed links, we lack a mathematical tool to reconstruct the multiplex network from the observed aggregate topology and partially observed links in multiplex networks. Here, we fill this gap by developing a theoretical and computational framework that builds a probability space containing possible structures with a maximum likelihood estimation. Then, we discovered that the discrimination, an indicator quantifying differences between layers from an entropy perspective, determines the reconstructability, i.e., the accuracy of such reconstruction. This finding enables us to design the optimal strategy to allocate the set of observed links in different layers for promoting the optimal reconstruction of multiplex networks. Finally, the theoretical analyses are corroborated by empirical results from biological, social, engineered systems, and a large volume of synthetic networks.},

It is, therefore, of great significance for these networks to exhibit resilience, defined as the ability of a network to recover from a disruptive event. Inspired by the measures of component importance used in reliability communities, this paper proposes a new resilience-based component importance ranking measure for multi-state networks from the perspective of a post-disaster restoration process. Considering the stochastic nature of disruptive events, the importance measure of each component is evaluated by finding the minimal recovery paths for various disruptive events, and it can be represented by a probability distribution. A stochastic ranking approach is implemented to identify the importance rank of each component in a network. Compared to existing methods, the proposed importance measure not only takes the multi-state characteristics of a network and its components into account but also quantifies the impact of both capacity improvement and recovery time of a component on network resilience. The proposed importance measure is exemplified through case studies in the Seervada Park road network.},

We apply the method to 11,790 urban road networks across 30 cities worldwide to measure the spatial homogeneity of road networks within each city and across different cities. We find that intracity spatial homogeneity is highly associated with socioeconomic status indicators such as gross domestic product and population growth. Moreover, intercity spatial homogeneity values obtained by transferring the model across different cities reveal the intercity similarity of urban network structures originating in Europe, passed on to cities in the United States and Asia. The socioeconomic development and intercity similarity revealed using our method can be leveraged to understand and transfer insights between cities. It also enables us to address urban policy challenges including network planning in rapidly urbanizing areas and regional inequality.},

Predictive flood monitoring for situational awareness of road network status plays a critical role to support crisis response activities such as evaluation of the loss of access to hospitals and shelters. Existing studies related to near-future prediction of road network flooding status at road segment level are missing. Using fine-grained traffic speed data related to road sections, this study designed and implemented three spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) models to predict road network status during flood events at the road segment level in the context of the 2017 hurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas, USA). Model 1 consists of two spatio-temporal blocks considering the adjacency and distance between road segments, while model 2 contains an additional elevation block to account for elevation difference between road segments. Model 3 includes three blocks for considering the adjacency and the product of distance and elevation difference between road segments. The analysis tested the STGCN models and evaluated their prediction performance. Our results indicated that model 1 and model 2 have reliable and accurate performance for predicting road network flooding status in near future (e.g., 2--4~h) with model precision and recall values larger than 98\% and 96\%, respectively. With reliable road network status predictions in floods, the proposed model can benefit affected communities to avoid flooded roads and the emergency management agencies to implement evacuation and relief resource delivery plans},

In this regard, water utilities have to ensure fresh water for all users in a demand scenario stressed by climate change along with the increase in the size of cities. Dealing with anomalies, such as leakages and pipe bursts, represents one of the major issues for efficient water distribution system (WDS) operation and management. To this end, it is crucial to count on suitable methods and technologies to provide a quick, reliable, and accurate detection of such anomalies and supply disruption events. Therefore, this work proposes a novel WDS management framework based on the development of graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) models for bursts detection in WDSs. These methods rely on a WDS graph representation for a set of pressure and flow rates measures. Such a graph is used to design two GCN-based models to identify bursts. In addition, two conventional multi-layer perceptron models are used as the benchmarks to compare the graph-based methodologies. Finally, the proposed methodology is tested on a water utility network, showing the high potential of graph convolutional networks for anomaly detection on WDSs.},

Existing studies have analyzed the vulnerability of interdependent networks to cascading failures from the static perspective of network topology structure. This paper develops a more realistic cascading failures model that considers the dynamic redistribution of load in power network to explore the vulnerability of interdependent power-water networks. In this model, the critical tolerance threshold is originally proposed to indicate the vulnerability of network to cascading failures. In addition, some key parameters that are important to network vulnerability are identified and quantified through numerical simulation. Results show that cascading failures can be prevented when the values of tolerance parameter are above a critical tolerance threshold. Otherwise interdependent networks collapse after attacking a critical fraction of power nodes. Interdependent networks become more vulnerable with the increase in interdependence strength, which implies the importance of protecting those interconnected nodes to reduce the consequences of cascading failures. Interdependent networks are most vulnerable under high-load attack, which shows the significance of protecting high-load nodes.},

  abstract = {Short-term traffic flow prediction on a large-scale road network is challenging due to the complex spatial--temporal dependencies, the directed network topology, and the high computational cost. To address the challenges, this article develops a graph deep learning framework to predict large-scale network traffic flow with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we model the dynamics of the traffic flow on a road network as an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain on a directed graph. Based on the representation, a novel spatial--temporal graph inception residual network (STGI-ResNet) is developed for network-based traffic prediction. This model integrates multiple spatial--temporal graph convolution (STGC) operators, residual learning, and the inception structure. The proposed STGC operators can adaptively extract spatial--temporal features from multiple traffic periodicities while preserving the topology information of the road network. The proposed STGI-ResNet inherits the advantages of residual learning and inception structure to improve prediction accuracy, accelerate the model training process, and reduce difficult parameter tuning efforts. The computational complexity is linearly related to the number of road links, which enables citywide short-term traffic prediction. Experiments using a car-hailing traffic data set at 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals for a large road network in a Chinese city shows that the proposed model outperformed various state-of-the-art baselines for short-term network traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract = {Multiplex interactions are common and essential in real-world systems. In many cases, we can only obtain aggregated networks without detailed information regarding the type of links contained within. Such single-layer networks oversimplify the structural information and lead to misunderstandings of some properties of real systems. In this context, network splitting which aims to correctly separate an aggregated network into multilayer networks, is a meaningful problem to address. To this end, we propose a simulated-annealing-like algorithm based on the link clustering coefficient. We verify the validity of this algorithm with several synthetic networks. Inter-similarities of layers are also taken into consideration, and we can find that the proposed method is valid even if there is a certain proportion of overlapping links between layers. Finally, we apply the algorithm to real international trading networks, which results in accurate splits of different layers.},

In addition, we used the local Getis-OrdGi* index and the space syntax model as references to optimize the space form of the commercial environment. This study reveals the internal relationship between the road network and quality of the commercial environment based on big data; this result has an innovative and guiding significance for urban commercial development. The study achieved the following results. First, the hotspots of business environment quality features a spatial pattern of ``one main and four secondary.'' Second, the road networks with high global integration are mainly situated in the central city, the main road to the outer city, and the key transport hubs. Third, global integration, local integration, and local choice of the road network have a relatively large impact on the business environment quality. Additionally, the impact of the global choice on the business environment quality is relatively small. Fourth, the correlation coefficient between global choice and the quality of business environments for leisure and entertainment suggest a positive relationship, but negatively correlates with life services and science, education, culture, and health. Finally, the local choice is negatively correlated with the quality of business environments for science, education, culture, and health, whereas it positively correlates with the business environment quality for leisure and entertainment and life services.},

  abstract = {The presented methodology results in an optimal portfolio of resilience-oriented resource allocation under weather-related risks. The pre-event mitigations improve the capacity of the transportation system to absorb shocks from future natural hazards, contributing to risk reduction. The post-event recovery planning results in enhancing the system's ability to bounce back rapidly, promoting network resilience. Considering the complex nature of the problem due to uncertainty of hazards, and the impact of the pre-event decisions on post-event planning, this study formulates a nonlinear two-stage stochastic programming (NTSSP) model, with the objective of minimizing the direct construction investment and indirect costs in both pre-event mitigation and post-event recovery stages. In the model, the first stage prioritizes a bridge group that will be retrofitted or repaired to improve the system's robustness and redundancy. The second stage elaborates the uncertain occurrence of a type of natural hazard with any potential intensity at any possible network location. The damaged state of the network is dependent on decisions made on first-stage mitigation efforts. While there has been research addressing the optimization of pre-event or post-event efforts, the number of studies addressing two stages in the same framework is limited. Even such studies are limited in their application due to the consideration of small networks with a limited number of assets. The NTSSP model addresses this gap and builds a large-scale data-driven simulation environment. To effectively solve the NTSSP model, a hybrid heuristic method of evolution strategy with high-performance parallel computing is applied, through which the evolutionary process is accelerated, and the computing time is reduced as a result. The NTSSP model is implemented in a test-bed transportation network in Iowa under flood hazards. The results show that the NTSSP model balances the economy and efficiency on risk mitigation within the budgetary investment while constantly providing a resilient system during the full two-stage course.},

  abstract = {Developing a self-sufficient renewable power (RP) road transport (SRPRT) system is an important future direction for transport--energy integration. More well-developed studies must be conducted on the coordinated planning of transport, power supply, and power generation networks. This paper carries out the joint operation and planning of highway charging networks with the wind-photovoltaic-energy storage (HCN-WPE) system. Under multi-network integration and the interaction among multiple entities, a nested bi-level optimization model is proposed to optimize the users' charging and travel behavior, charging network's deployment, and power generation system's (PGS) configuration. An H-M-L algorithm structure is developed, combining the heuristic algorithm, multi-agent-based simulation technology, and linear programming algorithm. Its convergence and applicability are verified on the Nguyen-Dupius network. An empirical case in the Hu-Bao-Wu city agglomeration in China is employed to explore and discuss the managerial insights for the HCN-WPE system. The study finds that multi-network coordinated planning can improve the benefits of multiple entities, where the net present value, RP supply rate, and RP consumption rate increase by 12.0\%, 3.2\%, and 10.5\%, compared to independent planning. Network-level planning can play a management and induction role in balancing the station's load pressure. In addition, the PGS co-configuration can leverage the complementary power supply of multiple RP generators and the peak cutting and valley filling of energy storage systems, which is essential for achieving the SRPRT goal.},

  abstract = {How to improve survivability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an important issue which has attracted much attention over recent years. In this paper, by resorting to complex network theories, we propose two models, namely, a linear growth evolution model (LGEM) and an accelerated growth evolution model (AGEM). In the model evolution processes, the following factors: node addition, node deletion, and link reconstruction that naturally arise from practical WSNs applications are considered. In addition, accelerated growth is introduced into the evolving processes of AGEM. Theoretical analysis shows that AGEM is an extension of the LGEM model, and AGEM is generally more flexible and accommodating in practice. Simulation results show that the degree distributions of two models have scale-free characteristics and the topologies generated by the two models show a good survivability under random and deliberate attacks.}

Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},
