\paragraph{Collaborative LLM-MA.}
LLM-MA systems enable agents to collaborate on complex tasks through dynamic role allocation, communication, and task execution~\cite{guo2024large, han2024challenges}. Recent advancements include agent profiling~\cite{yang2024multi}, hierarchical communication~\cite{rasal2024harmony}, and integration of reasoning and intentions~\cite{qiu2024collaborative}. % Does this talk about tools?
However, challenges remain in ensuring robust communication, avoiding redundancy, and refining evaluation processes~\cite{talebirad2023collaboration}. Standardized benchmarks and frameworks are needed to drive future progress~\cite{li2024survey}.

\paragraph{Communication in LLM-MA.}
Effective communication is crucial for collaborative intelligence~\cite{guo2024large}. While many previous works, including chain~\citep{cot}, tree~\citep{tot}, complete graph~\citep{qian2024scaling}, random graph~\citep{qian2024scaling}, optimizable graph~\citep{zhuge2024gptswarm}, and pruned graph~\citep{zhang2024cut} methods have focused on communication topologies, there has been limited discussion on the optimal form of communication. Most systems rely on text-based exchanges~\cite{zhang2024cut, shen2024small}, which is inefficient and prone to errors as agents often lose track of subtasks or fail to recall prior outputs as tasks grow in complexity. We argue for structured communication protocols that guide subtasks with clear, context-specific instructions, ensuring coherence across interactions.

\paragraph{Feedback-Based Refinement.}
Feedback mechanisms, such as Self-Refine~\cite{madaan2023selfrefine} and generator-evaluator frameworks~\cite{wang2023coeval}, improve system accuracy through iterative refinement. However, these methods face challenges in managing diverse feedback, which can lead to bias or inefficiencies if inputs are not well-organized~\cite{xu2024cooperative}. Scalable, unbiased solutions are essential to enhance multi-agent evaluation processes.
