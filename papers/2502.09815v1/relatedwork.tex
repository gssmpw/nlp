\section{Related Studies}
The field of representation learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has seen extensive research, leading to the development of various methodologies aimed at enhancing semantic understanding and generation capabilities \cite{wang2024optimizing,kanax2024contextualized}.

\subsection{Statistical Approaches in Representation Learning}

Early research in representation learning for LLMs employed statistical methods to capture linguistic patterns and structures \cite{amizern2024dynamic}. Probabilistic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, were utilized to uncover hidden thematic structures within large text corpora, facilitating the learning of topic distributions \cite{golatkar2024cpr}. Additionally, word embedding techniques, including Word2Vec and GloVe, were implemented to map words into continuous vector spaces, capturing semantic relationships through their co-occurrence statistics \cite{bargamon2024hierarchical,underwood2024implementing}. Despite their contributions, these approaches often faced challenges in modeling complex syntactic dependencies and failed to effectively represent polysemy, limiting their applicability in more advanced language modeling tasks \cite{cunningham2024efficient}.

\subsection{Neural Network-Based Representation Learning}

The advent of neural network architectures marked a significant shift in representation learning strategies for LLMs \cite{wong2024efficiency}. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory networks, were applied to model sequential data, enabling the capture of temporal dependencies in language \cite{fairburn2024mitigate,farmer2024optimizing}. However, RNNs encountered difficulties in handling long-range dependencies due to vanishing gradient issues, which impeded their performance on extensive textual data \cite{welling2024semantic}. The introduction of Transformer architectures addressed these limitations by employing self-attention mechanisms, allowing models to consider all words in a sentence simultaneously, thereby improving the representation of contextual information \cite{hubsch2024articulating, embury2024dynamic}. This development led to the creation of models like BERT and GPT, which demonstrated superior performance in various natural language processing tasks \cite{chen2024dynamic}.

\subsection{Tensor-Based Methods in Representation Learning}

In efforts to further enhance the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, tensor-based methods have been explored for representation learning \cite{tsuruta2024investigating}. Tensor decomposition techniques, such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC and Tucker decomposition, were utilized to reduce the dimensionality of large parameter spaces in neural networks, thereby mitigating computational costs while preserving essential information \cite{rateri2024automated, rixewa2024interleaved}. These methods facilitated the compression of large-scale models without significant loss of performance, enabling more practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments \cite{mcintosh2024reasoning}. Nonetheless, challenges persisted in maintaining the balance between model complexity and expressiveness, as excessive compression could lead to the loss of critical semantic nuances \cite{men2024large,aturd2024dynamic}.

\subsection{Limitations of Existing Methods}

Despite the advancements achieved through statistical, neural network-based, and tensor-based methods, several limitations remain evident in current representation learning approaches for LLMs \cite{hawks2024neural}. Traditional statistical models often lack the capacity to capture deep contextual relationships inherent in language, leading to superficial representations \cite{penicig2024assessing}. Neural network-based models, while powerful, are prone to overfitting and require extensive computational resources for training and fine-tuning \cite{hisaharo2024optimizing,chard2024auditing}. Tensor-based approaches, although effective in model compression, may inadvertently discard subtle semantic information during the decomposition process, thereby affecting the model's overall performance \cite{alouris2024dynamic}.

\subsection{Justification for Statistical Coherence Alignment}

The identified limitations in existing representation learning methods highlight the need for innovative approaches that can effectively capture the intricate statistical and contextual relationships in language \cite{lodin2024dynamic}. The proposed Statistical Coherence Alignment method seeks to address these challenges by aligning the internal representations of LLMs with the inherent statistical properties of language, thereby promoting more coherent and contextually relevant outputs \cite{grushail2024adaptive}. Through the integration of tensor field convergence techniques, this approach aims to enhance the model's ability to maintain semantic integrity across various linguistic contexts, offering a promising direction for future research in LLM representation learning \cite{verscaj2024innovative}.
