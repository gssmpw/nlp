\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a novel framework for the modelling of an analytic operator (such as a ML algorithm) when a large number of input data is available and thus no brute-force execution can be performed. We propose a deep learning model, \textit{NumData2Vec}, which transforms a dataset to a lower $k$-dimensional representation space $z$. Our framework produces vector embeddings for the input datasets using \textit{NumData2Vec} and performs a similarity search to identify the most relevant subset of datasets for any unseen input. By modelling the analytic operator based on this selected subset, we are able to accurately predict its output on any given input dataset. In practice, we demonstrated that our framework can accurately model various common algorithms and compared favourably against a similar recent framework \cite{b7Apollo1}, in both accuracy and speedup. Furthermore, we showed that \textit{NumData2Vec} can create different vector representations for datasets from different scenarios. We also demonstrated that \textit{NumData2Vec} can effectively detect when noise is introduced into a dataset.
