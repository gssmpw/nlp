\section{Limitations}
There exist a number of limitations in our work as we described it. In this section we briefly highlight them.
Firstly, our input datasets comprise records of specific size and type (numerical). This currently excludes data with textual and categorical attributes, or tables with varying number of features inside a set of datasets.
Secondly, we currently consider single-input and single-output operator modelling. 
Finally, our proposed NumData2Vec model for data vectorization has a performance limitation, as it cannot deal with datasets bigger than about $3000$ tuples. This is mostly a hardware limitation of off-the-shelf GPUs (with at most 24GB of memory available).
