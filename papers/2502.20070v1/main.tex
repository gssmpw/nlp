\begin{abstract}
  Deadlocks are a major source of bugs in concurrent programs.
  They are hard to predict, because they may only occur under specific
  scheduling conditions.
  Dynamic analysis attempts to identify potential deadlocks by
  examining a single execution trace of the program.
  A standard approach involves monitoring sequences of lock
  acquisitions in each thread, with the goal of identifying deadlock
  patterns.
  A deadlock pattern is characterized by a cyclic chain of lock
  acquisitions, where each lock is held by one thread while being
  requested by the next.
  However, it is well known that not all deadlock patterns identified
  in this way correspond to true deadlocks, as they may be impossible to manifest under any schedule.

  We tackle this deficiency by proposing a new method \emph{based on partial orders} to eliminate false positives:
  lock acquisitions must be unordered under a given partial order, and not preceded by other deadlock patterns.
  We prove \emph{soundness} (no falsely predicted deadlocks) for the novel TRW partial order,
  and \emph{completeness} (no deadlocks missed) for a slightly weakened variant of TRW.
  Both partial orders can be computed efficiently and report the same
  deadlocks for an extensive benchmark suite.
