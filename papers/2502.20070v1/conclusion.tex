\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


This paper considered the application of partial-order methods
to  eliminate false positives often reported by traditional lockset-based deadlock predictors.
Inspired by dynamic data-race prediction,
key ingredients for our refined deadlock
patterns are concurrency of lock acquisitions and absence of earlier blocking deadlock patterns.
We established soundness under
our novel TRW partial order and
completeness under the slightly weaker PWR.

We implemented our approach in an offline version of
the UNDEAD deadlock predictor.
Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
precision  of our approach, based on a sizeable set of
pre-recorded program traces.
Avenues for future work are improving the efficiency of the implementation
for large numbers of threads,
as well as exploring ways to allow for
unbounded critical sections without introducing false positives.

% We show how to apply partial-order methods known from dynamic data race prediction to
% eliminate false positives that are reported by existing lockset-based deadlock predictors.
% We establish soundness and completeness for the theoretically ideal partial order, and
% present a practical implementation that efficiently approximates the theoretical ideal.
% Our experiments show that our approach scales and leads to high precision in practice.

% \ms{todo}
% Should say something about further instances (future work).
% PWR variants that are more precise.

% Partial orders that overapproximate.
% See TWR.

% Dealing with guard locks.
% Though does not seem to arise in practice for the benchmarks
% we consider, it is an important topic to be explored.
