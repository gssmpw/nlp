\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed HDCompression, a hybrid dual-stream framework that integrates the lightweight DRV-diffusion modules for ultra-low-bitrate image compression. The DRV-guided enhancement module effectively improves the quality of the fidelity information provided by the LIC stream. The DRV-guided token mask predictor increases the token prediction accuracy. The DRVs are reconstructed in the decoder via a conditioned diffusion process to avoid transmission overhead. The VQ-correction module infuses fidelity information from the enhanced LIC stream into the VQ-codebook-based generative stream for improved faithfulness in reconstruction.  Experiments have demonstrated significantly improved perceptual quality (LPIPS) with the same level of fidelity (PSNR) compared to previous dual-stream methods.
