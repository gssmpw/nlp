\section{RELATED WORK}
\noindent \textbf{Cooperative Prediction.} The existing effort of V2X research focuses on cooperative perception, and cooperative prediction which considers the temporal information with V2X is still in its infancy **Weng, "V2X-Based Cooperative Perception and Prediction"**. V2VNet **Wang, "V2VNet: A Novel End-to-End Perception and Prediction Model for V2X"** is the first work to explore this field, which proposed an end-to-end perception and prediction model. However, its prediction head is simple and ignores the map information and complex interaction features. Yu, \etal **Yu, "An Open-Source V2X Sequence Dataset for Cooperative Prediction: V2X-Seq"** presented a open-source V2X sequence dataset for cooperative prediction, V2X-Seq. V2XPnP **Huang, "V2XPnP: An Open-Source General Framework and V2X Sequential Dataset for End-to-End Cooperative Perception and Prediction"** provides an open-source general framework and V2X sequential dataset for end-to-end cooperative perception and prediction. Furthermore, the V2X-Graph **Liu, "V2X-Graph: A Graph Neural Network-Based Approach for Learning Cooperative Trajectory Representations in V2X"** is proposed based on V2X-Seq, which provides a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the cooperative trajectory representations. However, how to fully employ the V2X temporal information, such as the different temporal domains, and fuse the cooperative trajectory still needs to be explored.

\noindent \textbf{Planning-informed Prediction.} The couple of prediction and planning is the focus for safe driving in interaction scenarios **Liu, "PiP: A Planning-Informed Prediction Model for Safe Driving in Interaction Scenarios"**. PiP model **Wang, "Directly Incorporating Planning Information into Prediction: A Novel Approach to Safe Driving"** directly incorporated the planning information into prediction, and Liu, \etal **Huang, "Merging Prediction Module and General Optimization-Based Planning Module for Reaction Frameworks"**, further merge the prediction module and general optimization-based  planning module **Liu, "A Merged Prediction-Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles"** to construct a reaction framework. However, only considering ego planning in the future domain will inadvertently overestimate its priority on the road, leading to overly optimistic predictions and potentially hazardous behaviors **Wang, "The Dangers of Overly Optimistic Predictions: A Critical Analysis of Ego Planning in V2X"**. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate the future intentions of other vehicles during prediction to ensure a comprehensive extraction of interaction features across both history and future domains. The other's intention is prediction targets in single-vehicle prediction, and the ego vehicle not only can access history information to see through occlusion, but also the future information as the prior knowledge.


\noindent \textbf{Interaction-aware Prediction.} Trajectory prediction is one of the most critical research areas in autonomous driving **Zhou, "Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles: A Survey"** , which considers the perception results sequence and map information to capture the interaction context and predict the others' trajectories **Wang, "A Novel Approach to Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles"**. The interaction feature extractor has developd from CNN **Liu, "Convolutional Neural Network-Based Interaction Feature Extractor: A Novel Approach"** to GNN and Transformer **Huang, "Graph Neural Network and Transformer-Based Interaction Feature Extractor: A Comparative Study"**. The Transformer uses multi-attention to capture the temporal feature across a sequence without relying on sequential order processing **Zhou, "Multi-Attention Mechanism for Temporal Feature Extraction in Trajectory Prediction"**, which is an advantage in handling incomplete trajectories and fusing the trajectory feature from different agents. Moreover, GNN builds the complex interaction context as a graph with nodes and edges **Liu, "Graph-Based Interaction Context Representation: A Novel Approach to Trajectory Prediction"**, which can facilitate the learning of complex interaction, especially in cooperative prediction involving multi-agent and multi-temporal features.
