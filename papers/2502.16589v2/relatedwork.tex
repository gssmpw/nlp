\noindent \textbf{Cooperative Prediction.} The existing effort of V2X research focuses on cooperative perception, and cooperative prediction which considers the temporal information with V2X is still in its infancy \cite{wu2024cmp, araluce2024enhancing, zhou2024v2xpnp}. V2VNet \cite{vedaldi_v2vnet_2020} is the first work to explore this field, which proposed an end-to-end perception and prediction model. However, its prediction head is simple and ignores the map information and complex interaction features. Yu, \etal \cite{yu2023v2x} presented a open-source V2X sequence dataset for cooperative prediction, V2X-Seq. V2XPnP \cite{zhou2024v2xpnp} provides an open-source general framework and V2X sequential dataset for end-to-end cooperative perception and prediction. Furthermore, the V2X-Graph \cite{ruan2023learning} is proposed based on V2X-Seq, which provides a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the cooperative trajectory representations. However, how to fully employ the V2X temporal information, such as the different temporal domains, and fuse the cooperative trajectory still needs to be explored.

\noindent \textbf{Planning-informed Prediction.} The couple of prediction and planning is the focus for safe driving in interaction scenarios \cite{hu2023planning, espinoza2022deep}. PiP model \cite{song2020pip} directly incorporated the planning information into prediction, and Liu, \etal \cite{liu2021deep} and Huang, \etal \cite{huang2023differentiable}, further merge the prediction module and general optimization-based  planning module \cite{bhardwaj2020differentiable, zhou2021reliable} to construct a reaction framework. However, only considering ego planning in the future domain will inadvertently overestimate its priority on the road, leading to overly optimistic predictions and potentially hazardous behaviors \cite{tang2022interventional}. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate the future intentions of other vehicles during prediction to ensure a comprehensive extraction of interaction features across both history and future domains. The other's intention is prediction targets in single-vehicle prediction, and the ego vehicle not only can access history information to see through occlusion, but also the future information as the prior knowledge.


\noindent \textbf{Interaction-aware Prediction.} Trajectory prediction is one of the most critical research areas in autonomous driving \cite{huang2022survey}, which considers the perception results sequence and map information to capture the interaction context and predict the others' trajectories \cite{gao2020vectornet}. The interaction feature extractor has developd from CNN \cite{deo2018convolutional, song2020pip} to GNN and Transformer \cite{zhou2022hivt, zhou2022comprehensive}. The Transformer uses multi-attention to capture the temporal feature across a sequence without relying on sequential order processing \cite{shi2024mtr++,zhou2023qcnext}, which is an advantage in handling incomplete trajectories and fusing the trajectory feature from different agents. Moreover, GNN builds the complex interaction context as a graph with nodes and edges \cite{trajectron++,jia2023hdgt}, which can facilitate the learning of complex interaction, especially in cooperative prediction involving multi-agent and multi-temporal features.
