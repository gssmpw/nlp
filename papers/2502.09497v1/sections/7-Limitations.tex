\section{Limitations}
\label{limitations}

During our experiments, we noted several limitations that future work could expand upon and resolve. Firstly, there is only one open-source and one close-source one. Future work could look at including more LLMs for comparison. Secondly, the prediction target, holistic score, is still hard to interpret, whereas some subsets (7 and 8) of ASAP and the entire set of ELLIPSE do have fine-grained essay score annotations (see examples in Appendix \ref{ellipse-rubric}). Incorporating them into the overall score prediction process would make the overall score more transparent. Thirdly, the persona section of the prompt template mentions ``grade 7 to 10,'' which is the age range for students in ASAP; however, the students in the ELLIPSE dataset are from grades 8 to 12, which might lead to performance differences among those two datasets. Lastly, our datasets have a clear western bias, especially ELLIPSE, which focuses on ESL students in the United States. We believe the community would benefit from more diverse and inclusive datasets.
