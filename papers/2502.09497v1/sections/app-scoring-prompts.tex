% \subsection{Zero-shot Essay Scoring}
Here are some examples of zero-shot essay scoring prompts. Note that the exact phrasing and wording are not exactly the same as \cite{stahl-etal-2024-exploring} paper. That is because we have failed to reproduce the exact same results in their paper, motivating us to conduct a limited prompt tuning in the \texttt{dev} set of ASAP. To reduce complexity, the tuning is done only in phrasing and formatting, without changing the overall structure of the prompt compared to the original design.

\subsubsection{No Linguistic Feature}

You are part of an educational research team analyzing the writing skills of students in grades 7 to 10. You have been given a student's essay and the prompt they responded to.  \\
\#\#\# Essay Prompt: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.  \\

\#\#\# Analyzed Student Essay: Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Others have different ideas. A great amount in the world today are using computers, some for work and spme for the fun of it. Computers is one of mans greatest accomplishments. Computers are helpful in so many ways, @CAPS4, news, and live streams. Don't get me wrong way to much people spend time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others but who are we to tell them what to do. When I grow up I want to be a author or a journalist and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on time on the computer, one @MONTH1 spend more time then the other but you know exactly what @CAPS5 getting at. So what if some expert think people are spending to much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying natures and interacting with family and friends. For all the expert knows that its how must people make a living and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time and to be honest it's non of my concern and it shouldn't be the so called experts concern. People interact a thousand times a day on the computers. Computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers helps the @ORGANIZATION1 locate most wanted criminals. As you can see computers are more useful to society then you think, computers benefit society. \\
