to address the above issues, with the aim of making decomposition-based MOEAs perform very well on irregular problems without compromising their good performance on regular ones. We do so by proposing a weight adaptation trigger mechanism, which will be detailed in the next section. 

In addition, 
it is worth mentioning that there are a couple of studies that attempted to balance the performance on regular and irregular Pareto fronts, though not being decomposition-based MOEAs, such as AR-MOEA____, VaEA____, BCE-IBEA____. 
They perform very well on both regular and irregular Pareto fronts. 
For comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm, we will include them in our comparative experiments. The results are presented in the supplementary material.
