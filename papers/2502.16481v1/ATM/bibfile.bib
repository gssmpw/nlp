  Abstract                 = {Convergence towards, and diversity across <span class='snippet'>the</span> Pareto-optimal front are <span class='snippet'>the</span> two main requirements when optimising a multiobjective optimisation problem (MOP) with <span class='snippet'>conflicting</span> <span class='snippet'>objectives</span>. Most established multiobjective <span class='snippet'>evolutionary</span> algorithms (MOEAs) have mechanisms that address these requirements. However, in <span class='snippet'>many</span>-<span class='snippet'>objective</span> optimisation, where <span class='snippet'>the</span> number <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> is greater than 2 or 3, it has been found that these two requirements can conflict with one another, introducing problems such as dominance resistance and speciation. In this study, a previously introduced diversity management mechanism is deployed within a Progressive Preference Articulation (PPA) technique to optimise an 8-<span class='snippet'>objective</span> real-world problem <span class='snippet'>of</span> aircraft control system design. This paper illustrates <span class='snippet'>the</span> effective application <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> new diversity management mechanism used in conjunction with <span class='snippet'>the</span> PPA technique when optimising a multiobjective real-world engineering problem.},

  Abstract                 = {<span class='snippet'>Many</span> real-world problems demand a feasible solution to satisfy physical equilibrium, stability, or certain properties which require an additional lower level <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> problem to be solved. Although such bilevel problems are studied somewhat in <span class='snippet'>the</span> context <span class='snippet'>of</span> a single <span class='snippet'>objective</span> in each level, there are not <span class='snippet'>many</span> studies in which multiple <span class='snippet'>conflicting</span> <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> are considered in each level. Bilevel multi-<span class='snippet'>objective</span> <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> problems offer additional complexities, as not every lower level Pareto-optimal front has a representative solution to <span class='snippet'>the</span> upper level Pareto-optimal front and that only a tiny fraction <span class='snippet'>of</span> participating lower level fronts make it to <span class='snippet'>the</span> upper level front. A couple <span class='snippet'>of</span> recent studies by <span class='snippet'>the</span> authors have suggested a viable EMO method to handle such problems. In this paper, we analyze <span class='snippet'>the</span> difficulties which a bilevel EMO procedure may face in handling such problems and present a systematic construction procedure for bilevel <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> test problems. Based <span class='snippet'>on</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> suggested principles, we propose five test problems which are scalable in terms <span class='snippet'>of</span> number <span class='snippet'>of</span> variables and <span class='snippet'>objectives</span>, and which enable researchers to evaluate different phases <span class='snippet'>of</span> a bilevel problem solving task. <span class='snippet'>The</span> test problem construction procedure is interesting and may motivate other researchers to extend <span class='snippet'>the</span> idea to develop further test problems.},

  Abstract                 = {When dealing with <span class='snippet'>many</span>-objectives <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> <span class='snippet'>problems</span>, the concepts <span class='snippet'>of</span> Pareto-<span class='snippet'>optimality</span> and Pareto-dominance are often inefficient in modeling and simulating human decision making. This leads to an unpractical size <span class='snippet'>for</span> the set <span class='snippet'>of</span> Pareto-optimal (PO) solutions, and an additional selection <span class='snippet'>criteria</span> among solutions is usually arbitrarily considered. In the paper, different <span class='snippet'>fuzzy</span>-based <span class='snippet'>definitions</span> <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>optimality</span> and dominated solutions, being nonpreference based, are introduced and tested on analytical test cases, in order to show their validity and nearness to human decision making. Based on this <span class='snippet'>definitions</span>, different subsets <span class='snippet'>of</span> PO solution set can be computed using simple and clear information provided by the decision maker and using <span class='snippet'>a</span> parameter value ranging from zero to one. When the value <span class='snippet'>of</span> the above parameter is zero, the introduced <span class='snippet'>definitions</span> coincide with classical Pareto-<span class='snippet'>optimality</span> and dominance. When the parameter value is increased, different subset <span class='snippet'>of</span> PO solutions can be obtained corresponding to higher degrees <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>optimality</span>.},

  Abstract                 = {In <span class='snippet'>optimization</span>, multiple <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> and constraints cannot be handled independently <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> underlying optimizer. Requirements such as continuity and differentiability <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> cost surface add yet another <span class='snippet'>conflicting</span> element to <span class='snippet'>the</span> decision process. While &ldquo;better&rdquo; solutions should be rated higher than &ldquo;worse&rdquo; ones, <span class='snippet'>the</span> resulting cost landscape must also comply with such requirements. <span class='snippet'>Evolutionary</span> algorithms (EAs), which have found application in <span class='snippet'>many</span> areas not amenable to <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> by other methods, possess <span class='snippet'>many</span> characteristics desirable in a multiobjective optimizer, most notably <span class='snippet'>the</span> concerted handling <span class='snippet'>of</span> multiple candidate solutions. However, EAs are essentially unconstrained search techniques which require <span class='snippet'>the</span> assignment <span class='snippet'>of</span> a scalar measure <span class='snippet'>of</span> quality, or fitness, to such candidate solutions. After reviewing current revolutionary approaches to multiobjective and constrained <span class='snippet'>optimization</span>, <span class='snippet'>the</span> paper proposes that fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision making framework based <span class='snippet'>on</span> goals and priorities is subsequently formulated in terms <span class='snippet'>of</span> a relational operator, characterized, and shown to encompass a number <span class='snippet'>of</span> simpler decision strategies. Finally, <span class='snippet'>the</span> ranking <span class='snippet'>of</span> an arbitrary number <span class='snippet'>of</span> candidates is considered. <span class='snippet'>The</span> effect <span class='snippet'>of</span> preference changes <span class='snippet'>on</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> cost surface seen by an EA is illustrated graphically for a simple problem. <span class='snippet'>The</span> paper concludes with <span class='snippet'>the</span> formulation <span class='snippet'>of</span> a multiobjective genetic algorithm based <span class='snippet'>on</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> proposed decision strategy. Niche formation techniques are used to promote diversity among preferable candidates, and progressive articulation <span class='snippet'>of</span> preferences is shown to be possible as long as <span class='snippet'>the</span> genetic algorithm can recover from abrupt changes in <span class='snippet'>the</span> cost landscape},

  Abstract                 = {This study contributes a many-objective analysis of the tradeoffs associated with using the portfolio planning approach for managing the urban water supply risks posed by growing population demands and droughts. The analysis focuses on four supply portfolio strategies: (1) portfolios with permanent rights to reservoir inflows, (2) adaptive options contracts added to the permanent rights, (3) rights, options, and leases, and (4) rights, options, and leases subject to a critical reliability constraint used to represent a maximally risk averse case. The portfolio planning strategies were evaluated using a 10 year Monte Carlo simulation of a city in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) within Texas. Our solution sets provide the tradeoff surfaces between portfolios' expected values for cost, cost variability, reliability, surplus water, frequency of using leases, and dropped (or unused) transfers of water. Using an additional severe drought scenario, this work shows that leases and options can reduce the potential for critical supply failures when urban supply systems must contend with unexpected and severe extremes in both demand and water scarcity. In summary, this paper contributes a framework that couples interactive visualization and many-objective optimization to innovate urban water portfolio planning under uncertainty. The many-objective analysis of the LRGV case study shows that effective water portfolio planning can simultaneously improve the costs, efficiency, and reliability of urban water supply while ensuring adaptability and resiliency to future changes.},

  Abstract                 = {<span class='snippet'>Many</span> real-world problems involve multiple <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> that need to be optimized simultaneously. However, in most cases, a suitable optimal solution meeting all <span class='snippet'>the</span> <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> can hardly be found since these <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> are generally <span class='snippet'>conflicting</span>. Compared to conventional <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> techniques, genetic algorithms (GAs) are well suited to solve multiobjective <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> (MO) problems since a family <span class='snippet'>of</span> "acceptable" solutions-a so called Pareto set-can be identified by different individuals through <span class='snippet'>the</span> evolution process. However, most <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> existing multiobjective <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> genetic algorithms (MOGAs) have difficulty dealing with <span class='snippet'>the</span> trade-off between uniformly distributing <span class='snippet'>the</span> computational resources and avoiding <span class='snippet'>the</span> "genetic drift" phenomenon. <span class='snippet'>The</span> paper proposes a new <span class='snippet'>evolutionary</span> approach to MO problems-<span class='snippet'>the</span> rank-density based genetic algorithm (RDGA). From <span class='snippet'>the</span> result <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> simulation study, RDGA clearly outperforms two representative MOGAs <span class='snippet'>on</span> three benchmark testing problems in terms <span class='snippet'>of</span> keeping <span class='snippet'>the</span> diversity <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> individuals along trade-off surface, tending to extend <span class='snippet'>the</span> Pareto front to new areas, and finding a well-approximated Pareto optimal set},

During <span class='snippet'>the</span> past decade a multiplicity <span class='snippet'>of</span> multiobjective EA (MOEA) techniques have been proposed and applied to <span class='snippet'>many</span> scientific and engineering applications. Our discussion's intent is to rigorously define and execute a quantitative MOEA performance comparison methodology. Almost all comparisons cited in <span class='snippet'>the</span> current literature visually compare algorithmic results, resulting in only relative conclusions. Our methodology gives a basis for absolute conclusions regarding MOEA performance. Selected results from its execution with four MOEAs are presented and described},

  Abstract                 = {Summary form only given. <span class='snippet'>The</span> field <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>evolutionary</span> multi-criterion <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> has undergone <span class='snippet'>a</span> tremendous growth since <span class='snippet'>the</span> first <span class='snippet'>approaches</span> have been proposed in <span class='snippet'>the</span> mid-1980's. Due to their population-<span class='snippet'>based</span> structure, <span class='snippet'>evolutionary</span> algorithms are inherently suited to <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> problems where <span class='snippet'>the</span> goal is to find <span class='snippet'>a</span> set <span class='snippet'>of</span> solutions. <span class='snippet'>For</span> this reason and with <span class='snippet'>the</span> advent <span class='snippet'>of</span> sufficient computing resources, they have become <span class='snippet'>a</span> valuable tool to approximate <span class='snippet'>the</span> set <span class='snippet'>of</span> Pareto-optimal solutions <span class='snippet'>for</span> highly complex applications in various domains. Several trends could be observed during <span class='snippet'>the</span> last two decades. Concerning <span class='snippet'>the</span> design <span class='snippet'>of</span> EMO algorithms, <span class='snippet'>the</span> early methods used component-wise selection mechanisms, while meanwhile dominance-<span class='snippet'>based</span> fitness assignment schemes combined with diversity preservation techniques and elitist environmental selection are most popular. <span class='snippet'>A</span> further paradigm shift has been initiated where <span class='snippet'>the</span> search is <span class='snippet'>based</span> <span class='snippet'>on</span> set quality measures. <span class='snippet'>A</span> second trend is related to <span class='snippet'>the</span> <span class='snippet'>performance</span> assessment <span class='snippet'>of</span> EMO methods. <span class='snippet'>The</span> first <span class='snippet'>studies</span> were proof-<span class='snippet'>of</span>-principle results and mainly using visual comparisons to evaluate simulation results. Later, quantitative measures were introduced and <span class='snippet'>a</span> variety <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>approaches</span> <span class='snippet'>for</span> assessing <span class='snippet'>the</span> quality <span class='snippet'>of</span> sets have been proposed. <span class='snippet'>The</span> issue <span class='snippet'>of</span> statistical testing in <span class='snippet'>the</span> context <span class='snippet'>of</span> random sets has gained only little attention until 2000, but has become more and more standard meanwhile. Finally, <span class='snippet'>a</span> third trend addresses theoretical aspects <span class='snippet'>of</span> EMO. Within <span class='snippet'>the</span> last four years, several <span class='snippet'>studies</span> have been presented run-time analyses <span class='snippet'>of</span> simple model algorithms <span class='snippet'>for</span> various types <span class='snippet'>of</span> problems; these complement <span class='snippet'>the</span> <span class='snippet'>many</span> empirical <span class='snippet'>studies</span> published in <span class='snippet'>the</span> second decade <span class='snippet'>of</span> EMO history. Despite <span class='snippet'>the</span> <span class='snippet'>many</span> advances that have been achieved during <span class='snippet'>the</span> last 20 years, there are several challenges ahead. <span class='snippet'>The</span> integration <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>the</span> search process into <span class='snippet'>the</span> decision making process has been discussed <span class='snippet'>for</span> <span class='snippet'>many</span> years, but so far only little research has been devoted to - real interactive EMO methods. In <span class='snippet'>the</span> light <span class='snippet'>of</span> this question, especially problems with <span class='snippet'>a</span> large number <span class='snippet'>of</span> <span class='snippet'>objectives</span> are <span class='snippet'>of</span> particular interest. But <span class='snippet'>many</span> other topics can be mentioned in this context: uncertainty, robustness, and integration <span class='snippet'>of</span> exact <span class='snippet'>optimization</span> methods, to name only <span class='snippet'>a</span> few.},
