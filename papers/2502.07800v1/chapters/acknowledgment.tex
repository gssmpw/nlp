First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof.\ Dr.\ Richard Hahnloser for providing me with the opportunity to undertake this project and providing valuable feedback. I am equally grateful to Prof.\ Dr.\ Nathalie Giroud for her continued support throughout my academic journey.

I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisors: Corinna, Maris, and Remo. I am deeply grateful to Corinna for her excellent data, patient guidance and detailed feedbacks on the intricate details of the project. I thank Maris for his ideas and consistent input on potential directions, as well as valuable feedbacks on presentation slides. His contribution of the NeuralEnCodec repository is the foundation for my subsequent EnCodec implementations. I am grateful to Remo for his thoughtful feedback, help and guidance on the tools, catch-ups, and insights into model interpretability. I would like to thank all three of my supervisors again for their help and feedback. Their collective mentorship have been invaluable to the completion of this thesis.

I would also like to thank Aidan, Jacob, as well as all members in the Birdsong and Natural Language Group for their feedback and patience during my presentations.

My sincere thanks to all amazing administrative team members at the Institute of Computational Linguistics and Institute of Neuroinformatics for their invaluable administrative support for this thesis.

Finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Zhugu, my friends, and my family for their unwavering support. This thesis would not have been possible without their unconditional support.
