\begin{definition}[Differentially-Private Partition Selection]
In the differentially-private partition selection (a.k.a. private set union or key selection) problem, there are $n$ users with each user $u$ having a set $S_u$ of items from an unknown and possibly infinite universe $\Sigma$ of items: the input is of the form $\sets = \{(u, S_u)\}_{u \in[n]}$. The goal is to output a set of items $U$ of maximum cardinality, such that $U$ is a subset of the union of the users' sets $\U=\cup_{u \in [n]} S_u$,  while maintaining user-level differentially privacy.
\end{definition}
As standard in prior work~\cite{korolova2009releasing, gopi2020dpunion, carvalho2022incorporatingitem, swanberg2023dpsips} we consider the central differential privacy model, where the input data is available to a curator that runs the algorithm and wants to ensure differential privacy for the output of the algorithm. We now formally define these notions.

\begin{definition}[Neighboring Datasets]
We say that two input datasets $\sets$ and $\sets'$ are neighboring if one can be obtained by removing a single user's set from the other, i.e., $\sets' = \sets \cup \{(v, S_v)\}$ for some new user $v$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Differential Privacy \cite{dwork2014book}]
A randomized algorithm $\mathcal{M}$ is $(\eps, \delta)$-differentially private, or $(\eps, \delta)$-DP, if for any two neighboring datasets $\sets$ and $\sets'$ and for any possible subset of outputs $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \{U: U \subseteq \Sigma \}$,
\[
    \Pr(\mathcal{M}(\sets) \in \mathcal{O}) \leq e^\eps \cdot \Pr(\mathcal{M}(\sets') \in \mathcal{O}) + \delta.
\]
\end{definition}

Let $\Phi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the standard Gaussian cumulative density function.

\begin{proposition}[Gaussian Mechanism \cite{balle2018gaussianmechanism}]\label{prop:gaussian}
Let $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ be a function with $\ell_2$ sensitivity $\Delta_2$. For any $\eps > 0$ and $\delta \in (0,1]$, the mechanism $M(x) = f(x) + Z$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$ is $(\eps, \delta)$-DP if
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi\left(\frac{\Delta_2}{2\sigma} - \frac{\eps \sigma}{\Delta_2}\right) - e^{\eps} \Phi\left(-\frac{\Delta_2}{2\sigma} - \frac{\eps \sigma}{\Delta_2}\right) \leq \delta.
\end{equation*}
\end{proposition}
