\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We demonstrate the \chat{} system to interactively build AI pipelines using \sys{} and \archytas{}.
Although our demo did not extensively cover physical optimization aspects, more details can be found in~\cite{palimpzestCIDR}.
The \chat{} interface offers a convenient tool for data practitioners to build complex data processing pipelines with little effort and a soft learning curve.
Our vision is that on the one hand, the future of data engineering will include more and more sophisticated frameworks to build complex applications that mix LLMs and traditional data processing.
On the other hand, tools like \chat{} will assist developers and make it easier to adopt new technologies and programming paradigms.
