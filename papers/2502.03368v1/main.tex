\begin{abstract}

Thanks to the advances in generative architectures and large language models, data scientists can now code pipelines of AI operations to process large collections of unstructured data.
Recent progress has seen the rise of declarative AI frameworks (e.g., \textsc{palimp}-\textsc{zest}, \textsc{Lotus}, and \textsc{DocETL}) to build optimized and increasingly complex pipelines, but these systems often remain accessible only to expert programmers. 
In this demonstration, we present \chat, a chat-based interface to \sys{} that bridges this gap by letting users create and run sophisticated AI pipelines through natural language alone. By integrating \archytas{}, a ReAct-based reasoning agent, and \sys{}’s suite of relational and LLM-based operators, \chat{} provides a practical illustration of how a chat interface can make declarative AI frameworks truly accessible to non-experts.

Our demo system is publicly available online. At SIGMOD’25, participants can explore three real-world scenarios—scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search—or apply \chat{} to their own datasets. In this paper, we focus on how \chat{}, supported by the \sys{} optimizer, simplifies complex AI workflows such as extracting and analyzing biomedical data. A companion video is also available at \demovideo.
% \cite{chatdemovideo}.
    % Thanks to the advances in generative architectures and large language models, data scientists can now code pipelines of machine-learning operations to process large collections of unstructured data.
    % We present \sys: a declarative framework to automatically build pipelines, and \chat, a chat-based interface that allows users to build \sys pipelines purely in natural language.
    % we showcase not only the potential of optimized unstructured data processing with \sys, but also the ease of getting started with our system without the steep learning curve of mastering a new programming framework.
    % %
    % %
    % The core architecture of \sys is based on an extended set of relational operations which are implemented using conventional as well as LLM-based physical operators.
    % % Users can specify whether to optimize the execution of their pipelines according to runtime, quality of the outputs, or processing cost.
    % The natural language interface to build these pipelines is based on the \archytas{} system, which implements the ``ReAct''  protocol to design reasoning agents.

    % % In this system, an LLM agent is provided with coding capabilities as well as templates of \sys primitives and it is instructed to build data processing pipelines.
    % Our demo system is publicly available online.
    % SIGMOD'25 participants can leverage \chat on three use cases: scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search - as well as upload their own datasets for analysis.
    % In this paper, we will describe the demonstration of the first use case.
    % A companion video for this submission is available online.
