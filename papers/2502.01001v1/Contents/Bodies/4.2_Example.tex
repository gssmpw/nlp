\subsection{Some Applications of Results}
\label{subsec:eg}

In this section, we propose a specific example to illustrate how the results regarding the uniqueness of NE can be applied in practice. This example is inspired by \citet{public-dynamic:fershtman1991dynamic}, where the cost functions are modeled as quadratic functions.

Specifically, we assume the homogeneity of players in the public good game $G$, i.e., the values of gains, costs of efforts, and action spaces are identical among players, with differences only in the network structure $W$. Therefore, we use $f(k)$ and $c(x)$ instead of $f_i(k_i)$ and $c_i(x_i)$ to represents values and costs, when the context allows. 

Assume $f(k)$ and $c(x)$ has following expression:
\begin{align*}
    f(k) =& 
    \begin{cases}
    ak - b k^2 \quad &\text{if $0\le k \le \frac{a}{2b}$}
    \\
    \frac{a^2}{4b} \quad &\text{if $k > \frac{a}{2b}$}
    \end{cases}
    \\
    c(x) =& \frac{c_0}{2}x^2\quad\qquad\quad \text{for $c_0>0$}
\end{align*}
and $X = [0,\xhigh]$ for a sufficiently large 
$\xhigh$ such that choosing $\xhigh$ is a dominated strategy for all players, due to extremely high costs and bounded values for gains. 
The values and costs are quadratic functions in their domains, with a clipping on the value function at the maximum point.
We also restrict $w_{ij}$ to be either $0$ or $1$.


%and $X = [0,\xhigh]$ for sufficiently large $\xhigh$ such that acting $\xhigh$ is a dominated strategy for all players (for the extremely large costs and bounded values for gains). We restrict $w_{ij}$ to be either $0$ or $1$.

From the expressions of $f(k)$ and $c(x)$, we know that $c(x)$ is $c_0$-strongly convex, $c'(x)$ is $c_0$-Lipschitz, $f(k)$ is $2b$-strongly concave in the domain $[0,\frac{a}{2b}]$ , and $f'(k)$ is $2b$-Lipschitz on the full domain.

\subsubsection{The Application of \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-individual}}
In this part, we assume that the non-diagonal elements of $W$ are $\iid$ generated with probability $p = \frac{p_0}{n}$ equals to $1$ and $0$ otherwise, where $p_0>0$ is a constant.
We have the following theorem,
\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_case_1}


\begin{remark*}
\label{rmk:thm:case:eg}

This proof is done by substituting \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-individual} and using Chebyshev's inequalities. Notice that $\sigma_{max}(\Sigma)$ can be bounded by the $\infty$-norm $\| \Sigma \|_\infty$, which is the maximum row sum of $\Sigma$.
We extract the sum of each row $i$ by $\gamma_i$, using Chebyshev's inequalities to bound the tail of $\gamma_i$ and union bound to control $\| \Sigma \|_\infty = \max_i \gamma_i$.

Notice that the result inevitably has a dependency on the square root of $n$ by Chebshev's inequality. 
Due to dependence between $\sigma_{ij}$ and $\sigma_{ij'}$, we can not directly use concentration inequalities, such as Chernoff's inequality \citep{chernoff:chernoff1952measure}, which can help decrease the dependency to $\log n$. 
However, we believe that the $\mathrm{poly} \log(n)$ dependency can be established, by the intrinsic independence on $\{w_{ij}\}_\ijinn$, which allows for further studies.

\end{remark*}

\subsubsection{The Application of \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-symmetric} and \cref{thm:NE:unique:equivalence}}

In this part, we assume that $W$ has a specific up-triangular structure, \ie, $w_{ij} = 0$ if $i>j$. Next, we will show that under this assumption, the NE of public good game is unique.

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_case_2}



\begin{remark*}
In such scenarios, the conditions specified in \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-individual,thm:NE:unique:near-potential,thm:NE:unique:near-symmetric} may no longer be satisfied. However, we can employ the technique described in \cref{thm:NE:unique:equivalence} to transform the original game $G$ into another game $G'$
that meets the conditions outlined in \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-symmetric}.

Notice that this game must have a unique NE. It is because the following insight: since $w_{ij} $ for $i>j$ means that the efforts of players with lower identifiers $j$ have no externalities on players with higher identifiers $i$. Therefore, player $n$ is playing an individual-interest game, and thus has an optimal strategy $x_n^*$. Given $x_n^*$ fixed, player $n-1$ can also determine an optimal strategy $x_{n-1}^*$. Overall, each player can determine an optimal strategy in turn, which forms an equilibrium. 
However, our proof can give a stronger result that, if $w_{ij} = O(\varepsilon^{i+1-j})$\footnote{here $\varepsilon$ is a constant used in the proof} for $i>j$, we can also guarantee the uniqueness of NE.
\footnote{It is because after the transformation in the proof, the lower-triangular elements hold to be $O(\varepsilon)$.}
