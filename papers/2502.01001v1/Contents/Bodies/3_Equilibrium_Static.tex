\section{Equilibrium Solutions of Public Good Games}
\label{sec:equilibrium}

In this section, we establish the existence and uniqueness results of equilibrium solutions in public good games. An effort profile is $\bmx$ as an (pure strategy) NE, if no player can unilaterally increase her utility by changing her effort. Formally, $\bmx$ is an NE if, for any player $i$ and any alternative effort $x_i'$, we have
\begin{align}
\label{eq:static:NE}
    u_i(x_i', \bmx_{-i}) \le u_i(x_i, \bmx_{-i}) \quad \forall x'_i \in [\underline{x}_i, \bar{x}_i].
\end{align}

% \myx{can delete}
% The first order condition states that an effort profile $\bmx$ is a NE iff for all $i$,
% \begin{align*}
%     f'(k_i) =& c'(x_i) \quad \text{if $\xlow_i < x_i < \xhigh_i$}
%     \\
%     f'(k_i) \le& c'(x_i) \quad \text{if $x_i = \xlow_i$}
%     \\
%     f'(k_i) \ge& c'(x_i) \quad \text{if $x_i = \xhigh_i$}
% \end{align*}


\subsection{Existence of Nash Equilibrium}

Generally, an (pure strategy) NE may not exist in normal-form games. Fortunately, the following theorem states that an NE always exists in the networked public good games studied in this paper. 

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_NE_exist}
%The proof's crux hinges on applying the Brouwer's fixed-point theorem to demonstrate that a NE is invariably achievable \citep{brouwer:brouwer1911abbildung}. 
% To construct the basis of our argument, we first present an essential lemma, whose proof is shown in \cref{app:omitted-prf}.
% \input{Contents/Theorems/lem_argmax_Lipschitz}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch of \cref{thm:NE:exist}]
Let us construct the best-response function $\BR(\bmx)$ for all players. If it is continuous, then by Brouwer's fixed point theorem \citep{brouwer:brouwer1911abbildung}, there is a fixed point, which is also the NE of the game.

However, this is not always the case, since the best response may be discontinuous and even not a singleton set. To address this issue, we modify the cost function to be an $\alpha$-convex function. This results in an $\alpha$-modified game, whose best-response function is continuous.
% by \cref{lem:argmax:Lipschitz}, the best-response function on 
% the $\alpha$-modified game is $\frac{2L}{\alpha}$-Lipschitz, thus continuous.

As long as the $\alpha$-modified game has an NE $\bmx^*_\alpha$, we first let $\alpha \to 0$, then by compactness of $X$, we claim that there is an accumulation point $\bmx^*$ that is the limitation of $\bmx^*_{\alpha_k}$ for a sequence $\alpha_k\to 0$. 
To establish the desirable result in this theorem, we continue proving that $\bmx^*$ is the NE of the original game, given $\bmx^*_{\alpha_k}$ is the NE of $\alpha_k$-modified game for all $k$.
This involves carefully taking limits through several steps.
\end{proof}

Similar to normal-form games, NE in public goods games may not be unique. This is elaborated upon in the example below.

Example \ref{eg:NE:nonunique} motivates us to investigate the scenarios in which the NE is unique.

\subsection{Uniqueness of Nash Equilibrium}
\label{subsec:NE:unique}

In this section, we explore the conditions under which NE of the public good game is unique.
We begin by introducing a necessary lemma along with some definitions that will be frequently utilized in the subsequent theorems.


\input{Contents/Definitions/closeness}

\input{Contents/Definitions/near_potential_game}


\input{Contents/Theorems/lem_near-potential}

Lemma \ref{lem:near-potential} can be deduced from the results in \citet{concave_game-initial:rosen1965existence} by the utilization of \emph{concave games} and \emph{diagonal strict concavity}.
This deduction relies on the technical assumption of the second-order differentiability of $u_i(\bmx)$'s and $u(\bmx)$. 
The proof for \cref{lem:near-potential} can be done by verifying whether the conditions in \citet{concave_game-initial:rosen1965existence} are satisfied, given the conditions in this lemma. We provide a proof sketch below, with the full derivation available in arXiv ???.
% The proof is not too technical and then the corresponding derivation is moved to appendix.
%For completeness, we also present a self-contained proof without the results of \citet{concave_game-initial:rosen1965existence}. The complete proof is also proved in appendix, only showing the proof sketch.

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch of \cref{lem:near-potential}]
\citet{concave_game-initial:rosen1965existence} proved that diagonal strict concavity indicates the uniqueness of NE. He also proposed a sufficient condition for diagonal strict concavity is that $G(\bmx,\bmgg) + G^T(\bmx, \bmgg)$ is negative definite. Here, $G(\bmx, \bmgg)$ is the Jacobian of $g(\bmx, \bmgg)$ \wrt\ $\bmx$, $G^T$ is the transpose of matrix $G$, and $g(\bmx, \bmgg)$ is the vector $(\gamma_i \frac{\pp u_i}{\pp x_i}(\bmx))_\iinn$, representing the pseudo-gradient of game $(u_i(\bmx))_\iinn$.

By careful computation, we can express $G(\bmx, \bmgg)$ as
\begin{align*}
    G(\bmx, \bmgg) =& H(\bmx) + \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\pp^2 (\gamma_1 u_1 - u)}{\pp x_1^2} (\bmx) & \cdots & \frac{\pp^2 (\gamma_1 u_1 - u)}{\pp x_1 \pp x_n}(\bmx)
    \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots 
    \\
    \frac{\pp^2 (\gamma u_n - u)}{\pp x_n x_1} (\bmx) & \cdots & \frac{\pp^2 (\gamma u_n - u)}{\pp x_n \pp x_n}(\bmx)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    \triangleq& H(\bmx) + I(\bmx,\bmgg) 
\end{align*}
where $H(\bmx)$ is the Hessian matrix of $u(\bmx)$ \wrt\ $\bmx$, thus is $c$-negative definite. 
By the near-potential property of the game $(u_i(\bmx))_\iinn$, we can bound the $I(\bmx, \bmgg)$ by $\Sigma$, with the largest eigenvalue of $\Sigma + \Sigma^T$ less than $2c$. Therefore, $G(\bmx, \bmgg) +  G^T(\bmx, \bmgg)$ is negative definite, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

% \begin{proof}[Proof Sketch of \cref{lem:near-potential}]\\

% \emph{Step 1: The uniqueness of NE.}
%  Consider the $\bmgg$-scaled pseudo-gradient ascent dynamic $\bmx(t)$, which satisfies the differential equations in \cref{def:BRD}. We aim at showing the dynamic is compressive. To prove this, we decompose $\frac{\dd \bmx(t)}{\dd t}$ into two parts: the first part portraits the dynamic on maximizing $u(\bmx)$, while the second part maximizes $\gamma_i u_i(\bmx) - u(\bmx)$. 

%  For the first part, by the technique in \cref{prf:thm:SW:BRD} we can show that the compressive factor is at least $c$, for $c$-concavity of $u(\bmx)$. 
%  For the second part, due to the near-potential property of the game $\{u_i(\bmx)\}_\iinn$, we could derive that the expansion factor is at most $\sigma_{max}(\Sigma)$.
%  Combining them, the $\bmgg$-scaled pseudo-gradient ascent dynamic is compressive overall. We then completes the proof by Banach's theorem.

%  \emph{Step 2: The exponential convergence rate.}
% We intend to construct an energy function $E(\bmx)$ such that: (1) $E(\bmx) \ge 0$, the equality holds iff $\bmx$ is a NE; (2) $\frac{\dd E(\bmx(t))}{\dd t}\le -c_0 E(\bmx(t))$ always holds.

% Combining them, we have $E(\bmx(t)) \le \exp(-c_0 t)E(\bmx(0))$ by standard differential equation analysis, which completes the proof.
%  \end{proof}

% We first show that, if $W$ is so small that the game is close to an individual-interest game, then the NE is unique.

Next, we will present three results of the uniqueness of NE under different conditions.

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_NE_near-individual}

\input{Contents/Proofs/thm_NE_near-individual.tex}

\begin{remark}
\label{rmk:NE:unique:near-individual}
The conditions in \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-individual} intuitively means that the players are close to playing an individual-interest game, \ie, the non-diagonal elements of $W$---those describe the interactions among different players---are small enough. In fact, from the expression of potential $u(\bmx) = \sum_\iinn \gamma_i u_i(\bmx)$, we know that the NE solution is close to the (weighted) social optimal solution.
\end{remark}

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_NE_near-potential}

\begin{remark}
\label{rmk:NE:unique:near-potential}
It's important to note that the conditions specified in \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-potential} intuitively suggest that each element of $W$ closely approximates $1$, and the values derived from the gains ${f_i(k)}_\iinn$ are nearly identical (when scaled). Consequently, the game approaches the characteristics of an identical-interest game, where the players' actions nearly maximize the potential function $u(\bmx) = f(\| \bmx \|_1) - \sum_\iinn \gamma_i c_i(x_i)$.
However, the social welfare is close to $n f(\| \bmx \|_1) - \sum_\iinn \gamma_i c_i(x_i)$, the $\frac{1}{n}$ coefficients on values means that in this case, the free-ride phenomenon can occur.
\end{remark}

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_NE_near-symmetric}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch of \cref{thm:NE:unique:near-symmetric}]
\citet{public-network-direct-BRD:bayer2023best} proved that, when $W$ is symmetric and the cost functions $c_i(x)$s are linear, then the best-response dynamic converges. The insight is that when $c_i(x)$s are linear, each player $i$ has its own marginal cost $c_i$, and the ideal $k_i$ such that $f'_i(k_i) = c_i$. Therefore, each player $i$ plays the best response to her ideal gain $k_i$, and $\phi(\bmx) = \bmk^T \bmx - \frac{1}{2} \bmx^T W \bmx$ becomes a potential function. Moreover, the NE must be unique if $W$ is positive semi-definite.

Our proof follows this insight. We construct the potential function $\phi(\bmx) = \bmk^{*T}\bmx - \frac{1}{2}\bmx^T W^0 \bmx$. Similarly define $y_i(\bmx_{-i})$ as the optimal gain level of player $i$, when the strategy profile of other players is $\bmx_{-i}$. Then the utilities in the near-potential game are, 
\begin{align*}
    \phi_i(\bmx) = y_i(\bmx_{-i}) x_i - \frac{x_i^2}{2} - \sum_\jnei w_{ij} x_i x_j.
\end{align*}
We then prove that: (1) the NE of the near-potential game corresponds to the NE of the original public good game; and (2) the constructed game $\{\phi_i(\bmx)\}_\iinn$ is indeed a near-potential game.
Following these results, the proof can be completed by 
\cref{lem:near-potential}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Theorem \ref{thm:NE:unique:near-symmetric} intuitively suggests that, if $W$ is close to a positive definite matrix $W_0$, as well as that the profit functions $f_i(k)$s are more concave than cost functions $c_i(x)$s, then the NE is unique.
\end{remark}

In addition to these three theorems that establish the uniqueness of the NE, we introduce a concept, called \emph{game equivalence}, which can expand the applicability of these theorems.

\input{Contents/Definitions/game_equivalence}

Intuitively, Definition \ref{def:equivalence} states that if $G^1$ is equivalent to $G^2$, then $G^1$ and $G^2$ are intrinsically the same in terms of linear transformation. Through this insight, we have the following theorem.

\input{Contents/Theorems/thm_NE_equivalence}

From \cref{thm:NE:unique:equivalence},it is evident that the uniqueness property of the NE is preserved within the equivalent class. Therefore, we present the following corollary, which further broadens the class of public goods games that have a unique NE.
