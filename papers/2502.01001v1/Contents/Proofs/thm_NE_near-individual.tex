\begin{proof}
\label{prf:thm:NE:unique:near-individual}
We shall apply \cref{lem:near-potential} to prove this theorem.

Firstly, we construct a near-potential game by  specifying the potential function $u(\bmx)$ and the utilities $u_i(\bmx)$ for all players.

To do this, we let the potential function $u(\bmx) = \sum_\iinn \gamma_i \left( f_i(k_i) - c_i(x_i) \right)$, and specify the utilities $u_i(\bmx)$ in the near-potential game identical to the utilities in the public good game. With some straightforward calculations, we derive that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\pp u_i}{\pp x_i}(\bmx) =& f'_i(k_i) - c'_i(x_i);
    \\
    \frac{\pp u}{\pp x_i}(\bmx) =& \sum_{i' \ne i} \gamma_{i'} f'_{i'}(k_{i'})w_{i'i} + \gamma_i \left( f'_i(k_i) - c'_i(x_i) \right).
\end{align*}

Since $f'_{i'}(k_{i'})$ is $L_0$-Lipschitz on $k_{i'}$, and $k_{i'}$ is $|w_{i'j}|$-Lipschitz on $x_j$, we have $\gamma_{i'} f'_{i'}(k_{i'})$ is $L_0 \gamma_{i'} |w_{i'j}|$-Lipschitz on $x_j$ and $\sum_{i'\ne i} \gamma_{i'} f'_{i'}(k_{i'}) w_{i'i}$ is $ L_0 \sum_{i'\ne i} \gamma_{i'} |w_{i'j} w_{i'i}|$-Lipschitz on $x_j$.

By constructing matrix $\Sigma = \{\sigma_{ij}\}_\ijinn$ with $\sigma_{ij} = L_0 \sum_\knei \gamma_k |w_{ki} w_{kj}|$, we can prove that $u_i(\bmx)$ is $\Sigma$-near-potential respect to $u(\bmx)$.
By \cref{lem:near-potential}, we obtain the result and thus complete the proof.
