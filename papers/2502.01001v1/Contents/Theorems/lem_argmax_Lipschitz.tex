\label{lem:argmax:Lipschitz}
Let function $u(c,x) = g(c,x) + f(x)$ be defined on a bounded, closed, and convex set $X$. Suppose that $g(c,x)$ is concave on $x$, twice differentiable almost everywhere with 
$$\sigma_{max}( \frac{\partial g}{\partial c\partial x} ) \coloneqq \sup_{||r_c|| = ||r_x|| = 1} r_c^T \frac{\partial g}{\partial c\partial x} r_x \le L$$ for some positive real number $L$ and $f(x)$ is an $\alpha$-concave function. We denote the maximum solution of $u(c, x)$ by $x(c) = \arg\max_{x\in X} u(c,x)$. Thus, $x(c)$ not only exists and is unique, but it is also $\frac{2L}{\alpha}$-Lipschitz continuous with respect to $c$.
