\begin{definition}[$\bmaa$-scaled Pseudo-Gradient Ascend Dynamic]
\label{def:BRD}
Let $\{u_i(\bmx)\}_\iinn$ be the utility functions of players in an $n$-player game and $\bmx(0)$ be an arbitrary initial strategy profile. 
Consider a dynamic of players' strategies, called $\bmaa$-scaled pseudo-gradient ascent dynamic, which describes the players' behaviors over time.
The $\bmaa$-scaled pseudo-gradient ascent dynamic
$\bmx(t) = (x_1(t),\dots, x_n(t))$
with updating speed $\bmaa \in \bbR_{++}^n$ (possibly $\bmaa \ne \ones$) is a system of differential equations, defined as
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\dd x_i}{\dd t}(t)
    = \alpha_i \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i}
    (\bmx(t))
    ,\quad \forall \iinn.
\end{align*}
