\begin{definition}[Near-potential Game]
\label{def:near-potential}
    Consider a game containing $n$ players. Denote $x_i \in X_i \subset \bbR$ as the action of player $i$ and $u_i(\bmx)$ as the utility function of player $i$ given the joint action $\bmx$. 

    We say that a game is a $(\bmgg,\Sigma)$-near-potential ($\bmgg \in \bbR_{++}^n, \Sigma\in\bbR_+^{n\times n}$) game \wrt~  a potential function $u(\bmx)$, if for two players $\ijinn$ (it could be $i = j$), we have that $u_i(\bmx)$ is $(\gamma_i, \sigma_{ij})$-close to $u(\bmx)$ on the domain $X_j$, assuming that $\bmx_{-j}$ is fixed, \ie, 
    \begin{align*}
        \gamma_i \frac{\pp u_i}{\pp x_i}(x_j,\bmx_{-j}) - \frac{\pp u}{\pp x_i}(x_j,\bmx_{-j})
    \end{align*}
    is $\sigma_{ij}$-Lipschitz on $x_j$ for all fixed $\bmx_{-j}\in X_{-j}$, where $\Sigma = \{\sigma_{ij}\}_\ijinn$.
