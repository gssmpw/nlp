Plot (a) shows status quo elementary school attendance boundaries; (b) illustrates the demographic distribution of elementary students in the district (darker blue indicates higher concentration of students of color); (c) outlines the algorithm's key decision (assignment) variables, objective function, and constraints; (d) specifies the algorithm's key outputs: a map of merged school attendance boundaries, and expected impacts on segregation in the district, and expected impacts on students' travel times.}}
