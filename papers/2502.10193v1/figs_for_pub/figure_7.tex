% \caption{Scatter plot cross-comparing the effectiveness of the school mergers integration strategy (vertical) with the redrawing school attendance boundaries integration strategy (\parencite{redrawing}, horizontal). The y-axis represents the trade-off in relative change in dissimilarity index versus absolute change in travel time for the mergers strategy ($\Delta D/\Delta T$). The x-axis represents the trade-off in relative change in dissimilarity index versus the proportion of students who would switch schools for the redistricting strategy ($\Delta D/p_{\mathrm{sw}}$). In both cases, a more negative X and Y value is generally more favorable, representing a higher decrease in segregation at lower increase in travel times or students being rezoned, respectively.}
