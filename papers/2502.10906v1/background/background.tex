    \caption{The architectural comparison of three prompt engineering techniques, along with details of the thought nodes. Each thought node includes a reward function ($R$) and a fitness value ($f$), which represent the evaluated score of the contents trained by the agent using the reward function. In the Tree- and Graph-of-Thought methods, the parent node is selected based on the fitness value.}
