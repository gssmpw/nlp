    \caption{The normalized pointwise-mutual information (NPMI) matrices between $k$-means cluster assignments and the {\topics topic annotations} (left) or {\formats format annotations} (right). A score of 0 indicates independence and 1 implies full co-occurrence. We observe that $k$-means clustering based on document embeddings primarily aligns with topic information.}
