    \caption{The implicit domain compositions from quality filtering compared to the corpus distribution for topic domains (left) and format domains (right). We include the RegMix prediction tailored to both MMLU and HellaSwag from \autoref{fig:mixtures_regmix} to facilitate comparison. Numerical values can be found in \autoref{tab:mixtures_weights} in the appendix.}
