    \caption{Frequency statistics of URL domain names in our 200B CommonCrawl corpus. Left: Plotting log document frequency vs. the log rank of the domain name exhibits Zipfian long-tail behavior.
    Middle and right: We list the most common domain names (left) and a random sample of domains between 100-100K documents (right).
    We plot statistics after removing any sub-domains, i.e. \texttt{en.wikipedia.org $\to$ wikipedia.org}.}
