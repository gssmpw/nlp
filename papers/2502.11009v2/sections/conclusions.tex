\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}
This paper analyzes a novel problem of computing inconsistency measures privately. There are many interesting directions for the continuation of this work. This paper shows a naive threshold bound for general DCs that can be improved for better performance of our algorithm. Our proposed conflict graphs algorithm is intractable for the $\drastic$ and $\maxconsistency$ measures that other heuristic or approximation-based approaches may solve in the future. The vertex cover size algorithm using the stable ordering of edges is general purpose and may be used in other problems outside of inconsistency measures. It can also be analyzed further in future work to return the vertex cover set. Another interesting direction is to develop these measures in a multi-relational database setting. Our approach can be extended to multi-relational tables as long as we can create conflict graphs representing the violations. 
However, in the multi-table setting, we must consider additional constraints that require tackling several challenges. In particular, these challenges may arise when we have non-binary or non-anti-monotonic constraints. Non-binary constraints with more than two tuples participating in a constraint lead to hypergraphs, and constraints like foreign key and inclusion constraints are non-anti-monotonic. Thus, they cannot be represented as conflict graphs, and as such, are outside the scope of our work. 
% and need to be considered beyond the conflict graph realm. 
Furthermore, in the context of DP, constraints on multi-relational tables also have implications for defining neighboring datasets and sensitivity that must be carefully considered. Our future work also includes studying the problem of private inconsistency measures with different privacy notions, such as k-anonymity, and using these private inconsistency measures in real-world data cleaning applications.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We proposed a new problem of inconsistency measures for private datasets in the DP setting. We studied five measures and showed that two are intractable with DP, and the others face a significant challenge of high sensitivity. To solve this challenge, we leveraged the dataset's conflict graph and used graph projection and a novel approximate DP vertex cover size algorithm to accurately estimate the private inconsistency measures. We found that parameter selection was a significant challenge and were able to overcome it using optimization techniques based on the constraint set. To test our algorithm, we experimented with five real-world datasets with varying density properties and showed that our algorithm could accurately calculate these measures across all datasets.
