\section{\Ours{} (\ours{}) Environment}

\subsection{Tools}
\label{app:tools}

Previous methods have proposed use of various hand-engineered tools. However, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:tool_comparison}, \ours{} natively supports all these tools.

\subsection{Comparison with Other Environments}

In Table~\ref{tab:env_comparison_pwp}, we compare \ours{} with existing environments across multiple dimensions. We focus on environments designed for software engineering agents as well as those developed for web agents and operating system interaction. Since many prior code agent efforts do not explicitly separate their agent and environment architectures, we evaluate their environments based on their published interfaces (e.g., SWE-Bench, SWE-Bench-MM).
We evaluate environments along the following dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-modal support}: The ability to process diverse input modalities including text, images, video, and audio
    \item \textbf{General action space}: Whether the environment provides a general-purpose interface for tool interaction. For instance, OSWorld, WindowsAgentArena, and BrowserGym enable keyboard/mouse interactions through visual inputs, creating a general action and observation space. In contrast, environments like SWE-Bench and OpenHands restrict interactions to predefined tool-specific APIs. While OpenHands does allow BrowserGym interface, which in turns allows for general action and observation space, the generality is limited to browser interactions and does not apply to other SWE-related tools.
    \item \textbf{Observation space}: The range of environmental states and feedback accessible to an operating agent
    \item \textbf{State Checkpointing}: Native support for preserving file system and process states, a capability unique to \ours{}
    \item \textbf{Tools}: The set of available tools and capabilities accessible to agents
    \item \textbf{Execution-based evaluation}: Use of runtime execution to verify the correctness of agent actions
    \item \textbf{SWE-specific}: Whether the environment is purposefully designed for software engineering tasks
\end{itemize}

While some environments offer general action and observation spaces, they are not specifically designed for software engineering tasks. \Ours{} uniquely combines SWE-specific design with general-purpose interaction capabilities, enabling the development of general-purpose computer-use agents for software engineering.
