    \caption{Comparison between the traditional tool-based paradigm (left) and our proposed \Ours{} (\ours{}) framework (right) for software engineering (SWE) agents. Instead of relying on specialized hand-engineered tools, \ours{} enables agents to interact directly with an IDE through basic computer interactions and screen observations. The framework naturally allows agents to take advantage of existing IDE capabilities across multiple languages and tools. Furthermore, \bench{} is a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate agent performance across different SWE domains.}
