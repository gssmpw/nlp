\section{Literature Review: }
Notable connections of LLM with psychology began with the advent of models such as GPT-3 **Brown et al., "Language Models Play High-Stakes Cognitive and Strategic Games a Few Questions to 3 Million People"**. Various perspectives of psychology are infused to understand behaviours from multiple dimensions such as emotion, cognition **Dolan et al., "Understanding events: From description to comprehension"** , Theory-of-Mind, and morality **Wellman et al., "From Simple Desires About Pictures and Objects: Intention and Action as Foundational Domains of Human Reasoning and Learning"**. Identifying personality traits has been one of the main emphasises in the field of study **Costa et al., "Personality in Adulthood: A Six-Year Longitudinal Study on the Conscientiousness-Health Relationship"**. Psychometric tools such as IPIP-NEO-120  **Gunturkun et al., "The Inventory for Interpersonal Problems (IIP): Structure, Reliability and Validity of a German Version"**, Big Five Inventory (BFI)  **John et al., "Handbook of Research Methods in Psychology"**, are predominantly used in the literature to assess the five dimensions of personality mentioned above.

Variations in prompts and the use of role-playing agents have been impersonated in several studies to study different personality behaviours in LLMs  **Vazire et al., "On the Other Side of the Mirror: Introspection and Person Perception in Self-Enhancement Motivation"**. The major aim behind these studies was to assess whether the behaviour is consistent or changing across different simulated situations. Context-sensitive variations were observed for several scenarios  **Merritt et al., "The Development of a Measure of Social Cognition: Factor Analysis of the Social Problem-Solving Inventory"**. Jiang et al.  **Jiang et al., "Improving Personality Prediction with Deep Learning and Data Integration"** used personality prompting methods to induce and tailor the personality of LLMs according to the dynamic needs of the tests. This also draws attention to the need to enforce ethical factors for LLMs to create a safe and moderated environment for users.

A limited number of LLMs and personality traits sharing the same domain in the literature restrict the scope of analysis. The small sample size at this exploratory stage could impact the validity of results across models. A significant concern is the use of these tests in their original form, raising the risk of training data contamination and potential bias due to the sequential nature of questions within the same Big Five Personality dimension  **Hough et al., "A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire"**.
