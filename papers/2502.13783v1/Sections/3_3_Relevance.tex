This tutorial is highly relevant to the Web Conference themes of user modeling, personalization, and recommendation. Previous tutorials, such as those at RecSys'23 \cite{hua2023tutorial} and WWW'24 \cite{zhang2024large}, have explored using large language models (LLMs) to enhance traditional recommendation systems, focusing mainly on their applications. In contrast, our tutorial not only summarizes the latest advancements in LLM-enhanced recommendations but also systematically introduces, for the first time, the design of generative large recommendation models that adhere to scaling laws. Our content is broader, more cutting-edge, and addresses a wider range of challenges than previous tutorials. Given its strong relevance to the Web Conference, the significant recent achievements in this field, and the comprehensive and innovative nature of our tutorial, we anticipate it will attract considerable attention.
