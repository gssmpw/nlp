% Gee (2019) analyzes the effect of revealing information about the number of prior applicants in job opportunities listed on LinkedIn. The author finds that, under the information about the competition level, the probability that the applicant completes an application process increases.
% Gee (2019) paper presents the results from a 2.3-million-person ﬁeld experiment thatvaries whether or not a job seeker sees the number of applicants for a job posting on a largejob-posting website, LinkedIn. This intervention increases the likelihood that a person willﬁnish an application by 3.5%. Women have a larger increase in their likelihood of ﬁnishingan application than men. Overall, adding this information to a job posting may oﬀer alight-touch way to both increase application rates and alter the diversity of the applicant pool.

% They define labor market as "congested" if if some employers receive more applications than they are willing or able to screen profitably. Congestion is inefficient if overall welfare could be improved by redistributing applications from congested job openings to non-congested ones.
