\section{Conclusion}
We propose a new model for causal discovery in the multi-view linear-DAG case. Surprisingly, we show that the model is fully identifiable even with Gaussian disturbances. The only thing that is needed is that the variances of the disturbances have some weak variability over the views. The results rely on a little-known framework for multi-view ICA \citep{richard2021sharedica,anderson2013multiviewidentifiability}. We develop algorithms that either use the covariance structure only, or automatically use both non-Gaussianity or the Gaussian covariance structure. Results on brain imaging data are promising.
