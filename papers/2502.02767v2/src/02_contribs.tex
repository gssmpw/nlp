\textbf{Contributions and outline.}
\label{sec:contributions}

Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textcolor{black}{(1)}] We define \emph{deception} in the context of computer science research and identify different scenarios of \emph{who}, \emph{by what means}, \emph{to whom}, and \emph{to what ends} (\Cref{sec:methods}).
\item[\textcolor{black}{(2)}] We identify how %popular 
computer science and security research methods engage in various forms of deception (\Cref{sec:taxonomy}).
\item[\textcolor{black}{(3)}] We discuss how deceptive aspects of computer security research relate to fraud in a U.S. context, and situate this new concern in the broader state of legal concerns in computer security
(\Cref{sec:law}).
\item[\textcolor{black}{(4)}] We articulate ethical standards that can guide the future of computer security research that employs deception as a part of its methodology (\Cref{sec:ethics}).
