%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting

% Sometimes research (especially in specific fields like security) runs into barriers from the law.  Examples include CFAA, DMCA, and ____ and their impact on the fields of ___, ___.  In some cases, the law itself or charging policies have carveouts that allow that research to proceed in circumstances deemed reasonable (e.g. DMCA's researcher carveout for security research from 200X, or DoJ's policy not to prosecute security researchers).

% [Section 4] Our contribution is that there's a particular category of these laws that is very under-examined in at least in the computer science context, and that's anti-fraud laws. [MX]

% [Section 4] We support this by talking at a high level about the research we were trying to do + related recent work in security and ML. [MX] 

% [Section 5] But we also think fraud laws are relevant to A, B, and C other kinds of research. [AS]

% [See Table 1 to see categories of research, the laws they implicate, and how those fields + laws have modified each other to allow reasonable carveouts]

% Since problems X and Y with anti-fraud laws are similar to issues faced in law Z, we generally think similar mitigation strategies L, M, and O would be good ways to address problems X and Y in the anti-fraud context in addition to the Z context.

% However, fraud also has separate issues that do not appear in most DMCA,CFAA, etc research, especially the possible (though unlikely) legal liability of human study participants.  To address those problems, and guided by ethical research principles, we think it's worth exploring P, Q, or R, as potential avenues.
