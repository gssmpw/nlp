\section{Experimental Setup} \label{exp}

For the retrospective experiments, hourly heat consumption data from 2016 to 2020 for three DMAs from a Danish utility is used and actual observations in-place weather forecast. Apart from historical demand data at lags $24$, and $168$, maximum temperature, feels-like temperature, day of week encoded using sine and cosine function, along with their trend, seasonality and residuals components form the feature set. Experiments are conducted across three DL models. An LSTM model with four layers and 32 hidden units is the baseline for comparing the adopted wavelet scalogram-based model $F$ and modified model $F^{'}$. The entire year of 2019 is used for testing, while the rest follows a 80:20 training-validation split. Additional experimental settings are described in Appendix \ref{exps}.
