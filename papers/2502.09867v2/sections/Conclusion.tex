\section{CONCLUSION}
In this work, we introduced \toolname{}, a generative AI system that empowers novice designers through dimensional scaffolding, encouraging broader design exploration and more nuanced prompt creation. Our findings demonstrate that \toolname{} led to significantly longer and more nuanced prompts, which produced more semantically diverse image output. It also better enabled participants to discover and adopt new design dimensions. Compared to a baseline, \toolname{} users produced more unique design terms and exhibited greater confidence in navigating complex design challenges. They engaged in richer creative processes, integrating both more predefined and custom tags to refine their designs iteratively. This suggests that dimensional scaffolding can effectively bridge the gap between novice and expert design strategies, offering a powerful tool for enhancing creative workflows.
