We thank our shepherd, Adam Morrison, and anonymous reviewers of ASPLOS 2025 for their valuable feedback.
SMaCk is reported to Intel and AMD security incident teams, and AMD published a security bulletin (AMD-SB-7024). We also reported the security bug in the OpenSSL library to the OpenSSL community.
