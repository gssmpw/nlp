\section{Threat Model}\label{sec:Threat Model}
In our threat model, we consider unprivileged attackers, targeting a victim running in the sibling thread of the same physical core through hyper-threading to leak sensitive information such as private keys, passwords, or secrets in the victim's memory. The processor pipeline is shared between two threads with microarchitectural units (L1i cache, TLB, execution ports) and the attacker can create SMC snippets with the available instructions in the targeted microarchitecture. We assume that the victim system has no exploitable vulnerabilities except the ones described hereafter.
