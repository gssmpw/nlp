\section*{Impact Statement}

This work aims to advance the field of Machine Learning by introducing \benchmark{}, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the context of text-based role-playing games. The development of \benchmark{} has potential societal implications related to the deployment of LLMs in interactive and narrative-driven applications, including fostering more immersive and engaging gaming experiences.

Ethical considerations include ensuring that LLMs evaluated and fine-tuned using \benchmark{} adhere to principles of fairness and inclusivity, particularly in the portrayal of characters and narratives. Misuse of the benchmark to develop systems that propagate harmful biases or enforce stereotypical characterizations is a concern that developers should address when applying this work. Additionally, the use of LLMs as evaluative judges raises questions about transparency, reliability, and the potential for unintended bias in automated assessments.

By encouraging further research on hybrid evaluation methods that combine subjective LLM-based judgments with objective scoring mechanisms, this work contributes to ongoing discussions about improving the accountability and robustness of machine learning systems in creative and interactive domains.
