\section*{Ethical Considerations}

We acknowledge the environmental impact of the benchmark that stems from the compute needed across tasks. As such, emissions tracking is added using codecarbon \citep{benoit_courty_2024_11171501} to measure kilograms of CO$_2$-equivalents (CO$_2eq$) and estimate the carbon footprint per task. The benchmark is a collaborative project and contains datasets of different data quality and origin. Thus, additional efforts are still required to identify and minimize biases in the benchmark datasets.
