\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}

We list the contributions of every author in \autoref{tab:contributions}. The possible types of contributions and their associated points are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{New dataset:} A new dataset includes creating a new implementation (subclass) of a task using a new dataset. 2 points were awarded for implementing the task and 4 points for each new language introduced by the task. 
\item \textbf{New task:} An implementation of a new task category such as multi-label classification or instruction retrieval. 2 points were given for a new task, as well as points following adding a new dataset.
\item \textbf{Annotations:} Many existing datasets were not yet annotated with proper metadata. To encourage high-quality annotations we awarded 1 point for each full dataset annotation.
\item \textbf{Fixes:} These included bug fixes, usability fixes, speed improvements and more. For these, we typically awarded 2-10 points depending on the size of the contribution.
\item \textbf{Running Models:} This includes both running and implementing models for MMTEB. We typically awarded 1 point per model run on a full set of relevant tasks. Relevant tasks for a specific model are limited to those pertinent to its language. For instance, a Russian model does not need to be run on French tasks.
\item \textbf{Review PR:} A large part of ensuring good dataset quality comes from the dataset review. We award 2 points for a review. If a PR had multiple reviewers, 2 points were awarded to each. Often reviewers finalized dataset additions, helped with data formatting, and resolving bugs. In many cases, adding 2 points for review was considered either too low (a perfect PR with little to no corrections) or too high (lengthy discussion examining dataset quality, debugging implementations and more), however on average we believe it was appropriate.
\item \textbf{Writing:} At this point many of the authors writing the paper already qualified for co-authorship and thus had reasonable experience with the MMTEB point system. Thus, it was generally possible to discuss a reasonable amount of points based on the efforts made in earlier stages.
\item \textbf{Coordination:} Included Coordination of contributors and initial ideation were given points at the end of the project based on relative effort. These points were given, similar to paper writing, based on relative effort.
\end{itemize}

A total of 10 points had to be obtained to be invited as a co-author. To see each contribution mapped to specific PRs, see \url{https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb/tree/main/docs/mmteb/points}, where the name of JSON files corresponds to the PR id.
