\caption{Qualitative results. The sample images are from the \emph{val} set of MS-COCO~\citep{caesar2018coco} for instance segmentation, and are from the \emph{val} set of ADE20K~\citep{zhou2017scene} for semantic segmentation.
``w/o Conv'' denotes that the Conv branch is not used in the experiments.
``20K'' and ``MM'' refers to the backbone network being pre-trained on ImageNet-22k~\citep{steiner2021train} and Multi-Modal~\citep{zhu2022uni}, respectively.}
