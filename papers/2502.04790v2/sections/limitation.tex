\section{Limitation}
\label{sec:limitation}
Despite the significant reduction in token cost achieved by $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$, our method has several limitations. First, the reduction in token cost exhibits variability depending on the consistency of agent responses. When agents' answers differ significantly, the efficiency gains are limited, whereas more consistent responses yield a greater reduction in token cost. This variability introduces an element of unpredictability to the system's overall efficiency.
Second, the judge module in $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$ is sometimes unable to filter out redundant viewpoints. The module relies on keyword extraction using regular expressions to determine whether agents' outputs convey the same idea. However, when agents express similar views with different wording or synonyms, the judge module may fail to detect these similarities, resulting in redundant exchanges of information. This can undermine the potential gains in efficiency and contribute to token cost redundancy.
Therefore, there remains room for improvement in optimizing the token cost of $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$. 
%Future work could explore more advanced natural language understanding techniques or semantic analysis methods to improve the judge module's ability to accurately assess redundancy beyond simple keyword matching.
