\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we identified the issue of redundant viewpoints among agents in Multi-agent Debate (MAD). To address this, we proposed \textbf{S}elective \textbf{S}parse \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{D}ebate (\({\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}}\)), a novel strategy designed to reduce token cost by selectively incorporating non-redundant viewpoints from different agents, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of information exchange and debate.
Our theoretical analysis verify the effectiveness of $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$, and extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$ can significantly reduce token cost in MAD while maintaining competitive performance.
For future work, we aim to refine $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$ by further optimizing the identification and condensation of non-redundant viewpoints between agents, with the goal of further reducing token cost and enhancing efficiency. Additionally, exploring methods to increase the diversity of thought among agents will be key to improving the overall accuracy of $\text{S}^2\text{-MAD}$.
