In this paper, we systematically study how to enhance the logical reasoning ability of LLMs by addressing their limitations in reasoning order variations. We introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on the principles of independency and commutativity in logical reasoning. Our method involves shuffling independent premises to introduce order variations and constructing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to identify valid step reorderings while preserving logical dependency. Extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLMsâ€™ reasoning performance and their adaptability to diverse logical structures.
