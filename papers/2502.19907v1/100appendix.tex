\subsection{Details of Generating Solutions} 
\label{sec:appendix_1}
In Sec. \ref{sec:Answer order Augmentation}, 
We discuss how to generate step-by-step solutions through \( D = \{P, C, L\} \). Specifically, we follow these steps:

(1) For datasets that do not have first-order logic (FOL) expressions, such as RuleTaker and LogicNLI, we extract their premises and conclusions, and use GPT-4o-mini with prompts as shown in Tab. \ref{tab:100prompt_FOL} to convert them into corresponding FOL representations. FOLIO, on the other hand, already includes FOL expressions, so no conversion is required.

(2) The FOL-enhanced premises and ground truth labels are input into the model, prompting it to generate step-by-step solutions. As shown in the prompt in Tab. \ref{tab:100prompt_cot}, we add two domain-specific examples from each dataset to the prompt, requiring the model to clearly define the purpose and reasoning for each step, eventually leading to the final conclusion. The Task prompt specifies the possible values for the label. Specifically, in FOLIO, the label values are \{True, False, Unknown\}, in RuleTaker they are \{entailment, not entailment\}, and in LogicNLI they are \{entailment, neutral, self\_contradiction, contradiction\}.

(3) The model then reprocesses the generated solutions, using prompts like the one shown in Tab. \ref{tab:100prompt_DAG}, to extract the premise indices and premise step indices used in each reasoning step.

\subsection{Kendall Tau Distance}

In our study, we investigate the effects of premise order transformations by using the Kendall tau distance \( \tau \). This coefficient measures the correlation between two ordered lists, providing a quantitative way to assess how much one order differs from another. We use \( \tau \) to categorize various permutations of premise orders and assess their impact on model performance.

The Kendall tau coefficient \( \tau \) is calculated as follows:
\[
\tau = \frac{C - D}{\binom{n}{2}}
\]
where \( C \) is the number of concordant pairs (pairs of items that are in the same relative order in both lists), and \( D \) is the number of discordant pairs (pairs that are in opposite order in both lists). The total number of possible pairs is \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of items being compared.

We divide \( \tau \) values into 10 groups, each spanning a 0.2 range within the interval [-1, 1). A \( \tau \) value of 1 indicates that the order of the premises is exactly as required for the reasoning process, while -1 indicates a complete reversal of order. A \( \tau \) value of 0 indicates that the order is completely random, with no correlation to the original sequence.

For example, if the original premise order is \( [P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots, P_n] \), a permutation function \( \sigma \) might rearrange it to \( [P_3, P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n] \). This process allows us to explore different levels of order perturbation, with the goal of analyzing how such variations affect model performance. Examples of premise orders corresponding to different \( \tau \) values can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:tau}.
