Our work primarily focuses on logical commutativity within propositional reasoning tasks. However, this property extends beyond these tasks. It is also prevalent in many other reasoning scenarios, such as mathematical problems and other logic-based tasks. This remains an area for future exploration. Additionally, while we have explored the impact of condition order and answer order augmentations on model performance, how to further integrate and refine these augmentations for better logical reasoning capability is still an open question. We believe our exploration will provide valuable insights for future work on logical equivalence and commutativity in reasoning.
