We have carefully revised our manuscript, taking all the comments and suggestions into consideration. Point-for-point responses are shown as follows.

\quad (a) For Abstract, Sections 1 and 2: we have revised some contents for better presentation of the contribution
of our work.

\quad (b) For Section 3: 1) we have added the description regarding the viewport extraction in the JUFE dataset; 2) we have revised some descriptions for precise representation of the proposed method.

\quad (c) For Section 4: 1) we have added the formulations regarding the evaluation metrics; 2) we have added the ablation studies of the backbone; 3) we have discussed the advantages and limitations of the proposed model and added a figure for better presentation.

\quad (d) Finally, we have double-checked the whole manuscript and made other necessary revisions to the manuscript.

% \quad (b) For Section 2: 1) we have removed some sentences and references for ensuring compliance with the page and reference limits; 2) we have added two references published recently in the Pattern Recognition. 

% \quad (c) Finally, we have double-checked the whole manuscript and made other necessary revisions to the manuscript.

\quad Thank you very much for consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
