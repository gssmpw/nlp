This study explores the application of Vision Transformer (ViT) principles in audio analysis, specifically focusing on heart sounds. This paper introduces \textit{ENACT-Heart} -- a novel ensemble approach that leverages the complementary strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ViT through a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 97.52\%. This outperforms the individual contributions of ViT (93.88\%) and CNN (95.45\%), demonstrating the potential for enhanced diagnostic accuracy in cardiovascular health monitoring. These results demonstrate the potential of ensemble methods in enhancing classification performance for cardiovascular health monitoring and diagnosis.
