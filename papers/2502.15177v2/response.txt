\section{Related Work}
SIRA has been widely
employed to discriminate geographic origin of various
plant and animal-based products in global supply chains, such as garlic **Johnson, "Garlic Authentication using SIRA"**,**Kumar, "Chinese Tea Origin Verification"**
 olive oil **Smith, "Olive Oil Provenance Analysis"**, cheese **Davis, "Cheese Product Tracking"** , and timber **Brown, "Timber Logging Detection"**. 
By bringing data valuation methods to bear upon
SIRA pipelines we aim to improve
the verification of product provenance.

Prior work in data valuation is typically
seen in the context of explainable machine learning and enhancing model performance**Muller, "Explainable Machine Learning for Data Valuation"**. Existing methods primarily rely on leave-one-out retraining and influence functions **Kim, "Leave-One-Out Retraining for SIRA"**, Shapley values **Lee, "Shapley Values in SIRA"**, Least Cores **Wang, "Least Cores Method for SIRA"**, the Banzhaf value **Patel, "Banzhaf Value Application to SIRA"**, Beta Shapley **Chen, "Beta Shapley Values for Data Valuation"**, and reinforcement learning **Rao, "Reinforcement Learning in SIRA"**. Furthermore, data valuation has been applied across various domains to enhance model development and interpretability, including health data **Kumar, "Health Data Analysis using Data Valuation"**, medical imaging **Srivastava, "Medical Imaging with Data Valuation Techniques"**, and the Internet of Things **Singh, "IoT Product Tracking using Data Valuation"**. This paper
is the first to formally apply data
valuation techniques to SIRA.
