\section{Related Work}
SIRA has been widely
employed to discriminate geographic origin of various
plant and animal-based products in global supply chains, such as garlic \cite{pianezze_geographical_2019}, Chinese tea \cite{liu_c_2020}, olive oil \cite{bontempo_characterisation_2019}, cheese \cite{camin_application_2004}, and timber \cite{mortier2024framework, truszkowski2025}. 
By bringing data valuation methods to bear upon
SIRA pipelines we aim to improve
the verification of product provenance.

Prior work in data valuation is typically
seen in the context of explainable machine learning and enhancing model performance~\cite{wu2024data, covert2024stochastic}. Existing methods primarily rely on leave-one-out retraining and influence functions \cite{koh2017understanding}, Shapley values \cite{jia2019towards, ghorbani2019data, shapley_jia_wang2023note}, Least Cores \cite{yan2021if}, the Banzhaf value \cite{banzhaf_wang2022data}, Beta Shapley \cite{kwon2021beta}, and reinforcement learning \cite{yoon2020data}. Furthermore, data valuation has been applied across various domains to enhance model development and interpretability, including health data \cite{health_pandl2021trustworthy}, medical imaging \cite{medical_image_tang2021data}, and the Internet of Things \cite{iot_shi2024data}. This paper
is the first to formally apply data
valuation techniques to SIRA.
