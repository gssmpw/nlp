	abstract = {European law requires a designation of origin for virgin and extra virgin olive oils (at least in terms of EU/nonEU provenance). Stable isotope ratios have been successfully applied to determine the geographical origin of olive oils, but never to distinguish EU and non-EU oils. In this study 2H/1H, 13C/12C and 18O/16O ratios were analysed in bulk olive oils using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) as well as 13C/12C and 2H/1H in the four main fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids) using IRMS coupled with GC. The isotopic composition of olive oils was successfully used to distinguish samples originating in the two areas. Speciﬁcally, when bulk data were combined with fatty acid isotopic data the diﬀerentiation power of the method improved clearly. This separation is due to the speciﬁc isotopic ﬁngerprint of the individual countries making up the EU and non-EU samples.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope ratio analysis of the major bioelements (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ34S), considered for the ﬁrst time as a whole, was used to attempt a geographical characterization of red garlic (Allium sativum L.) cultivated throughout diﬀerent Italian territories (Abruzzo, Lazio and Sicily). Up to now, no oﬃcial methods are available to determine the geographical origin of this type of product. In this context, the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry method (IRMS) represents a powerful analytical technique. The characteristic ranges of variability of the ﬁve isotope ratios in 56 red Italian garlic samples are here presented as well as their relationships. The geographical origin has some inﬂuence over the diﬀerent ratios, although their data distribution shows some overlap when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. In spite of the relative closeness of the sampling sites, a model with very good predictive performance of the geographical classiﬁcation was achieved byLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) method. Moreover, preliminary class modelling based on Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) supports the ability of stable isotope ratios analysis for the geographical traceability of garlic.},

	abstract = {In this work, the potential of C, N, H, O and mineral element stable isotope ratios and chemometric methods as a tool to ﬁrst authenticate Chinese tea according to their blend raw materials was examined. Forty-four multielemental stable isotope ratios of four batches of Chongqing tuo tea (n = 27 for each batch) were determined by the EA-IRMS and ICP-MS methods. The clustering results of HCA and PCA were worse than that of PLS-DA, BPANN, and LDA. The PLS-DA model displayed good model performance (R2X = 0.57, R2Y = 0.74, and Q2 = 0.653). By BP-ANN, the total correct authentication rates for model training and external validation were 100\% and 91.2\%, respectively. The best performance was obtained by LDA, the total correct authentication rates for model training, cross-validation and external validation were 100\%, 100\% and 96.9\%, respectively. δ2H, δ18O, 98Mo/95Mo, 96Mo/95Mo, and 98Mo/96Mo were markers for enabling the accurate authentication of Chongqing tuo tea according to formulas. This study has contributed toward generalizing the use of multielemental stable isotope ratio ﬁngerprinting as a promising tool for testing the authenticity of tea worldwide.},

	abstract = {Virtually all elements of biological interest have multiple stable isotopic forms and the fractionation events associated with biological and physical processes help to create spatial and temporal variations in isotopic abundance that can be used to understand the dynamics of ecological systems. Stable isotope ratio analyses at natural abundance levels can provide integrated information on ecosystem functioning, such as variations in water-use activities by different elements within an ecosystem (Ehleringer et al. 1993; Dawson and Ehleringer 1998). Stable isotope ratio analyses do not provide information on water flux rates through the ecosystem, but instead they help constrain the analysis of flux data, such as through identifying those specific soil layers that are the source of current moisture use by the vegetation or the ratio of carbon dioxide-to-water (CO2-to-H2O) flux.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the oxygen isotope ratio of tree-ring cellulose is a valuable tool that can be used as a paleoclimate proxy. Our ability to use this tool has gone through different phases. The first began in the 1970s with the demonstration of empirical relationships between the oxygen isotope ratio of tree-ring cellulose and climate. These empirical relationships, however, did not provide us with the confidence that they are robust through time, across taxa and across geographical locations. The second phase began with a rudimentary understanding of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the oxygen isotope ratios of cellulose, which is necessary to increase the power of this tool. This phase culminated in a mechanistic tree-ring model integrating concepts of physiology and biochemistry in a whole-plant system. This model made several assumptions about leaf water isotopic enrichment and biochemistry which, in the nascent third phase, are now being challenged, with surprising results. These third-phase results suggest that, contrary to the model assumption, leaf temperature across a large latitudinal gradient is remarkably constant and does not follow ambient temperature. Recent findings also indicate that the biochemistry responsible for the incorporation of the cellulose oxygen isotopic signature is not as simple as has been assumed. Interestingly, the results of these challenges have strengthened the tree-ring model. There are several other assumptions that can be investigated which will improve the utility of the tree-ring model.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes are a powerful research tool in environmental sciences and their use in ecosystem research is increasing. In this review we introduce and discuss the relevant details underlying the use of carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions in ecosystem gas exchange research. The current use and potential developments of stable isotope measurements together with concentration and flux measurements of CO2 and water vapor are emphasized. For these applications it is critical to know the isotopic identity of specific ecosystem components such as the isotopic composition of CO2, organic matter, liquid water, and water vapor, as well as the associated isotopic fractionations, in the soil-plant- atmosphere system. Combining stable isotopes and concentration measurements is very effective through the use of ”Keeling plots.” This approach allows the identification of the isotopic composition and the contribution of ecosystem, or ecosystem components, to the exchange fluxes with the atmosphere. It also allows the estimation of net ecosystem discrimination and soil disequilibrium effects. Recent modifications of the Keeling plot approach permit examination of CO2 recycling in ecosystems. Combining stable isotopes with dynamic flux measurements requires precision in isotopic sampling and analysis, which is currently at the limit of detection. Combined with the micrometeorological gradient approach (applicable mostly in grasslands and crop fields), stable isotope measurements allow separation of net CO2 exchange into photosynthetic and soil respiration components, and the evapotranspiration flux into soil evaporation and leaf transpiration. Similar applications in conjunction with eddy correlation techniques (applicable to forests, in addition to grasslands and crop fields) are more demanding, but can potentially be applied in combination with the Keeling plot relationship. The advance and potential in using stable isotope measurements should make their use a standard component in the limited arsenal of ecosystem-scale research tools.},
