	abstract = {European law requires a designation of origin for virgin and extra virgin olive oils (at least in terms of EU/nonEU provenance). Stable isotope ratios have been successfully applied to determine the geographical origin of olive oils, but never to distinguish EU and non-EU oils. In this study 2H/1H, 13C/12C and 18O/16O ratios were analysed in bulk olive oils using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) as well as 13C/12C and 2H/1H in the four main fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids) using IRMS coupled with GC. The isotopic composition of olive oils was successfully used to distinguish samples originating in the two areas. Speciﬁcally, when bulk data were combined with fatty acid isotopic data the diﬀerentiation power of the method improved clearly. This separation is due to the speciﬁc isotopic ﬁngerprint of the individual countries making up the EU and non-EU samples.},

	abstract = {In this work, the potential of C, N, H, O and mineral element stable isotope ratios and chemometric methods as a tool to ﬁrst authenticate Chinese tea according to their blend raw materials was examined. Forty-four multielemental stable isotope ratios of four batches of Chongqing tuo tea (n = 27 for each batch) were determined by the EA-IRMS and ICP-MS methods. The clustering results of HCA and PCA were worse than that of PLS-DA, BPANN, and LDA. The PLS-DA model displayed good model performance (R2X = 0.57, R2Y = 0.74, and Q2 = 0.653). By BP-ANN, the total correct authentication rates for model training and external validation were 100\% and 91.2\%, respectively. The best performance was obtained by LDA, the total correct authentication rates for model training, cross-validation and external validation were 100\%, 100\% and 96.9\%, respectively. δ2H, δ18O, 98Mo/95Mo, 96Mo/95Mo, and 98Mo/96Mo were markers for enabling the accurate authentication of Chongqing tuo tea according to formulas. This study has contributed toward generalizing the use of multielemental stable isotope ratio ﬁngerprinting as a promising tool for testing the authenticity of tea worldwide.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope ratio analysis of the major bioelements (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ34S), considered for the ﬁrst time as a whole, was used to attempt a geographical characterization of red garlic (Allium sativum L.) cultivated throughout diﬀerent Italian territories (Abruzzo, Lazio and Sicily). Up to now, no oﬃcial methods are available to determine the geographical origin of this type of product. In this context, the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry method (IRMS) represents a powerful analytical technique. The characteristic ranges of variability of the ﬁve isotope ratios in 56 red Italian garlic samples are here presented as well as their relationships. The geographical origin has some inﬂuence over the diﬀerent ratios, although their data distribution shows some overlap when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. In spite of the relative closeness of the sampling sites, a model with very good predictive performance of the geographical classiﬁcation was achieved byLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) method. Moreover, preliminary class modelling based on Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) supports the ability of stable isotope ratios analysis for the geographical traceability of garlic.},
