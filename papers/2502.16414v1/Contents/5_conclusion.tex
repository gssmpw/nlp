\section{Conclusion}
%\vspace{-.1pt}
This work proposes \modelname, an ICL framework for tabular data generation with LLMs. It steer the LLM's prior distribution towards real data distribution by iteratively retrieving the most under-represented regions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its potential to enhance LLM-based synthetic data generation across various domains.
