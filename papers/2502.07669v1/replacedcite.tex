Besides clustering with outliers, researchers have extensively explored coresets for various other clustering variants. 
Two particularly interesting variants are clustering with capacity constraints
and clustering with fairness constraints, both of which have been investigated in____ for coreset constructions.
Notably, the coresets for both these variants can be reduced to an assignment-preserving coreset____, for which several studies apply a hierarchical sampling framework____ to construct small-sized coresets with assignment-preserving properties____. Recently, Huang et al.____ introduced a general unified model to capture a wide range of clustering problems with general assignment constraints, including clustering with fairness/capacity constraints, clustering with outliers (which we consider), and a fault-tolerant variant of clustering____.


Coresets for other variants of clustering have also been considered, including projective clustering____, clustering with missing values____, ordered-weighted clustering____, and line clustering____.
