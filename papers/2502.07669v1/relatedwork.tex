Besides clustering with outliers, researchers have extensively explored coresets for various other clustering variants. 
Two particularly interesting variants are clustering with capacity constraints
and clustering with fairness constraints, both of which have been investigated in~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/Chierichetti0LV17, DBLP:conf/waoa/0001SS19, DBLP:conf/nips/HuangJV19,Cohen-Addad2019Fixed-Parameter,DBLP:conf/icalp/BandyapadhyayFS21, Braverman22Power} for coreset constructions.
Notably, the coresets for both these variants can be reduced to an assignment-preserving coreset~\cite{DBLP:conf/waoa/0001SS19, DBLP:conf/nips/HuangJV19}, for which several studies apply a hierarchical sampling framework~\cite{Chen09OnCoresets} to construct small-sized coresets with assignment-preserving properties~\cite{DBLP:conf/icalp/BandyapadhyayFS21, Braverman22Power}. Recently, Huang et al.~\cite{Huang2023General} introduced a general unified model to capture a wide range of clustering problems with general assignment constraints, including clustering with fairness/capacity constraints, clustering with outliers (which we consider), and a fault-tolerant variant of clustering~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/KhullerPS00}.


Coresets for other variants of clustering have also been considered, including projective clustering~\cite{Feldman11unified,FeldmanSS20Turning,DBLP:conf/aistats/Tukan0ZBF22}, clustering with missing values~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/BravermanJKW21}, ordered-weighted clustering~\cite{DBLP:conf/icml/BravermanJKW19}, and line clustering~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/MaromF19, DBLP:conf/nips/LotanSF22}.
