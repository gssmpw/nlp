Example Input: \\
\#\#\# Question: \\
Which element has the atomic number 6? \\
\#\#\# Options: \\
A) Nitrogen \quad B) Oxygen \quad C) Carbon \quad D) Helium \\

\#\#\# Person 1's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: C \\
Explanation: Carbon is the element with atomic number 6, well-known for being the basis of organic chemistry. \\

\#\#\# Person 2's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: A \\
Explanation: Nitrogen is important for life on Earth, making up a large portion of the atmosphere. \\

\#\#\# Reviewer 1's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: C \\
Explanation: Person 1 accurately states that Carbon has the atomic number 6. This explanation is correct and directly addresses the question. Carbon is indeed a fundamental element in organic chemistry. \\

\#\#\# Reviewer 2's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: C \\
Explanation: Person 1 has correctly identified Carbon as the element with atomic number 6. Their explanation is scientifically accurate and directly answers the question. \\

\#\#\# Judger 1's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: C \\
Explanation: Based on Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2's critique, Person 1's explanation is indeed correct. Nitrogen (A) does not have atomic number 6, so Person 2's response is invalid. I agree with Person 1's answer. \\

\#\#\# Judger 2's Response: \\
Chosen Answer: C \\
Explanation: After considering Reviewer 2’s feedback and Judger 1's decision, it is clear that Carbon (C) is the correct answer. Person 1’s explanation holds up against the reviewers' critique. I agree with Person 1’s answer. \\

Example Output: \\
Explanation: \\
- Both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 agree that Person 1's explanation is scientifically accurate, and Judger 1 and Judger 2 both reaffirm this conclusion. Based on this consensus, Person 1’s explanation aligns with the correct answer. \\
Answer: C
