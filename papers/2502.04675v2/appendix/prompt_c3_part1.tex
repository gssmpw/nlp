\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=cyan!40!black, title=\textbf{Prompt for $C^3$ Generation (Part 1)}]
You are given a multiple-choice question, along with responses from two individuals, Person 1 and Person 2, their explanations, evaluations from two reviewers (Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2), and now evaluations of reviewers from two additional judges (Judger 1 and Judger 2). Your task is to identify which answer is correct, based on judges' explanations and the final evaluations from the judges. Follow this structure for your response:\\

- Explanation of Choice: Based on the information provided by judges, compare both explanations and determine which one aligns better with the correct answer. Start with `Explanation: `. Consider both the critiques from Judger 1 and Judger 2.\\
- Analysis of Reviewer Evaluations: Evaluate the critiques provided by Judger 1 and Judger 2. Discuss their reasoning and whether it aligns with the correct answer. Consider whether Judger 1 and Judger 2's decisions reflect the validity of these critiques.\\
- Answer: On a separate line, start with `Answer: `, stating your final chosen option (A, B, C, or D) only, without any additional text.\\
