\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-4pt}
In this work we presented the task of personalized recommendation with set-theoretic queries. We discussed how this problem can be viewed as set-theoretic matrix completion, and why the common approach of logistic matrix factorization is not aligned with the set-theoretic operations we wish to perform at inference time.
% As such, we formulated an approach to set-theoretic matrix completion using box embeddings, and applied this to the task of recommendation.
We observed substantial improvements over the vector/neural baselines when using box embeddings as the representation, validating our intuition regarding the necessary set-theoretic bias.
% Additional ablations and analysis of the box embedding model substantiates our claims that the improvements come from reduced error compounding (compared to the filtered version) and increased user-attribute interaction (compared to the product version).
Our empirical results confirm that box embeddings are ideally suited to the task of recommendation with set-theoretic queries.
