\begin{abstract}
Personalized item recommendation typically suffers from data sparsity, which is most often addressed by learning vector representations of users and items via low-rank matrix factorization.
While this effectively densifies the matrix by assuming users and movies can be represented by linearly dependent latent features, it does not capture more complicated interactions.
% effectively express the notion of “similarity,” other relations between users and objects are not accurately captured.
For example, vector representations struggle with set-theoretic relationships, such as negation and intersection, \eg recommending a movie that is "comedy and action, but not romance".
In this work, we formulate the problem of personalized item recommendation as matrix completion where rows are \emph{set-theoretically dependent}.
% a novel set-theoretic framework building on box embeddings, representing both users and attributes as sets of items.
To capture this set-theoretic dependence we represent each user and attribute by a hyper-rectangle or \emph{box} (\ie a Cartesian product of intervals).
Box embeddings can intuitively be understood as trainable Venn diagrams, and thus not only inherently represent similarity (via the Jaccard index), but also naturally and faithfully support arbitrary set-theoretic relationships.
Queries involving set-theoretic constraints can be efficiently computed directly on the embedding space by performing geometric operations on the representations.
We empirically demonstrate the superiority of box embeddings over vector-based neural methods on both simple and complex item recommendation queries by up to $30\%$ overall.
