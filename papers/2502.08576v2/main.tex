\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\gls{genai} models such as LLMs, GPTs, and Diffusion Models have recently gained widespread attention
from both the research and the industrial communities. 
This survey explores their application in network monitoring and management, focusing on 
prominent
use cases, as well as challenges and opportunities. 
We discuss how 
\emph{network traffic generation and classification, network intrusion detection, networked system log analysis, and network digital assistance}
can benefit from the use of \gls{genai} models.
Additionally, we provide an overview of the available \gls{genai} models, datasets for large-scale training phases, and platforms for the development of such models.
Finally, we discuss research directions that potentially mitigate the roadblocks to the adoption of \gls{genai} for network monitoring and management.
Our investigation aims to map the current landscape and pave the way for future research in leveraging  \gls{genai} for network monitoring and management. %
