\caption{Instruct-tuned models provide high-quality but low-diversity data, while base models provide low-quality but high-diversity data. \Sys{} independently generates a diverse initial set of data points with a base model and refines each entry individually with an instruct-tuned model to create a high-quality, high-diversity dataset. In this example of a real grade school math problem generation, the Llama-3.1-70B-Base model hallucinates in its answer to its own question. The refiner (Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) recognizes this and disambiguates the question and corrects the reasoning.}
