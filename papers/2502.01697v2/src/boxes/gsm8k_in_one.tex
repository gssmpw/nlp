\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=brown!5!white,colframe=brown!75!black,title=In One Prompt]
Provide \texttt{\{num\}} examples of problems that might be grade school math word problems that require performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations. A bright middle school student should be able to solve each problem. Problems require no concepts beyond the level of early Algebra. You must first specify the question then provide the brief reasoning and answer. Note how the numerical answer is provided after \texttt{\#\#\#\#} after each brief reasoning for a question. Provide your examples in the following format:\\

\texttt{Question: [question]} \\
\texttt{Answer: [answer]}\\

Here are some examples:\\

\{examples\}\\

Now it's your turn. Generate \texttt{\{num\}} different problems following this format. Your question should be different in content from the examples. Make sure to only provide only the question and answer. Start each example with the question. Delimit the end of an example with the phrase "END OF EXAMPLE" (all caps) on a new line.
