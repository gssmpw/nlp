\textbf{Question:} Alice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels and so she goes to the bank. After getting back from the bank, she discovers that 20\% of the nickels are iron nickels worth \$3 each. What is the total value of her money now? \\
\textbf{Answer:} A quarter is worth five nickels because .25 / .05 = \(\ll.25/.05=5\gg 5\). She gets 100 nickels from the bank because 20 x 5 = \(\ll20*5=100\gg 100\). 20 of the nickels are iron nickels because 100 x .20 = \(\ll100*.20=20\gg 20\). 80 of the nickels are regular because 100 - 20 = \(\ll100-20=80\gg 80\). The iron nickels are worth \$60 because 20 x 3 = \(\ll20*3=60\gg 60\). The regular nickels are worth \$4 because 80 x .05 = \(\ll80*.05=4\gg 4\). Her money is now worth \$64 because 60 + 4 = \(\ll60+4=64\gg 64\). \texttt{\#\#\#\#} 64

\textbf{Question:} A church has 120 members. 40\% are adults. The rest are children. How many children more children are there than adults? \\
\textbf{Answer:} There are 48 adults because 120 x .4 = \(\ll120*.4=48\gg 48\). 60\% of members are children because 100 - 40 = \(\ll100-40=60\gg 60\). There are 72 children because 120 x .6 = \(\ll120*.6=72\gg 72\). There are 24 more children than adults because 72 - 48 = \(\ll72-48=24\gg 24\). \texttt{\#\#\#\#} 24

\textbf{Question:} Lisa is looking to attempt a World Record. She has decided to try and match Joey Chestnut's record of eating 75 full hotdogs, buns included, in 10 minutes. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. How many hotdogs will she have to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record? \\
\textbf{Answer:} Joey Chestnut ate 75 hotdogs to claim the record and Lisa has eaten 20 hot dogs so far, so she still needs to eat \(75-20=\ll75-20=55\gg 55\) hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut. Lisa has a 10-minute time period to eat the hotdogs and half the time has already passed, which means Lisa has \(10/2=\ll10/2=5\gg 5\) minutes left until the competition is over. If she needs to eat 55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut and there are 5 minutes left in the competition period, then she needs to eat \(55/5=\ll55/5=11\gg 11\) hot dogs per minute to have a chance of tying for a win. \texttt{\#\#\#\#} 11
