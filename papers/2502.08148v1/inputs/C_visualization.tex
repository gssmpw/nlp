The \textit{Causal Network Visualization} tool is an explorative attempt at enhancing the comprehension of complex causal relationships within textual data. Built on React\footnote{\url{reactjs.org}}, TypeScript\footnote{\url{typescriptlang.org}}, Sigma.js\footnote{\url{sigmajs.org}}, and leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, this web-based application facilitates the clustering of sentences and the identification of causal relationships between them. The layout of the network utilizes \texttt{nx.spring\_layout}, a force-directed layout algorithm provided by networkX\footnote{\url{networkx.org}}, to arrange the nodes in a manner that reflects the complexity of the causal relationships. Key features of the tool include categorization of nodes into "keys" and "categories" for enhanced navigation, node size differentiation based on between-ness centrality to signify importance, and robust search and filtering options that improve usability. Additionally, the application supports customization for different datasets and visual styles, offering a versatile platform for academic research in understanding the intricate web of cause-and-effect relationships.
