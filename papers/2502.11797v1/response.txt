\section{Related Work}
Much of the progress in participatory budgeting has built on prior work in multiwinner voting, i.e.,
a special case of participatory budgeting with unit costs **Procaccia, "Approximating Multidimensional Proportional Representation"**.
The Extended Justified Representation (EJR) axiom was first introduced in this context by **Brams and Kilgour, "Beyond the Myth of Complete Voting Cycles"**.

%\paragraph{Proportional Multiwinner Voting Methods}{
Besides MES, Phragm\'en's method **Phragmén, "Sur quelques problèmes de théorie des jeux"** and Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) **Xie et al., "Proportional Approval Voting in the 2014 Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections"** are well-established proportional rules in the multiwinner voting setting; **Procaccia and Rosenschein, "Aggregation of Divided Preferences in Multi-Criteria Decision Making"** provides an excellent overview.
PAV satisfies EJR **Xie et al., "Proportional Approval Voting in the 2014 Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections"** and has optimal proportionality degree, but is NP-hard to compute. Its threshold-based local search variant is polynomial-time computable  **Skowron et al., "Optimal Proportionality for Multiwinner Voting Rules"**, but may be hard to explain to voters. 
Phragmén's sequential method is also market-based.
Unlike MES, it is exhaustive, but it does not satisfy EJR. %It inspired the Method of Equal Shares **Aziz and McMullin, "Justified Representation in Exchange Systems"**, which is considered the first ``natural" polynomial-time rule to satisfy EJR in the multiwinner voting context.  
%However, **Klamler et al., "Phragmén's Sequential Method for Multiwinner Voting"** shows that Phragmén and MES have the same proportionality degree making Phragmén preferable in the MWV setting.}
Moreover, while **Brams et al., "Extending the Method of Equal Shares to General Additive Utilities"** extended
MES to participatory budgeting with general additive utilities, neither PAV nor Phragmén have been adapted to this general setting.

Exact Equal Shares for cardinal utilities was implicitly studied by **Aziz and McMullin, "Justified Representation in Exchange Systems"** and **Brams et al., "Extending the Method of Equal Shares to General Additive Utilities"**.
**Liu et al., "A Stability Notion for Participatory Budgeting"** introduce a stability notion for participatory budgeting that is satisfied by the outcome of Exact Equal Shares. **Goto et al., "Adaptive Equal Share Allocation in Cardinal Utilities"** propose an adaptive version of EES for cardinal utilities, which uses the outcome of EES for a smaller budget to compute the outcome of EES for a larger budget more efficiently, an alternative approach that complements our work.
They also consider the problem of finding the minimum budget increment that changes the election outcome, and propose an $O(n^2m)$ algorithm for this problem in the context of cardinal utilities. However, in practice, both in cities and in DAOs, the number of voters ($n$) is usually large, while the number of projects ($m$) is relatively small. As EES itself has a linear dependency on $n$, a completion method with quadratic dependency on $n$ is undesirable.


%They also give a naive $O(mn^2 \log n)$\footnote{Note that in participatory budgeting usually the number of voters $n$ is large while the number of projects $m$ is small, so a linear dependence on $n$ is desirable for such a method to be useful in practice.} algorithm to compute the next outcome for which the projects and/or voters paying for them change.
%Improving upon this result, our work provides a "natural" $O(mn)$ algorithm for cardinal utilities and introduces an $O(m^2n)$ time algorithm for the case of general identical utilities.
