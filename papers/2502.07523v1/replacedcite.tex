\section{Related work}
\RL{} has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, yet sample efficiency remains a significant challenge, especially in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or impractical. Various approaches have been explored to address this issue, including model-based RL, \UTD{} ratio scaling, and architectural modifications.

\paragraph{Model-based \RL{}} methods enhance sample efficiency by constructing predictive models of the environment to reduce reliance on real data collection ____.
However, such methods introduce additional complexity, computational overhead, and potential biases due to model inaccuracies.

\paragraph{Update-to-data ratio scaling.}
Model-free \RL{} methods, including those utilizing higher \UTD{} ratios, focus on increasing the number of gradient updates per collected sample to maximize learning from available data.
High \UTD{} training introduces several challenges, such as overfitting to early training data, a phenomenon known as primacy bias____.
This can be counteracted by periodically resetting the network parameters____.
However, network resets introduce abrupt performance drops.
Alternative approaches use techniques such as Q-function ensembles____ and architectural changes____.

\paragraph{Normalization techniques in \RL{}.}
Normalization techniques have long been recognized for their impact on neural network training. \LN{}____ and other architectural modifications have been used to stabilize learning in \RL{}____.
Yet \BN{} has only recently been successfully applied in this context____, challenging previous findings, where \BN{} in critics caused training to fail____.
\WN{} has been shown to keep \ELR{}s stable and prevent loss of plasticity____, when combined with \LN{}, making it a promising candidate for integration into existing \RL{} frameworks.
