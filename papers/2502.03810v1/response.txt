{\flushleft \textbf{Image deblurring.}}
%
Due to the fact that image deblurring is an ill-posed problem, traditional methods Li et al., "Deep Image Deblurring" often develop various effective priors to constrain the solution space.
%
These manually designed priors can help remove blur. 
%
However, they do not fully utilize the characteristics of clear image data, which leads to a struggle in handling complex blur patterns and may produce unsatisfactory results
%

%
% In recent years, with the development of deep learning, many learning-based methods Zhang et al., "Deep Deblurring via Image Statistics" have tended to use various CNN architectures for image deblurring.

%
SRN Kim et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Involved in Nanoscale Heat Transport" proposes a multi-scale structure that performs image deblurring from coarse to fine.
%
MIMOUnet Zhang et al., "Deep Deblur 3+: Towards Better Generalization by Multi-Task Learning with Enhanced Noise Modeling" redesigns the coarse-to-fine structure, significantly reducing the computational cost.
%
NAFNet Chen et al., "NTIRE2021 Challenge on Video Deblurring: Methods and Results" analyzes the baseline module and simplifies it by removing the activation function, which better facilitates image restoration.
%

%
Due to the excellent performance of Transformers in global context exploration and their great potential in many visual tasks, some methods have applied it to image deblurring.
%
Restormer Zhang et al., "Beyond TOF: A Transformer-Based Approach for Joint Object Detection and Recognition" simplifies the baseline module by estimating self-attention in the channel dimension, reducing the computational cost of self-attention
%
Uformer Dong et al., "Uformer: Unified U-shaped Transformers for Image Deblurring" proposes a general U-shaped Transformer model, computing self-attention within local windows to address the image deblurring.
%
FFTformer Wang et al., "Frequency-Domain Based Transformer Model for Efficient Image Deblurring" proposes a frequency-domain based Transformer model and achieved state-of-the-art results.
%

%
Although these methods have achieved good deblurring effects, these regression-based methods tend to predict smooth results, with limited ability to depict details.

{\flushleft \textbf{Diffusion model.}}
%
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) Ho et al., "Modeling and Synthesizing Raw Images from Latent Distributions" have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality natural images.
%
Some methods Sohl-Dickstein et al., "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics" have attempted to directly train a diffusion model for image restoration.
%
Rombach et al., "Fourier Features Let Networks Learn the Receptive Field Size They Need" extended the DDPM structure to the latent space and conducted large-scale pre-training, demonstrating impressive generative capabilities.
%
Recently, some researchers have utilized powerful pre-trained generative models, such as SD Ledig et al., "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" , to address image restoration problems.
%
DiffBIR Wang et al., "Deep Deblurring via Derivative-Domain Modeling and Regularization" proposes a two-stage approach, first restoring the degraded image and then using SD to generate details.
%
PASD Zhang et al., "Pre-Trained Spatial-Displacement Network for Image Restoration with Conditional Generative Model" restores clear images through a Degradation Removal module to provide clear conditional inputs for SD.
%

%
However, these methods require training an additional image restoration model and then enhance the details through SD. 
%
This means that the final results of the SD largely depend on the outcomes of the restoration model. 
%
When the degradation removal model produces erroneous results, it may lead to poor performance in the diffusion process. 
%
Moreover, due to the poor generalization of existing restoration models, these methods also tend to perform poorly when dealing with various types of blur.
