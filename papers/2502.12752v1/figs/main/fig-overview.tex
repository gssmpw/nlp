    \caption{\textbf{Overview of \method.} Given the input view, we first estimate the depth information from a depth estimator and then perform pixel splatting to generate splatted views as diffusion conditioning. In our splatting-guided diffusion, we fine-tune the latent U-Net for aligned synthesis, producing consistent novel views while correcting splatting errors. Meanwhile, a texture bridge module is designed to aggregate the encoder features for high-fidelity synthesis.}
