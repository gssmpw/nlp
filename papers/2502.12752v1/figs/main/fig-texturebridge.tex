    \caption{\textbf{Texture bridge.} The texture bridge is designed to complement multi-scale features from the encoder to the decoder, enabling high-fidelity synthesis. For training, we intentionally degrade the texture of the target view with the diffusion model, simulating a degraded view with hallucinated textures. This facilitates the texture bridge to learn how to adaptively fuse information from the splatted view and the diffusion outputs.}
