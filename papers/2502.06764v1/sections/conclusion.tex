\section{Conclusion}
Enabling flexible conditioning on different portions of history, the \method not only establishes itself as a competitive video diffusion framework but also gives rise to History Guidance, a family of powerful history-conditioned guidance methods that significantly enhances video quality, consistency, and motion degree. Additionally, we demonstrate that \mtd can be efficiently fine-tuned from existing models, suggesting future potentials of integrating History Guidance with current foundation models.
