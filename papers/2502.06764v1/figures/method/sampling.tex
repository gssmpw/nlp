      \textbf{Sampling with \mtd and History Guidance.} A \mtd can be used to estimate scores conditioned on differently masked histories using \emph{noise as masking}. This includes clean (full history), \xred{fully masked (unconditional)}, \xgreenii{subset masked (shorter history)}, or \xorangeii{partially masked (low-frequency history)}.  These scores can be composed when sampling to obtain a family of \emph{History Guidance} methods.
