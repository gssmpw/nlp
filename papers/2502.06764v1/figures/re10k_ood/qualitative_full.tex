            Given \slightlyoodregion history with rotation angles in $[120^\circ, 130^\circ]$, baselines and \mtd with \HGv generate inconsistent frames with artifacts. In contrast, \mtd with \HGt generates consistent videos that highly resemble the ground truth. This is the region where \HGt starts showing its generalization gap with other methods.

        \textbf{Qualitative results of testing robustness to out-of-distribution history on RealEstate10K.} We provide wide-angle, 4-frame history and task the models to generate the next 4 frames that interpolate between the history frames. As the angle increases, the history becomes more out-of-distribution, and thus we split the results into \slightlyoodregion and \oodregion depending on the angle range.
