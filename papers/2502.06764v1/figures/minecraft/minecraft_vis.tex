        \textbf{Visualization of long context generation on Minecraft.} We visualize the generation up to the maximum length of the training set. Given $25$ initial frames (red), \mtd with temporal history guidance (upper) can roll out stably without blowing up even without CFG. In contrast, one can clearly see that without temporal history guidance (lower), conditional generation easily becomes blurry in later frames. This is likely because the shorter-context model is less likely to fall out of distribution, using its generation power to compensate for the unconfident, blurry prediction from the longer-context model.
