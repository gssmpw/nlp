        \textbf{Visualization of the fruit-swapping task through a \mtd generated video.} Two fruits are randomly put within two random slots. The robot is tasked with swapping its slots using the third slot and moving one fruit at a time. This task requires long-horizon memory because it needs to remember the initial location of the fruit for the task completion, but also react to different fruit locations within each slot, which is combinatorically impossible form the dataset.
