        \textbf{Additional qualitative comparison on Kinetics-600}. We uniformly
        subsample 6 frames $\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\}$ from 16-frame videos, conditioned on 5-frame histories. Both \mtd variants, \emph{scratch} and \emph{fine-tuned}, consistently align with the history, generating high-quality samples that closely resemble the ground truth. In contrast, the baselines, typically ordered as SD $>$ BD $>$ FS, struggle to maintain consistency and often exhibit artifacts.
