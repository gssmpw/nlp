\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Luc Van Gool and my advisor Dr. Christos Sakaridis, for their unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement throughout my thesis journey. Their expertise and passion for the subject have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the field and inspiring me to pursue a career in research. Especially for my weekly meetings with Dr. Christos Sakaridis, his insightful feedback and countless discussions we had during our research endeavours. I'm truly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work in the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich under his mentorship, and I'm immensely grateful for his patience and dedication in helping me grow as a researcher.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my collaborators, who have been invaluable source of knowledge, kindness, and camaraderie. In particular, I would like to thank Konstantinos Tzevelekakis for his collaboration and kindness on this project, especially for his help during the data preparation and the model training. I am grateful to all members of the Computer Vision Lab for creating a stimulating and supportive environment, fostering a sense of community and enabling a fruitful exchange of ideas. Everyone who has helped me has contributed immensely to my personal and professional development.

Moreover, I'm also grateful to my home university, the University of Toronto, for giving me the chance to work as a researcher outside Canada and providing me with financial support, as well as to ETH Zurich, for accepting me as a research student and providing me with a strong world research environment.

Lastly, I would like to express my profound appreciation to my parents, and my entire family for their unconditional love, support, and encouragement. My friends for being a constant source of motivation, understanding and emotional support as I navigated through this period. My previous supervisors and collaborators, as their help and guidance have enabled my ability to better conduct scientific research. Their unwavering belief in me and my abilities has been the bedrock of my success, and their sacrifices have enabled me to reach my milestones again and again. I dedicate this thesis to everyone above, as s testament to their love and support.
