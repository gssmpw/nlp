 By a theorem of Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c____, a homogeneous structure $\struct{B}$ with a countable relational signature is Ramsey if and only if its automorphism group $\Aut(\struct{B})$ is \emph{extremely amenable}, and hence the Ramsey property only depends on $\Aut(\struct{B})$ viewed as an abstract topological group.  
%
They also observed that extreme amenability is preserved under taking wreath products; although they do not state this result explicitly, they do provide an example as a proof of concept: the automorphism group of the \emph{random convexly ordered equivalence relation}.  
 % 
 Scow~\cite[Theorem~5.13]{scow2021ramsey} does state this result, and essentially provides a full proof, modulo Theorem~4.7~in ____.
 %
 We kindly borrow her statement and in return provide a positive answer to one of her open questions regarding \emph{semi-retractions}~\cite[Question 4.3]{BARTOŠOVÁ_SCOW_2024}.
 %
 In simple words, a semi-retraction is a certain purely algebraic construction allowing to transfer   the Ramsey property from one structure to another.   

\begin{restatable}{proposition}{semiretraction} \label{prop:rg_semiret_aba} 
  The random linearly ordered graph is a semi-retract of the linearly ordered atomless Boolean algebra. %The canonical injections witnessing this fact can be chosen to be order-preserving.

 The first two examples of a tractable $\omega$-categorical sandwich for a finite-domain PCSP that is not finitely tractable have  recently been provided in the preprint~\cite[Propositions~35 and~36]{Mottet_2025}. Our results compare to the results of that work as follows:~\cite[Theorem 1]{Mottet_2025}  shows that every CSP within the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture is polynomial-time equivalent to the PCSP of a half-infinite template, more precisely a template $(\struct{S}_1,\struct{S}_2)$ such that $\struct{S}_1$ is in the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture and $\struct{S}_2$ is finite.
%
In contrast, our Theorem~\ref{thm:main_theorem_sandwiches} provides a non-finitely tractable finite-domain PCSP template $(\struct{S}_1,\struct{S}_2)$ sandwiching a given structure $\struct{A}$ from Conjecture~\ref{conj:bodirsky_pinsker} up to Datalog interreducibility.
%
Since our PCSP template $(\struct{S}_1,\struct{S}_2)$ is finite and not half-infinite, we cannot guarantee polynomial-time equivalence between $\PCSP(\struct{S}_1,\struct{S}_2)$ and $\CSP(\struct{A})$.
