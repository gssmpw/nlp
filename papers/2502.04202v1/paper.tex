\begin{abstract}
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) plays a central role in mobile applications, directly affecting usability and user satisfaction. Poor GUI performance, such as lag or unresponsiveness, can lead to negative user experience and decreased mobile application (app) ratings. In this paper, we present \tool, a framework designed to detect GUI lags by analyzing screencasts recorded during mobile app testing. \tool uses computer vision techniques to identify three types of lag-inducing frames (i.e., janky frames, long loading frames, and frozen frames) and prioritizes the most severe ones that significantly impact user experience. Our approach was evaluated using real-world mobile application tests, achieving high accuracy in detecting GUI lags in screencasts, with an average precision of 0.91 and recall of 0.96. The comprehensive bug reports generated from the lags detected by \tool help developers focus on the more critical issues and debug them efficiently.
Additionally, \tool has been deployed in a real-world production environment, continuously monitoring app performance and successfully identifying critical GUI performance issues. By offering a practical solution for identifying and addressing GUI lags, \tool contributes to enhancing user satisfaction and the overall quality of mobile apps.
