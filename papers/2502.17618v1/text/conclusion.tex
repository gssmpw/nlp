\section{Conclusion}
This work introduces \ouralg, an algorithm for learning generative models of team behavior from heterogeneous demonstrations. Experiments show that \ouralg outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent imitation learning baselines and captures expert team behavior across six diverse teamwork domains. Additionally, \ouralg can generate a wide range of expert team behaviors.
\ouralg also motivates future research directions. First, \ouralg assumes a known, finite set of subtasks, though real-world subtasks may be difficult to define a prior or represent as scalars. Future MAIL methods should explore more expressive hierarchical representations. Second, by enabling generative models of team behavior, \ouralg can enable novel human-AI teaming applications, such as AI-enabled team coaching~\cite{seo2021towards, seo2025socratic} and end-user programming of multi-agent systems~\cite{ajaykumar2021survey, stegner2024understanding}. We invite developers of these and other impactful applications to utilize \ouralg and make additional details available at \url{http://tiny.cc/dtil-appendix}
