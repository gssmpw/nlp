\section{Related Work}
The recent surge in LLM research has reignited interest in PEFT research. To pursue favorable task performance while using only a small number of trainable parameters, current PEFT methods primarily lie in four categories: adding extra trainable modules ____, selectively training a small subset of key parameters ____, employing reparameterization techniques like low-rank decomposition to the incremental matrices ____, or combining multiple strategies ____. Among them, low-rank methods have garnered significant attention due to their mergable nature and parameter efficiency. These low-rank methods, which aim to approximate large weight matrices using a few principal components, is highly analogous to techniques employed in data compression. In fact, low-rank decomposition (or singular value decomposition) and frequency-domain decomposition (e.g., JPEG compression) represents two fundamental tools in image compression and signal processing.
    
    For image compression, frequency-domain reconstruction (e.g., DCT) are preferred due to the inherent smoothness prior of image data ____. However, when dealing with the complex data structures of neural network parameter matrices, the relative efficacy of these approaches remains unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, although FourierFT ____ has made an empirical study of frequency-domain PEFT by employing Fourier Transform, no prior work has conducted a rigorous comparison between low-rank and frequency-domain decomposition methods in the context of PEFT. Our work aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis and designing a more efficient frequency-domain PEFT method.
