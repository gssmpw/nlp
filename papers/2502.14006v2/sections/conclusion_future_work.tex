\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}

In conclusion, Im2SurfTex presents a novel backprojection approach to generating high-quality, coherent textures for 3D shapes from multiview image outputs from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Unlike conventional methods that rely on heuristic and averaging backprojection strategies that introduce texture artifacts and seams, our approach enhances texture continuity and coherence. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method. 

\paragraph{Limitations and future work}  In our current implementation, texture generation is limited by predefined viewpoints that may be suboptimal. Instead, a better approach would be to dynamically adapt to the shapeâ€™s intrinsic structure.
Future work can focus on integrating richer geometric information and utilizing specialized 3D networks to encode complex features such as curvature and occluded regions,
which remain challenging for current approaches. By enabling geometry-aware processing in the diffusion process, future methods may further mitigate view-dependent biases.
