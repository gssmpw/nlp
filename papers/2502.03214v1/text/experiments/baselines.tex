To contextualize agent performance and provide upper and lower bounds, we establish four baselines encompassing human and AI agents. 

\textbf{Human performance} was evaluated with 30 participants using a web app GUI of the SGP, where participants interacted by prompting text commands over a command line, mirroring the interaction method of VLM agents. Baselines were provided for 3D vision  modality on the same dataset as the VLM agents. 

\textbf{AI baselines} were introduced for two agents: an optimal agent executing shortest path solutions computed by A* \cite{hart1968formal}, and a random agent performing uninformed but valid actions uniformly sampled from those leading to new board states. Algorithms for the AI agents are detailed in Appendix \ref{sec:algorithms}.
