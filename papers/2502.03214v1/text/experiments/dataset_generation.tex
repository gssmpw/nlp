Experiments were conducted on a dataset %\footnote{Dataset available at: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LinkToDataset}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LinkToDataset}} 
of SGPs on a fixed 4x4 board, with performance assessed by varying complexity across two parameters: the number of objects (2-11) and the shortest path length (2-11). Configurations maintain a geom interference factor of 0, ensuring the shortest path equals the cumulative Manhattan distance. Initial experiments indicated that VLM agents faced significant challenges at higher task complexities. Three episodes are sampled for each complexity level, producing a dataset of 300 diverse board configurations. The set of geom properties consists of four shapes—sphere, pyramid, cube, and cylinder—and four colors—red, green, blue, and yellow—resulting in 16 unique combinations. A detailed list of the dataset generation parameter is provided in Appendix \ref{sec:params_configs}. VLM agents are tested on the same dataset for each modality, resulting in 900 episodes for each model.
