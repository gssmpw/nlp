Although some VLMs continue to progress toward the goal state beyond 20 steps, the majority fail to complete episodes after this threshold (Appendix \ref{sec:additional_graphs}: Figure \ref{fig:lineplot_episode_progress}). Overall, performance is highly consistent, with minimal variation across repeated experiments. However, VLMs consistently struggle with specific settings and fail to solve certain episodes repeatedly.
