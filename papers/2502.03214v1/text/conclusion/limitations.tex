\textbf{Limitations}\hspace{.3cm} We restricted the context window, limiting the number of images VLMs can process. Extended image inputs often disrupt VLMs' understanding of sequential coherence and increase computational demands and API costs. This contrasts with human participants, who recall each step of an episode and draw from past experiences.
