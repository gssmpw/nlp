We have introduced iVISPAR, a novel interactive multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities in 3D vision of VLMs acting as agents. The benchmark, centered on the Sliding Geom Puzzle, evaluates VLMs' abilities in logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step problem-solving, aiming to reflect real-world spatial reasoning. Our evaluation tested a suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs on a dataset of board configurations, scaled across two levels of complexity. We compared them to baselines for human capabilities, optimal and random agents, providing insight into their performance under varying conditions.
