\textbf{Complexity scales:} We evaluated the cumulative performance of VLMs across the three modalities using two complexity scales, the shortest path length required to solve an episode and the number of geoms on the board. Longer shortest paths demand a broader global planning horizon and consistent goal-directed progress, while higher geom counts require efficient local planning to optimize rearrangement order and manage free spaces. Figure \ref{fig:cumulative_heatmap} illustrates the performance of VLMs in 100 combinations of complexity, highlighting the average minimal distance to the goal state in 20 steps.
