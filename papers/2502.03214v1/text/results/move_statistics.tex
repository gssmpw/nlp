\textbf{Action classification:} We classified actions based on their effects on the board and calculated their average occurrence per episode to provide insights into the challenges VLMs face in efficiently completing episodes (Figure \ref{fig:barplot_action_counts}). Effective and ineffective actions both result in valid new board states but, respectively, decrease or increase the path length to the goal state. Invalid moves, such as occupied destination and out-of-bounds actions, fail to alter the board state, as do illegal commands, which violate the instructed action format.
