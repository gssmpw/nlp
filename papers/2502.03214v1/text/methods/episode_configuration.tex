\textbf{Episode Configuration}\hspace{.3cm}  Unique episode configurations are generated by randomly sampling and pairing initial and goal states. These configurations are classified according to hyperparameters, including board size, number of geoms, shortest path solution length, and the geom interference factor (Appendix \ref{sec:params_configs}). Geoms on the board are assigned shape and color properties derived from the specified hyperparameter set. This structured approach facilitates the selection of episode datasets that accurately reflect targeted complexity requirements.
