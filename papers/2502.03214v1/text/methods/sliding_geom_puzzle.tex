The Sliding Geom Puzzle (SGP) replaces traditional numbered tiles with geometric objects (geoms) that are uniquely defined by color and shape attributes, increasing visual-spatial complexity and enhancing task scalability. This design shift requires models to interpret object features rather than follow simple numerical sequences, mirroring real-world spatial reasoning, where objects are distinguished by appearance, size, or structure. This approach aligns with physical tasks such as organizing items, assembling structures, or packing, promoting a more authentic evaluation of real-world spatial capabilities.
