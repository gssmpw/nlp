\textbf{Observation spaces}\hspace{.3cm} Agents observe a combination of the current board state and the goal state. Additionally they can receive a sequence of past state-action pairs, determined by the length of their context window. iVISPAR supports multi-modal observations of the board state, which can be represented in either a 3D vision, 2D vision or text-based modality (Figure \ref{fig:SGP_states}).Images for 3D and 2D vision modalities may optionally include embedded, text-based chess-style coordinate labels as spatial cues on outer edge of the grid board as well as on free tiles. Images can also marked with an embedded text label and a colored background to differentiate between past (grey), active (blue) and goal state (green). Figure \ref{fig:SGP_states} shows 3D vision (left) and 2D vision (middle) for the active state (top) and the goal state (bottom). Text-based representation encodes past, active, and goal states directly in the prompt string supplied to the agent. A visualization of the text-based active (top) and goal states (bottom) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SGP_states} (right). Images are not used in this modality.
