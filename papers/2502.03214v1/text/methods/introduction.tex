iVISPAR\footnote{All code available at: \\
\href{https://github.com/SharkyBamboozle/iVISPAR}{https://github.com/SharkyBamboozle/iVISPAR}} is an interactive and multi-modal puzzle simulator that provides agents with an image or text representation of the board state. By rendering in 3D space, iVISPAR offers a more realistic depiction of spatial scenes compared to traditional 2D grid puzzles. Additionally, it supports a 2D top-down view and a text-based representation. Both the 3D and 2D renderings and text-based representations are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SGP_states}. 

A key feature of iVISPAR is the Sliding Geom Puzzle (SGP), which reimagines the classic sliding tile puzzle by replacing numbered tiles with geometric objects defined by their unique combinations of color and shape (see Section~\ref{slidinggeompuzzle}). Agents interact with the board by issuing natural language commands through a text-based API to apply actions to the board. The objective is to rearrange pieces on the board to match a goal configuration. iVISPAR allows for a fine scaling of complexity, customizable random puzzle generation, and benchmarking performance with multiple baseline models.
