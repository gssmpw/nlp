This paper contributes to advancements in vision-language models. While our work has potential applications in broader AI research, it does not introduce immediate ethical or societal risks beyond those already associated with the field. As our work is largely theoretical and not at a scale that could pose significant concerns, it does not raise specific risks of misuse or unintended consequences.
