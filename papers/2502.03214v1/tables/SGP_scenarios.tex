\textbf{Short} & \textbf{Modality} & \textbf{Reasoning Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
SGP-T & Text-only & Text-Based Spatial Reasoning & Agents receive only text descriptions of board states in the form of a list of chess coordinates. \\
SGP-V & Vision-only & Visual-Spatial Reasoning & Agents rely exclusively on rendered images of the board without textual support. \\
SGP-VL & Vision + Labels & Visual-Spatial Reasoning with Embedded Text-Based Spatial-Cues & Agents receive images with board labels embedded directly in the scene, aiding spatial recognition. \\
SGP-TVL & Text \& Vision + Labels & Multi-Modal Spatial Reasoning & Agents process both images with embedded labels and text descriptions. \\
