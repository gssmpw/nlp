        \caption{VLMs' average action counts per episode by category for each modality. Number of actions per episode is capped at 20. Effective / ineffective actions respectively decrease / increase the path length to the goal state. Occupied destination and out-of-bounds are invalid moves, while illegal commands break the instructed action format, all of which leave the board state unchanged.}
