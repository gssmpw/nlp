        \caption{VLMsâ€™ average action counts per episode. Effective / ineffective actions respectively decrease / increase the path length to the goal state. Occupied destination and out-of-bounds are invalid moves, while illegal commands break the instructed action format, all of which leave the board state unchanged. Top: Overall action counts for each modality. Bottom: Overall action counts for each model.}
