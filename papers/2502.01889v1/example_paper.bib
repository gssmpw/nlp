abstract="In this paper, a new algorithm for Sparse Component Analysis (SCA) or atomic decomposition on over-complete dictionaries is presented. The algorithm is essentially a method for obtaining sufficiently sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations. The solution obtained by the proposed algorithm is compared with the minimum ℓ1-norm solution achieved by Linear Programming (LP). It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is about two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ℓ1-magic, while providing comparable reconstruction performance.",

To overcome the time complexity involved by the numerical solving of such problem, the original Wasserstein metric is replaced by a sliced approximation over 1D distributions. This enables us to introduce a new fast gradient descent algorithm to compute Wasserstein barycenters of point clouds.",
