\section{Conclusion}
%In this work, we addressed the under-explored aspect of temporal awareness in multimodal scenarios by introducing the MTPChat dataset and an accompanying framework with an adaptive temporal module. The MTPChat dataset, with its integration of linguistic, visual, and temporal elements, offers a high-quality resource for advancing research in temporal reasoning. MTPChat challenges models by requiring comprehension of temporal dynamics, thereby extending the scope of time-sensitive research beyond traditional QA formats. Our proposed adaptive temporal module has demonstrated substantial improvements in model performance, suggesting its potential applicability in various real-world scenarios. 
%Future research will focus on refining this framework and exploring its scalability and adaptability across different domains and temporal challenges, aiming to further our understanding of time's impact on cognitive and decision-making processes.
In this work, we addressed the underexplored challenge of temporal awareness in multimodal, persona-grounded dialogues by introducing MTPChat, a multimodal, time-aware persona dialogue dataset, along with an adaptive temporal framework.
MTPChat presents new challenges by requiring conversational agents to comprehend implicit temporal dynamics in evolving dialogues and persona memories, thereby expanding the scope of temporal reasoning beyond traditional QA tasks. Additionally, our proposed adaptive temporal module has demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, underscoring its effectiveness in integrating multimodal streams and capturing dynamic temporal dependencies.
Our findings highlight the importance of temporal reasoning in conversational AI, and we anticipate that MTPChat will serve as a valuable resource for future research in multimodal, time-aware AI systems.
\section{Limitations}

Despite its comprehensive structure and innovative tasks, the MTPChat dataset and our framework present certain limitations and need attention for future development. For MTPChat dataset, while the dataset significantly enhances the challenge of temporal reasoning by incorporating implicit temporal cues, it may still not fully capture the subtleties of real-world temporal dynamics, such as those influenced by cultural, historical, or personal contexts that affect human interactions. For our framework, future research should focus on refining this framework and exploring its scalability and adaptability across different domains and temporal challenges, aiming to further our understanding of time's impact on cognitive and decision-making processes.

\section{Ethics Statement}

In the development of the MTPChat dataset, we have placed a high priority on privacy and adherence to ethical standards. We ensured that the images in the dataset do not contain identifiable features such as faces, license plates, or email addresses, and the text is free from offensive language. We urge users of the dataset to be aware of these inherent risks. Additionally, commercial use of our data is strictly limited to ensure compliance with the Reddit API Terms and to protect user privacy. The MTPChat dataset is exclusively permitted for academic research purposes.
