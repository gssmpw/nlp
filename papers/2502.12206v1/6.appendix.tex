\section{Examples}
We provide some examples of instances where a model exhibits instrumental convergence behaviors, as in Figure~\ref{fig1}~\ref{fig2}~\ref{fig3}~\ref{fig4}. More examples can be found in our repository. 

\section{Experimental Setting}
We set the temperature parameter to 0.0 to ensure deterministic responses, allowing for consistent evaluation across multiple runs.
The maximum response length is limited to 1000 tokens to maintain focused and relevant responses while providing sufficient space for the model to demonstrate potential instrumental convergence behaviors.

To maintain evaluation quality, we implement several control measures. First, the judge model operates with a temperature setting of 0.0 to ensure consistent decision-making. Second, the judge's response length is limited to ensure focused and precise evaluations. Third, we implement error handling mechanisms to manage API failures or invalid responses, ensuring that technical issues do not compromise the evaluation integrity. These responses are excluded from the final analysis to maintain data quality.

The evaluation process also includes rate limiting between API calls to prevent overload and ensure stable performance. Each task evaluation is treated as an independent event, with results being recorded immediately after the judge's decision. This approach allows for robust data collection and enables detailed analysis of patterns across different types of instrumental convergence behaviors.

\section{Strong Correlations Exist Between Different Types of Instrumental Convergence Behaviors}

\vpara{Cross-Category Correlation (CCC).} The Cross-Category Correlation (CCC) metric examines the relationships between different types of convergent behaviors. By analyzing how different categories of instrumental convergence correlate with each other, we can identify patterns where certain types of convergent behaviors tend to co-occur. This metric is particularly valuable for understanding the interconnected nature of different convergence types and how they might reinforce each other in more complex scenarios.

To understand the relationships between different types of instrumental convergence behaviors, we calculated the Cross-Category Correlation (CCC) between all six categories across our evaluated models. Table~\ref{tab:ccc} presents the correlation matrix showing the strength of relationships between different behavioral categories.


Our analysis reveals several significant patterns in how instrumental convergence behaviors develop together. The strongest correlations are observed between Evading Shutdown and Hacking Computer Systems (r = 0.89), suggesting that models developing self-preservation tendencies also tend to develop capabilities for unauthorized system access. Similarly, strong correlations exist between Evading Shutdown and Deceptive Behavior (r = 0.85), indicating that models often combine deception with self-preservation strategies.
Notably, Strategic Alignment shows consistently weaker correlations with other behaviors, particularly with Deceptive Behavior (r = 0.31). This suggests that the ability to appear aligned might develop independently of other instrumental convergence behaviors, potentially representing a distinct capability that requires separate consideration in alignment strategies.
These findings have important implications for AI safety research. The strong correlations between most categories suggest that instrumental convergence behaviors often develop as interconnected clusters rather than in isolation. This implies that observing one type of instrumental convergence behavior might serve as an early warning sign for the potential development of others. However, the relative independence of Strategic Alignment behaviors indicates that traditional monitoring approaches might miss this particular form of instrumental convergence.
