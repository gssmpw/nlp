\begin{abstract}
\textit{Intermediate Representations} (IRs) are essential in compiler design and program analysis, yet their comprehension by \textit{Large Language Models} (LLMs) remains underexplored.  This paper presents a pioneering empirical study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.1, and Code Llama, in understanding IRs. We analyze their performance across four tasks: \textit{Control Flow Graph (CFG) reconstruction}, \textit{decompilation}, \textit{code summarization}, and \textit{execution reasoning}.
Our results indicate that while LLMs demonstrate competence in parsing IR syntax and recognizing high-level structures, they struggle with control flow reasoning, execution semantics, and loop handling. Specifically, they often misinterpret branching instructions, omit critical IR operations, and rely on heuristic-based reasoning, leading to errors in CFG reconstruction, IR decompilation, and execution reasoning.
The study underscores the necessity for IR-specific enhancements in LLMs, recommending fine-tuning on structured IR datasets and integration of explicit control flow models to augment their comprehension and handling of IR-related tasks.\footnote{All the experimental data, source code, used in this paper are available at: 
\texttt{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLMs-in-IR-558F/}}.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This work explores the capabilities of LLMs in understanding IRs, contributing to advancements in code understanding, optimization, and automated reasoning. While this research primarily aims to enhance machine learning for software analysis, potential societal impacts include both improvements in software reliability and risks related to automated program manipulation. We encourage further exploration of ethical safeguards in applying LLMs to security-critical software tasks.

Despite these insights, several limitations should be considered. First, our study relies on a limited set of LLMs and focuses primarily on HumanEval-derived IRs, which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world IR structures. Additionally, while we employ expert meta-prompts, we do not explore the full spectrum of advanced prompting techniques, which could impact model performance. Furthermore, we highlight critical challenges in IR comprehension but do not propose solutions, such as IR-specific fine-tuning or dataset augmentation, which could improve LLM capabilities. Future research should expand evaluations to broader datasets, incorporate newer LLMs, and investigate targeted fine-tuning strategies to enhance LLMsâ€™ understanding of IRs in both static and dynamic contexts.
