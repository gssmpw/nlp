The experiments are conducted using Llama-3.1-1B on the GSM8K dataset. The comparison includes a model trained without curriculum learning (w/o Cur.), trained for only stage 1 (Stage 1), and trained using the full two-stage curriculum learning approach (\sname) (Stage 2). (a) Accuracy improves with curriculum learning by mitigating conflicts between competing objectives during early training stages. (b) AUROC results demonstrate enhanced classification performance of corrected and incorrect responses and effective transfer from Stage 1 to the final \sname model. }
