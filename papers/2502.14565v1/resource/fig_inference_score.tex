    \caption{Inference-time scaling comparison between \sname ($\mathcal{M}$(\eos) (Ours)) and inference metrics. For $\mathcal{M}$(Answer) and $\mathcal{M}$(\eos) (Ours), we have done weighted majority voting. \sname consistently outperforms other inference metrics, and \sname's sampling method using weighted majority voting exceeds the performance of majority voting. Experiments are conducted using the Llama-3.2-1B model.}
