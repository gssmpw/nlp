  \caption{\textbf{Overview of \sname. Left:} \sname is a self-verifying and self-correcting reasoning framework. It first generates an initial answer, verifies its correctness, and decides whether to stop or refine. If the model generates the \rethink token, it refines the initial reasoning. \textbf{Right: } The structured curriculum-based training pipeline of \sname. In the first stage, the model learns self-verification by selecting between \eos and \rethink. In the second stage, it learns to correct reasoning mistakes using golden data.} \label{figure:method}
