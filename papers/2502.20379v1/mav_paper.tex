\begin{abstract}
\vspace{-0.25em}
By utilizing more computational resources at test-time, large language models (LLMs) can improve without additional training. One common strategy uses \textit{verifiers} to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: \textit{scaling the number of verifiers}. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. 
% one possible 
AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-$n$ sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. 
% where a model self-verifies its outputs.
Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.
