\section*{Impact Statement}
Our findings on LLM emergent planning raise specific considerations for model deployment. While these capabilities could enhance system reliability through better resource allocation and early warning mechanisms, they also present  concerns when handling sensitive data, as these probing methods reveal aspects of the model's internal thinking or decision-making process. We encourage careful evaluation of these trade-offs when implementing probing-based monitoring systems, particularly in applications involving sensitive information.
