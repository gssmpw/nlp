\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our work reveals that LLMs have emergent response planning capabilities, with prompt representations encoding global attributes of future outputs across structure, content, and behavior attributes. These findings challenge the conventional view of LLMs as purely local predictors and provide new insights into their internal mechanisms. 
Though we do not focus on interpretability mechanisms to explain the causal relationship of emergent response planning, our findings open promising directions for enhancing model control and transparency, potentially enabling more effective methods for guiding and predicting model outputs before generation begins.
