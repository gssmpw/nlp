\begin{abstract}
Autonomous artificial agents must be able to learn behaviors in complex environments without humans to design tasks and rewards. Designing these functions for each environment is not feasible, thus, motivating the development of intrinsic reward functions. In this paper, we propose using several cognitive elements that have been neglected for a long time to build an internal world model for an intrinsically motivated agent. Our agent performs satisfactory iterations with the environment, learning complex behaviors without needing previously designed reward functions. We used 18 Atari games to evaluate what cognitive skills emerge in games that require reactive and deliberative behaviors. Our results show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in many test cases with dense and sparse rewards.

%Autonomous artificial agents must be able to learn valuable behaviors in complex environments without the presence of humans to design tasks and rewards. This capability is even more essential for reinforcement learning agents that rely on complex extrinsic reward functions. Designing these functions for each environment is not feasible, thus, motivating the development of intrinsic reward functions. In this paper, we propose using several cognitive elements that have been neglected for a long time to build an internal world model for an intrinsically motivated agent. Our agent performs satisfactory iterations with the environment, learning complex behaviors without needing previously designed reward functions. We used 18 Atari games to evaluate what cognitive skills emerge with varying reward types environments in games that requires reactive and deliberative behaviors, and our results show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in many test cases.

% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
