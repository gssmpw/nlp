  abstract = {Our research is a step toward ascertaining the need for personalization in XAI, and we do so in the context of investigating the value of explanations of AI-driven hints and feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). We added an explanation functionality to the Adaptive CSP (ACSP) applet, an interactive simulation that helps students learn an algorithm for constraint satisfaction problems by providing AI-driven hints adapted to their predicted level of learning. We present the design of the explanation functionality and the results of a controlled study to evaluate its impact on students' learning and perception of the ACPS hints. The study includes an analysis of how these outcomes are modulated by several user characteristics such as personality traits and cognitive abilities, to asses if explanations should be personalized to these characteristics. Our results indicate that providing explanations increase students' trust in the ACPS hints, perceived usefulness of the hints, and intention to use them again. In addition, we show that students' access of the ACSP explanation and learning gains are modulated by three user characteristics, Need for Cognition, Contentiousness and Reading Proficiency, providing insights on how to personalize the ACSP explanations to these traits, as well as initial evidence on the potential value of personalized Explainable AI (XAI) for ITS.},

Using social network analysis, the authors study how interactions between researchers-policy makers affect utilization of research by policy makers in a boundary organization designed to mediate between research and policy communities. Two types of social interactions with independent effects on utilization are identified. Policy makers with more direct contacts with researchers are more likely to utilize research. Policy makers interacting more with other policy makers regarding research are also more likely to utilize it. This indicates the importance of policy makers’ embeddedness in social networks and the importance of external reputation of boundary organizations for successful knowledge transfer.},

  abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited hgih convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significnatly correlated with both self-reported current usage r = .63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage r = .85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage r = .45, Study 1) and future usage r = .59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a signficnatly greater correaltion with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecdent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.}

  abstract = {An extensive body of literature indicates the importance of teamwork to the success of innovative projects. This growing awareness, that “good teamwork” increases the success of innovative projects, raises new questions: What is teamwork, and how can it be measured? Why and how is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality (TWQ). The six facets of the TWQ construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between TWQ and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that TWQ (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between TWQ and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, TWQ shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).},

  abstract = {Current discussions of "Explainable AI" (XAI) do not much consider the role of abduction in explanatory reasoning (see Mueller, et al., 2018). It might be worthwhile to pursue this, to develop intelligent systems that allow for the observation and analysis of abductive reasoning and the assessment of abductive reasoning as a learnable skill. Abductive inference has been defined in many ways. For example, it has been defined as the achievement of insight. Most often abduction is taken as a single, punctuated act of syllogistic reasoning, like making a deductive or inductive inference from given premises. In contrast, the originator of the concept of abduction---the American scientist/philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce---regarded abduction as an exploratory activity. In this regard, Peirce's insights about reasoning align with conclusions from modern psychological research. Since abduction is often defined as "inferring the best explanation," the challenge of implementing abductive reasoning and the challenge of automating the explanation process are closely linked. We explore these linkages in this report. This analysis provides a theoretical framework for understanding what the XAI researchers are already doing, it explains why some XAI projects are succeeding (or might succeed), and it leads to design advice.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Recent success in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) allow problem solving automatically without any human intervention. Autonomous approaches can be very convenient. However, in certain domains, e.g., in the medical domain, it is necessary to enable a domain expert to understand,               why               an algorithm came up with a certain result. Consequently, the field of Explainable AI (xAI) rapidly gained interest worldwide in various domains, particularly in medicine. Explainable AI studies transparency and traceability of opaque AI/ML and there are already a huge variety of methods. For example with layer-wise relevance propagation relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network which caused a result, can be highlighted. This is a first important step to ensure that end users, e.g., medical professionals, assume responsibility for decision making with AI/ML and of interest to professionals and regulators. Interactive ML adds the component of human expertise to AI/ML processes by enabling them to re-enact and retrace AI/ML results, e.g. let them check it for plausibility. This requires new human–AI interfaces for explainable AI. In order to build effective and efficient interactive human–AI interfaces we have to deal with the question of               how to evaluate the quality of explanations               given by an explainable AI system. In this paper we introduce our System Causability Scale to measure the quality of explanations. It is based on our notion of Causability (Holzinger et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev Data Min Knowl Discov 9(4), 2019) combined with concepts adapted from a widely-accepted usability scale.},

  abstract = {The lack of explainability of a decision from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based "black box" system/model, despite its superiority in many real-world applications, is a key stumbling block for adopting AI in many high stakes applications of different domain or industry. While many popular Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods or approaches are available to facilitate a human-friendly explanation of the decision, each has its own merits and demerits, with a plethora of open challenges. We demonstrate popular XAI methods with a mutual case study/task (i.e., credit default prediction), analyze for competitive advantages from multiple perspectives (e.g., local, global), provide meaningful insight on quantifying explainability, and recommend paths towards responsible or human-centered AI using XAI as a medium. Practitioners can use this work as a catalog to understand, compare, and correlate competitive advantages of popular XAI methods. In addition, this survey elicits future research directions towards responsible or human-centric AI systems, which is crucial to adopt AI in high stakes applications.},

  abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such ‘multilayer’ features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize ‘traditional’ network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

This review concentrates on visual recognition as the model system for developing and testing ideas about the role and mechanisms of top-down predictions in the brain. We cover relevant behavioral, computational and neural aspects, explore links to emotion and action preparation, and consider clinical implications for schizophrenia and dyslexia. We then discuss the extension of the general principles of this proposal to other cognitive domains.},

  abstract = {Understanding the recommendations of an artificial intelligence (AI) based assistant for decision-making is especially important in high-risk tasks, such as deciding whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. To foster user understanding and appropriate trust in such systems, we assessed the effects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods and an educational intervention on AI-assisted decision-making behavior in a 2~×~2 between subjects online experiment with N=410 participants. We developed a novel use case in which users go on a virtual mushroom hunt and are tasked with picking edible and leaving poisonous mushrooms. Users were provided with an AI-based app that showed classification results of mushroom images. To manipulate explainability, one subgroup additionally received attribution-based and example-based explanations of the AI’s predictions; for the educational intervention one subgroup received additional information on how the AI worked. We found that the group that received explanations outperformed that which did not and showed better calibrated trust levels. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the educational intervention, domain-specific (i.e., mushroom) knowledge, and AI knowledge had no effect on performance. We discuss practical implications and introduce the mushroom-picking task as a promising use case for XAI research.},

After changing our software engineering mode to agile, we wanted to find out if people experienced more or less stress than before. This study is based on a company-wide survey of 466 software engineering practitioners. We asked about their subjective feelings about stress, empowerment, and performance in their respective engineering teams after they had started to use agile methods. The results reveal that the feelings of higher performance improvement and sustainable pace are related, and that this difference is statistically significant. Respondents who feel that their team is empowered also feel less stress. However, no significant difference in feelings of stress and empowerment was found between respondents working in Kanban and Scrum mode after transition to agile. The group that was improving its performance because of agile was also reporting a better workload balance. The group that was experiencing worse performance because of agile methods was also more stressed. The differences may be explained by the management styles being practiced in the teams. The results are important as those verify in industrial setting what some agile books suggest: limiting workload and team empowerment has an impact on performance and stress. This contributes to our understanding how agile teams should be managed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the current model of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which may be counter-productive to better human decision making. In early decision support systems, we assumed that we could give people recommendations and that they would consider them, and then follow them when required. However, research found that people often ignore recommendations because they do not trust them; or perhaps even worse, people follow them blindly, even when the recommendations are wrong. Explainable artificial intelligence mitigates this by helping people to understand how and why models give certain recommendations. However, recent research shows that people do not always engage with explainability tools enough to help improve decision making. The assumption that people will engage with recommendations and explanations has proven to be unfounded. We argue this is because we have failed to account for two things. First, recommendations (and their explanations) take control from human decision makers, limiting their agency. Second, giving recommendations and explanations does not align with the cognitive processes employed by people making decisions. This position paper proposes a new conceptual framework called Evaluative AI for explainable decision support. This is a machine-in-the-loop paradigm in which decision support tools provide evidence for and against decisions made by people, rather than provide recommendations to accept or reject. We argue that this mitigates issues of over- and under-reliance on decision support tools, and better leverages human expertise in decision making.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

Thus, this review is necessarily selective. That said, most of the key concepts and issues are expressed in this Report. The Report encapsulates the history of computer science efforts to create systems that explain and instruct (intelligent tutoring systems and expert systems). The Report expresses the explainability issues and challenges in modern AI, and presents capsule views of the leading psychological theories of explanation. Certain articles stand out by virtue of their particular relevance to XAI, and their methods, results, and key points are highlighted. It is recommended that AI/XAI researchers be encouraged to include in their research reports fuller details on their empirical or experimental methods, in the fashion of experimental psychology research reports: details on Participants, Instructions, Procedures, Tasks, Dependent Variables (operational definitions of the measures and metrics), Independent Variables (conditions), and Control Conditions.},

In homogenates about 15 bands were differentially induced with molecular weights (MW's) of 12, 13, 14, 15, 15.5, 71, 120 and 140 kD, or repressed molecular weights of 12.5, 14.3, 28, 30, 53, 73, 90-105 kD). The effects of castration were reversed by testosterone and dihydrotestosterone but not by oestradiol, progesterone or corticosterone. When the androgen-dependence of proteins was investigated using radioactive methionine the protein spectra showed that about 12 bands with molecular weights of 13, 13.7, 14, 15, 15.5, 16, 20.5, 24, 37, 38.5, 56, 68, 96 and 180 kD were differentially induced or repressed by androgens. Of the induced proteins, those with low molecular weight (12-15.5 kD) were accumulated in significant amounts between 20 days and 30 days, coincident with the pubertal increase of androgens in the seminal vesicles. Those induced proteins with high molecular weight (71, 120 and 140 kD) appeared between 40 days and 60 days. The androgen-repressed proteins were strongly evident in immature males, but disappeared after day 40.},

We present the design of the explanation functionality and the results of an exploratory study to evaluate how students use it, including an analysis of how students’ experience with the explanation functionality is affected by several personality traits and abilities.

Drawing upon the perspectives of transactive memory systems (TMS) and social ties, we propose that TMS mediates the effect of interpersonal trust on team performance. In addition, the centralization of instrumental ties and expressive ties moderates the effect of interpersonal trust and TMS. We capture team performance holistically with solution creativity, team efficiency, and member satisfaction. For hypothesis testing, we collect data based on a term project of app design with 79 teams at a major university in China. Our results show that the centralization of instrumental ties strengthens the relationship between interpersonal trust and TMS. The centralization of expressive ties weakens the relationship between trust and TMS and that between TMS and team performance. The mediating effect of TMS is moderated by the centralization of instrumental and expressive ties.}

  abstract = {We argue that the debate regarding the performance implications of demographic diversity can be usefully reframed in terms of the network variables that reflect distinct forms of social capital. Scholars who are pessimistic about the performance of diverse teams base their view on the hypothesis that decreased network density—the average strength of the relationship among team members—lowers a team's capacity for coordination. The optimistic view is founded on the hypothesis that teams that are characterized by high network heterogeneity, whereby relationships on the team cut across salient demographic boundaries, enjoy an enhanced learning capability. We test each of these hypotheses directly and thereby avoid the problematic assumption that they contradict one another. Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R…D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity. These findings support a recasting of the diversity-performance debate in terms of the network processes that are more proximate to outcomes of interest.},

Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.},

  abstract = {Software development in project teams has become more and more complex, with increasing demands for information and decision making. Software development in projects also hugely depends on effective interaction between people, and human factors have been identified as key to successful software projects. Especially in this context, managing and analyzing social networks is highly important. The instrument of social network analysis (SNA) provides fine-grained methods for analyzing social networks in project teams, going beyond the traditional tools and techniques of project management. This paper examines the importance of the application of SNA in software development projects. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of research on software development projects and social network data published between 1980 and 2019. We identified and analyzed 86 relevant studies, finding that research on software development projects spans the topics of project organization, communication management, knowledge management, version and configuration management, requirement management, and risk management. Further, we show that most studies focus on project organization and that the most common method used to gather social data relies on automated extraction from various software development repositories in the SNA context. Our paper contributes to the software development literature by providing a broad overview of published studies on the use of social networks in helping software development projects. Finally, we identify research opportunities and make suggestions for addressing existing research gaps.},

Such models illustrate the structure of connections and measure the strength of association among elements in a network, and they quantify changes in the composition and strength of connections over time. Importantly, ENA enables comparison of networks both directly and via summary statistics, so the method can be used to explore a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research questions in situations where patterns of association in data are hypothesized to be meaningful. While ENA was originally developed to model cognitive networks—the patterns of association between knowledge, skills, values, habits of mind, and other elements that characterize complex thinking—ENA is a robust method that can be used to model patterns of association in any system characterized by a complex network of dynamic relationships among a relatively small, fixed set of elements.}

  abstract = {Context Lack of coordination may create significant problems between work teams, this problem is even most critical when team workers are geographically distributed as it results in cost increases and delays in the projects. There exists a technique called Socio-Technical Congruence (STC) that aims at helping to measure and control the coordination level existing in an organization at their different levels. Objective The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of socio-technical congruence. The aspects of particular interest for this article are: Socio-Technical Congruence definition, different ways to measure it, available tools to measure or that can help to measure it, the areas of application, its benefits and the case studies that analyze the effects Socio-Technical Congruence has on the organization as regards the products quality and the improvements in performance in the long term development, in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Therefore, companies could use this work as a starting point to apply STC measures in their work teams. Results This paper presents the results of a systematic mapping of Literature about Socio-Technical Congruence (STC) in order to investigate and classify the existing articles and conferences about the subject, as well as summarizing the most important aspects in regards to provide a general overview about the existing studies. Conclusions After analyzing the 40 papers found, we can conclude that there is no one standard measure of socio-technical congruence, although most take the proposal by Kwan et~al. applying adaptations and improvements on it as regards the environment that it will be focused on. In general, most case studies talk about the benefits of STC control in organizations. However, only one paper focus on global software development where the problems of communication, coordination and control are an important risk. Moreover, there are only a few papers that explore the risks of excessively overloading users with coordination iterations when controlling STC. In fact, no case study to examine these risks and their effect on developers’ productivity has been found. The small number of studies found on STC, together with the research gaps we have pointed out, suggest that further investigation on socio-technical congruence is required.},

As hypothesized, individual job performance was positively related to centrality in advice networks and negatively related to centrality in hindrance networks composed of relationships tending to thwart task behaviors. Hindrance network density was significantly and negatively related to group performance.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Teamwork is crucial in software development, particularly in agile development teams which are cross-functional and where team members work intensively together to develop a cohesive software solution. Effective teamwork is not easy; prior studies indicate challenges with communication, learning, prioritization, and leadership. Nevertheless, there is much advice available for teams, from agile methods, practitioner literature, and general studies on teamwork to a growing body of empirical studies on teamwork in the specific context of agile software development. This article presents the agile teamwork effectiveness model (ATEM) for colocated agile development teams. The model is based on evidence from focus groups, case studies, and multi-vocal literature and is a revision of a general team effectiveness model. Our model of agile teamwork effectiveness is composed of shared leadership, team orientation, redundancy, adaptability, and peer feedback. Coordinating mechanisms are needed to facilitate these components. The coordinating mechanisms are shared mental models, communication, and mutual trust. We critically examine the model and discuss extensions for very small, multi-team, distributed, and safety-critical development contexts. The model is intended for researchers, team members, coaches, and leaders in the agile community.},
