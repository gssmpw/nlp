We conduct a systematic and rigorous zero-shot and few-shot commonsense evaluation of large pre-trained LMs, where we: (i) carefully control for the LMs' ability to exploit potential surface cues and annotation artefacts, and (ii) account for variations in performance that arise from factors that are not related to commonsense knowledge. Our findings highlight the limitations of pre-trained LMs in acquiring commonsense knowledge without task-specific supervision; furthermore, using larger models or few-shot evaluation is insufficient to achieve human-level commonsense performance."

Despite LLMs demonstrating significant proficiency in a range of tasks, a comprehensive, large-scale analysis of their temporal reasoning capabilities is missing. Our paper addresses this gap, presenting the first extensive benchmarking of LLMs on temporal reasoning tasks. We critically evaluate 8 different LLMs across 6 datasets using 3 distinct prompting strategies. Additionally, we broaden the scope of our evaluation by including in our analysis 2 Code Generation LMs. Beyond broad benchmarking of models and prompts, we also conduct a fine-grained investigation of performance across different categories of temporal tasks. We further analyze the LLMs on varying temporal aspects, offering insights into their proficiency in understanding and predicting the continuity, sequence, and progression of events over time. Our findings reveal a nuanced depiction of the capabilities and limitations of the models within temporal reasoning, offering a comprehensive reference for future research in this pivotal domain."

abstract = {Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings.ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use.When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies.},

The objective of this task was to develop a system that can differentiate statements that make sense from the ones that don`t. ComVE comprises of three subtasks to challenge and test a system`s capability in understanding commonsense knowledge from various dimensions. Commonsense reasoning is a challenging task in the domain of natural language understanding and systems augmented with it can improve performance in various other tasks such as reading comprehension, and inferencing. We have developed a system that leverages commonsense knowledge from pretrained language models trained on huge corpus such as RoBERTa, GPT2, etc. Our proposed system validates the reasonability of a given statement against the backdrop of commonsense knowledge acquired by these models and generates a logical reason to support its decision. Our system ranked 2nd in subtask C with a BLEU score of 19.3, which by far is the most challenging subtask as it required systems to generate the rationale behind the choice of an unreasonable statement. In subtask A and B, we achieved 96{\%} and 94{\%} accuracy respectively standing at 4th position in both the subtasks."

To clarify the intention for judgment and inject contrastive information for selection, we propose the input reconstruction strategy with prompt templates. Specifically, we formalize the subtasks into the multiple-choice question answering format and construct the input with the prompt templates, then, the final prediction of question answering is considered as the result of subtasks. Experimental results show that our approaches achieve significant performance compared with the baseline systems. Our approaches secure the third rank on both official test sets of the first two subtasks with an accuracy of 96.4 and an accuracy of 94.3 respectively."
