In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to address the following research questions (\textbf{RQs}):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How does PLD perform compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} How well does PLD generalize, align with the theoretical analysis, and what is its time complexity?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} How do the hyperparameters affect the performance of PLD?
\end{itemize}
