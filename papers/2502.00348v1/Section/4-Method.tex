To address the limitations of current denoising techniques~\cite{wang2021denoising, he2024double, gao2022selfguided, lin2023autodenoise}, we conduct a thorough investigation into the underlying causes of the overlap between normal and noisy interactions in the overall loss distribution. Then, we refine existing denoising criteria and introduce a novel resampling strategy for denoising based on users' personal loss distributions, called PLD. Furthermore, we enhance the denoising capability of PLD through rigorous theoretical analysis, resulting in a more robust and effective denoising methodology.
