In this research, we identify the limitations of denoising indicators used in current loss-based denoising methods, particularly the significant overlap between normal and noisy interactions in the overall loss distribution. Our analysis reveals a clear distinction between normal and noisy interactions in users' personal loss distributions. Building on these findings, we introduce a novel denoising strategy, PLD, which incorporates a resampling approach based on users' personal loss distributions. By selectively resampling training interactions, PLD effectively reduces the likelihood of noisy interactions being optimized. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the robustness of PLD and suggesting potential ways to further enhance its performance. Extensive experimental results confirm the strong efficacy and robustness of PLD in denoising recommender systems.
