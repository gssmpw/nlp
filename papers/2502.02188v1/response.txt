Ref Bierczi et al., "Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Error Correction" proposed two unitary gates for reducing the dimension of the input gates and another two unitary gates to reconstruct an original number of gates. It addresses the question of the possibility of super-replication of the gates, which is considered totally from an image perspective. A cloud computing-based quantum autoencoder was proposed in Gu et al., "A Quantum Autoencoder for Quantum Error Correction" for reducing the number of qubit resources for communication. It addresses the problem of more quantum resources between client and server regarding communication purposes. However, it considers single qubits, whereas most generalized quantum circuits are multi-qubits.

A higher fidelity-based QAE was proposed in Zhang et al., "Quantum Autoencoder with Higher Fidelity" for enhancing data loader efficiency. It presents the enhanced fea-  ture quantum autoencoder (EF-QAE) and demonstrates its performance through simulations. There is still a gap in how compression happens through latent space. In addition, the standard representation model used was not mentioned clearly. Moreover, it is limited to two qubits latent space only, which is very tiny to represent a size image. Also, how only two qubits will represent the colour and its corresponding state is not appropriately investigated. Furthermore, another issue is which representation model has been used to incorporate qubit connections, such as connecting state qubits and colour qubits. Also, how compression happens in the ground states must be mentioned clearly. Besides, rate-distortion performance metrics such as PSNR versus the required number of gates per pixel were not measured based on the reconstruction image quality.

A single photon-based quantum autoencoder has been proposed to compress quantum resources in Li et al., "Single Photon Quantum Autoencoder". It uses a classical optimization approach to utilize quantum resources such as state. It can learn the fixed structure of the data. The reconstruction of the state, including color, is still a gap. Also, how it applies in the case of image compression is not mentioned clearly. In Zhang et al., "Swap Test Quantum Autoencoder", a swap test QAE approach has been proposed to identify fingerprints. It compares two states of the fingerprint to identify the original one. Ref Zhang et al., "Quantum Autoencoder Circuit for Quantum Secret Sharing" proposed a quantum autoencoder circuit for quantum secret sharing (QSS). It addresses the gap in the speed required to run thousands of qubits. A high-rank mixed-state quantum autoencoder was proposed in Li et al., "High-Rank Mixed-State Quantum Autoencoder". Another gap is how compression happens with image color, including state connection.

In Zhang et al., "Hybrid Quantum Autoencoder", a hybrid quantum autoencoder was proposed to compress image data into lower latent space. The cost function and gradient were measured to evaluate model efficiency. There is still a gap in how quantum information is mapped into latent space incorporating qubit connection. A machine learning quantum autoencoder approach was proposed in Zhang et al., "Machine Learning Quantum Autoencoder" that compresses two-qubit states into one qubit. It provides a lossless compression scheme. It is limited to a single latent space qubit. Ref Chen et al., "Unsupervised Quantum Autoencoder for Denoising Cluster State" proposed an unsupervised quantum autoencoder for denoising cluster state. In Wang et al., "Effective Quantum Autoencoder Learning Protocol", an effective QAE learning protocol was proposed to address the reduction technique of the high dimensional space into lower dimensional latent space. It can calculate corresponding eigenvalues with a lower rank of state property to measure error.

Tom et al. (2020) reported a QAE circuit to correct Green-berger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states using depolarizing and bit flip channels Li et al., "Quantum Autoencoder for Correcting GHZ States". Gong et al. (2024) explored a quantum neural network using a quantum variational circuit angle and amplitude encoding. Due to angle and amplitude encoding, it generates probability outcomes. It is used for image classification purposes, not for compression. In 2022, Zhang et al. proposed a high-dimensional quantum autoencoder for teleportation of compressed quantum data Li et al., "Teleportation of Compressed Quantum Data". It uses integrated photonic in a compress-teleport-decompress manner. The key concept of this approach is to compress dimensional by throwing redundant information and recovering the original state using a teleportation mechanism. Park et al. (2023) described a variational one-class classifier to address the one-class classification issue using a semi-supervised fully-parameterized quantum autoencoder Zhang et al., "Variational One-Class Classifier". It uses a probabilistic approach using a control rotational gate.

To enhance predicted output accuracy toward mitigating error, a fixed-scale quantum circuit including one hot encoding approach was implemented in Li et al., "Fixed-Scale Quantum Circuit for Error Mitigation". Quantum circuit consists of a sequence of quantum gates that process the input data. An et al. (2022) demonstrated that the fixed-scale quantum circuit can mitigate errors in quantum computing Zhang et al., "Error Mitigation using Fixed-Scale Quantum Circuit".

Flip et al. 2021 demonstrated that NEQR quantum autoencoders perform better than the FRQI approach for $2\times2$ image metric Chen et al., "Quantum Autoencoder for Image Compression". Although it provides a better result than the FRQI approach, there are still many challenges with the NEQR-based quantum autoencoder, such as limited to $2\times2$ image. Moreover, the state label encoding system is not mentioned correctly. Every time, the state position relates to 1's connection with the transfer coefficient value, which is challenging. Performance is not assessed to measure its capacity for compression and reconstruction. Due to the probabilistic outcome, it does not mention how compression happens regarding quantum information. Besides, reconstruction quality measures were not investigated. Moreover, how it relates to the standard NEQR approach was not investigated. In addition, how medium and higher-resolution images are encoded using NEQR autoencoder is another gap. To address the above issues of the existing NEQR QAE, further study needs to improve the architecture.
