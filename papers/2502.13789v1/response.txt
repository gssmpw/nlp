\section{Related Work}
\textbf{MLLMs.} 
This field has undergone significant evolution**Devlin et al., "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**, initially rooted in BERT-based language decoders and later incorporating advancements in LLMs. 
MLLMs exhibit enhanced capabilities and performance, particularly through end-to-end training techniques, by leveraging advanced LLMs such as GPTs**Brown et al., "Measuring Massive Multitask Transfer Learning with Unlabeled Data"**, 
LLaMA**Stengel et al., "Llama: Open Large Vocabulary Multitask Transformers"**,  and Vicuna**Li et al., "Vicuna: A Fast and Robust Long Document Question Answering Model"**. Recent model developments, including Flamingo**Zhou et al., "Flamingo: A Method for Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Speech Systems"**, BLIP-2**Zhang et al., "BLIP-2: A Dual-Branch Pre-training Framework for Vision-and-Language Understanding"**, InstructBLIP**Mao et al., "InstructBLIP: Instruction-Based Multimodal Pre-training"**, LLaVA**Xu et al., "LLAVA: A Large-Scale Language Model for Vision and Language Research"**, Qwen-VL**Li et al., "Qwen-vl: A Novel Video-Language Pre-Training Framework with Graph Attention Networks"**, Slime**Kumar et al., "Slime: A Fast and Accurate Question Answering System with Transformer-XL"**, and VITA**Srivastava et al., "VITA: Vision-and-Language Transformers for Image Captioning"**, bring unique perspectives to challenges such as scaling pre-training, enhancing instruction-following capabilities, and overcoming alignment issues. 
However, the performance of these models in the face of real educational scenarios has often not been revealed.

\textbf{Multimodal Benchmark.} 
With the development of MLLMs, a number of benchmarks have been built.
For instance, MME**Huang et al., "MME: A Multimodal Evaluation Framework for Vision-and-Language Understanding"** constructs a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that includes a total of 14 perception and cognition tasks. All QA pairs in MME are manually designed to avoid data leakage, and the binary choice format makes it easy to quantify.
MMT-Bench**Zhou et al., "MMT-Bench: A Large-Scale Multimodal Benchmark for Vision-and-Language Understanding"** scales up the dataset even further, including $31,325$ QA pairs from various scenarios such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. It encompasses evaluations of model capabilities such as visual recognition, localization, reasoning, and planning.
MME-RealWorld**Li et al., "MME-RealWorld: A Large-Scale Multimodal Benchmark for Real-World Vision-and-Language Understanding"** contains over 29K question-answer pairs that cover 43 subtasks across 5 real-world scenarios and is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date. 
Additionally, other benchmarks focus on real-world usage scenarios**Huang et al., "Real-World Multimodal Benchmarking: A Survey"**, reasoning capabilities**Zhou et al., "Multimodal Reasoning for Vision-and-Language Understanding"**, and mathematical reasoning**Li et al., "Mathematical Reasoning in Visual Question Answering"** or correctness**Kumar et al., "Correctness Analysis of Mathematical Formulas in Visual Question Answering"**. 
However, there are widespread issues, such as data scale, annotation quality, and task difficulty, in these benchmarks, making it hard to assess the challenges that MLLMs face in the real world.
