%\subsection{Research of SFCs in terrestrial or physical network}

% In **Kong, "Resilience Enhancement of Space Information Networks against Cascading Failures"**, the authors aimed to improve the resilience of space information networks against cascading failures. They introduced a failure model, identify satellite load imbalance as a key issue, and developed a gateway layout optimization model using a cuckoo search algorithm.

% In **Li et al., "Cascading Failure Theory for LEO Satellite Network Resilience"**, the authors explored how cascading failure theory can enhance LEO satellite network resilience to cyber attacks, focusing on how initial load and real-time routing affect network stability.

There exist several studies exploring SFC or VNF deployment in SAGIN. For example, the authors in **Wang et al., "Federated Learning for SFC Embedding in SAGIN"** applied federated learning algorithms to address the SFC embedding challenge in SAGIN and adjusted SFC configurations to minimize service blocking rates. The authors in **Zhang et al., "Cyber-Physical System Integration using SDN and NFV"** introduced a cyber-physical system that integrates ground, air, and space layers using software-defined networking (SDN) and NFV techniques. In **Huang et al., "Hierarchical Resource Management Structure for SAGIN"**, the authors proposed a hierarchical resource management structure for SAGIN, which integrated SDN, NFV, and multi-access edge computing to manage heterogeneous network resources. In **Liu et al., "Heuristic Greedy Algorithm for SFC Planning in SAGIN"**, the authors proposed a heuristic greedy algorithm to tackle the SFC planning issue in a reconfigurable service provisioning framework for SAGIN. The work of **Wang et al., "SAGIN Architecture with Edge Intelligence"** proposed a SAGIN architecture with edge intelligence to improve the capabilities of communication, computing, sensing, and storage. It introduced a new deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm for resource allocation and computation offloading. In **Zhou et al., "Service Model for Network Slice Segmentation and Delay Prediction"**, the authors developed a service model by segmenting network slices and suggested an SFC mapping approach based on delay prediction. The authors in **Huang et al., "Dynamic VNF Mapping and Scheduling in SAGIN"** focused on dynamic VNF mapping and scheduling within SAGIN, and proposed two Tabu search-based algorithms for achieving near-optimal solutions. In **Liu et al., "Dynamic Network Architecture for Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Integration"**, the authors proposed a dynamic network architecture for integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, addressing challenges of satellite mobility and communication delays. It optimized the allocation of VNFs among LEO CubeSats using three kinds of heuristic algorithms, achieving the near-optimal performance in simulations. These papers considered various models and algorithms in SAGIN to solve the deployment problems of SFCs or VNFs. However, the resource failures are not well considered, which is an important problem in dynamic SAGIN. In the dynamic network environment, nodes and links are easy to fail due to the environmental uncertainty, resulting in the tasks on nodes and links can no longer be effectively transmitted and processed, respectively.
% However, these studies often overlook the dynamic nature of SAGIN's topology over time, which is a critical aspect that requires further attention.
