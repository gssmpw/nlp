    \textbf{HIGHLIGHTS}
\end{center}


\begin{itemize}
    \item InfiniBand architecture (IBA) is widely used to build the interconnection network at the core of HPC systems.

    \item It is essential to optimize the design and configuration of the interconnection network so that it does not become the bottleneck of the overall system.

    \item Dragonfly topologies have become very popular in the last years because of their low diameter, path diversity, high bisection bandwidth, and good performance/cost ratio.

    \item There are very few studies comparing the performance of the InfiniBand routing engines which could help the network administrators in choosing the most suitable one for Dragonfly networks.

    \item We propose a straightforward method to implement as a routing engine in the InfiniBand control software (OpenSM) the deterministic, minimal-path routing algorithm proposed originally by Kim and Dally for Dragonfly networks. This routing algorithm had not been implemented previously due to some restrictions in the InfiniBand architecture.

    \item We analyze the requirements, pros and cons of all the routing engines available in OpenSM that are suitable for Dragonfly networks, including the one proposed in the paper. We consider the impact of several switch features and constraints in their implementation and performance.

    \item We have evaluated the proposed method, in comparison with other routing engines, in a simulation environment, under synthetic traffic patterns. In addition we have run several applications and benchmarks in a real IBA-based cluster to demonstrate the validity of our implementation.
