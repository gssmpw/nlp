abstract = {We consider the hub label optimization problem, which arises in designing fast preprocessing-based shortest-path algorithms. We give O(log n)-approximation algorithms for the objectives of minimizing the maximum label size (ℓ∞-norm) and simultaneously minimizing a constant number of ℓp-norms. Prior to this, an O(log n)-approximation algorithm was known [Cohen et al. 2003] only for minimizing the total label size (ℓ1-norm).},
