\subsection{Trade-Offs with Existential Bounds}\label{sec:existential}

There are a number of constructive existential results for hopsets that we trade off with our junction tree-based algorithm from Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree} (an $\widetilde{O}(\be n^\epsilon \cdot {\opt})$-approximation) and our star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithm from Section~\ref{sec:star_sampling_rounding} (an $\widetilde{O}(n / \sqrt{\opt})$-approximation) to give approximations in several regimes. 
Our junction tree algorithm gives much better approximations than all other existential results when $\opt$ and $\beta$ are relatively small, so it will be used in the trade off for all regimes. The star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithm gives improved approximations over the junction tree algorithm as ${\opt}$ gets larger. 

\iflong  
We first state a folklore existential bound that we will use throughout. For exact hopsets in both directed and undirected graphs, the following bound is the best-known (and is known to be tight \cite{BH23folklore}). Exact hopsets satisfy any arbitrary stretch, so we can trade off the hopset produced by the folklore existential bound with other algorithms in any regime. For more restricted regimes---specifically for limited stretch, hopbound, and undirected graphs---we will trade off with stronger existential bounds to get improved approximations.

\begin{lemma}
    Given any weighted directed graph $G$ and a parameter $\beta >0$, there is an exact hopset of $G$ with hopbound $\beta$ and size $\widetilde{O}(n^2/\beta^2)$. This hopset can be constructed in polynomial time via random sampling.
\end{lemma}

This implies the following straightforward characterization based on $\opt$, which will allow us to trade the folklore construction off with our other approximation algorithms that also depend on $\opt$.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:existential_folklore}
    There is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(n^2/ (\beta^2 \cdot \opt))$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{corollary}

As $\be$ gets larger, this folklore construction gives improved approximations over the junction tree and star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms, especially when $\opt$ is also relatively large. 


\subsubsection{Directed Hopsets with Arbitrary Distance Bounds}
We trade off our junction-tree and star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms with the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_folklore} folklore approximation to achieve an overall $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:main_result}
    There is a randomized  polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We trade off the junction tree based algorithm from Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree}, the star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms from Section~\ref{sec:star_sampling_rounding}, and the algorithm of Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_folklore} to give an algorithm for directed {\hopset}; that is, we run all three algorithms and return the solution with the minimum cost. The overall approximation ratio of this algorithm, $\al$, is the maximum over all possible $\beta, \opt$ of the minimum cost:
    \begin{align*}
        \al &= \widetilde{O}\left( \max_{\be, {\opt}} \left( \min_{} \left\{ \be n^\epsilon \cdot {\opt}, \mbox{ } \frac{n}{\sqrt{{\opt}}}, \mbox{ }\frac{n^2}{\be^2 \cdot {\opt}}  \right\} \right) \right).                    
    \end{align*}
    
    The value of $\al$ is $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5+\epsilon})$, achieved at $\be = \widetilde{O}(n^{2/5})$, ${\opt} = \widetilde{O}(n^{2/5 - \epsilon})$ (this is also the point at which all three curves intersect). Additionally, each of the three algorithms runs in polynomial-time, so the overall algorithm is polynomial-time.
\end{proof}


When $\beta = \widetilde{O}(n^{2/5})$, the folklore construction gives worse approximations than the trade off between our other algorithms. By just trading off the junction tree and star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms, we achieve a better approximation in this regime.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:small_be_dir_gen}
    When $\be = \widetilde{O}(n^{2/5})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\be^{1/3} \cdot n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}
    When $\be = \widetilde{O}(1)$, Theorem~\ref{thm:small_be_dir_gen} gives an $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-approximation for {\hopset}.
\end{corollary}

We can also get improved approximations in the large $\beta$ setting by trading off the junction tree algorithm with the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_folklore} folklore approximation. Note that because the folklore construction has a better inverse dependence on $\beta$ than the star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithm (in fact, the latter has \textit{no} dependence on $\be$), the folklore construction performs better than star-sampling/randomized rounding when $\be$ is sufficiently large.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:big_be_dir_gen}
    When $\be = \widetilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}( n^{1+\epsilon} / \sqrt{\vphantom{\be^k} \be})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Directed Hopsets with Small Stretch}

For $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate directed hopsets, the best known existential bound is the following:

\begin{lemma}[Theorem 1.1 of~\cite{BW23}]
    For any directed graph $G$ with integer weights in $[1,W]$, given $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and $\beta \geq  20\log n$, there is a $(1+\epsilon)$-hopset with hopbound $\beta$ and size:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^2\log^2(nW)}{\beta^3 \epsilon^2  }\right)$ for $\beta \leq n^{1/3}$,
        \item $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{\frac{3}{2}} \log^2(nW)}{\beta^{3/2} \epsilon^2}\right)$ for $\beta >n^{1/3}$.
    \end{itemize} 
    This hopset can be constructed in polynomial time.
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary} \label{cor:existential_W}
    When $\beta \geq 20\log n$, there is a polynomial-time approximation for directed $(1+\epsilon)$ {\hopset} with approximation ratio:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^2\log^2(nW)}{\beta^3 \epsilon^2 \cdot \opt  }\right)$ for $\beta \leq n^{1/3}$,
        \item $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{\frac{3}{2}} \log^2(nW)}{\beta^{3/2} \epsilon^2 \cdot \opt}\right)$ for $\beta >n^{1/3}$
    \end{itemize}
    where $\epsilon \in (0,1)$.
\end{corollary}

Using the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_W} algorithm, we get an improved approximation for directed {\hopset} when we restrict to $(1+\epsilon)$ stretch. 

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:dir_eps}
    When $\beta \geq 20\log n$ and $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/4 + \epsilon'} \cdot \epsilon^{-\frac{1}{4}})$-approximation for directed stretch-$(1+\epsilon)$ {\hopset}, where $\epsilon' > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The approximation is achieved by trading off the junction tree algorithm of Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree}, the star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms of Section~\ref{sec:star_sampling_rounding}, the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_folklore} folklore algorithm, and the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_W} algorithm. Note that $W = poly(n)$, so the $\log(nW)$ factor is hidden by the $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Undirected Hopsets with Small Stretch}
For \textit{undirected} hopsets with $(1+\epsilon)$ stretch, there is the following constructive existential result.

\begin{lemma}[\hspace{1sp}\cite{elkin2019RNC}] \label{lem:existential_undir_eps}
    For any weighted undirected graph $G$, any integer $\eta \geq 1$, and any $0 < \rho < 1$, there is a randomized algorithm that runs in polynomial time in expectation and computes a hopset with size $O(n^{1 + 1/\eta})$, which is a hopset for any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ with hopbound
    \begin{align*}
        \beta = \left( \frac{\log(\eta) + 1/\rho }{\epsilon}   \right)^{\log(\eta) + \frac{1}{\rho}+1} .
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}

Let $W_0(x)$ be the principle branch of the Lambert $W$ function. When $x \geq 3$, the function is upper bounded by $\ln{x} - (1/2) \ln{\ln{x}}$. The Lemma~\ref{lem:existential_undir_eps} existential result implies the following:

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:existential_undir_eps}
    Let $\eta = \lfloor \beta^{1/W_0(\ln{\beta})} \rfloor > \be^{1/(\ln{\ln{\be}}-\frac{1}{2}\ln{\ln{\ln{\be}}})}$ (inequality holds when $\be \geq 3$). There is a randomized polynomial-time $O(n^{1 + 1/\eta} / {\opt})$-approximation for undirected stretch-$(1+\epsilon)$ {\hopset}, where $\epsilon \in (0,1)$.
\end{corollary}

For some insight into the behavior of $\eta$, note first that for all $\beta \geq 3$, $\eta \geq 6$. Additionally, the $\eta$ function grows faster than $\ln{\be}$, but much slower than $\be$. The Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_undir_eps} construction performs better than the star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms as $\opt$ grows, resulting in improved approximations compared to the directed graph, arbitrary stretch regime when $\be$ is relatively small. 


\begin{theorem} \label{thm:undir_eps}    
    Let $\eta = \lfloor \beta^{1/W_0(\ln{\beta})} \rfloor > \be^{1/(\ln{\ln{\be}}-\frac{1}{2}\ln{\ln{\ln{\be}}})}$ (inequality holds when $\be \geq 3$). When $\beta = \widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2\eta}})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\be} \cdot n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\eta} + \epsilon'})$-approximation for undirected $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch {\hopset}, where $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, and $\epsilon' > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The approximation is achieved by trading off the junction tree algorithm of Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree} with the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_undir_eps} algorithm.
\end{proof}



\subsubsection{Undirected Hopsets with Odd Stretch}

The following result is directly implied by Thorup-Zwick approximate distance oracles.

\begin{lemma}[\hspace{1sp}\cite{TZ05}]
    Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer. For any weighted undirected graph $G$, a stretch-$(2k-1)$ hopset with hopbound $2$ and size $O(kn^{1+1/k})$ can be found in polynomial-time.
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary} \label{cor:existential_undir_k}
    Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer. There is a polynomial-time $O(kn^{1+1/k} / {\opt})$-approximation for undirected stretch-$(2k-1)$ {\hopset}.
\end{corollary}

We can use Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_undir_k} to get an improved approximation (over the directed graph, arbitrary stretch setting) for undirected stretch-$(2k-1)$ {\hopset} when $\be$ is relatively small.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:undir_gen_stretch}
    Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer. When $\be = \widetilde{O}(k^{-1/2} \cdot \, n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}}) $, there is a polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k \be \vphantom{\be^k}} \, \cdot \, n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2k} + \epsilon})$-approximation for undirected stretch-$(2k-1)$ {\hopset}, where $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The approximation is achieved by trading off the junction tree algorithm of Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree} and the Corollary~\ref{cor:existential_undir_k} algorithm.
\end{proof}

\else 
We trade off a folklore existential result for directed, exact hopsets, along with the existential results of \cite{BW23} (directed, $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch), \cite{EN19} (undirected, $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch), and \cite{TZ05} (undirected, odd stretch) to get improved approximations over the general problem in these regimes. We also note that a trade off can be done with the existential results of~\cite{BP2020} for improved approximations in the constant stretch, $\Omega(\log n)$-hopbound regime for undirected graphs. Further discussions of each trade-off can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:tradeoffs}.

\subsubsection{Directed Graphs with Arbitrary Distance Bounds}
We trade off our junction tree and star-sampling/randomized-rounding algorithms with the folklore construction to achieve the following for directed {\hopset}:
\begin{restatable}{thm}{mainResult}
\label{thm:main_result}
    There is a randomized  polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{restatable}

Where $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. When $\beta$ is smaller, the folklore construction gives worse approximations than the trade-off between our other algorithms. In this regime, we achieve a better approximation:
\begin{restatable}{thm}{smallBeDirGen} \label{thm:small_be_dir_gen}
    When $\be = \widetilde{O}(n^{2/5})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\be^{1/3} \cdot n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{restatable}
 
We also get improved approximations in the large $\beta$ setting by trading off just the junction tree algorithm with the folklore construction:
\begin{restatable}{thm}{bigBeDirGen} \label{thm:big_be_dir_gen}
    When $\be = \widetilde{\Omega}(n^{2/5})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}( n^{1+\epsilon} / \sqrt{\vphantom{\be^k} \be})$-approximation for directed {\hopset}.
\end{restatable}


\subsubsection{Directed Hopsets with Small Stretch}
Using the existential bound of~\cite{BW23}, we get an improved approximation for directed {\hopset} when we restrict to $(1+\epsilon)$ stretch. 
\begin{restatable}{thm}{dirEps} \label{thm:dir_eps}
    When $\beta \geq 20\log n$ and $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/4 + \epsilon'} \cdot \epsilon^{-\frac{1}{4}})$-approximation for directed stretch-$(1+\epsilon)$ {\hopset}, where $\epsilon' > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
\end{restatable}


\subsubsection{Undirected Hopsets with Small Stretch}
Let $W_0(x)$ be the principle branch of the Lambert $W$ function, which is upper bounded by $\ln{x} - (1/2) \ln{\ln{x}}$ when $x \geq 3$. With the existential bound of~\cite{EN19}, we get the following:
\begin{restatable}{thm}{undirEps} \label{thm:undir_eps}    
    Let $\eta = \lfloor \beta^{1/W_0(\ln{\beta})} \rfloor > \be^{1/(\ln{\ln{\be}}-\frac{1}{2}\ln{\ln{\ln{\be}}})}$ (inequality holds for $\be \geq 3$). When $\beta = \widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2\eta}})$, there is a randomized polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\be} \cdot n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\eta} + \epsilon'})$-approximation for undirected $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch {\hopset}, where $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, and $\epsilon' > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
\end{restatable}
For some insight into the behavior of $\eta$, note first that for all $\beta \geq 3$, $\eta \geq 6$. Additionally, the $\eta$ function grows faster than $\ln{\be}$, but much slower than $\be$.


\subsubsection{Undirected Hopsets with Odd Stretch}
Trading off with the existential result of~\cite{TZ05}, we get the following:
\begin{restatable}{thm}{undirGenStretch} \label{thm:undir_gen_stretch}
    Let $k \geq 1$ be an integer. When $\be = \widetilde{O}(k^{-1/2} \cdot \, n^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}}) $, there is a polynomial-time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k \be \vphantom{\be^k}} \, \cdot \, n^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2k} + \epsilon})$-approximation for undirected stretch-$(2k-1)$ {\hopset}, where $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant.
