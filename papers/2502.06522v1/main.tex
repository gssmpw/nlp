\section{Introduction}

A hopset $H$ with hopbound $\beta$ and stretch $\alpha$ for a given (directed or undirected) graph $G$ is a set of (possibly weighted) edges such that between every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ there is a path with at most $\beta$ hops in $G \cup H$ that approximates the distance between $u$ and $v$ up to multiplicative stretch $\alpha$ (our results hold for a more generalized version of the problem formally defined in Definition \ref{def:gen_hopset}). A related object is shortcut sets, which preserve \emph{reachability} via low-hop paths, rather than distances.
Hopsets were formally introduced 25 years ago by Cohen~\cite{cohen2000}, and they were used to compute approximate single-source shortest paths in undirected graphs in parallel settings.  More recently, they have been shown to be useful for a variety of different problems and settings, and have been studied extensively.  Examples of these applications include low parallel depth single-source shortest paths algorithms \cite{klein1997, cohen2000, miller2015, elkin2019RNC}, distributed shortest-paths computation \cite{elkin2019journal, elkin2017, censor2021}, and dynamic shortest-paths \cite{bernstein2011,henzinger2014, gutenberg2020, chechik2018, LN2022} with implications for fast static flow-based algorithms \cite{madry2010, bernstein2021deterministic, chen2022maximum} and dynamic clustering \cite{cruciani2024dynamic}, faster construction of related objects such as distributed or massively parallel distance sketches \cite{elkin2017, dinitz2019, DM24}, parallel reachability \cite{ullman1990high}, and work-efficient algorithms for reachability and directed shortest paths \cite{cao2020efficient, cao2020improved, cao2023exact,fineman2018nearly,jambulapati2019parallel}.


In addition to their wide range applications, hopsets and shortcut sets are also studied as fundamental objects in their own right. There has been a surge of recent work that, rather than focusing on running time, focuses on finding the best \emph{existential} (extremal) upper or lower bounds for hopsets and shortcut sets \cite{KP22,BW23, hesse2003directed, huang2021lower, kogan2023towards,  williams2024simpler}. 
Namely, the main goal is to find the smallest value $\gamma(n,\beta, \alpha)$ such that \emph{every} graph $G$ on $n$ nodes admits a hopset with hopbound $\beta$ and stretch $\alpha$.

Another line of work has explored the connections between hopsets and many other fundamental objects such as spanners \cite{BP2020, abboud2018}, emulators \cite{elkin2020survey, huang2019}, and distance preservers \cite{KP2022hope, hoppenworth2025, bodwin2023bridge}.


The two main existing lines of work in this direction are on finding efficient algorithms for constructing hopsets in various computational models for specific applications, or on existential bounds and structural properties.
Such results are very useful, since they give us a \emph{worst-case bound} on how many edges we must add to an arbitrary graph if we want a hopset of a certain quality and how fast can this be done for our particular application.  The focus in these results has been on improving these existential bounds and developing fast algorithms for a variety of different settings and parameters; see Section \ref{sec:related_work} for a discussion of known results of this form.

A complementary type of problem with a very different flavor is \emph{optimization}: \emph{given} a graph $G$, hopbound $\beta$, and stretch bound $\alpha$, can we design an algorithm to efficiently find the smallest hopset \emph{for $G$} (rather than in the worst case over all graphs)?  If the minimization problem is NP-hard, then can we \emph{approximate} the smallest hopset for $G$?  Note that the existential and optimization versions of these problems are complementary: good existential bounds guarantee that no matter the graph $G$, there will be a reasonably small hopset; conversely, good optimization results guarantee that we can find an approximately minimum hopset, even if the best hopset for $G$ is significantly smaller than for the worst-case graph.  An existential bound might convince someone to use a hopset for some application---since they know they will never need to add too many edges---but once they commit to using a hopset for that application, they might naturally want to find the best hopset for their particular input. Additionally, in many distributed and parallel settings, adding hopset edges can be seen as a preprocessing step (that can take considerable time), after which (approximate) distance queries can be performed in fewer distributed/parallel rounds (often corresponding to the hopbound). Thus in such cases, we may be willing to spend more preprocessing time in order to add the fewest number of edges.

This natural complementarity between the existential and optimization versions has led to significant study of \emph{both} versions for a number of related objects, most notably graph spanners (subgraphs that approximately preserve distances).  For spanners, while the vast majority of work has been on the existential questions (see, e.g., \cite{ADDJS93} for the fundamental tradeoff between stretch and size), there has also been significant work on the optimization versions (see, e.g., \cite{KP94,KP98,Kor01,EP07,DK11,BBMRY11,DKR16,DNZ20,GKL23,CD16,CDKL20,GLQ21,CDK12,CDR19}).  Similarly, there has also been work on optimization versions of other related objects such as reachability preservers\cite{abboud2024reachability}, 2-hop covers \cite{CHHZ2003}, and diameter reduction\cite{demaine2010minimizing}.

Despite both the recent importance of hopsets and the extensive study of optimization for related objects, the optimization version of hopsets has not yet been considered.  In this paper we initiate this line of research, introducing these optimization variants and proving both upper and lower bounds on their approximability. 

\subsection{Our Results and Techniques}
There are many variants of this problem, divided along three main axes: whether the graph is directed or undirected, what the desired hopbound $\beta$ is, and what the required stretch is (and in particular whether it is arbitrary or whether it is in some particularly nice regime like $1+\epsilon$ for small $\epsilon$ or $2k-1$ for integer $k$).  A summary of our results for these variants can be found in Table~\ref{tab:results}.

\subsubsection{Upper Bounds}
While this list may appear a bit complex, it turns out that almost all of the results are generated by trading off several approximation algorithms that we design and analyze with the known existential bounds for the given regime.  In particular, we consider three main approximation algorithms: one based on rounding an LP relaxation, one based on randomly sampling stars, and one based on defining and analyzing an appropriate variant of junction trees \cite{GKL23, GKL24, CDKL20}.  Instead of just analyzing the approximation ratio of each algorithm as a function of $n$ (the traditional point of view), we analyze the approximation ratios as functions of $n$, $OPT$, $\beta$ and the \emph{local neighborhood size}~\cite{DK11,BBMRY11}.  Importantly, none of these algorithms have performance that depends on whether the graph is undirected or directed, or what the allowed stretch is.  

To get the results in Table~\ref{tab:results}, we trade these three algorithms off not only with each other based on the described parameters, but also with the known existential bounds.  Unsurprisingly, there are different existential bounds known for each setting.  These different existential bounds are what lead to each of the different rows of Table~\ref{tab:results}.

\paragraph{Technical Overview.}  Technical components of our main approximation algorithms have appeared before, in particular, in the literature on approximation algorithms for spanners.  The LP rounding algorithm we use is a variant of the one introduced for spanners by~\cite{BBMRY11}, our star sampling is a variant of the arborescence sampling used by~\cite{DK11}, and our junction tree algorithm is a variant of the junction trees used by~\cite{CDKL20} and~\cite{GKL23}.  But using them for hopsets involves overcoming a number of technical difficulties.

First, and most notably, the performance bound on arborescence sampling used by~\cite{DK11,BBMRY11} fundamentally depends on the fact that for traditional graph spanners, the required connectivity implies that $\opt \geq n-1$, and hence polynomial size bounds of the form $n^{\gamma}$ can be interpreted as $n^{\gamma-1} \cdot \opt$, i.e., as $n^{\gamma -1 }$-approximations.  But for hopsets, since we are adding edges rather than removing them, this is not the case: the only bound we have is the trivial bound of $\opt \geq 1$ (or else we are already done).  Hence bounds that are sublinear for spanners (e.g., the $O(n^{1/2})$-approximation of~\cite{BBMRY11}) turn into \emph{superlinear} approximation ratios if translated to hopsets in the obvious way.  These are still nontrivial bounds, in the sense that the trivial bound for hopsets is an $O(n^2)$-approximation  ($\opt \geq 1$ and we can just add all pairwise edges to get a solution of size $O(n^2)$), but superlinear approximation ratios are not particularly satisfying. This is why we need different algorithms for various regimes of $\opt$.
By combining the star sampling and randomized LP rounding we get an approximation bound that is comparatively better for cases where $\beta$ is small and $\opt$ is large. On the other hand, our junction tree algorithm performs better when $\opt$ is smaller.  

Second, while the LP relaxation that we use for our rounding algorithm is a natural variant of the standard spanner LP relaxation (see~\cite{DK11,BBMRY11,DNZ20}), the hopset variant turns out to be significantly more difficult to solve.  Most notably, solving the equivalent LP relaxations for spanners (either the flow version of~\cite{DK11} or the fractional cut version of~\cite{DNZ20}) requires using the ellipsoid method with a separation oracle for a problem known as Restricted Shortest Path, in which we are given two distance metrics (think of one metric as being our original edge lengths and one metric as being the fractional values given by the LP to edges) and are asked to find the shortest path in the second metric subject to a distance constraint in the first metric.  Unfortunately, Restricted Shortest Path is NP-hard, but it turns out that one can use approximation algorithms for Restricted Shortest Path to solve the LP up to any desired accuracy (see~\cite{DK11}).  But for our hopset LP, the equivalent separation oracle has \emph{three} metrics (the original edge lengths, the number of hops, and the LP values), and we need to find the shortest path in the third metric subject to upper bounds in the first two metrics.  So we need to design a PTAS for this more complex problem in order to solve our LP.

Third, for similar reasons our junction tree argument is more complex. Junction trees were originally introduced for network design problems where the only constraints are on connectivity, not distances; see, e.g., \cite{CEGS11}.  By reducing to a ``layered'' graph, Chlamt\'a\v{c} et al.~\cite{CDKL20} showed that junction tree-based schemes are also useful in distance-constrained settings, and this layering technique was pushed significantly further by~\cite{GKL23}.  When trying to use these ideas for hopsets, though, we have the same difficulty as when solving the LP: we have essentially \emph{two} distance constraints for each demand, corresponding to the number of hops and the allowed distance.  To overcome this, we give a ``two-stage'' layering reduction, where we first construct a layered graph that allows us to get rid of the hop requirement without changing the distance requirements.  Then we can use the further layered graph of~\cite{GKL23} to get rid of the distance requirement, transforming it into a pure connectivity problem.  In fact, we can use~\cite{GKL23} as a black-box for this second step.

The black-box nature of our use of~\cite{GKL23} has an interesting corollary: even without caring about junction trees, the layered graph reduction we design will immediately let us use the known results for pairwise spanners \cite{GKL23} (by considering them on the \textit{weighted transitive closure}) to get a non-trivial approximation guarantee for our full problem. However this reduction introduces additional factors in $\beta$, which we improve by white-boxing their approach, which will in turn give us a better trade-off in combination with the other algorithms.


\subsubsection{Lower Bounds}

To complement our upper bounds, we show that (at least for directed graphs) we cannot hope to get approximation ratios that are subpolynomial.  In particular, we give an approximation-preserving reduction from the famous Label Cover problem (or more precisely, its minimization variant Min-Rep~\cite{Kor01}) to the problem of computing the smallest hopset in a directed graph with hopbound at least $3$, for any stretch value.  This gives the following theorem.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:LB-main}
    Assuming that $NP \not\subseteq DTIME(2^{polylog(n)})$, for any constant $\epsilon > 0$, and for any $\beta \geq 3$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can approximate directed {\hopset} (for any stretch value) or the minimum shortcut set on directed graphs with approximation ratio better than $2^{\log^{1-\epsilon} n}$.
\end{theorem}

Our reduction is quite similar to known hardness reductions used for spanners~\cite{Kor01,EP07,DKR16,CD16}.  The main difficulty is that these previous reductions, since they are for spanners, only have to reason about \emph{subgraphs} of the graph created by the reduction.  That is, given an instance of Min-Rep, they create some graph $G$ and argue that if the Min-REP optimum is large then any subgraph of $G$ that is a spanner must be large.  But for hopsets, not only are the edges of $G$ ``free,'' we also need to argue about hopset edges that \emph{are not} part of $G$.  This requires some changes in the reductions and analysis. The full reduction and details can be found in \iflong Section \else Appendix \fi \ref{app:hardness}.



\subsection{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

In earlier applications, sparse $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate hopsets for undirected graphs were used to obtain low parallel depth single-source shortest paths algorithms \cite{klein1997, cohen2000, miller2015, elkin2019RNC}. Similarly, fast hopset constructions for undirected graphs were studied in many other settings such as distributed \cite{elkin2019journal, elkin2017, censor2021, elkin2017, dinitz2019, DM24} and dynamic settings \cite{bernstein2011,henzinger2014, gutenberg2020, chechik2018, LN2022}.

Another line of work focuses on fast computation of hopsets for directed graphs and shortcut sets that preserve pairwise reachability, rather than distances, while reducing the diameter. These have gained attention particularly due to their application in parallel reachability and directed shortest path computation \cite{ullman1990high, cao2020efficient, cao2020improved, cao2023exact, fineman2018nearly,jambulapati2019parallel}.

More recently, hopsets and shortcut sets have been studied from an extremal (or existential) point of view.
In particular, for $(1+\epsilon)$-hopsets, there are almost (up to $1/\epsilon$ factors) matching upper bounds \cite{elkin2019journal, huang2019} and lower bounds \cite{abboud2018} in \emph{undirected graphs}. One trade-off that is widely used in $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest paths applications is that for any graph, there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-hopset of size $n^{1+o(1)}$ with hopbound $n^{o(1)}$.  On the other hand, \cite{abboud2018} showed that there are instances in which this trade-off is tight. For larger stretch, better size/hopbound trade-offs are known.

In directed graphs there are polynomial gaps between existential lower bounds and upper bounds, both for approximate hopsets and shortcut sets. A widely used folklore sampling approach implies an $\widetilde{O}(n)$ size for exact hopset and shortcut sets, with hopbound $O(\sqrt{n})$ \footnote{The upperbounds for directed hopsets and shortcut sets give a smooth trade-off between size and hopbound. For simplicity, we discuss the important linear-size regime.}.
A breakthrough result of \cite{KP22} went beyond this long-standing bound by constructing shortcut sets of size $\widetilde{O}(n)$ with hopbound $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. 
Later, \cite{BW23} showed that the same upper bound also holds for directed $(1+\epsilon)$-hopsets (up to log factors in weights and aspect ratio). More on these existential bounds can be found in Section \ref{sec:existential}, where we trade them off with our approximation algorithms\iflong \else, and in Appendix~\ref{app:tradeoffs} \fi. Another line of work focused on obtaining subsequently better existential lower bounds for directed graphs \cite{hesse2003directed, huang2021lower, kogan2023towards,  williams2024simpler}. The current best known lower bound for a linear size shortcut set is $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/4})$ \cite{BH23folklore, williams2024simpler}. 

Another recent result \cite{BH23folklore} showed that for \textit{exact hopsets} both in directed and undirected \textit{weighted} graphs, the folklore sampling (see Section \ref{sec:existential}) is existentially optimal, implying that the separation between approximate hopsets for directed and undirected graphs, does not hold for exact hopsets.


On the approximation algorithms side, most relevant to hopsets are the weighted pairwise spanner algorithms \cite{GKL23}, and 2-hop covers \cite{CHHZ2003}. In particular, weighted pairwise spanners (like hopsets and unlike $k$-spanners) do not have $n$ as a trivial lower bound on $\opt$, and hence some of the difficulties encountered when designing algorithms are similar. 


Approximation algorithms for 2-hop covers~\cite{CHHZ2003}, hub labelings~\cite{CHHZ2003,BGGN17}, and 2-spanners \cite{KP94,DK11} in particular are closely related to our hopbound $2$ regime (see \iflong Section~\ref{sec:2hop}\else Appendix~\ref{app:2hop}\fi).  In all of these problems, the requirement of covering using 2-paths leads to algorithms that are essentially solving some variant of Set Cover.  Our situation is similar, so we can use similar techniques, but our Set Cover variant is slightly different from these other problems, most notably because we do not ``pay'' for edges that already exist in the graph. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminaries}
Formally, we consider the following problem:

\begin{definition}[\hopset]\label{def:gen_hopset}
    Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, edge weights (or ``lengths") $\ell : E \rightarrow \{1,2,3,...,\texttt{poly}(n) \}$, a set of vertex pairs $\mathcal D \subseteq V \times V$, and a distance bound function $Dist: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$, find the smallest set of edges $H$ such that for each vertex pair $(s,t) \in \mathcal{D}$, it is the case that $d_G(s,t) \leq d^{(\beta)}_{H \cup G}(s,t) \leq Dist(s,t)$. In other words, there must be an $s-t$ path $P$ in $H \cup G$ such that $|P| \leq \beta$ and $\sum_{e \in P} \ell(e) \leq Dist(s,t)$.
\end{definition} 


If $G$ is directed, we say that the problem of interest is \textit{directed} {\hopset}; otherwise it is \textit{undirected} {\hopset}. Additionally, if for all $(s,t) \in \mathcal{D}$ we have that $Dist(s,t) = k \cdot d_G(s,t)$ for some $k$, then this is the \textit{stretch-$k$} {\hopset} problem. Note that {\hopset} is a generalized version of the traditional hopset problem: all of our results hold for \textit{any} set of vertex demand pairs, and many of our results hold for arbitrary distance bound functions.

${\opt}$ to refer to the cost of the optimal solution to the {\hopset} problem instance. That is, {\opt} will refer to the number of edges in the optimal hopset. A path is an \textit{$i$-hop path} if there are exactly $i$ edges on the path. We also say that a demand $(s,t) \in \mathcal{D}$ is \textit{settled} or \textit{satisfied} by a graph $G$ (or an edge set $E$) if there is a path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$ (in $E$) with at most $\be$ hops and distance at most $Dist(s,t)$. Otherwise, demand $(s,t)$ is considered \textit{unsettled} or \textit{unsatisfied}. 

Going forward, we will generally operate on what we call the \textit{weighted transitive closure} of $G$, defined as follows. Let $d_G(s,t)$ denote the distance in $G$ from $s$ to $t$.

\begin{definition}[Weighted Transitive Closure] \label{def:trans_closure}
    The weighted transitive closure of a graph $G$, denoted by $G_M = (V, E_M)$, is the weighted graph obtained by first taking the transitive closure of $G$, then assigning weight $d_G(u,v)$ to each edge $(u,v)$ in the transitive closure. We use $\widetilde{E} = E_M \setminus E$ to denote the set of edges in the weighted transitive closure that are not provided in the input $G$. 
\end{definition}

Note that the weighted transitive closure of a graph can be found in polynomial-time. When working in the weighted transitive closure, we will generally assign costs to the edges in $G_M$: edges in $E$ will have cost $0$, while edges in $\widetilde{E}$ will have cost $1$. It is easy to see that {\hopset} on $G$ is equivalent to finding a min-cost subgraph of $G_M$ that settles all demand pairs. We will use $c(F)$ to denote the \textit{cost} of an edge set $F$; namely, $c(F) = |F \cap \widetilde{E}|$ is the number of edges in $F$ not provided in the input. 
Finally, we will assume each edge $(u,v) \in E$ in the input is a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.

\section{Approximation for Hopbound 2} \label{sec:2hop}
When the hopbound is $2$, we can get improved bounds by using the hopset version of a spanner approximation algorithm.  Interestingly, while we will require the hopbound to be $2$, we can handle arbitrary distance bound functions (including exact hopsets, $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch hopsets, and larger stretch hopsets), in contrast with the spanner version which requires all edges to have unit length and requires the \emph{stretch} to be at most $2$.

 
We use a version of the LP rounding algorithm for stretch $2$ from~\cite{DK11}.  In particular, we first solve our LP relaxation~\eqref{lp:hopset} to get an optimal solution $\bm{\mathrm{x}}$, and then round as follows.  First, every vertex $v \in V$ chooses a threshold $T_v \in [0,1]$ uniformly at random.  We then return as a hopset the set of edges $E' = \{(u,v) : \min(T_u, T_v) \leq (c \ln n) \cdot x_{(u,v)} \}$, where $c$ is an appropriately chosen constant. 

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:2hop-cost}
    %$\E[|E' \setminus E|] \leq O(\ln n) \cdot \opt$
    $\E[c(E')] \leq O(\ln n) \cdot \opt$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Fix some $e = (u,v) \in \widetilde{E}$. 
    Clearly $\Pr[e \in E'] \leq (2c\ln n) x_e$, and hence $\E[c(E')] \leq \sum_{e \in \widetilde{E}} (2c\ln n) x_e \leq (2c \ln n) \cdot \opt$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:2hop-correct}
$E'$ is a valid hopset with high probability.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Fix some $(u,v) \in V \times V$.  If $x_{(u,v)} \geq 1/(c \ln n)$ then our algorithm will directly include the $(u,v)$ edge.  So without loss of generality, we may assume that $x_{(u,v)} \leq 1/2$.  As discussed, our LP~\eqref{lp:hopset} is equivalent to the flow LP, and hence $\bm{\mathrm{x}}$ supports flows $f : \mathcal P_{u,v} \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{P \in \mathcal P_{u,v}} f_P \geq 1$.  Since $\beta = 2$ and $x_{(u,v)} \leq 1/2$, this means that $\sum_{P \in \mathcal P_{u,v} \setminus \{(u,v)\}} f_P \geq 1/2$, i.e., at least $1/2$ flow is sent on paths of length $2$ in $\mathcal P_{u,v}$.  Let $W \subseteq V \setminus \{u,v\}$ be the set of nodes that are the middle node of such a path, and for each $w \in W$ let $P_w$ denote the path $u-w-v \in \mathcal P_{u,v}$.

    Fix $w \in W$.  Note that if $T_w \leq (c \ln n) f_{P_w}$ then our algorithm will include the path $P_w$, since the $\bm{\mathrm{x}}$ variables support the flow $f$.  Hence the probability that we fail to include every path $P \in \mathcal P_{u,v}$ is at most
    \begin{align*}
        \prod_{w \in W} (1-(c\ln n) f_{P_w}) \leq \exp\left(-\sum_{w \in W} (c \ln n) f_{P_w}\right) \leq \exp(-(c \ln n) (1/2)) = n^{-c/2}.
    \end{align*}
    
    We can now take a union bound over all $(u,v) \in V \times V$ to get that the probability that $E'$ is not a valid hopset is at most $n^{2-(c/2)}$.  Hence by changing $c$, we can make the failure probability $1/n^{c'}$ for arbitrarily large constant $c'$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:2hop-main}
    There is an $O(\ln n)$-approximation algorithm for {\hopset} when $\be = 2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This is directly implied by Lemmas~\ref{lem:2hop-cost} and \ref{lem:2hop-correct}.

\section{Approximation Algorithms for General Hopbounds}
Continuing the connection to spanners, there is a reduction from {\hopset} to the directed pairwise weighted spanner problem (where ``weighted" refers to edge costs). The most general version of this problem, studied by~\cite{GKL23}, allows for any demand set, any positive rational edge costs, integer edge weights in $\texttt{poly}(n)$, and arbitrary distance bound functions. The reduction starts with the transitive closure $G_M$, and builds a layered graph with $\beta + 1$ copies of each node in $G_M$, and $\be$ copies of each edge (see Section~\ref{sec:layered_reduction} for a more detailed description of the reduction). Since~\cite{GKL23} achieved an $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for directed pairwise weighted spanners, this reduction immediately gives an $\widetilde{O}((\be n)^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for {\hopset}. 

In this section, we improve upon this result and get an $\widetilde{O}(n^{4/5 + \epsilon})$-approximation for {\hopset}, removing the dependence on $\be$. We will give approximation algorithms in terms of $n, \be, {\opt}$, and ``local neighborhood size." All of our algorithms are based on spanner algorithms, and we must modify them (and provide different analyses) to accommodate the hop constraint. We will then trade these algorithms off with known existential hopset results to get approximations (in terms of $n$ and $\be$) in many regimes, including the general setting (directed graphs, arbitrary stretch), and in more restricted settings, such as small and large hopbound, and specific stretch regimes. The approximation  we get in any given regime will be a function of how good the existential bounds are for that regime, so better existential results will result in better approximations.

Our first algorithm, the junction tree algorithm of Section~\ref{sec:junction_tree}, will perform best when ${\be}$ and ${\opt}$ are relatively small. Our second and third algorithms, the star sampling and randomized LP rounding algorithms of Section~\ref{sec:star_sampling_rounding}, will together give better approximations as ${\opt}$ gets larger. 
\iflong\else We also give an $O(\log n)$-approximation for hopbound $2$, which we defer to Appendix~\ref{app:2hop}.\fi
