abstract = {In the generalized connectivity problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph G = (V,E) and a collection D = {(S1, T1), …, (Sk, Tk)} of distinct demands each demand (Si,Ti) is a pair of disjoint vertex subsets. We say that a subgraph F of G connects a demand (Si, Ti) when it contains a path with one endpoint in Si and the other in Ti. The goal is to identify a minimum weight subgraph that connects all demands in D. Alon et al. (SODA '04) introduced this problem to study online network formation settings and showed that it captures some well-studied problems such as Steiner forest, facility location with nonmetric costs, tree multicast, and group Steiner tree. Obtaining a nontrivial approximation ratio for generalized connectivity was left as an open problem. We describe the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for generalized connectivity that has a performance guarantee of O(log2 n log2 k). Here, n is the number of vertices in G and k is the number of demands. We also prove that the cut-covering relaxation of this problem has an O(log3 n log2 k) integrality gap.Building upon the results for generalized connectivity, we obtain improved approximation algorithms for two problems that contain generalized connectivity as a special case. For the directed Steiner network problem, we obtain an O(k1/2 + ϵ) approximation which improves on the currently best performance guarantee of \~{O}(k2/3) due to Charikar et al. (SODA '98). For the set connector problem, recently introduced by Fukunaga and Nagamochi (IPCO '07), we present a poly-logarithmic approximation; this result improves on the previously known ratio which can be Ω(n) in the worst case.},
