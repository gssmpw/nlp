\begin{abstract}
Device sizing is crucial for meeting performance specifications in operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), and this work proposes an automated sizing framework based on a transformer model. The approach first leverages the driving-point signal flow graph (DP-SFG) to map an OTA circuit and its specifications into transformer-friendly sequential data. A specialized tokenization approach is applied to the sequential data to expedite the training of the transformer on a diverse range of OTA topologies, under multiple specifications. Under specific performance constraints, the trained transformer model is used to accurately predict DP-SFG parameters in the inference phase. The predicted DP-SFG parameters are then translated to transistor sizes using a precomputed look-up table-based approach inspired by the $g_m/I_d$ methodology. In contrast to previous conventional or machine-learning-based methods, the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in both speed and computational efficiency by reducing the need for expensive SPICE simulations within the optimization loop; instead, almost all SPICE simulations are confined to the one-time training phase. The method is validated on a variety of unseen specifications, and the sizing solution demonstrates over 90\% success in meeting specifications with just one SPICE simulation for validation, and 100\% success with 3--5 additional SPICE simulations. 
% \redHL{Can we quantify ``small'' -- e.g., ``after 3-5 iterations''? Can we change ``iteration'' to ``SPICE simulation''?\textbf{YES, How about ``additional'' with that?}}

% \redHL{The number of references is quite small and most of the last page is blank. This was understandable when you were page-limited, but it looks bad when the last page is mostly blank. (Don't you think about these things without being told?) I have tried to mitigate this by using the full form of each journal/conference to take up more space (also changed to IEEEtran instead of ieeetr2, which allows me to turn off ``{\em et al.}''). I am not even sure you have run a good enough literature review. There are no references from Helmut Graeb's group, and he has done a LOT of work on OTAs -- missing his work is a glaring omission. Nothing from Georges Gielen's group. Plus I am sure there are other groups you have missed. {\bf Please answer this question: have you really made the effort to read all papers on OTA sizing?} I suspect not. Don't you think 2 years is enough time to show the will to conduct a full literature review? What do you do with your time??} SSS_NOTE

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Please use $\sqrt{xyz}$ instead of $\sqrt xyz$. Your sqrt sign only appears over x if you do the latter.
% \item Please number the first equation in Sec IIIA.
% \item Please use $\log$ instead of log within an equation.
% \item Also use $\left ( and \right )$ in scenarios where the parentheses are too small, e.g., in (2).
% \item Please double-check that notation is suitably italicized in the text, (e.g., use $B$ in the line after eq. (1) instead of B; there are several other instances).
% \item When you write "where..." after an equation, it is a continuation of the sentence that contains the equation. So, you should use no indentation and should not capitalize it ("Where...")
% \item Remove single period that is alone on a line after the P\_NOISE equation.
% \item PJ -> pJ
% \item Never start a sentence with "E.g" - it just does not work that way. Use "For example, ..." if you need to say that.
% \item I assume you will do this anyway, but just to be complete
% Pay attention to figure sizes, text readability, etc.
% \item Make your captions more descriptive (e.g., all figures on p4 have very short/insufficiently descriptive captions). Check all figures.
% \item Check for "( xxx" - extra space after "(" - this is a common issue in your writing and easy to fix with search-replace.
% \item There are numerous easy-to-find issues in the reference section (capitalization problems, at least one incorrect journal name, capitalization problems in the month, etc.)
