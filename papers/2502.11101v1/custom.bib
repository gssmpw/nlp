    abstract = "Extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for numerous applications. However, the considerable computational cost of transformers, coupled with limited generalization of positional encoding, restricts the size of their context window. We introduce Cross-Attention to Parallel Encodings (CAPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs for context expansion. CAPE leverages a small encoder to process a long input chunk by chunk and enables the frozen decoder to cross-attend to the additional contexts. CAPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, CAPE extends the context window of LLaMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering $10\times$ of the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CAPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CAPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CAPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models with only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLaMA-2-Chat, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long context on downstream tasks."

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

    abstract = "While recent language models have the ability to take long contexts as input, relatively little is known about how well they use longer context. We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models."
