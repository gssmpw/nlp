Early practices for modeling irregular time series with missing values typically relied on fixed-time discretization. In this context, ____ ignores the timestamp information by treating all intervals as equal, ____ considers missing data as an effective feature for learning, 
% ____ employs Gaussian processes to model missing data and high uncertainty in real-world situations, 
and ____ segments the data into evenly spaced time intervals. In contrast, GRU-D ____ employs a gated network and incorporates imputation of missing values into the optimization process. Unlike previous methods, it adopts an additional missing value mask and lag matrix as inputs. Similar strategy have been adopted in ____, where adversarial frameworks are utilized to enhance the prediction of imputed values. 

Some recent approaches have leveraged attention mechanisms to improve modeling. For instance, SeFT ____ introduces a set of differentiable set functions and uses attention mechanisms to aggregate embeddings of different variables. ContiFormer ____, on the other hand, combines neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with attention mechanisms based on continuous-time dynamics, extending the relationship modeling capabilities of Transformers to the continuous time domain. Besides, DNA-T ____ utilizes a deformable attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the receptive field, enabling more effective handling of local features and short-term correlations. Warpformer ____ also considers multi-scale features by applying a warping module to achieve multi-grained representations. Unlike previous methods that adopt a sequence modeling perspective, ViTST ____ transforms the signals into RGB images and utilizes a pre-trained Swin Transformer for further classification and regression.

\subsection{Modeling Time Series as Images}
Transforming time series data into images has gained significant attention with the advancements in visual detection frameworks. Some approaches ____ plot time series directly as time-observation representations and utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for downstream tasks. Generally, they do not apply special processing to the sequences, instead focusing on leveraging visual frameworks to better capture temporal patterns in visualized sequences. ViTST ____ is another similar case that extends further to multivariate sequences and discusses the impact of visualization parameters such as color, markers, and order. 

In contrast, other methods emphasize the modeling of time series, which requires more specialized design and expert knowledge. ____ utilizes an iterative filtering (IF) approach to produce different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from EEG signals. Empirically, these transformed features often fit the task better than the original signals. Chong et al. ____ and Deng et al. ____ model sequences based on time segmentation, calculating time-invariant features and transforming them into corresponding RGB images. Similarly, frequency domain modeling, as demonstrated by TimesNet ____, has also proven effective. By utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT) to concatenate signal of different time periods, it constructs a 2D representation optimized for CNNs. Finally, other methods model the relative relationships between points in a time series. Examples include Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and recurrence plot ____. Typically, these methods involve applying a reversible time coordinate transformation and calculating the correlations between points, effectively capturing the continuity and periodic characteristics of the sequences.
