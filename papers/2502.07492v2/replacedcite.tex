%Deep learning-based methods avoid manual feature extraction by directly analyzing raw byte sequences or disassembly opcode n-grams ____ in an end-to-end manner. Models such as CNN ____ and LSTM ____ improve classification accuracy by learning representations from raw data. 

% Identifying the groups behind Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) malware is key to comprehending the motivations and tactics of these actors ____. Traditional manual attribution was reliant on the in-depth expertise of cybersecurity professionals, making it a technically demanding and time-consuming endeavor ____. In recent years, automatic group attribution techniques that employ machine learning-based malware analysis have garnered significant research interest. These techniques are generally divided into dynamic and static analyses. Dynamic techniques focus on tracking malware runtime behaviors like process activities and network operations ____ and function invocation sequences ____. Yet, they require a virtual environment and are inefficient against certain malware evasions. Static methods bypass these issues by analyzing malware code without execution. In this research, we focus on static methods. 

% Early static attribution works harness static malware file features, such as PE-headers and import tables, and leverage conventional Random Forest (RF) models for classification ____. Subsequent works delve into various static features and more machine learning models. Laurenza et al. extract such statistical features as section table count and resource count, and create an RF classifier ____. Wei et al. extract API system calls as malware features, and adopt LSTM with attention mechanisms for feature vectorization ____. Taking a distinct approach, Liu et al. focus on attributing particular malware functions to APT groups. They extract sequences from the disassembled code, vectorize the control flow graph, and utilize LSTM to generate function embedding ____. Recently, Song et al. have extracted the disassembly codes from APT malware and employed an LSTM encoder to analyze n-gram opcode sequences for group attribution ____.

% While the existing machine learning-driven malware attributions are promising, they come with inherent limitations. Firstly, their dependence on feature engineering necessitates constant manual adjustments, risking the omission of subtle yet vital features and introducing biases. Secondly, these techniques often overlook evasion tactics, notably the deployment of `false flags' by malicious actors, which compromises attribution robustness. Thirdly, there's a potential for enhanced accuracy in these models, especially considering the attribution challenges posed by shared tools among APT groups. In contrast, our research introduces a specialized end-to-end attribution model for raw-byte APT malware. Designed for adversarial robustness and accuracy, our approach bypasses the complexities of feature engineering.

% Malware detection serves as a binary classification task, distinguishing between benign and malicious software. Employing raw-binary detectors allows for direct raw data processing, bypassing traditional manual feature engineering. This approach is simpler, adaptable, and can discern intricate patterns often overlooked in traditional methods. In recent years, raw-binary malware detection methods have grown popular ____. It deals with the code data as it is, catching little details that other methods might miss (such as code images, or opcode sequences). 

% Early attempts at classifying malware through raw bytes focus on the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) method ____, but it had its drawbacks, especially in supervised settings ____. A significant shift in this domain is the introduction of the MalConv model, a pioneering method that utilizes the 1D-CNN to directly process raw byte sequences, showcasing unique neural network designs for better results ____. Notably, studies by firms like Avast revealed that MalConv could match, and sometimes even surpass, the effectiveness of hand-crafted detection features ____. However, due to memory constraints, MalConv is restricted to a maximum file size of 2MB, which could compromise its performance and expose it to threats in adversarial settings. Raff et al. propose the fixed-memory convolution, which harnesses the sparsity of temporal max pooling to decouple memory usage from time series length, optimizing memory efficiency and training speed ____. They introduce a global channel gating (GCG) design equipped with an attention mechanism, enabling the capture of feature interactions over prolonged periods, surpassing 100 million time steps ____. Malconv with GCG not only addresses memory constraints faced by earlier techniques but also boosts the malware detection model's accuracy by up to 2\%. 

% In this study, we address malware attribution as a multi-classification problem. Drawing inspiration from the malware detection model, MalConv with GCG, we aim to construct an raw-binary multi-class attribution model.

FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) offers a fast, single-step adversarial training approach. In the malware domain, Slack-FGSM and Append-FGSM apply adversarial bytes to slack space or the end of PE files ____, while extensions apply adversarial bytes to additional regions, such as the full DOS header or shifted sections ____. However, single-step FGSM methods are vulnerable to multi-step attacks. To mitigate this, multi-step adversarial training methods like PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) ____ are employed in malware classification, although they incur considerable training overhead ____.
