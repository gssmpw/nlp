\caption{\textbf{Impact of using random sampling strategy instead of class-balanced sampling.} As highlighted in the long-tail analysis in Appendix \ref{long_tail}, random sampling can lead to class underrepresentation, potentially affecting the correlation between upstream and downstream tasks. Notably, both ANI-1x and Transition-1x exhibit different patterns compared to the class-balanced values reported in the main paper.}

\section{Long-Tail Analysis}
\label{long_tail}
As discussed in Section \ref{3_setup}, molecular understanding datasets are typically imbalanced and exhibit a skewed distribution. Figure \ref{fig:upstream_sampling} illustrates the effect of \textit{random sampling} versus \textbf{class-balanced sampling}, which we employ in this study, in terms of class coverage. Notably, random sampling results in significant class underrepresentation, whereas class-balanced sampling ensures broader coverage across all classes.
