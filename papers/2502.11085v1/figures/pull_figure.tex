\caption{\textbf{Pretraining on a High-Quality, Task-Relevant Dataset.} Pretraining on a carefully selected high-quality dataset achieves comparable or superior mean absolute error (MAE) across tasks while reducing computational cost by a factor of 24 compared to JMP-S, which is pretrained on all upstream datasets. Lower MAE indicates better performance.}
