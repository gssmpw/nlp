\section{Limitations and future work}

Our methods currently rely on calibrated cameras for reconstruction. However, the dense correspondences could be used to recover the relative camera poses, up to a scale ambiguity. We did not explore this as part of this paper, as our evaluations are against Foot3D, requiring accurate camera scale and pose. This approach is implemented in the code released alongside this paper, and can be run on an arbitrary set of uncalibrated images.

\ourOptim does not leverage the image surface normal predictions, as there is no simple mapping from TOC to surface normals, and so would require differentiable rendering. Modifying the approach to use surface normals could improve accuracy, at the cost of computation time. Similarly, \ourSfM does not use the predicted TOC uncertainty, as we did not find it to improve the reconstruction. Future research could identify an approach to use this signal to improve \ourSfM's reconstruction.\\
