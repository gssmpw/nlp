\begin{abstract}
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and implicit DPO reward margins.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.  Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.

\section{Conclusion}
Our research bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and data-focused approaches in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment by systematically examining how preference data quality affects Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data and introduce a dual-margin-based strategy for selecting high-quality training examples. This approach not only improves model performance but also significantly increases computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments show that the method maintains or enhances performance while using just around 10\% of the original training data, demonstrated through consistent improvements on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Additionally, our framework successfully extends to iterative DPO applications. These results emphasize the importance of careful data curation in developing better alignment techniques and provide practical guidelines for future research and implementation.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of  Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}
