\section{Conclusion}
We propose BeamVQ, a unified framework for spatio-temporal forecasting in data-scarce settings. By combining VQ-VAE with beam search, BeamVQ addresses limited labeled data, captures extreme events, and maintains physical consistency. It first learns main dynamics via a deterministic base model, then encodes predictions with Top-K VQ-VAE to produce diverse, plausible outputs. A joint optimization process guided by domain-specific metrics boosts accuracy and extreme event sensitivity. During inference, beam search retains multiple candidate trajectories, balancing exploration of rare phenomena with likely system trajectories. Extensive experiments on weather and fluid dynamics tasks show improved prediction accuracy, robust extreme state detection, and strong physical consistency. Ablation studies confirm the crucial roles of vector quantization and beam search in enhancing performance.
