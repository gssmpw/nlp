abstract = {In order to reduce driving risk in the rainfall days, developing the variable speed limits (VSL) is effective. However, it is hard to develop suitable VSL aligning with travel speed of mainstream that it affected by the traffic flow, rainfall intensity, individual travel speed, peak hours, working days, random events, and so on. In this paper, the average travel speed and traffic flow of each road section are calculated from the toll collection data of Xiâ€™an Ring Road from May to July in 2018 in Shaanxi Province, China. The weather data are collected and extrapolated to the corresponding road sections. Travel speed, traffic flow, and rainfall intensity are integrated to predict the fluctuation trend of travel speed through the proposed deep belief-radial basis function network. The experimental results show that a significant decrease happens in the travel speed in the rainfall day during peak hours. Furthermore, the deep learning algorithm that considers more factors such as the rainfall intensity and traffic flow could improve the prediction accuracy. Then, a VSL method and an expressway risk coefficient evaluation method based on estimation of average travel speed are proposed. The experimental results show that the variable 85th percentile speed limit method proposed in this paper can reduce the risk of expressway driving. This can promote road safety in the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) in future.},

abstract = {Traffic anomaly detection is an essential part of an intelligent transportation system. Automatic traffic anomaly detection can provide sufficient decision-support information for road network operators, travelers, and other stakeholders. This research proposes a novel automatic traffic anomaly detection method based on spatial-temporal graph neural network representation learning. We divide traffic anomaly detection into two steps: first is learning the implicit graph feature representation of multivariate time series of traffic flows based on a graph attention model to predict the traffic states. Second, traffic anomalies are detected using graph deviation score calculation to compare the deviation of predicted traffic states with the observed traffic states. Experiments on real network datasets show that with an end-to-end workflow and spatial-temporal representation of traffic states, this method can detect traffic anomalies accurately and automatically and achieves better performance over baselines.},
