\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we systematically evaluate Android malware detection
models across four datasetsâ€”three publicly available and one
systematically collected Google Play-only dataset. We assess the
performance of both deep learning (DL) and traditional machine
learning (ML) models. After implementing additional models for each
proposed DL approach on each dataset, our results show that while DL
models achieve strong performance, % particularly when app patterns
% shift in the data. However,
simpler and computationally efficient ML
models% , which are often overlooked,
can achieve comparable or even
superior performance. These findings emphasize the importance of
extensive benchmarking in Android malware detection research. We
encourage future studies to conduct more comprehensive evaluations
between advanced DL models and traditional ML models to provide a more
accurate assessment of detection capabilities. Additionally, we
advocate for releasing datasets used in research to facilitate further
research, enabling deeper exploration and new discoveries in this
field. 
We will publicly release our dataset upon the publication of the paper.
