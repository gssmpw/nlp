We propose a simple model of the growth of higher-order networks over time.    
    Although this model has only a small number of parameters, we mathematically demonstrate that it reproduces several realistic features in real-world hypergraph datasets. 
    We also develop a scalable algorithm for efficiently fitting our model to large hypergraphs, and show that the model makes accurate predictions about the likely evolution of the network. 
    Our results highlight the power of modeling simple microscale properties in studying the macroscale structure of complex higher-order data.
