We implemented our model and performed experiments using the XGI package \cite{landryXGIPythonPackage2023} for higher-order network analysis in  Python. 
The XGI package also makes available the datasets used in our experiments. (We conducted experiments using all datasets provided in the XGI package.)
Code sufficient to fully reproduce our experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/hexie1995/HyperGraph}.
