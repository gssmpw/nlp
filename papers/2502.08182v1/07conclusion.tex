This paper presents \sys, a memory offloading mechanism
for LLM serving that meets latency SLOs while maximizing the host 
memory usage. 
%
\sys captures the tradeoff between meeting SLOs and maximizing host memory usage 
with \interval, an internal tunable knob. 
%
In addition, \sys automatically decides the optimal \interval, \ie, the smallest \interval that meets SLOs, with a two-stage tuning approach.  
%
The first stage assumes bandwidth contention and profiles the GPU model offline, and generates a performance \record that, for any valid combination of SLOs, sequence lengths, and batching sizes, stores an optimal \interval,
%
The second stage adjusts the \interval for GPU instances sharing the bus to ensure that the SLOs can still be met while maximizing the aggregate host memory usage across all GPU instances. 
%
Our evaluation shows that \sys consistently maintains SLO under various runtime
scenarios, and outperforms \flexgen in throughput by 1.85\X, due to use 2.37\X more host memory.
