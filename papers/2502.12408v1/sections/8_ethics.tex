\section{Ethics Statement}\label{sec:ethics_statement}

\paragraph{Data Collection and Release.} The datasets used in our experiments consist of publicly available ASR data from both benchmark and in-the-wild sources, as detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:datasets}. We ensure that the use of these datasets aligns with the principles of fair use, specifically in a non-commercial academic context or as specified in their original license. All datasets are openly accessible, and no private or confidential data is included in this work to the best of our knowledge. 

\paragraph{Intended Use.} By enabling the approximation of ASR performance metrics with minimal data, our work has the potential to impact applications in domains with limited data availability, such as healthcare, emergency response, and low-resource language research. We believe our approach will foster further research in scalable, low-cost ASR systems with comprehensive evaluation, benefiting industries and research areas that serve underrepresented or resource-limited populations.

\paragraph{Potential Misuse and Bias.} While our regression model has demonstrated effectiveness in approximating ASR metrics, it is important to consider potential misuse and bias. Given that our model is trained on diverse datasets, including those with various linguistic, acoustic, and demographic variations, there is a risk that the model may inherit biases present in the data, particularly with respect to accents, dialects, and socio-linguistic factors. Additionally, as our model approximates error rates, it could be misused in applications where the approximation may not be sufficient for real-world critical tasks. We recommend cautious deployment and further evaluation in sensitive applications, especially those where fairness and accuracy are critical.
