\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}
In this work, we introduced a framework for approximating ASR metrics, evaluated across various ASR models and datasets. Despite the promising results, there are several limitations to consider.

\noindent\textbf{Evaluation.} While our evaluation setup is comprehensive, consisting of over 40 models and 14 datasets representing various acoustic and linguistic conditions such as natural noise, dialects, and accents—far surpassing previous works—we have not explored more nuanced conditions such as gender, non-native speech, and approximation across various age groups. Additionally, while the framework has demonstrated strong performance in approximating ASR metrics across multiple datasets, its generalization to highly diverse or extreme real-world conditions might still require further investigation.

\noindent\textbf{Language.} Furthermore, the evaluation is currently limited to a single language; expanding this framework to multiple languages or achieving language-agnostic ASR metric approximation remains an important direction for future work.

\noindent\textbf{Compute.} While, unlike previous works, our final approximator is a simple machine learning model that does not require GPUs to run, we do utilize a single GPU for multimodal embedding extraction, which could be performed on any consumer-grade GPU.
