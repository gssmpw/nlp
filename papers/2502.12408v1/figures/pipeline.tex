    \caption{High-level diagram for our framework. The proxy is an ASR model that takes input speech and generates a transcription. We use the output from the source model as a hypothesis, and the output from the proxy model as a reference, to calculate metrics like WER and CER (p{metrics}), which we denote as pWER and pCER. We then use this, along with the the similarity between SONAR embeddings of the input speech and the hypothesis, to train the regression that gives approximated metrics (a{metrics}), e.g., aWER/aCER.}
