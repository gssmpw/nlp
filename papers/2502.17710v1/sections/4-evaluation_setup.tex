\section{Experimental Setup}

To showcase one of the use cases of our \offHandsDataset dataset, we conduct investigations focused on cross-cultural gesture understanding in AI systems, specifically T2I models, LLMs, and VLMs. 


\subsection{Evaluation Strategies}

Motivated by real-world applications of AI systems, we employ two types of evaluation strategies to assess models’ ability to interpret gestures across cultural contexts (see Table~\ref{tab:prompt-examples}):
\paragraph{Explicit Mention} Here, we evaluate whether models correctly interpret gestures when referenced directly -- via specific gesture names, physical descriptions, or images, depending on the model type. This setting is motivated by cross-cultural applications such as marketing and advertising, where an accurate understanding of gestures across countries is crucial. For instance, when generating advertising content for Turkey featuring a group of people showing an ``OK'' gesture, models should be able to recognize its potential homophobic connotations and flag the request (see Table~\ref{tab:examples}). 



We test this through:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Country Prompt}: Prompts explicitly specify the country and the gesture.
    \item \textbf{Country + Scene Prompt}: Provide additional context via specific usage scenarios, involving certain demographic attributes, and scene descriptions. 
\end{enumerate}

To generate gesture-specific scene descriptions, we aggregated annotator-provided meanings and context descriptions. With this, we use GPT-4 to generate scenarios in the template  `A \{demographic\} person showing \{gesture\} in \{country\} in \{scene\}', prioritizing hateful/offensive/rude human-annotated contexts for offensive gestures and appropriate contexts for non-offensive ones. The first author manually verified and edited all generations. See Appendix Figure \ref{fig:prompt_scene} for prompt details.

      %\saadia{You originally said "in general," but that sounds more like you did a control and they flagged everything, so I changed this to "across regions." Also this should be a full width figure.}
    \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Implicit Mention}  Here, we test whether models default to US-centric interpretations when gestures are referenced through their neutral or positive US meanings. This setting is motivated by AI applications in travel and education, where gestures meant to communicate universal values may vary across cultures. For instance, while wishing good luck is universal, the gesture used varies across cultures; if a user asks how to wish someone good luck in Vietnam, a model should avoid suggesting US-centric gestures (e.g., fingers crossed) that may carry unintended negative connotations. We apply this evaluation to the subset of $n=10/25$ gestures in the \offHandsDataset that carry benign interpretations in US contexts.





\subsection{Model-Specific Design Considerations}

\paragraph{Prompt Details}  
The following prompt designs are employed for each model type:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
    \item T2I systems: Explicit prompts include the canonical and alternate gesture names.\footnote{We deliberately excluded gesture descriptions, as they resulted in mutilated hand images in the outputs of both models.}
    \item LLMs: Explicit prompts specify the gesture's canonical name, alternate names, and physical description. We evaluate two settings: (1) single-turn prompts, and (2) a two-turn Chain-of-Thought setup \cite{wei2022chain} getting meaning in first-turn, and then offensiveness classification in the second. 
    \item VLMs: Explicit and Implicit prompts have no gesture details in the textual inputs. Instead, the manually scraped images of gestures are used as visual inputs.
\end{itemize}
Each prompt design under each type of model has two rephrases to ensure robustness of evaluation. See Appendix \ref{app:prompt_varations_all} for all prompt details.  


\paragraph{Explicit Mention Evaluation Metrics}

We measure model understanding of gesture offensiveness through complementary metrics. For T2I systems, we examine rejection rates -- the proportion of generation requests blocked by safety systems. For LLMs and VLMs, models classify gestures into four categories (Hateful, Offensive, Rude, Not Offensive), which we then map to `Generally Offensive' and `Not Offensive'.


Across all three models, we measure \textit{Recall} (true positive rate; TPR) (correct identification of offensive gestures) and \textit{Specificity} (true negative rate; TNR) (correct identification of non-offensive gestures). A culturally safe system should have \textit{high} scores on both these measures.


\paragraph{Implicit Mention Evaluation Metrics}

For T2I systems, we measure the error rate, i.e., the proportion of generated images that depict US-specific gesture interpretations in regions where they are offensive. 
For instance, we prompt the model to generate a gesture for a given intent (e.g., ``wishing someone luck in Vietnam'') and count it as an error if the image depicts the US interpretation (e.g., crossed fingers), which is offensive in that country.  We use \texttt{gpt-4o} to classify the presence of such gestures in the outputs. 
Similarly, for LLMs, \texttt{gpt-4o} is used to detect whether these gestures are suggested. For VLMs, yes/no responses about the appropriateness of gestures are converted into error rates. We observe high agreement for \texttt{gpt-4o}-as-a-judge, validated through human evaluation. Refer to Appendix \ref{app:gpt4o-judge} for setup details.





\paragraph{Models considered}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=2pt]
    \item T2I: We evaluate two closed-source models, DALLE-3 \cite{betker2023improving} and Imagen 3 \cite{baldridge2024imagen}.\footnote{Open-source models like Stable Diffusion \cite{podell2023sdxl},  Playground, and Realistic Vision are excluded due to poor hand and finger generation quality in preliminary tests.}

    \item LLM: We evaluate Llama-3.1 (8B, 70B-Instruct) \cite{dubey2024llama}, gemma (2b, 7b-it) \cite{team2024gemma}, Qwen2.5 (7B, 14B, 32B, 72B-Instruct)\footnote{\url{https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}}, and gpt-4 (0613).\footnote{ \url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4}} 

    \item VLM: We evaluate InstructBLIP \cite{dai2023instructblip},  llava-1.5-7b \cite{liu2024improved}, Llava-Next (llava-v1.6-mistral-7b) \cite{liu2024llavanext}, paligemma-3b-mix-224 \cite{beyer2024paligemma}, chameleon-7b \cite{team2024chameleon},  Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct,\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct}} Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct,\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct}} gpt-4o.\footnote{ \url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o}} 

\end{itemize}
We use default parameters for T2I models, with \texttt{person\_generation = allow\_adult} for Imagen 3 and \texttt{style=natural} for DALLE-3.\footnote{For each prompt design and country-gesture pair, we generate 6 images (2 prompt variations × 3 runs).} We set temperature to $0.0$ for LLMs and VLMs. 
%Each prompt design under each model has two variations.
