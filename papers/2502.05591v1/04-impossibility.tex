\section{Lower Bound}

We first discuss a lower bound on the number of rounds needed to achieve $\approximateagreement$ on trees. Fekete \cite{Fekete90} has studied the \emph{performance} achieved by $\approximateagreement$ protocols on $\realvalues$, i.e. \emph{how close} the honest values may get after $R$ rounds.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 15 of \cite{Fekete90}]
\label{thm:fekete-lowerbound}
Let $\Pi$ denote an arbitrary deterministic $R$-round protocol achieving Validity and Termination on $\realvalues$. Then, if honest parties' inputs range is $[a, b]$, there is an execution where two honest parties outputs' $v$ and $v'$ satisfy $\abs{v - v'} \geq K(R, b - a)$, where:
\begin{align} \label{eq:fekete-performance}
    K(R, \diameter) \geq \diameter \cdot \frac{\sup \{\roundT_1 \cdot \roundT_2 \cdot ... \cdot \roundT_R : \roundT_1 + \roundT_2 \cdots + \roundT_R \leq t\}}{(n + t)^R} \geq \diameter \cdot \frac{t^R}{R^R \cdot (n + t)^R}.
\end{align}
\end{theorem}

The proof of \cite{Fekete90} assumes an $R$-round protocol given in the \emph{full-information form}: in the first round, each party sends its input value to everyone. In each of the next $R - 1$ rounds, the parties send their current views to all parties. Afterwards, each party obtains its output by applying a function $f$ on its final view. For each distribution $\{\roundT_1, \roundT_2, \ldots, \roundT_R :  \roundT_1 + \roundT_2 \cdots + \roundT_R \leq t\}$, the proof of \cite{Fekete90} builds a chain of $s \leq \frac{(n + t)^R}{\roundT_1 \cdot \roundT_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot \roundT_R}$ \emph{consecutive} views where the parties start with inputs in $\{a, b\}$. Two views are consecutive if there is some execution where two honest parties obtain those views. In these views, $\roundT_i$ roughly represents the number of byzantine parties that deviate from the protocol for the first time in round $i$. The first view is built to lead to output $a$ (due to Validity), while the last view leads to output $b$ (also due to Validity). This implies that there are two consecutive views leading to two honest outputs $v, v' \in \realvalues$ with $\abs{v - v'} \geq (b - a) / s$.

The proof can be adapted to paths and trees immediately, by replacing the input values $a$ and $b$ with vertices (endpoints of the longest path in the tree). This leads us to the corollary below.
\begin{corollary}\label{corollary:fekete-bound}
 Let $\Pi$ denote an arbitrary deterministic $R$-round protocol achieving Validity and Termination on an input tree $\tree$. 
 Then, there is an execution where two honest parties' outputs $v$ and $v'$ satisfy $d(v, v') \geq K(R, \diameter(\tree))$, where $K(R, \diameter(\tree))$ is described in \Cref{eq:fekete-performance}. 
\end{corollary}

\Cref{corollary:fekete-bound} gives us a lower bound on the number of rounds needed to achieve $\approximateagreement$ on trees. In the following Theorem we will refine this bound under the assumption that a constant fraction of the parties is corrupted. The proof is outsourced to \Cref{appendix:lower-bound}.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{FeketeCorollary}\label{thm:fekete-lowerbound-trees}
    If $t = \theta(n)$, every deterministic protocol achieving $\approximateagreement$ on tree $\tree$ has round complexity $\Omega\left(\frac{\log \diameter(T)}{\log \log \diameter(T)}\right).$
\end{restatable}
