\section{Related work}
\paragraph{Real values.}
The problem of $\approximateagreement$ was first introduced for real values by Dolev, Lynch, Pinter, Strong, and Weihl____. This initial work investigated the feasibility of achieving $\approximateagreement$ on $\realvalues$, both in the synchronous model and in the asynchronous model (where messages get delivered \emph{eventually}). Concretely, ____ has presented a synchronous protocol resilient against $t < n / 3$ corruptions, which is optimal in settings with no cryptographic assumptions, and an asynchronous protocol resilient against $t < n/5$ corruptions. The condition $t < n / 3$ has been later proven to be sufficient and necessary in the asynchronous by Abraham, Amit, and Dolev____. Under cryptographic assumptions, the necessary and sufficient condition in the synchronous model becomes $t < n / 2$ ____. Moreover, the work of ____ has provided tight conditions for achieving $\approximateagreement$ on real values in the \emph{network-agnostic} model, presenting a protocol achieving $\approximateagreement$ up to $t_s$ corruptions if it runs in a synchronous network, and up to $t_a$ corruptions if it runs in an asynchronous network if the necessary condition $2 \cdot t_s + t_a < n$ holds.

Each of these protocols requires $O(\log(b - a) / \varepsilon)$ rounds of communication if the honest parties' inputs are in $[a, b]$: roughly, each iteration halves the honest values. The work of ____ has also shown that such \emph{convergence factor} is optimal for a specific class of protocols where parties do not use information obtained in the prior iterations. The works of Fekete ____ investigate this further and provide lower bounds on \emph{how close the honest values' may get} after $R$ rounds, considering various kinds of failures (crashes, omission, byzantine), both in the synchronous model and in the asynchronous model. The lower bound in asynchrony under byzantine failures matches the convergence factor of $1/2$ per round/iteration obtained by asynchronous $\approximateagreement$ protocols. On the other hand, in the synchronous model with byzantine failures, ____ shows that any $R$-round $\approximateagreement$ protocol reduces the honest values' range by a (multiplicative) factor of at least $K(R) \geq \frac{t^R}{R^R \cdot (n + t)^R}$ as opposed to the factor $2^{-R}$ obtained by prior $R$-iteration $\approximateagreement$ protocols. The lower bound $K(R)$ is known to be asymptotically tight: ____ has provided an asymptotically matching protocol assuming $t < n / 4$, with message complexity $O(n^R)$. Later, ____ has improved the resilience threshold to $t < n / 3$ and the message complexity to $O(R \cdot n^3)$. In addition, with minor adjustments, the \emph{Proxcensus} protocol of ____ becomes an $\approximateagreement$ protocol that matches Fekete's lower bound for $t = (1 - c)/2 \cdot n$ corruptions assuming digital signatures, for any constant $c > 0$.

Optimizations regarding communication complexity have also been considered. The work of ____ has achieved optimal-resilience asynchronous $\approximateagreement$ with $O(n^2)$ messages per iteration as opposed to the prior solutions of $O(n^3)$ ____, and the work of ____ has shown that $O(\ell n)$ bits are sufficient to achieve a stronger version of $\approximateagreement$ (with exact agreement) on $\ell$-bit integer inputs, given that $\ell$ is large enough.


\paragraph{Multiple dimensions.} 
For higher-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^D$, $\approximateagreement$ was first studied in____.
These works have shown sufficient and necessary conditions for achieving $\approximateagreement$ on $\mathbb{R}^D$ in the asynchronous setting. In addition, ____ has characterized the exact-agreement variant of the problem in the synchronous setting. Feasibility in the network-agnostic model was investigated in ____. The work of ____ has focused on efficiency, investigating various rules of computing a new value, leading to different convergence rates. 
The work of ____ has focused on achieving a trade-off between the quality of the outputs, i.e. \emph{honest inputs' convex hull} vs. \emph{bounding box} and resilience thresholds.

To the best of our knowledge, optimal-round complexity solutions for $\realvalues^D$ represent an open problem in \emph{message-passing} models. On the other hand, the recent work of ____ provides lower bounds and efficient protocols for $\approximateagreement$ on $\realvalues^D$ in the \emph{wait-free model}: where at most $t < n$ parties may crash and the parties communicate via shared memory.


\paragraph{Trees and graphs.} $\approximateagreement$ on graphs has been first considered in ____  as a relaxation of the \emph{robot gathering} problem ____ that can be solved in the wait-free model. The work of ____ has introduced two variants: \emph{Edge Agreement}, where the honest parties obtain vertices that are either the same or adjacent, or \emph{Clique Agreement}, where the honest parties' outputs are in a clique. Note that, on trees, these two problems are equivalent. The work of Nowak and Rybicky ____ has generalized the $\approximateagreement$ problem in the synchronous and asynchronous models to various discrete spaces under byzantine failures, providing asynchronous $\approximateagreement$ protocols for trees and \emph{chordal} graphs where the diameter of the honest parties' values gets halved with each iteration. However, ____ has proven the efficient asynchronous protocol on \emph{chordal} graphs of ____ to be incorrect, and provided a network-agnostic protocol that requires $O(\diameter)$ rounds, where $\diameter$ is the diameter of the graph. Whether the round complexity can be improved is an open problem.

A topic of interest regarding $\approximateagreement$ on graphs is characterizing the classes of graphs where $\approximateagreement$ can be achieved: the protocols of ____ assume that the input graph is \emph{chordal}. Further works have explored properties that the input graph needs to satisfy for $\approximateagreement$ in the wait-free model ____.

Regarding efficient solutions, the recent work of ____ has provided a solution asynchronous $\approximateagreement$ on trees with message complexity $O(n^2)$ per iteration as opposed to $O(n^3)$ ____, maintaining the convergence factor of one half per iteration.
