Algorithms are presented to reach approximate agreement in asynchronous, as well as synchronous systems. The asynchronous agreement algorithm is an interesting contrast to a result of Fischer et al, who show that exact agreement with guaranteed termination is not attainable in an asynchronous system with as few as one faulty process. The algorithms work by successive approximation, with a provable convergence rate that depends on the ratio between the number of faulty processes and the total number of processes. Lower bounds on the convergence rate for algorithms of this form are proved, and the algorithms presented are shown to be optimal.},

	abstract = {Classic Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols are designed for a specific timing model, most often one of the following: synchronous, asynchronous or partially synchronous. It is well known that the timing model and fault tolerance threshold present inherent trade-offs. Synchronous protocols tolerate up to n/2 Byzantine faults, while asynchronous or partially synchronous protocols tolerate only up to n/3 Byzantine faults. In this work, we generalize the fault thresholds of BFT and introduce a new problem called multi-threshold BFT. Multi-threshold BFT has four separate fault thresholds for safety and liveness under synchrony and asynchrony (or partial-synchrony), respectively. Decomposing the fault thresholds in this way allows us to design protocols that provide meaningful fault tolerance under both synchrony and asynchrony (or partial synchrony). We establish tight fault thresholds bounds for multi-threshold BFT and present protocols achieving them. As an example, we show a BFT state machine replication (SMR) protocol that tolerates up to 2n/3 faults for safety under synchrony while tolerating up to n/3 faults for other scenarios (liveness under synchrony as well as safety and liveness under partial synchrony). This is strictly stronger than classic partially synchronous SMR protocols. We also present a general framework to transform known partially synchronous or asynchronous BFT SMR protocols to additionally enjoy the optimal 2n/3 fault tolerance for safety under synchrony.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem of distributed computing is that of simulating a secure broadcast channel, within the setting of a point-to-point network. This problem is known as Byzantine Agreement (or Generals) and has been the focus of much research. Lamport et al. [1982] showed that in order to achieve Byzantine Agreement in the plain model, more than two thirds of the participating parties must be honest. They further showed that by augmenting the network with a public-key infrastructure for digital signatures, it is possible to obtain protocols that are secure for any number of corrupted parties. The problem in this augmented model is called “authenticated Byzantine Agreement”.In this article, we consider the question of concurrent, parallel and sequential composition of authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols with a single common setup. We present surprising impossibility results showing that:(1) Authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols that remain secure under parallel or concurrent composition (even for just two executions) and tolerate a third or more corrupted parties, do not exist.(2) Deterministic authenticated Byzantine Agreement protocols that run for r rounds and tolerate a third or more corrupted parties, can remain secure for at most 2r − 1 sequential executions.In contrast, we present randomized protocols for authenticated Byzantine Agreement that remain secure under sequential composition, for any polynomial number of executions. We exhibit two such protocols. In the first protocol, an honest majority is required. In the second protocol, any number of parties may be corrupted; however, the complexity of the protocol is in the order of 2n · n! for n parties. In order to have this polynomial in the security parameter k (used for the signature scheme in the protocol), this requires the overall number of parties to be limited to O(log k/log log k). The above results are achieved due to a new protocol for authenticated Byzantine Generals for three parties that can tolerate any number of faulty parties and composes sequentially.Finally, we show that when the model is further augmented so that in each session, all the participating parties receive a common session identifier that is unique to that session, then any polynomial number of authenticated Byzantine agreement protocols can be concurrently executed, while tolerating any number of corrupted parties.},

abstract = {Given a set of robots with arbitrary initial location and no agreement on a global coordinate system, convergence requires that all robots asymptotically approach the exact same, but unknown beforehand, location. Robots are oblivious–they do not recall the past computations–and are allowed to move in a one-dimensional space. Additionally, robots cannot communicate directly, instead they obtain system related information only via visual sensors. Even though convergence and the classical distributed approximate agreement problem (that requires correct processes to decide, for some constant ϵ, values distance ϵ apart and within the range of initial proposed values) are similar, we provide evidence that solving convergence in robot networks requires specific assumptions about synchrony and Byzantine resilience. In more detail, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of mobile robots despite a subset of them being Byzantine (i.e. they can exhibit arbitrary behavior). Additionally, we propose two deterministic convergence algorithms for robot networks and analyze their correctness and complexity in various atomicity and synchrony settings. The first algorithm tolerates f Byzantine robots for (2f+1)-sized robot networks in fully synchronous ATOM networks, while the second proposed algorithm tolerates f Byzantine robots for (3f+1)-sized robot networks in non-atomic CORDA networks. The resilience of these two algorithms is proved to be optimal.}

abstract = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a fundamental problem in secure distributed computing. The optimal resilience for perfectly-secure MPC in synchronous and asynchronous networks is t &lt; n/3 and t &lt; n/4 respectively, where n is the number of parties and t is the number of corruptions. A natural question is whether there exists a protocol tolerating ts &lt; n/3 corruptions in a synchronous network and ta &lt; n/4 corruptions in an asynchronous network. We design such a protocol, if 3ts + ta &lt; n. For our protocol, we present a perfectly-secure Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol, tolerating t &lt; n/3 corruptions in any network and a perfectly-secure verifiable secret-sharing (VSS) protocol, tolerating ts and ta corruptions in a synchronous and an asynchronous network respectively.},

abstract = {Approximate agreement is a weaker version of consensus where two or more processes must agree on a real number within a distance ε of each other. Many variants of this task have been considered in the literature: continuous or discrete ones; multi-dimensional ones; as well as agreement on graphs and other spaces. We focus on two variants of approximate agreement on graphs, edge agreement and clique agreement. We show that both tasks arise as special cases of a more general, higher-dimensional, approximate agreement task, where the processes must agree on the vertices of a simplex in a given simplicial complex. This new point of view gives rise to a novel topological perspective on the solvability of clique agreement.},

The discrepancy stems from the fact that a function H : {\{}0,1{\}}* {\textrightarrow} {\{}0,1{\}}nalways admits an efficient collision-finding algorithm, it's just that us human beings might be unable to write the program down. We explain a simple way to sidestep this difficulty that avoids having to key our hash functions. The idea is to state theorems in a way that prescribes an explicitly-given reduction, normally a black-box one. We illustrate this approach using well-known examples involving digital signatures, pseudorandom functions, and the Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction.",
