	\subsection{Intelligent Transportation Systems} 
	Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have experienced rapid development in the past few decades ____. In recent years, the introduction of artificial intelligence and big data has greatly promoted the development of ITS. Traffic flow prediction ____ based on big data analysis ____ has become one of the core research directions of ITS. Researchers have developed efficient traffic flow prediction models by integrating sensor data and historical traffic data ____. These models can provide early warning of congestion and optimize traffic signal control. In addition, the development of autonomous driving technology has also become an important part of ITS. Vehicle-to-vehicle ____ and vehicle-to-infrastructure ____ communication technologies ____ have enabled information sharing between vehicles, improving road safety and traffic efficiency. In particular, with the support of 6G networks ____ and edge computing ____, real-time data processing ____ and low-latency communication ____ have enhanced the ITS intelligence level.
	
	At the same time, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology ____ has brought new development opportunities to ITS. In terms of traffic simulation and strategy generation, GenAI can generate simulated data in complex traffic scenarios for optimizing traffic management strategies ____. This technology effectively solves the limitations of traditional methods in dealing with sparse data and abnormal scenarios ____. In addition, researchers have also explored the application of LLMs in the automatic generation of traffic reports ____, further improving the efficiency and automation of ITS.
	
	
	\subsection{Watermarkings} 
	Zero-bit watermarking can embed watermarks by modifying the logits or adjusting token sampling. Regarding the modification of logits, Kirchenbauer et al. ____ first proposed a watermarking, which generates a green-red list using a hash of the previous token. The logits of tokens in the green list are increased, while those in the red list are decreased. Subsequent improvements to the ____ scheme by Takezawa et al. ____ and Fu et al. ____ enhanced the quality of the generated watermarked text. Lee et al. ____ believed that high-entropy logits indicate token uncertainty. Multi-bit watermarking embeds the watermark by semantic ____, format ____, and syntactic ____ modifications and replacement ____. Wang et al. ____ used a proxy language model to guide vocabulary division, making the probabilities of available and unavailable parts close to the same. TABLE \ref{rw} summarizes the functions for ITS of some representative watermark works.
