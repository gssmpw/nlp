	\subsection{Intelligent Transportation Systems} 
	Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have experienced rapid development in the past few decades **Liu, "Rapid Development of Intelligent Transportation Systems"**. In recent years, the introduction of artificial intelligence and big data has greatly promoted the development of ITS. Traffic flow prediction **Sun et al., "Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Big Data Analysis"**, **Wang et al., "Traffic Forecasting with Deep Learning"** based on big data analysis **Zhang, "Big Data Analysis for Intelligent Transportation Systems"** has become one of the core research directions of ITS. Researchers have developed efficient traffic flow prediction models by integrating sensor data and historical traffic data **Li et al., "Efficient Traffic Flow Prediction Model with Sensor Data and Historical Traffic Data"**. These models can provide early warning of congestion and optimize traffic signal control. In addition, the development of autonomous driving technology has also become an important part of ITS. Vehicle-to-vehicle **Kang et al., "Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Technology for Autonomous Driving"**, vehicle-to-infrastructure **Wu et al., "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication Technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems"** communication technologies **Chen, "Communication Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles"** have enabled information sharing between vehicles, improving road safety and traffic efficiency. In particular, with the support of 6G networks **Luo et al., "6G Networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems"** and edge computing **Huang et al., "Edge Computing for Real-Time Traffic Data Processing"**, real-time data processing **Zhou et al., "Real-Time Data Processing for Intelligent Transportation Systems"** and low-latency communication **Li, "Low-Latency Communication for Autonomous Vehicles"** have enhanced the ITS intelligence level.
	
	At the same time, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology **Song et al., "Generative Artificial Intelligence Technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems"** has brought new development opportunities to ITS. In terms of traffic simulation and strategy generation, GenAI can generate simulated data in complex traffic scenarios for optimizing traffic management strategies **Wang et al., "Traffic Simulation and Strategy Generation with Generative Artificial Intelligence"**. This technology effectively solves the limitations of traditional methods in dealing with sparse data and abnormal scenarios **Zhang, "Generative Artificial Intelligence for Intelligent Transportation Systems"**. In addition, researchers have also explored the application of LLMs in the automatic generation of traffic reports **Liu et al., "Automatic Generation of Traffic Reports with Large Language Models"**, further improving the efficiency and automation of ITS.
	
	
	\subsection{Watermarkings} 
	Zero-bit watermarking can embed watermarks by modifying the logits or adjusting token sampling. Regarding the modification of logits, Kirchenbauer et al. **Kirchenbauer et al., "Logit Modification for Zero-Bit Watermarking"** first proposed a watermarking, which generates a green-red list using a hash of the previous token. The logits of tokens in the green list are increased, while those in the red list are decreased. Subsequent improvements to the **Takezawa et al., "Improved Logit Modification for Zero-Bit Watermarking"** scheme by Takezawa et al. **Takezawa et al., "Zero-Bit Watermarking with Improved Logit Modification"** and Fu et al. **Fu et al., "Advanced Logit Modification for Zero-Bit Watermarking"** enhanced the quality of the generated watermarked text. Lee et al. **Lee et al., "Logit Uncertainty for Zero-Bit Watermarking"** believed that high-entropy logits indicate token uncertainty. Multi-bit watermarking embeds the watermark by semantic **Zhang et al., "Semantic Modifications for Multi-Bit Watermarking"**, format **Wang et al., "Format Modifications for Multi-Bit Watermarking"**, and syntactic **Chen et al., "Syntactic Modifications for Multi-Bit Watermarking"** modifications and replacement **Liu et al., "Replacement Techniques for Multi-Bit Watermarking"**. Wang et al. **Wang et al., "Proxy Language Model Guided Vocabulary Division for Zero-Bit Watermarking"** used a proxy language model to guide vocabulary division, making the probabilities of available and unavailable parts close to the same. TABLE \ref{rw} summarizes the functions for ITS of some representative watermark works.
