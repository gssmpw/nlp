	\subsection{Intelligent Transportation Systems} 
	Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have experienced rapid development in the past few decades \cite{RW1, RW2, RW3}. In recent years, the introduction of artificial intelligence and big data has greatly promoted the development of ITS. Traffic flow prediction \cite{RW6, RW7} based on big data analysis \cite{RW5} has become one of the core research directions of ITS. Researchers have developed efficient traffic flow prediction models by integrating sensor data and historical traffic data \cite{RW8, RW9, itsappen4}. These models can provide early warning of congestion and optimize traffic signal control. In addition, the development of autonomous driving technology has also become an important part of ITS. Vehicle-to-vehicle \cite{VV} and vehicle-to-infrastructure \cite{VI} communication technologies \cite{tbjz2, tbjz3} have enabled information sharing between vehicles, improving road safety and traffic efficiency. In particular, with the support of 6G networks \cite{RW2, itsappen2} and edge computing \cite{RW1, RW4}, real-time data processing \cite{RT, itsappen5} and low-latency communication \cite{LL} have enhanced the ITS intelligence level.
	
	At the same time, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology \cite{LLaMA22023, GLM42024} has brought new development opportunities to ITS. In terms of traffic simulation and strategy generation, GenAI can generate simulated data in complex traffic scenarios for optimizing traffic management strategies \cite{tra3, tra4}. This technology effectively solves the limitations of traditional methods in dealing with sparse data and abnormal scenarios \cite{TRS1, TRS2}. In addition, researchers have also explored the application of LLMs in the automatic generation of traffic reports \cite{TRS3}, further improving the efficiency and automation of ITS.
	
	
	\subsection{Watermarkings} 
	Zero-bit watermarking can embed watermarks by modifying the logits or adjusting token sampling. Regarding the modification of logits, Kirchenbauer et al. \cite{KGW2023} first proposed a watermarking, which generates a green-red list using a hash of the previous token. The logits of tokens in the green list are increased, while those in the red list are decreased. Subsequent improvements to the \cite{KGW2023} scheme by Takezawa et al. \cite{NSW2023} and Fu et al. \cite{Fu2024} enhanced the quality of the generated watermarked text. Lee et al. \cite{SWEET2024} believed that high-entropy logits indicate token uncertainty. Multi-bit watermarking embeds the watermark by semantic \cite{AWT2021}, format \cite{Unicode2016}, and syntactic \cite{Robust_Multi-bit2023} modifications and replacement \cite{Context-aware2022}. Wang et al. \cite{CTWL2024} used a proxy language model to guide vocabulary division, making the probabilities of available and unavailable parts close to the same. TABLE \ref{rw} summarizes the functions for ITS of some representative watermark works.
