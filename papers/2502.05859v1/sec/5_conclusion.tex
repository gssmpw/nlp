\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

This paper introduces a novel panorama depth estimation method, SphereFusion, which combines the strengths of equirectangular and spherical projection. 
SphereFusion uses 2D image convolution to complement mesh convolution by using a gate fusion module to select reliable features from two encoders and estimates the panorama depth map in the spherical domain to avoid distortion and discontinuity. 
Meanwhile, SphereFusion utilizes a lighter network and a cache strategy to improve the inference efficiency. 
Experiments conducted on three popular datasets indicate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results and maintains an impressive inference efficiency of up to 60 FPS for $512 \times 1024$ panorama images on one NVIDIA RTX3090.
