\section{Viewer-provider two-sided systems}

This section models the dynamics of viewer and provider populations on a recommendation platform. 
Specifically, we consider sub-group dynamics where viewers and providers are categorized into $K$ and $L$ subgroups\footnote{We can consider a ``subgroup'' of size 1. In such cases, the viewer ``population'' corresponds to the time spent by an individual viewer, while the provider ``population'' can be the amount of content produced by an individual provider.
}. Then, we model the populations, recommendation policy, payoffs, and social welfare as follows.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=12pt]
    \item (Viewer/provider population)  
    Let $\lambda_{k} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be the population of the viewer group $k \in [K]$ and $\lambda_{l}$ be that of the provider group $l \in [L]$. Also let $\blambda := (\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \cdots, \lambda_{K},
    \lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \cdots, \lambda_{L})$ be the joint population vector of viewers and providers.
    \item (Platform's recommendation policy) 
    The platform matches each viewer group $k$ to a provider group $l$ with a recommendation policy denoted by a $K$-by-$L$ matrix $\bpi$. Specifically, its $(k,l)$-th element $\pi_{k,l}$ represents the probability of allocating the provider group $l$ to the viewer group $k$. 
    Thus $\sum_{l=1}^L \pi_{k,l} = 1, \forall k \in [K]$. For example, the uniform random policy, which assigns equal exposure probability across all provider groups is represented as given by $\bpi=\frac{1}{L}\1_{L\times K}$.
    \item (Viewer/provider payoffs) After viewer and provider groups are matched by the policy $\bpi$, their perceived payoffs can be quantified by the following metrics:
    \begin{align}\label{eq:user_satisfaction}
    \text{Viewer Satisfaction: \quad } & s_k = \textstyle \sum_{l=1}^L \pi_{k,l} q_{k,l} \,  , \\\label{eq:content_exposure}
    \text{Provider Exposure: \quad} & e_l = \textstyle\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_{k,l}\lambda_k,
    \end{align}
    where $q_{k,l}$ is the (expected) utility that viewers $k$ receive from the provider groups $l$. Eqs.~\eqref{eq:user_satisfaction} and~\eqref{eq:content_exposure} define viewer satisfaction as determined by the total utility they receive from recommendations, while providers care about the total amount of exposure they receive by recommendation. This model is prevalent is prior works including \citep{singh2018fairness, mladenov2020optimizing}.
    \item (Social welfare) Finally, we consider the following total viewer welfare as the global metric of the platform:
    \begin{align*}
        R(\bpi; \blambda) := \textstyle\sum_{k=1}^{K} \lambda_{k} s_k
    \end{align*}
    Note that here we consider the sum of viewer-side satisfaction as the social welfare, a formulation prevalent in related works~\citep{mladenov2020optimizing, huttenlocher2023matching}.
    The sum of content-side exposure simplifies to the total size of the viewer population.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interaction dynamics and ``population effects''}\label{sec:dynamic_formulation}

We have so far seen a typical formulation in two-sided platforms. However, a key limitation of such formulation is to ignore potential non-stationarity in the viewer and provider populations, which is common in many real-world two-sided systems~\citep{boutilier2023modeling,  deffayet2024sardine}. 

First, consider the impact of provider population growth on the utility experience by viewers, which we call \textit{``population effects''}.
An increase in provider population naturally leads to more high-quality content. 
For example, consider a two-stage recommendation policy, where our higher-level policy $\bpi$ decides the matching between viewer and provider groups, and a second-stage policy selects individual providers among the selected group. 
Any reasonable second stage policy should be able to select a better provider from a larger provider pool~\citep{su2023value, evnine2024achieving}. 
To model such ``population effects'', we introduce the following utility decomposition:
\begin{align}
    q_{k,l} = b_{k,l} + f_{k,l}(\lambda_{l}) \label{eq:reward_decomposition}
\end{align}
where $b_{k,l}$ is the \textit{base} utility, which may indicates the matching between the preference of viewer and provider groups (e.g., this viewer group likes sports articles). In contrast, $f_{k,l}(\cdot)$ represents the quality of the provider which improves as the provider population increases. $f_{k,l}$ might be heterogeneous among different viewer and provider groups because quality might be multi-dimensional (e.g., visuals, intellects, novelty), viewers may have different preferences, and providers may have different abilities. 
We take $f_{k,l}$ to be a monotonically increasing function.

Next, consider the impact of viewer and provider payoffs on the population.
The number of viewers that a platform can maintain is related to the level of satisfaction, similarly the number of providers is related to the exposure.
We assume that viewer and provider subgroups have 
some \textit{``reference''} population $\bar{\lambda}_{k}(s_{k})$ and $\bar{\lambda}_{l}(e_{l})$ given the level of viewer satisfaction $s_k$ and provider exposure $e_l$. We assume that $\bar{\lambda}$ is a monotonically increasing function, so higher viewer satisfaction and provider exposure result in increased populations. 
Based on this, we model the viewer and provider population dynamics as:
\begin{align}
    \text{Viewer: \,}  \lambda_{t+1,k} = (1 - \eta_k) \lambda_{t,k} + \eta_k \bar{\lambda}_{k}(s_{t,k}), \label{eq:user_dynamics} \\
    \text{Content: \,}  \lambda_{t+1,l} = (1 - \eta_l) \lambda_{t,l} + \eta_l \bar{\lambda}_{l}(e_{t,l}), \label{eq:content_dynamics}
\end{align}
where $\eta \in [0, 1]$ are the \textit{reactiveness} hyperparams, determining how fast the population changes. Note that similar models are widely adopted in performative predictions~\citep{perdomo2020performative, brown2022performative}. 
We thus have that the viewer satisfaction $s_k$ depends on the provider population via ``population effects'' $f_{k,l}$, while the provider exposure directly depends on the viewer population.
The two-sided platform has complex dynamics between viewers and providers. 
Our goal will be to consider long-term objectives under such co-evolving and two-sided dynamics.

\subsection{Game-theoretic interpretation}\label{sec:game_formulation}

Next, we provide a further justification of and insight into the dynamics model by introducing a game-theoretic formulation that is equivalent to Eqs. \eqref{eq:user_dynamics} and \eqref{eq:content_dynamics}.

Consider a $(K+L)$-player game involving $K$ viewer groups and $L$ provider groups. Each viewer group selects a pure strategy $\lambda_k \in \RR_{\geq 0}$, and each provider group chooses a pure strategy $\lambda_l \in \RR_{\geq 0}$. The utility functions for the viewer and provider groups, denoted by $\{u_k\}_{k=1}^K$ and $\{v_l\}_{l=1}^L$ are defined as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq:util_user}
    & u_k(\blambda)= \lambda_k \cdot \bar{\lambda}_k \left(\sum_{l=1}^L \pi_{k,l}\left(b_{k,l}+f_{k,l}(\lambda_l)\right)\right)-\frac{\lambda_k^2}{2}, \\ \label{eq:util_creator}
    & v_l(\blambda)= \lambda_l\cdot \bar{\lambda}_l \left(\textstyle\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_{k,l}\lambda_k\right)-\frac{\lambda_l^2}{2},
\end{align}
We denote this game as $\G(\bpi, B, f, \bar{\lambda})$, where $B$ is a $K$-by-$L$ matrix whose $(k,l)$-element is $b_{k,l}$. Proposition \ref{prop:dynamics_equivalence} establishes a connection between the game instance $\G$ and the 
formulation presented in Section \ref{sec:dynamic_formulation}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:dynamics_equivalence}
    If all players in $\G$ apply gradient ascent to optimize their utility functions with learning rates $\{\eta_k\}_{k=1}^K$ and $\{\eta_l\}_{l=1}^L$, the resulting joint strategy evolving dynamics are exactly given by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:user_dynamics} and \eqref{eq:content_dynamics}.
\end{proposition}

Through Proposition \ref{prop:dynamics_equivalence}, our game-theoretic formulation provides a first-principles perspective for understanding the dynamical formulation in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:user_dynamics} and \eqref{eq:content_dynamics}.\footnote{The game $\G$ resembles the Cournot Duopoly competition \cite{cournot1838recherches}. When $K = L = 1$ and $\bar{\lambda}(\mu) = a - b\mu$ and $\bar{\mu}(\lambda) = a - b\lambda$ for some positive constants $a$ and $b$, the game $\G$ corresponds exactly to the Cournot Duopoly model. The key distinction in ours is that $\bar{\mu}$ and $\bar{\lambda}$ are generic increasing functions.} 
That is, 
we can interpret $\bar{\lambda}(\cdot)$ as the marginal gain from increasing the size of a viewer or provider group by one unit. Consequently, the first terms $\lambda_k \cdot \bar{\lambda}_k(\cdot)$ and $\lambda_l \cdot \bar{\lambda}_l(\cdot)$ represent the collective payoffs for viewer and provider groups of sizes $\lambda_k$ and $\lambda_l$. 
The quadratic terms $-\frac{\lambda_k^2}{2}$ and $-\frac{\lambda_l^2}{2}$ capture the congestion costs associated with maintaining larger populations (e.g., if a provider group becomes too large, providers within the group may face intensified competition and thus reduce their productivity due to diminished marginal gains). This suggests that Eqs.~\eqref{eq:user_dynamics} and \eqref{eq:content_dynamics} are quite reasonable formulation to capture real-world interactions.
