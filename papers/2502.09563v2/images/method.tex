    \textbf{Overview of Our Method}. In contrast to the explicit distortion vector field illustrated in the upper row, our hybrid approach maintains computational efficiency by leveraging explicit control points. Additionally, the regularization provided by the invertible neural field effectively balances the trade-off between the expressiveness and smoothness of the distortion field.
