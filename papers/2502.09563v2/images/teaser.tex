    We introduce Bundle-Adjusting Gaussian Splatting, a differentiable rasterization pipeline that can produce high-quality view-synthesis results from imperfect camera parameters. 
    (b) Vanilla Gaussian Splatting~\cite{kerbl20233d} struggles with lens distortion because of the pinhole camera assumption. 
    (c) Existing self-calibration methods like ADOP~\cite{ruckert2022adop} fails to accurately represent complex distortions of lenses, leading to blurry rendering. 
    (d) Our model produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis results by jointly modeling 3D scene representations, camera parameters, and lens distortion.
