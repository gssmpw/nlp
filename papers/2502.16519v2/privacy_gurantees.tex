\section{Correctness}
\label{sec:correctness}
In this section, we discuss correctness of \tool. 

\paragraph{Correctness.} Our main theorem that \tool is sound: 
it returns a bound encompassing all the inputs where the classifier, trained on the complete dataset and its variants missing a single sample, classify differently.


\begin{restatable}[]{theorem}{ftc}
\label{thm1}
Given a classifier $D$, a training algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, a target class set $c$,  
\tool returns an bound $\beta_c$
bounding the maximal \propa such that $\beta_c\geq \text{\propa}$.
