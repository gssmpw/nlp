The resulting corpus (emrQA) has 1 million questions-logical form and 400,000+ question-answer evidence pairs. We characterize the dataset and explore its learning potential by training baseline models for question to logical form and question to answer mapping."

While stress can be a motivator, too much stress is associated with many negative health outcomes, making its identification useful across a range of domains. However, existing computational research typically only studies stress in domains such as speech, or in short genres such as Twitter. We present Dreaddit, a new text corpus of lengthy multi-domain social media data for the identification of stress. Our dataset consists of 190K posts from five different categories of Reddit communities; we additionally label 3.5K total segments taken from 3K posts using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We present preliminary supervised learning methods for identifying stress, both neural and traditional, and analyze the complexity and diversity of the data and characteristics of each category."

               care for adults with common mental health disorders,
               specifically depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic
               disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic
               stress disorder. The vast majority of depressive and anxiety
               disorders that are diagnosed are treated in primary care, but
               recognition of anxiety disorders, in particular, is poor. The
               focus of this guideline is to improve access to services and
               recognition of common mental health disorders, and provide
               advice on the principles that need to be adopted to develop
               appropriate referral and local care pathways. The importance and
               uniqueness of this new guideline, which is aimed at primary care
               practitioners, managers and commissioners, is in bringing
               together treatment and referral advice from existing NICE mental
