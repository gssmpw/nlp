\section{Conclusion}

LLMs hold significant promise for revolutionizing psychotherapy by enhancing assessment, diagnosis, and treatment processes through dynamic, context-sensitive interactions. Despite the progress made, key challenges such as linguistic biases, limited disorder coverage, and underrepresented therapeutic models persist. Future research should focus on creating integrative, multi-turn systems that span the entire psychotherapy process while addressing the evolving nature of mental health conditions. Expanding resources, embracing diverse therapeutic approaches, and improving model architectures will be crucial in making LLM-driven psychotherapy tools more effective, inclusive, and adaptable.
