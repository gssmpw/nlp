\subsection{Diagnosis}

\paragraph{Static Diagnosis} is based on a fixed set of data, typically derived from complete dialogues or social media posts. \newcite{11} highlighted the effectiveness of Med-PaLM 2 in psychiatric condition assessment from patient interviews and clinical descriptions without specialized training. Similarly, \newcite{107} showcased LLMs' superior performance on depression and anxiety detection on Russian datasets, particularly with noisy or small datasets. \newcite{102} evaluated PLMs and LLMs on multi-label classification in depression and anxiety, underscoring the ongoing challenges in applying LMs to mental health diagnostics. Besides, \newcite{124} introduced \textit{DORIS}, a depression detection system integrating text embeddings with LLMs, utilizing symptom features, post-history, and mood course representations to make diagnostic predictions and generate explanatory outputs. \newcite{110} developed \textit{ADOS-Copilot} for ASD diagnosis through diagnostic dialogues, employing In-context Enhancement, Interpretability Augmentation, and Adaptive Fusion based on real-world ADOS-2 clinic scenarios.

\paragraph{Dynamic Diagnosis} involves real-time evaluation based on ongoing, interactive conversations between the patient and LLM, enabling more personalized and contextually relevant insights. \newcite{9} simulated psychiatrist-patient interactions with ChatGPT, in which the doctor chatbot focused on role, tasks, empathy, and questioning strategies, while the patient chatbot emphasized symptoms, language style, emotions, and resistance behaviors. \newcite{33} introduced the \textit{Symptom-related and Empathy-related Ontology (SEO)}, grounded in DSM-5 and Helping Skills Theory, for depression diagnosis dialogues. \newcite{52} dissected the doctor-patient relationship into psychologist’s empathy and proactive guidance and introduced \textit{WundtGPT} that integrated these elements. \newcite{106} further presented the \textit{AMC}, a self-improving conversational agent system for depression diagnosis through simulated dialogues between patient and psychiatrist agents.
% The psychiatrist agent is structured with a tertiary memory structure, a dialogue control and reflection plugin that functions as a “supervisor,” and a memory sampling module.
