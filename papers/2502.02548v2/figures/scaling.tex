        \textbf{Model performance scales with training data.}
        We observe consistent improvements in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation on ScanNet200~\cite{scannet200} as we increase the amount of training data.
        This shows the value of our large-scale data generation pipeline in improving open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding.
