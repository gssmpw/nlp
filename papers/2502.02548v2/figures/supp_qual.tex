        \textbf{Attention visualization of \nickname as a 3D foundational model.}
        We observe that our model can highlight relevant regions even without explicitly mentioning ScanNet~\cite{dai2017scannet,scannet200} class names in queries.
        The model also effectively attends to regions related to abstract concepts like affordances (\eg, reading, discarding, washing).
