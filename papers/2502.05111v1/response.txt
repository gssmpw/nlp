% One example of constrained decoding is generating text that conforms to a regular expression **Grissom, "Regular Expression Matching by Stochastic Automaton"**. In this approach, the decoding is guided by a finite-state automaton that recognizes the same set of strings as the given regular expression **Thompson, "Regular Expression Search Algorithm"**.
