\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce \method, a framework to enable robots to move large objects in the real world by training them in simulation with human demonstrations. Critical to our method, is the Dynamic Chain, a novel graphical representation that enables to imitate human-object interactions in robot embodiments with different morphologies, facilitating the learning of reusable control policies. Our experimental evaluation in simulation demonstrates that policies trained using Dynamic Chain significantly outperform traditional robot learning methods in manipulating a variety of objects. Furthermore, our hardware experiments show that the proposed method produces more reliable object manipulation policies compared to both learning-based approaches and teleoperation methods. Finally, we integrate the learned policies with various high-level planners, showcasing their applicability in diverse real-world daily tasks.
