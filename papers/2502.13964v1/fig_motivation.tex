Many everyday tasks require reaching a precise interaction site before executing a motion primitive, \eg precise reaching of a knob / handle to pull open a cupboard in (a) and (b), or precisely reaching a user-indicated button / book before pushing it in (c) and (d) (shown via the {\color{red} red dot}). Open loop execution fails due to the precise nature of these tasks. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (\name), a training-free framework that closes the loop using a wrist camera to enable a commodity mobile manipulator to tackle these tasks.
