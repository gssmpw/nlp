\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we present the first printed sequential SVM classifiers optimized for the strict area and power constraints of printed electronics (PE).
Using our proposed sequential architecture with bespoke storage and control, and a single-MAC engine, we achieve on average $10$x lower area and $30$x lower power compared to fully-parallel exact SVMs, at similar accuracy.
Compared to approximate printed classifiers, our approach reduces area and power by $4$x and $9$x, respectively, on average, while delivering a $5.4$\% accuracy gain.
These advantages become more pronounced as dataset complexity increases.
Overall, our SVM circuits represent the most accurate digital printed classifiers that meet PE's strict area and power constraints.
Although we focused on EGFET technology, our design principles are applicable to similar technologies.
