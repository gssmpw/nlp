In recent years, research on printed \gls{ml} classifiers has proliferated, with a primary focus on improving hardware efficiency while adhering to the strict area and power budget of \gls{pe} systems.
As a result, classification accuracy is often compromised in favor of design feasibility.
The authors in____ introduced printed \gls{ml} classifiers by exploring various models and architectures, and concluding that only simpler models like decision trees and \gls{svm} regressors could be implemented in \gls{pe}.
Furthermore,____ determined that fully parallel architectures should be used in \gls{pe}. %, while sequential designs can be prohibitive due to the costs associated with registers.
Since then, significant research efforts have focused on fully parallel approximate neural networks (\glspl{mlp}____ and \glspl{bnn}____) and also approximate \glspl{svm} classifiers____.
%Approximate computing has proven effective in reducing complexity, with approaches spanning hardware, software, and co-design techniques.
While works like____ achieve impressive area efficiency, they often report accuracy losses around 4\%-5\% or more, due to employing aggressive power-of-two or ternary quantization and approximate additions.

____ also applied a gate-level pruning approximation.
The authors in____ expand upon____ by additionally incorporating voltage over-scaling.
In-training hardware-friendly weight replacement along with truncated addition is proposed in____ for \glspl{mlp}.

% In our work we fill these research gaps, and propose for the first time bespoke sequential \glspl{svm} in \gls{pe}.
% We strive for maximum area efficiency and substitute costly register files or memristor-based \glspl{rom} with \gls{mux}-based storage units.
% We also propose a novel \gls{fsm}-based control unit which omits voting modules for further area savings.
