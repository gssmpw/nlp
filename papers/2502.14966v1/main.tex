\begin{abstract}
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly expanded the attack surface for AI-driven cybersecurity threats, necessitating adaptive defense strategies. This paper introduces \textbf{CyberSentinel}, a unified, single-agent system for emergent threat detection, designed to identify and mitigate novel security risks in real time. CyberSentinel integrates: (1) Brute-force attack detection through SSH log analysis, (2) Phishing threat assessment using domain blacklists and heuristic URL scoring, and (3) Emergent threat detection via machine learning-based anomaly detection. By continuously adapting to evolving adversarial tactics, CyberSentinel strengthens proactive cybersecurity defense, addressing critical vulnerabilities in AI security.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Frontier AI systems introduce new security vulnerabilities, ranging from adversarial attacks on models \cite{carlini2017towards, papernot2016limitations} to emergent behaviors leading to unforeseen risks. These vulnerabilities often stem from the complex, high - dimensional nature of modern AI models, where small perturbations can be amplified into critical failures. Attackers exploit this complexity to craft adversarial inputs capable of bypassing conventional filters or inducing unintended model behaviors. Existing cybersecurity solutions are largely reactive, relying on signature - based approaches or manual updates. As threat actors continuously evolve their tactics, purely reactive defenses struggle to keep pace, leaving systems exposed for extended periods.

Moreover, recent advancements in large language models and generative AI create new opportunities for \textit{emergent threats}, where malicious behavior arises not through explicit software vulnerabilities, but from subtle interactions between model parameters and cleverly crafted inputs. Examples include \textbf{prompt injection attacks}, which circumvent policy constraints by manipulating the AI’s contextual reasoning and \textbf{model drift exploitation}, where an attacker gradually shifts a model’s decision boundary over time. These scenarios highlight the need for proactive defenses that can adapt without waiting for an explicit threat signature to emerge.

In this paper, we address these challenges with a novel single - agent approach to \textbf{proactively identify and mitigate emergent threats} using an adaptive security model \cite{madry2017towards}. Our solution, \textbf{CyberSentinel}, acts as a unified detection layer that continuously learns from observed behaviors, adjusting its threat models in real time. By eschewing manual rule updates, CyberSentinel ensures security policies and detection thresholds remain current, even when adversaries alter their attack vectors.

We explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application of \textbf{agent - based cybersecurity} for real - time detection,
    \item A unified single - agent approach integrating multiple threat detection layers and
    \item The scalability of this framework to address \textbf{frontier AI security concerns} \cite{russell2022human}.
\end{itemize}

Our findings demonstrate how a single - agent system can offer both breadth -  -  - by monitoring diverse threat vectors such as brute - force, phishing and anomaly - based threats -  -  - and depth, through continuous retraining of machine learning models to detect novel intrusion patterns. We also discuss implementation details, including multi - threaded orchestration for scalability and a modular design that facilitates real - time updates without downtime. In doing so, this paper provides a new perspective on securing frontier AI applications against both \emph{known} and \emph{unforeseen} cyber threats.

\subsection{Emergent Threat Detector (ETD): A Novel Contribution}
A primary innovation within CyberSentinel is the \textbf{Emergent Threat Detector (ETD)}, an adaptive, machine learning–based module for anomaly detection that identifies unconventional or evolving attacks in real time. While adversarial robustness and anomaly detection have been explored in past research \cite{papernot2016limitations, buczak2016survey}, our approach is distinguished by its seamless integration into a \emph{single - agent framework}, where the ETD operates alongside brute - force and phishing modules under one orchestrator.

\paragraph{Architecture and Data Flow}
The ETD is built around a streaming data pipeline that ingests raw events such as authentication logs, system metrics and (optionally) GitHub repository activity. These data streams are normalized into a unified format (e.g., JSON), extracting key features like timestamps, IP addresses, event types and context - specific metadata. Standardizing data early allows the ETD to adapt to new sources or changing log formats with minimal reconfiguration.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Key Features Used by the Emergent Threat Detector (ETD).}
\label{tab:etd - features}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2} % slightly increase row spacing
\begin{tabular}{p{3.3cm} p{8.5cm}}
\hline
\textbf{Feature Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
\texttt{hour} & Hour of day for the login or event (0 -  - 23). \\
\texttt{ip\_numeric} & Numerical representation of the source IP. \\
\texttt{geo\_distance} & Geographic distance from typical user locations. \\
\texttt{failed\_attempts} & Count of consecutive failed login attempts. \\
\texttt{freq} & Rolling frequency of login or event activity. \\
\texttt{status} & Binary or categorical success/failure label. \\
\texttt{repo\_event\_count} & (Optional) Number of recent commits/PRs in GitHub. \\
\texttt{url\_risk} & (Optional) URL risk score from the phishing module. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Feature Extraction and Modeling}
Each normalized event is converted into a numerical feature vector. Common features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal characteristics:} Hour of day, day of week and session length.
    \item \textbf{Network behavior:} IP geolocation, request size, or repeated login failures.
    \item \textbf{Workflow indicators:} Unusual spikes in GitHub commit activity, branch creation patterns, or pull - request frequency.
\end{itemize}
These features feed into unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest or Gaussian Mixture Models) that require no labeled data to detect suspicious deviations.

\paragraph{Adaptive Learning and Model Updates}
The ETD periodically retrains on a window of recent data (e.g., 30 days) to account for legitimate drift. If a system sees routine load tests or changing usage patterns, the ETD incorporates these into its model to reduce false positives. Administrators can adjust retraining intervals and thresholds through a simple configuration file, ensuring that the system remains both flexible and robust.

\paragraph{Real - Time Detection and Response}
Upon detecting an anomaly, the ETD issues alerts containing the event’s feature vector, anomaly score and a timestamp. Depending on the severity, the system may:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Log the incident in JSON for forensic analysis,
    \item Notify administrators via email, Slack, or SIEM dashboards, or
    \item Trigger automated mitigations (e.g., blocking suspicious IPs or enforcing multi - factor authentication).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Advantages Over Signature - Based Detection}
Because the ETD focuses on \emph{behavioral} rather than \emph{signature - based} anomalies, it excels at revealing zero - day exploits and subtle deviations from normal usage. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insider Threats:} A legitimate account that suddenly exhibits atypical login times or commit frequency.
    \item \textbf{Unknown Vulnerabilities:} Attackers exploiting undisclosed software bugs often generate patterns not seen in known signatures.
    \item \textbf{Gradual Escalation Attacks:} Small, incremental changes that push a system’s boundaries over time, which signature - based approaches might miss.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Integration with GitHub Agent Workflows}
One real - world application of the ETD is monitoring GitHub repositories via CyberSentinel’s agent. In this setup, the ETD correlates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Code - based events (commits, merges, pull requests),
    \item SSH authentication logs and
    \item Potential phishing indicators.
\end{itemize}
This cross - module synergy can escalate warnings if, for instance, an IP address involved in brute - force attacks later performs suspicious code changes.

By consolidating these capabilities into a single - agent framework, CyberSentinel not only shortens response times but also streamlines deployment and maintenance. The ETD thus represents a significant step toward real - time, adaptive defense for frontier AI systems, enabling security teams to detect emerging threats proactively -  -  - often before they become critical incidents.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Cybersecurity for AI Systems}
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cybersecurity has introduced both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Historically, security mechanisms have relied on rule - based models, where predefined patterns or signatures dictate whether an event is considered malicious. While effective against known threats, these approaches struggle to adapt to dynamic attack patterns, particularly in AI - driven systems that continuously evolve \cite{tramer2017ensemble}.

Traditional cybersecurity models were designed to protect \textbf{static infrastructures}, where network behavior followed predictable patterns. However, modern AI applications operate in complex, high - dimensional environments where adversarial behavior can emerge in unexpected ways. Attackers now exploit AI models themselves, manipulating \textbf{machine learning algorithms} through adversarial inputs, poisoning datasets, or leveraging model inversion techniques to extract sensitive information \cite{sharif2016accessorize}. These evolving attack vectors highlight the urgent need for \textbf{adaptive security architectures} that can respond to threats in real time.

Existing AI security research primarily focuses on \textbf{adversarial robustness}, designing models that resist perturbations, or \textbf{explainability}, ensuring AI decisions remain interpretable \cite{goodfellow2014explaining, papernot2016limitations}. However, there is a growing recognition that cybersecurity frameworks must incorporate \textbf{self - learning and autonomous defense mechanisms} that can detect and mitigate novel threats as they arise.

\subsection{Emergent Threats in AI Systems}
Emergent threats refer to security vulnerabilities or attack patterns that arise unpredictably within AI - driven systems. Unlike traditional cyber threats, which often follow known exploit chains or malware signatures, emergent threats result from the complex interactions of AI models with their environment, data sources, or adversarial inputs. These threats often evade conventional detection mechanisms because they do not exhibit predefined attack signatures \cite{biggio2013evasion}.

One example of an emergent threat is \textbf{model drift exploitation}, where attackers manipulate AI training data over time, gradually shifting the model’s behavior until it becomes vulnerable to specific inputs. Another case involves \textbf{prompt injection attacks} against large language models, where carefully crafted inputs bypass intended constraints to elicit unauthorized or harmful responses. These attack techniques are particularly challenging to detect because they do not originate from explicit vulnerabilities in the software stack but instead exploit the inherent statistical nature of AI decision - making.

Recent high - profile AI security breaches illustrate the risks associated with emergent threats. For example, \textbf{deepfake phishing attacks} have leveraged generative AI to impersonate executives and bypass traditional authentication methods, leading to financial fraud. Similarly, \textbf{AI - powered misinformation campaigns} have demonstrated how adversaries can manipulate public discourse at scale, exploiting reinforcement learning models that prioritize engagement over veracity \cite{sharif2016accessorize}. These cases underscore the necessity for cybersecurity frameworks that can dynamically detect and respond to \textbf{unknown attack vectors} rather than relying solely on predefined rules.

\subsection{Agent - Based Cybersecurity}
Cybersecurity defense strategies can broadly be categorized into \textbf{multi - agent} and \textbf{single - agent} frameworks. Multi - agent approaches distribute security responsibilities across multiple autonomous entities, each specializing in different aspects of threat detection and mitigation. This architecture is well - suited for large - scale enterprise environments, where multiple layers of defense collaborate to provide comprehensive coverage. However, multi - agent systems introduce complexity in coordination, communication overhead and potential failure points when trust assumptions between agents break down.

In contrast, single - agent cybersecurity frameworks focus on \textbf{autonomous, self - contained security agents} capable of executing multiple defensive functions within a unified model. A single - agent approach simplifies deployment, reduces inter - agent dependency risks and ensures a \textbf{coherent decision - making process}. CyberSentinel follows this paradigm, implementing an \textbf{adaptive single - agent security model} that integrates \textbf{anomaly detection, brute - force monitoring, phishing protection and emergent threat detection} within a single cohesive system.

A key advantage of the single - agent model is its ability to dynamically adjust its detection strategies based on observed behavior. Rather than relying on \textbf{static rule sets}, CyberSentinel continuously \textbf{learns from past security events}, refining its internal models to improve accuracy over time. Additionally, the single - agent framework is more amenable to \textbf{edge deployment}, enabling real - time monitoring without reliance on centralized infrastructure.

Agent - based cybersecurity aligns closely with advancements in \textbf{autonomous AI systems}, where decision - making must occur \textbf{at the edge, in real - time and without human intervention}. As cyber threats become more \textbf{automated, adaptive and stealthy}, the need for intelligent security agents that can evolve alongside adversarial tactics becomes increasingly apparent.

\section{CyberSentinel: A Single - Agent Emergent Threat Detector}

\subsection{System Overview}
CyberSentinel is a modular, real - time threat detection framework designed to monitor, identify and adapt to both known and emerging cybersecurity risks. It employs a \textbf{single - agent architecture} in which a central process continuously orchestrates three specialized modules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brute - Force Attack Detection:} Monitors SSH logs and flags IP addresses exhibiting suspicious login patterns (e.g., repeated authentication failures).
    \item \textbf{Phishing Detection:} Evaluates URLs against a combination of known blacklists and heuristic analyses, identifying fraudulent or deceptive domains in real time.
    \item \textbf{Emergent Threat Detection:} Uses machine learning–based anomaly detection to capture deviations from historical norms, enabling the discovery of novel attacks not caught by signature - based methods.
\end{itemize}

These modules are orchestrated by the \texttt{security\_agent.py} daemon, which serves as the core intelligence of the system. The orchestrator manages module initialization, schedules routine tasks (such as log parsing and retraining cycles) and coordinates alerts and automated responses. By consolidating these distinct security functions under a single coordinating process, CyberSentinel avoids the complexity of multi - agent solutions and ensures that global context—such as newly observed threats or updated IP blocklists—can be shared seamlessly across modules.

Written in Python for cross - platform compatibility, CyberSentinel is designed to be lightweight, extensible and straightforward to deploy. Logs and analytical outputs flow back to the orchestrator, where they are normalized into a unified format (e.g., JSON) for storage or further analysis. This centralized approach simplifies the integration of new detection techniques and facilitates real - time threat escalation, making CyberSentinel well - suited for both on - premise and cloud - based environments. 

For reproducibility and community - driven enhancements, we have made the CyberSentinel source code publicly available on GitHub.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/KrtiT/CyberSentinel}} The repository includes Dockerfiles for containerized deployment and a \texttt{requirements.txt} (or \texttt{environment.yml}) file specifying Python dependencies. Although CyberSentinel operates efficiently on modest hardware, the anomaly detection module benefits from GPU acceleration when large datasets or highly complex models are employed. Typical training runs for the Emergent Threat Detector complete in under two hours on a mid - range GPU when processing 30 days of authentication logs (averaging 500\,MB in size). Pre - trained models, sample logs and instructional notebooks are also provided, offering a convenient starting point for users interested in extending or tailoring the framework to specific threat scenarios.

\subsection{Brute - Force Attack Detection}
CyberSentinel continuously monitors SSH authentication logs to detect brute - force login attempts. In typical configurations, the system queries log files in real time using:

\begin{verbatim}
log show  -  - last 5m | grep "sshd"
\end{verbatim}

This command retrieves relevant SSHD entries from the previous five minutes, effectively capturing recent authentication events on most Unix - based systems. By periodically running this query, CyberSentinel gains continuous visibility into each new login attempt.

Once the raw log data is collected, a regex - based parser extracts critical fields such as timestamps, IP addresses and authentication statuses (e.g., “Failed password for”). These fields are collated into an internal data structure and correlated against known thresholds. For instance, if an IP address records an excessive number of failed logins—defined in a user - configurable threshold (e.g., 5 or 10 attempts)—that IP is flagged as a potential source of brute - force activity.

Flagged attempts are then recorded in a structured JSON format, including the offending IP, the timestamp of the incident and the number of observed failures. An example entry is shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "timestamp": "2025 - 02 - 12T15:23:01Z",
    "event_type": "BruteForce",
    "ip": "192.168.1.12",
    "failed_attempts": 10
}
\end{lstlisting}

This JSON record can optionally be forwarded to external alerting systems (e.g., via a webhook or SIEM agent) for rapid incident response. CyberSentinel’s default polling interval is 60 seconds, striking a balance between near real - time responsiveness and minimal overhead on production servers. Additionally, administrators can tune this interval or add advanced parsing rules to accommodate specific organizational requirements, such as white - listing trusted IP addresses or introducing adaptive thresholds for high - volume servers. By automating log analysis and integrating seamlessly with existing alert pipelines, CyberSentinel significantly reduces the reaction time to brute - force login threats, enabling security teams to take proactive measures (e.g., firewall blocking) before an attack can escalate.

\subsection{Phishing Detection}
The phishing detection module is designed to evaluate URLs in near real - time and determine their likelihood of being malicious or deceptive. This assessment begins by referencing a pre - compiled blacklist of known phishing domains maintained in a local or cloud - hosted database. When a URL is encountered, the system checks for an exact domain match against the blacklist, swiftly flagging any entries that appear in this repository of high - confidence malicious sites.

Next, the module performs heuristic analysis on URLs that are not immediately recognized from the blacklist. These heuristics focus on multiple lexical and contextual indicators:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain Similarity:} CyberSentinel inspects whether the URL’s domain name resembles well - known legitimate services (e.g., \texttt{g00gle.com} vs. \texttt{google.com}). A configurable similarity threshold, often computed via Levenshtein distance, helps detect homograph attacks or brand impersonation.
    \item \textbf{HTTP vs.\ HTTPS Usage:} The system assigns higher suspicion scores to URLs using unencrypted HTTP for services that typically rely on HTTPS. Although not conclusive proof of phishing, this heuristic provides an initial risk signal.
    \item \textbf{URL Obfuscation Patterns:} Strategies such as long subdomain chains, encoded parameters (like \texttt{\%20} or \texttt{\%3F}), or unusual path manipulations are flagged as potential obfuscation tactics.
    \item \textbf{Keyword Detection:} The parser checks for words like “login,” “verify,” or “update” embedded in suspicious contexts. Certain terms, especially in combination with brand names, often correlate with phishing attempts.
\end{itemize}

Based on these features, the function \texttt{is\_phishing\_url()} computes a composite \textit{risk score}, typically on a scale from 0 (benign) to 100 (highly suspicious). This score combines weighted contributions from each heuristic, allowing administrators to adjust parameters as threat landscapes evolve. For instance, an enterprise deploying CyberSentinel can raise the threshold for domain - similarity alerts if they are experiencing a wave of homograph - based phishing attempts targeting specific departments.

When the aggregated risk score surpasses a predefined threshold, the URL is deemed sufficiently suspicious and is logged in JSON format. A sample entry might include the URL, its computed score and the specific heuristic triggers:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json]
{
    "timestamp": "2025 - 02 - 13T09:11:45Z",
    "event_type": "PhishingAlert",
    "url": "http://secure - updates - login.com",
    "score": 85,
    "detection_method": "HeuristicAnalysis"
}
\end{lstlisting}

Flagged URLs are optionally passed to an alerting mechanism, which could integrate with incident response tools or notify administrators via Slack, email, or SIEM dashboards. By default, the phishing detection module runs in a \textbf{stateless} manner: each URL undergoes a fresh evaluation upon arrival without relying on session history. This design choice simplifies deployment and scales well under high traffic, although an optional caching layer can be added to prevent repeat evaluations of the same URL within a short interval.

The stateless model ensures that organizations can rapidly adapt CyberSentinel to their evolving security needs. For example, if a new phishing campaign emerges that frequently uses domains with numeric substitutions, administrators can augment the heuristic engine to assign heavier weights for those patterns or integrate an additional third - party threat feed. This flexible architecture ultimately enhances real - time detection while minimizing false positives that might interrupt legitimate user activity.

\subsection{Emergent Threat Detection}
Conventional threat detection systems rely heavily on \textbf{signature - based} approaches, where predefined rules or heuristics flag malicious activity based on known attack patterns. While effective against previously observed threats, these methods struggle with \textbf{zero - day attacks}, adaptive adversaries and evolving cyber threats that do not conform to established behavioral signatures \cite{papernot2016limitations}. 

To address these limitations, CyberSentinel integrates an \textbf{Emergent Threat Detector (ETD)}, a machine - learning - driven anomaly detection framework that continuously learns from historical system activity and flags deviations in real time. Unlike traditional rule - based systems, the ETD leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning to detect deviations from expected behavior, allowing it to adapt dynamically to \textbf{novel attack vectors} \cite{biggio2013evasion}.

    \caption{System architecture of the Emergent Threat Detector (ETD). The ETD processes multiple data streams, including system logs, network telemetry, GitHub activity and user behavior. It applies feature engineering techniques and anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest and Mahalanobis Distance) to identify emerging threats. The model continuously updates using historical data for adaptive threat detection.}
    \label{fig:etd_architecture}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Architecture and Data Flow}
The ETD’s design centers on a streaming data pipeline that ingests raw events (e.g., authentication logs, system metrics and—in some cases—telemetry from GitHub repositories monitored by the CyberSentinel Agent). Once these events are collected, the system normalizes them into a consistent JSON - based format, extracting key features such as timestamps, originating IP addresses, event types and relevant metadata. By standardizing data early in the pipeline, the ETD can seamlessly incorporate new sources or adapt to changes in logging formats without requiring significant code rewrites.

\paragraph{Feature Extraction and Modeling}
After normalization, each event is transformed into a numerical feature vector for anomaly detection. Typical features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal characteristics:} Hour of day, day of week, or sliding window frequency of events.
    \item \textbf{User/Repo Interaction Metrics:} In a GitHub context, this could include commit frequency, unusual branch creations, or sudden spikes in issue or pull request activity.
    \item \textbf{Network - based attributes:} IP geolocation, average request size, failed login rates, or atypical protocol usage.
\end{itemize}
The ETD applies these features to one or more unsupervised learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest or a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). This choice ensures that \emph{no prior labels} are strictly required; CyberSentinel can autonomously identify new threats even if they have never been encountered before.

\paragraph{Adaptive Learning and Model Updates}
In addition to its streaming inference, the ETD runs periodic retraining jobs on historical data to capture “drift” in normal usage patterns. For instance, if a repository experiences an uptick in legitimate user activity—like routine load tests or seasonal spikes—the ETD will learn these new norms. Retraining jobs typically:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aggregate clean “ground - truth” data from a stable time window (e.g., 30 days).
    \item Recompute model parameters (means, covariances, cluster boundaries, etc.) based on the updated distribution.
    \item Validate the refreshed model on a hold - out set of recent data to confirm performance before deployment.
\end{enumerate}
Once validated, the new model seamlessly replaces the active one without requiring system downtime, ensuring that detection thresholds stay in line with real - world behavior. Administrators can adjust retraining frequency through a configuration file, making it easy to align model updates with operational schedules.

\paragraph{Real - Time Detection and Response}
When the ETD identifies an anomaly, it generates a structured alert containing the event’s feature vector, anomaly score and a timestamp. Depending on the severity, CyberSentinel can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Escalate the alert to a Slack channel, SIEM system, or email distribution list.
    \item Log the incident for subsequent forensic analysis.
    \item Trigger automated mitigations, such as blocking an IP or requiring multi - factor authentication (MFA).
\end{itemize}
For GitHub workflows, automated responses might involve temporarily restricting commit privileges to suspicious branches or prompting additional code review steps. This tight integration ensures that anomalies in development workflows—like sudden mass commits from an unfamiliar IP or an uncharacteristic spate of PR merges—are quickly contained and investigated.

\paragraph{Advantages Over Signature - Based Detection}
Because the ETD relies on \emph{behavioral} rather than purely \emph{signature - based} detection, it excels at uncovering zero - day attacks and subtle deviations from normal patterns. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insider Threats}: A compromised user account might still be recognized by its unusual commit patterns or anomalous behavior times.
    \item \textbf{Unknown Vulnerabilities}: Attackers exploiting brand - new software bugs typically exhibit usage patterns that do not match prior legitimate traffic; the ETD can spot these anomalies early.
    \item \textbf{Gradual Escalation Attacks}: If an adversary increments malicious activity over time (e.g., model drift exploitation), the ETD will register these stepwise deviations before they become critical.
\end{itemize}

By continuously retraining on real - world data, the ETD ensures its behavior baselines remain current. This approach fundamentally differs from rule -  or signature - based systems, which require manual updates whenever attackers alter their tactics. As a result, CyberSentinel provides \textbf{long - term resilience} against evolving threats, enabling security teams to detect and contain incidents that might otherwise go unnoticed until significant damage is done.

\subsubsection{Behavioral Modeling and Data Representation}
The ETD constructs a statistical model of \textbf{normal system behavior} by analyzing historical logs and network activity. Its primary goal is to capture the typical operational patterns within a given environment and then measure how far new events deviate from those norms. This baseline is refined over time, allowing CyberSentinel to adapt to legitimate changes—such as new users joining the system or variations in work hours—without conflating them with malicious activity.

To achieve this, each authentication event is mapped into a \textbf{numerical feature space}, enabling the model to quantify how far a given login attempt strays from prior historical activity. Key features include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time - based patterns:} 
    Tracking the hour of day, day of week and typical session length. For instance, if a user who usually logs in between 9:00\,AM and 5:00\,PM suddenly starts authenticating at 3:00\,AM, the ETD registers an elevated risk score.
    \item \textbf{Geospatial distribution:}
    Monitoring the geographic location (via IP - based geolocation) or cloud region from which users access the system. Abnormal changes—for example, a user who routinely logs in from North America now appearing in Eastern Europe—will increase suspicion.
    \item \textbf{Access frequency and velocity:}
    Observing the number of login attempts within a specific time window and how quickly attempts are made. A sudden burst of authentication attempts from a single IP can indicate either a brute - force attack or bot - based testing of credentials.
    \item \textbf{Credential failure rates:}
    Capturing the expected distribution of failed login attempts per session. While occasional failures are common, a high or escalating failure rate often signals unauthorized access attempts.
\end{itemize}

Beyond these core features, administrators can customize additional fields to reflect unique operational contexts. In a DevOps environment, for instance, the ETD might also track CI/CD interactions or unusual build triggers, whereas in financial institutions, it could incorporate transaction volumes or typical account interaction times. Once the log data is ingested, each feature is normalized (e.g., scaling numerical values to a fixed range or standardizing continuous variables) to ensure different units of measurement do not skew the anomaly scores.

The result is a structured vector, often denoted as
\[
  x = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \},
\]
where each \(x_i\) corresponds to a standardized feature (e.g., hour of login, IP geolocation, number of failed attempts, etc.). By comparing these vectors against an evolving baseline of “normal” behaviors, the ETD can continuously quantify how “unusual” an event is. In effect, the system learns a probabilistic understanding of how typical authentication sequences unfold—accounting for when, where and how often users log in—so that deviations from these patterns can be identified early, often before a threat actor fully compromises the environment.

\subsubsection{Detection via Anomaly Scoring}
To evaluate whether an authentication attempt is anomalous, CyberSentinel employs an \textbf{outlier detection algorithm} using \textbf{statistical distance metrics}. The core detection process consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Encoding each authentication log entry as a feature vector \( x \):
    \begin{equation}
    x = \{ \text{hour}, \text{ip\_numeric}, \text{failed\_attempts}, \text{geo\_distance} \}
    \end{equation}

    \item Estimating the probability distribution \( P(x) \) of historical login behavior.
    \item Computing an \textbf{anomaly score} using a distance - based metric such as Mahalanobis distance or Isolation Forest - based anomaly scoring:
    \begin{equation}
    S(x) = (x  -  \mu)^T \Sigma^{ - 1} (x  -  \mu)
    \end{equation}
    where \( \mu \) and \( \Sigma \) represent the mean and covariance matrix of known normal activity.
    \item Flagging authentication attempts as potential threats if their anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold, \textit{tau}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Real - Time Anomaly Detection and Response}
The ETD operates in \textbf{streaming mode}, continuously ingesting new authentication events and computing their anomaly scores in real time. When a high - severity anomaly is detected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The event is logged in structured \textbf{JSON format} and escalated for further investigation.
    \item If the anomaly score surpasses a critical threshold, an \textbf{automated response} is triggered, such as temporarily blocking the associated IP or requiring \textbf{multi - factor authentication (MFA)}.
    \item Security administrators are notified via \textbf{email alerts or Slack notifications}, integrating with enterprise security monitoring tools.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Model Retraining}
To prevent \textbf{model drift}, CyberSentinel periodically retrains its anomaly detection model using the most recent verified login data. The retraining process occurs every \textbf{30 days}, ensuring that the system adapts to legitimate changes in network activity while maintaining sensitivity to true anomalies. 

Retraining is managed via an automated job:

\end{verbatim}

This scheduled retraining prevents false positives due to evolving system behaviors while preserving the model's ability to detect emerging threats.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)}
Unlike conventional \textbf{Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)}, which rely on predefined rule sets and known attack signatures, CyberSentinel's ETD adopts a \textbf{proactive} approach. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques and adaptive anomaly detection, it can effectively identify:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low - and - slow brute - force attacks} that evade signature - based detection.
    \item \textbf{Compromised insider threats} where login behavior deviates subtly from expected norms.
    \item \textbf{Novel attack vectors} that do not match predefined patterns, such as credential stuffing with atypical timing distributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Engineering}
The ETD models SSH login behavior as a \textbf{temporal sequence of authentication events}, capturing patterns in login frequency, geographic distribution and authentication success/failure trends. Each SSH authentication attempt is transformed into a feature vector with the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timestamp} (\texttt{hour}) – The hour of login (0 -  - 23).
    \item \textbf{IP Address (Numerical)} (\texttt{ip\_numeric}) – The source IP address converted into a numerical representation.
    \item \textbf{Success/Failure} (\texttt{status}) – Whether the login attempt was successful (1) or failed (0).
    \item \textbf{Login Frequency} (\texttt{freq}) – Number of login attempts from the same IP within a defined time window.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Anomaly Detection Model}
The ETD employs a \textbf{statistical outlier detection approach} combined with \textbf{unsupervised machine learning} to identify deviations from normal behavior. The training process consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing}: The system loads historical login logs stored in \texttt{data/normal\_ssh\_data.csv}.
    \item \textbf{Clustering Normal Behavior}: A density - based clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Model) is applied.
    \item \textbf{Establishing Normalcy Bounds}: Using clustered login data, the system computes confidence intervals for expected login frequencies.
    \item \textbf{Outlier Detection}: New login attempts are compared against the learned model, flagging significant deviations as anomalous.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Retraining and Adaptation}
The emergent threat model undergoes periodic retraining to remain effective against evolving attack patterns. Retraining occurs every 30 days using the most recent verified login data. The \texttt{retrain.py} script manages data collection, feature transformation and model re - optimization. Old data is rotated out to prevent model drift while ensuring responsiveness to new network behaviors. Retrained models replace the existing detection module without service downtime.

\subsection{Security Agent Orchestration}
CyberSentinel operates as a \textbf{daemonized} process, coordinating detection modules within \texttt{security\_agent.py}. It launches brute - force monitoring as a background thread, periodically executes phishing detection and continuously evaluates authentication logs for emergent anomalies. 

\subsubsection{Multi - Threaded Execution and Task Scheduling}
The Security Agent is designed to run continuously, ensuring concurrent execution of detection modules. Each module operates in an independent execution thread, avoiding performance bottlenecks. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, breaklines=true, frame=single, backgroundcolor=\color{gray!10}]
brute_force_thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_ssh_logs, daemon=True)
brute_force_thread.start()

phishing_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_phishing_check, daemon=True)
phishing_thread.start()

emergent_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_brute_force_monitor, 
                                   args=(emergent_detector,), 
                                   daemon=True)
emergent_thread.start()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Structured Logging and Threat Management}
Threat events are logged in JSON format and forwarded to administrators. For instance:
\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "timestamp": "2025 - 02 - 12T15:23:01Z",
    "event_type": "BruteForce",
    "ip": "192.168.1.12",
    "failed_attempts": 10
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
{
    "timestamp": "2025 - 02 - 12T16:45:10Z",
    "event_type": "PhishingAlert",
    "url": "http://fake - bank - login.com",
    "detection_method": "Blacklist"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Automated Response and Mitigation}
To prevent identified threats from escalating, CyberSentinel employs automated response mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSH brute - force attacks}: The agent dynamically updates firewall rules to block malicious IP addresses:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, breaklines=true, frame=single, backgroundcolor=\color{gray!10}]
import os

def block_ip(ip_address):
    os.system(f"sudo ufw deny from {ip_address} to any")
\end{lstlisting}

    \item \textbf{Emergent anomalies}: Flagged IPs are logged and escalated for manual review, preventing false positives.
    \item \textbf{Phishing detection}: Alerts are issued via email or Slack notifications, leveraging \texttt{smtplib} and webhook integration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Agent Lifecycle}
CyberSentinel maintains persistent real - time monitoring, executing tasks in background threads while handling failure recovery. 

Retraining of the Emergent Threat Detector is scheduled using a cron job, ensuring the system adapts to evolving network patterns:
\begin{verbatim}
0 3 * * 1 python3 src/retrain.py
\end{verbatim}
This architecture allows CyberSentinel to continuously improve its detection capabilities while operating with minimal human intervention.

\section{Discussion}

CyberSentinel represents a significant advancement toward an autonomous and adaptive cybersecurity agent, leveraging a unified single-agent framework for real-time threat detection, anomaly scoring, and proactive security mitigation. By integrating deep learning-based intrusion detection methods, CyberSentinel enhances its ability to identify malicious activities across complex network environments \cite{li2020deep}. The system's modular design enables seamless scaling to large-scale deployments, ensuring efficiency even under adversarial attack scenarios \cite{kurakin2018adversarial}. Additionally, its automated retraining and adaptive thresholds account for the well-documented trade-off between robustness and accuracy in machine learning-based security solutions, allowing CyberSentinel to continuously improve detection without compromising performance \cite{zhang2019theoretically}.

Our key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A scalable and modular single - agent architecture that integrates brute - force detection, phishing protection and anomaly - based emergent threat detection.
    \item A machine learning - driven Emergent Threat Detector (ETD) that adapts to evolving attack patterns without requiring predefined threat signatures.
    \item A fully automated model retraining pipeline that enables continuous learning from new security data, improving anomaly detection performance over time.
    \item Seamless integration with SIEM systems, cloud security platforms and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring wide applicability in enterprise and cloud environments.
\end{itemize}

By incorporating explainability, AI security alignment, and AI-generated attack detection, CyberSentinel stands at the frontier of next-generation AI-driven cybersecurity. The integration of explainable AI (XAI) mechanisms enhances transparency, enabling security teams to interpret and trust model decisions in high-stakes environments \cite{doshi2020considerations}. However, as adversarial AI threats evolve, research on enhancing model resilience against adversarial attacks remains critical, particularly in securing AI-driven authentication systems and cyber-defense strategies \cite{carlini2020evaluating}. Furthermore, improving AI governance and regulatory frameworks is essential to ensure responsible deployment of AI-based threat detection systems, balancing security needs with ethical considerations and compliance requirements \cite{weidinger2022taxonomy}.

In future work, we aim to extend CyberSentinel’s capabilities to proactively detect adversarial AI manipulation, integrate federated security learning, and refine human-in-the-loop security oversight. Detecting adversarial AI manipulations requires expanding defenses against data poisoning, backdoor attacks, and model inversion techniques, which have been increasingly observed in AI-driven cybersecurity \cite{goldblum2022dataset}. Additionally, federated learning for security monitoring offers promising avenues for collaborative threat detection across decentralized environments while preserving privacy \cite{kairouz2021advances}. Moreover, refining human-AI collaboration in cybersecurity workflows is crucial, as security analysts require interpretable and actionable insights to effectively respond to emerging threats \cite{bhatt2021machine}. Finally, aligning CyberSentinel with AI risk assessment frameworks and global cybersecurity policies will be essential to balance proactive defense with ethical and legal considerations \cite{brundage2020toward}.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}
While CyberSentinel presents a significant advancement in AI - driven cybersecurity, several challenges and open research areas remain. This section discusses key limitations and outlines future directions for improving the framework.

\subsubsection{Reducing False Positives in Anomaly Detection}

One of the primary challenges in AI - based anomaly detection systems is minimizing false positives while maintaining high recall for genuine security threats. The Emergent Threat Detector (ETD) in CyberSentinel employs unsupervised learning models such as Isolation Forests and Mahalanobis Distance to detect deviations from normal behavior. However, these methods can sometimes flag benign activity as suspicious, leading to unnecessary security alerts.

\textbf{Future Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context - Aware Threat Modeling:} Incorporating additional contextual information (e.g., user roles, time - of - day access patterns, behavioral baselines) can reduce false alarms by distinguishing normal variations from genuine threats.
    \item \textbf{Active Learning for Label Refinement:} Implementing a human - in - the - loop feedback system where security analysts can label uncertain cases, enabling the model to improve over time and reduce false positives.
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Learning Approaches:} Combining multiple anomaly detection techniques (e.g., statistical, deep learning - based and graph - based methods) may enhance accuracy by cross - verifying anomalies before flagging them as threats.
    \item \textbf{Confidence Scoring and Threshold Optimization:} Dynamically adjusting alert thresholds based on historical security incidents can help balance sensitivity and specificity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extending Detection Capabilities to AI - Generated Attack Vectors}

The increasing use of AI for adversarial attacks introduces novel cybersecurity threats that traditional security tools struggle to detect. Attackers now leverage AI to automate phishing campaigns, generate deepfake identities, conduct model inversion attacks and manipulate AI - driven decision systems. These threats demand enhanced detection strategies that go beyond conventional security measures.

\textbf{Future Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detecting AI - Powered Phishing Attacks:} Enhancing CyberSentinel’s phishing detection module with NLP - based AI classifiers to recognize LLM - generated phishing emails and deceptive social engineering messages.
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Robustness Testing:} Introducing adversarial attack simulation modules that test CyberSentinel’s defenses against evasion techniques, such as perturbation - based adversarial examples.
    \item \textbf{Deepfake and Synthetic Identity Detection:} Incorporating computer vision and audio analysis to identify manipulated images, videos and voices used in AI - generated fraud schemes.
    \item \textbf{Model Integrity Verification:} Implementing mechanisms to detect backdoor attacks and model poisoning in AI systems by analyzing hidden layer activations and decision boundary shifts.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration with AI Alignment and Safety Frameworks}

As AI systems become more autonomous, ensuring alignment with security and ethical standards is critical. CyberSentinel must integrate with emerging AI governance, interpretability and accountability frameworks to ensure transparency in security decision - making.

\textbf{Future Directions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Explainable AI (XAI) for Security Decisions:} Developing interpretable threat classification models that provide human - readable explanations for detected anomalies and security alerts.
    \item \textbf{Compliance with AI Ethics Guidelines:} Aligning CyberSentinel’s risk assessment processes with frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and the EU AI Act.
    \item \textbf{Federated Learning for Privacy - Preserving Security Monitoring:} Exploring federated learning approaches to allow distributed threat intelligence sharing across organizations while maintaining data privacy.
    \item \textbf{Autonomous Threat Mitigation with AI Safety Constraints:} Implementing policy - driven constraints that ensure AI - driven mitigation actions (e.g., auto - banning users, blocking IPs) align with ethical and legal guidelines.
\end{itemize}

By addressing these research challenges, CyberSentinel can evolve into a more adaptive, interpretable and resilient cybersecurity system capable of defending against next - generation AI - driven cyber threats.
