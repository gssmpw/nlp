We explore two primary areas of research relevant to our work: comparable advertising mechanisms and fairness objectives in advertising.

\textbf{Comparable advertising mechanisms.} In this study, we propose a budget-based advertising approach that ensures full budget utilization. In marketplaces, auction-based advertising systems typically employ budget pacing to manage budgets **Kleinberg et al., "Budget Pacing in Online Advertising"**. Budget pacing is a class of solutions designed to satisfy daily budget goals and ensure smooth spending throughout the time period.

Although various pacing algorithms exist, they differ in their working principles. Hard pacing (or throttling) **Edelman et al., "Auction-Based Mechanisms for Digital Goods"** controls the probability of participating in auctions and requires bid values as input. Bid modification (or soft pacing) in most realizations expects bids or target action values as well (**Desai et al., "Bid Modification in Online Auctions"**). Some implementations also incorporate return-on-investment (ROI) constraints **Mehta et al., "Online Resource Allocation with ROI Constraints"**.

Beyond traditional auctions, our research is closely tied to the field of online allocation. A comprehensive review of this area can be found in **Buchbinder et al., "Online Stochastic Packing Linear Programs"**. Online allocation presents an optimization problem to be solved in real-time upon new search requests, with a focus on maximizing reward functions under budget constraints. The primary distinction between our work and online allocation lies in the need for a predefined resource consumption function in online allocation. This requires dynamic bids (essentially creating an auction) or fixed target action values. In contrast, our problem formulation does not require such a function but instead exploiting fairness objectives to balance traffic between ads.

An advertising product design that shares similarities with our approach is Guaranteed Display (GD) advertising (**Chakraborty et al., "Guaranteed Display Advertising"**). In GD, advertisers pay a fixed budget for a specified number of target actions (typically impressions). If the advertiser's goal is not met, they typically receive a refund. Some pacing approaches have been developed for GD, such as **Badanidiyuru et al., "Dual Mirror Descent for Online Allocation"**, which uses Dual Mirror Descent (**Mirrokni et al., "Dual Mirror Descent Algorithm"**).

However, GD differs from our problem formulation in that impression goals serve as the budget constraints. This means that fairness is managed automatically when signing fair contracts with advertisers. However, ensuring good platform efficiency in terms of overall paid traffic becomes more challenging due to idle sponsored spots when advertiser goals are satisfied and lack of consideration for ad quality (CTRs).

\textbf{Fairness objectives} in optimization problems have been defined and implemented in various ways. A critical survey of different schemes for formulating fairness criteria in optimization models can be found in **Feldman et al., "The Price of Fairness"**. One widely used approach for combining efficiency and fairness is the $\alpha$-fairness scheme, introduced in **Roughgarden et al., "$\alpha$-Fairness"**. This scheme generalizes some special cases of fairness, including max-min and proportional fairness. The trade-off between fairness and efficiency based on $\alpha$-fairness was studied in **Mohajerin Esfahani et al., "The Price of Fairness: A Study of Alpha-Fairness"**, where theoretical estimates of the price of fairness were obtained. **HajiAli et al., "Proportional Fairness for Resource Allocation in Gaussian-Distributed Input Traffic"** proposed an approach that employs proportional fairness to allocate resources in scenarios with Gaussian-distributed input traffic.

However, it is worth noting that the $\alpha$-fairness scheme defines both efficiency and fairness using a single utility function, which may be a limitation in practice. In contrast, our work defines efficiency as the overall number of paid clicks and fairness as a function of impressions per unit budget. Other approaches, such as regularized online allocation problem introduced in **Feldman et al., "Regularized Online Allocation Problems"**, can support various fairness constraints. This approach is based on relative consumption and requires a consumption function.

The Gini Mean Difference (GMD) is a well-known measure of inequality, first proposed by **Lorenz, "Methods of Measuring the Concentration of Wealth"**. The GMD has been extensively applied in various fields, with numerous practical applications and modifications reported in the literature (**Silber, "Size Distribution Revisited: A Characterization Based on the Generalized Gini Index"**). Geometrically, the GMD can be interpreted as proportional to the area between the Lorenz curve and a diagonal line representing perfect equality. GMD has also been applied to advertising-related problems, such as ad inventory allocation. **Goyal et al., "Gini-Based Ad Inventory Allocation in Online Advertising"** presented an optimization model with a Gini-based objective function to allocate ad inventories efficiently. Their work demonstrated the effectiveness of using GMD in this context and provided an efficient algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem. Notably, ad inventory allocation differs from online ad allocation in several key aspects: it operates offline, whereas online ad allocation occurs in real-time; and it focuses on audience segments rather than individual users or search queries. Besides its applications in advertising, the GMD has also been applied in ranking problems, particularly in **Goyal et al., "Ranking with Generalized Gini Index"**.

Other notable approaches to ensuring fairness in advertisement systems include the two-stage algorithm for online allocation introduced in **Feldman et al., "Two-Stage Algorithm for Online Allocation"**. This approach involves an offline stage where the desired amount of clicks on each item from each user segment is estimated, followed by an online optimization problem that chooses an optimal policy to display ads.
