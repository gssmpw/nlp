In this paper, we introduce the first generative model capable of simultaneously compositing multiple objects in a natural and realistic manner, guided by text and layout. We demonstrate how joint training on object compositing and subject-driven generation improves model performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both tasks. This multi-object, dual training approach enhances flexibility, enabling applications like subject-driven inpainting and more realistic object interactions. We hope this work inspires further research into more controllable and effective object compositing techniques.
