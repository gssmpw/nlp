% It is strongly recommended to use hyperref, especially for the review version.
% hyperref with option pagebackref eases the reviewers' job.
% Please disable hyperref *only* if you encounter grave issues, 
% e.g. with the file validation for the camera-ready version.
%
% If you comment hyperref and then uncomment it, you should delete *.aux before re-running LaTeX.
% (Or just hit 'q' on the first LaTeX run, let it finish, and you should be clear).

    Figure 1. Our model allows simultaneous compositing of several objects with text and layout control, offering harmonious and natural results (\textit{top row}). Object relations and actions can be controlled through text, allowing reposing and automatic addition of necessary objects (\ie flowing tea). Pose and layout can be controlled via bounding boxes provided as input. Our model can also be used for customization (\textit{bottom row}), seamlessly integrating given objects into described backgrounds.
