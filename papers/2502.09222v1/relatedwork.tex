The creation of problem-specific interfaces has been a long standing challenge for declarative methods.
A \prolog-based method using XML was investigated in~\cite{schsei12a}.
\cite{schel96a} focus on automatic user interface generation with model-based UIs.
This is extended with contextual information and ASP in~\cite{zakzag11a}.
In the context of non-interactive ASP visualizations, recent advancements have led to \clingraph~\cite{hasascst22a}.
The need for interactivity in ASP was addressed in previous studies~\cite{geobsc15a},
and later incorporated into \clingo's API with multi-shot capabilities~\cite{karoscwa21a},
enabling continuous solving of logic programs that undergo frequent changes.
Tools have also emerged to facilitate ASP program development,
such as ASP Chef~\cite{alcrro23a} for task pipelining,
and various Integrated Development Environments~\cite{fereri11a,buoepuskto13a}.
These tools align with advancements in related areas like argumentation~\cite{dachselt2022nexas}.
In contrast to existing work,
\clinguin\ focuses on creating modern domain-specific interactive user interfaces in ASP.
