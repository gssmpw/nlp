    \textbf{Effect of multi-reward CaPO}. We demonstrate the qualitative comparison between CaPO with single-reward with each MPS, VQAscore, and VILA, and CaPO with multi-reward on SDXL.
    We see that optimizing with single-reward improves upon the base model, yet multi-reward CaPO shows the best overall improvement.
    For example, while using VQAscore alone improves the image-text alignment, the image aesthetics are significantly improved when using multi-reward. 
    Also, when using VILA score, the image aesthetics improve, but it often lose the image-text alignment (\emph{e.g.}, the image becomes drawing style, while only the elephant should be in a drawing style).}
