    Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO) improves the performance of diffusion models by optimizing the model with diverse reward signals. 
    The top and bottom groups are using SDXL and SD3-medium, respectively. For each group, the first row is from base model and the second row is applying CaPO to the base model. 
    CaPO tends to generate images of higher quality (\emph{e.g.}, image aestheticism, text rendering), and better prompt alignment (\emph{e.g.}, compositional generation), without using any human preference dataset.
