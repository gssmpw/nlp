We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Supavich Punchun for facilitating WCX-CCL data preparation, Apiwat Sukthawornpradit, Watcharit Boonying, and Tawan Tantakull for scraping, preprocessing, and preparing Tax Case Dataset. We also thank all VISAI.AI company members for helping us perform quality control for LLM-as-a-judge metric validation.

We are deeply thankful to the legal expert annotators for their meticulous work in annotating samples, which was essential for validating the LLM-as-a-judge metrics.

Special thanks to Prof. Keerakiat Pratai - Faculty of Law, Thammasat University - for their insightful consultations on Thai legal information and background knowledge, which significantly enriched our research.

We sincerely thank PTT, SCB, and SCBX, the main sponsors of the WangchanX project, for their generous support. Their contributions have been instrumental in advancing research on Thai legal AI.

Finally, we extend our appreciation to the research assistants at VISTEC for their valuable guidance in constructing benchmarks for LLM systems, particularly in retrieval and end-to-end (E2E) metrics.
