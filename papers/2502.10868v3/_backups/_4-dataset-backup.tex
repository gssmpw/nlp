\section{WangchanX Legal ThaiCCL Rag Dataset}
\label{sec: wangchanx}

This paper introduces WangchanX Legal ThaiCCL RAG Dataset\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/airesearch/WangchanX-Legal-ThaiCCL-RAG} (WCX Dataset), a question-answering dataset specifically designed for RAG tasks in the field of Thai financial law. This dataset addresses the crucial need for accurate, verifiable, and source-aware legal applications, an area where RAG has gained significant traction. \textcolor{orange}{The goal of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive data for finetuning both retrieval model and LLM which is a foundation of building a domain-specific Thai legal RAG system. We also provides a seperate test set annotated by the legal domain experts.}\st{RAG enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of answers provided by large language models by retrieving and incorporating domain-specific information from reliable knowledge bases. This involves understanding the user's question, identifying relevant information from the knowledge base, and crafting a comprehensive answer using both retrieved information and the model's knowledge.

However, a significant challenge lies in the lack of high-quality datasets for training and evaluating RAG models in Thai legal domain. This dataset aims to bridge this gap by providing comprehensive data for both retriever and LLM training, enabling the development of more robust and reliable legal applications.}

\subsection{Dataset Curation}
Our dataset is divided into training and test set. The training set comprises synthetically generated data \textcolor{orange}{from a LLM which was later} validated by legal experts, covering 35 legislation encompassing the Civil and Commercial Code, Revenue Code, and various other financial laws (see table \ref{tab:wcxccc}). On the other hand, the test set is developed by legal experts who formulated both questions and answers based on specific legal articles covering only 21 from 35 legislation from training set\st{,}\textcolor{orange}{. The test set was} further validated by a separate group of legal professionals for quality assurance.

% The training set leverages a semi-automated approach involving synthetic data generation and expert validation. First, questions are automatically generated from section in each legislation using Gemini 1.5 Pro \cite{gemini1.5}, followed by the retrieval of top 5 relevant sections using BGE-M3 \cite{bge-m3}. Legal experts subsequently refine these generated components, labeling retrieved sections as positive if relevant. Subsequently, answers are generated using a Meta-Llama-3–70B \cite{llama3.1} or claude-3-sonnet \cite{claude3} if the former LLM cannot generate an answer, followed by another round of expert review to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Our training dataset is constructed using a semi-automated approach combining synthetic data generation with expert validation. First, we automatically generate questions from each legal section using Gemini 1.5 Pro \cite{gemini1.5}. We then retrieve the top 5 most relevant sections using BGE-M3 \cite{bge-m3}. Legal experts subsequently refine these generated components, labeling retrieved sections as positive if relevant. Answers are then generated using Meta-Llama-3–70B \cite{llama3.1}, or claude-3-sonnet \cite{claude3} if the former fails to produce an answer. A final expert review \textcolor{orange}{and adjust the LLM generated answer again to} ensures accuracy and comprehensiveness.

% In contrast, the test set relies entirely on manual creation and a rigorous two-tiered expert review process. Legal experts meticulously craft both questions and answers based on specific legal articles. These question-answer pairs then undergo scrutiny by a separate group of legal experts who evaluate their quality, provide feedback, and ensure alignment with real-world legal scenarios. This approach ensures a comprehensive and reliable dataset suitable for both training and evaluating RAG models in the Thai legal domain.

Our test set, conversely, is constructed entirely manually and undergoes a rigorous two-tiered expert review. Legal experts craft questions and answers based on specific legal articles. A separate group of legal experts then reviews these question-answer pairs, providing feedback and ensuring relevance to real-world legal scenarios.

% The dataset curation pipeline is illustrated in Figure XXX.


\subsection{Limitation}
It's important to note a key difference between the training and test sets: the training set inherently allows for multiple relevant sections (multi-label) per question, reflecting real-world legal scenarios where multiple legal provisions might apply. Conversely, the expert-curated test set primarily focuses on single-label question-answer pairs. This discrepancy presents a limitation, potentially leading to an overly optimistic evaluation of models trained on the multi-label training set when tested on the single-label test set. Future work will explore bridging this gap, potentially through incorporating multi-label annotations in the test set or developing evaluation metrics robust to label multiplicity variations.

% This paper introduces the WangchanX Legal ThaiCCC RAG Dataset\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/airesearch/WangchanX-Legal-ThaiCCC-RAG}}, a question-answering dataset specifically designed for RAG tasks in the field of Thai financial law. This dataset features positive and negative labels and is constructed from 35 legal documents, including 33 acts and 2 codes, encompassing the Thai Civil and Commercial Code, Revenue Code, and various finance-related acts (detailed in Table XX).

% The dataset creation process involves a multi-step approach. First, we use our tier-based hierarchical chunking pipeline to segment legal acts and codes into hierarchical chunks. Then, only chunks representing legal sections are selected, considered the smallest meaningful units of legal information. LLM then generates synthetic queries based on these sections, simulating real-user inquiries. Subsequently, the bge-m3 model retrieves the top 10 relevant sections for each synthetic query. Finally, human annotators review these retrieved sections, selecting the truly relevant ones for each query and crafting comprehensive answers based on both the query and these selected sections.

% This meticulous process ensures real-world relevance by simulating user queries and requiring multi-label annotation, reflecting how multiple legal sections often contribute to answering a single query. Additionally, human-generated answers based on selected relevant sections guarantee accuracy and comprehensiveness. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, allowing for both the fine-tuning of embedding models for retrieval tasks and the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for generating accurate and relevant answers within the context of Thai financial law.
