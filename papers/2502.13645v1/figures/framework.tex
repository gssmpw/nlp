    which yields a downstream task score and a WER score of the transcript set input to the task. The pipeline is executed for several severeties of noising and types of cleaning techniques. %Acoustic noising is applied at $k$ intensities, providing $k+1$ audio versions (including the non-noised version), eventually producing $k+2$ transcript versions (including the source transcript). Applying transcript cleaning reveals the effect of \textit{types} of noise. 
    Resulting scores are plotted on a graph for the analyses, as in, e.g., \autoref{fig_cleaning_graphs}.}
    %The pipeline is executed on $k+1$ intensities of acoustic noising (including the non-noised version), producing $k+2$ scores for the downstream task (including execution on the source transcripts). This process eventually describes the effect of the \textit{intensity} of transcript noise on the downstream task. The process is repeated for $m$ cleaning techniques ($m+1$ when including no cleaning), to analyze the benefit of a cleaning approach and the effect of the \textit{types} of transcript noise.}
