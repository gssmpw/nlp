    \caption{Speech can be transcribed with varying levels of error severity,
    %Speech is transcribed with different noise levels, 
    which effects the results of downstream language understanding tasks. For example, summarizing a transcript with variations of the utterance above might produce differing outcomes. The top version is the reference, and the following are \underline{marked} with errors.}
    %We propose a framework for analyzing the behavior of task models, when given transcripts with errors at varying intensities and types.}
