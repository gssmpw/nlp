    \caption{The framework for assessing \ENDow{}, where each component in the pipeline is given in the input configuration. As a result of the pipeline, we can analyze the behavior of the task model at $k+2$ different levels of noise, as represented by line $l_0$. Additionally, the corresponding line $l_j$ of cleaning technique $j$ can be compared against $l_0$ to produce a final cleaning effectiveness score, comparable to other cleaning techniques.}
