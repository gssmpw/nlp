@article{deKlerka2005-dutch,
	abstract = {The wait time for deceased‐donor kidney transplantation has increased to 4--5 years in the Netherlands. Strategies to expand the donor pool include a living donor kidney exchange program. This makes it possible that patients who cannot directly receive a kidney from their intended living donor, due to ABO blood type incompatibility or a positive cross match, exchange donors in order to receive a compatible kidney. All Dutch kidney transplantation centers agreed on a common protocol. An independent organization is responsible for the allocation, cross matches are centrally performed and exchange takes place on an anonymous basis. Donors travel to the recipient centers. Surgical procedures are scheduled simultaneously. Sixty pairs participated within 1 year. For 9 of 29 ABO blood type incompatible and 17 of 31 cross match positive combinations, a compatible pair was found. Five times a cross match positive couple was matched to a blood type incompatible one, where the recipients were of blood type O. The living donor kidney exchange program is a successful approach that does not harm any of the candidates on the deceased donor kidney waitlist. For optimal results, both ABO blood type incompatible and cross match positive pairs should participate.},

	abstract = {In 1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running-time of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem can be improved when non-sequential access to the input is allowed. Partial negative answers were given by Ng and Hirschberg and as part of Segal's general communication-complexity analysis. We give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful, argument showing that Ω(n2) Boolean queries of any type are required for finding a stable --- or even approximately stable --- marriage. Unlike Segal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes additionally to (A) randomized algorithms, (B) allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's and men's respective preferences profiles, (C) related problems, e.g. whether a given pair is married in every/some stable marriage, (D) whether a proposed marriage is stable or far from stable. To analyze ``approximately stable'' marriages, we introduce the notion of ``distance to stability'' and provide an efficient algorithm for its computation.},

At least one stable matching exists for every stable marriage instance, and efficient algorithms for finding such a matching are well known. The stable roommates problem involves a single set of even cardinality n, each member of which ranks all the others in order of preference. A stable matching is now a partition of this single set into n2 pairs so that no two unmatched members both prefer each other to their partners under the matching. In this case, there are problem instances for which no stable matching exists. However, the present paper describes an O(n2) algorithm that will determine, for any instance of the problem, whether a stable matching exists, and if so, will find such a matching.},

In this chapter, we give the keys to understand and use acyclic preference-based. After a brief introduction to the roots and notation of the model, the main convergence theorem is exposed and a description of P2P-relevant preferences is given. Ensues an explanation of the combinatory techniques used to refine the convergence study, and a statistical description, based on mean field assumptions, of the stable configurations of acyclic preference-based systems. For some preferences, we observe that the stable configuration is a small-world.},

@article{Perach2008-stable,
	abstract = {This paper reports on a case study of the assignment of students to dormitories at the Technion--Israel Institute of Technology. Two criteria are used in considering applicants. The first criterion, determined by personal socio-economic characteristics, is used to make decisions about the privilege of getting on-campus housing. The second criterion is used for the actual assignment of the students who were found eligible for on-campus housing to specific dormitories---here the priority is determined by academic seniority and academic excellence. A modification of the classic stable matching model that allows for an ``entrance criterion''is developed and analyzed. In particular, a new concept of quasi-stable outcomes is introduced and an algorithm that produces such an outcome with desirable properties is described. The algorithm was implemented successfully for the assignment of students to dormitories at the Technion toward the 2004/2005 academic year.},

However, in kidney exchange, there are constraints on the size of exchanges. Initially, kidney exchanges are likely to be between just two patient–donor pairs. We show that, although this constraint eliminates some potential exchanges, there is a wide class of constrained-efficient mechanisms that are strategy-proof when patient–donor pairs and surgeons have 0–1 preferences. This includes deterministic mechanisms that accommodate the priority setting that organ banks currently use to allocate cadaver organs, and stochastic mechanisms that allow distributive justice issues to be addressed.}

We call such a matching ``a complete stable matching.'' It is known that a complete stable matching may not exist. Irving described an O(n2) algorithm that would find one complete stable matching if there is one, or would report that none exists. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a complete stable matching; namely, the non-existence of any odd party, which will be defined subsequently. We define a new structure called a ``stable partition,'' which generalizes the notion of a complete stable matching, and prove that every instance of the stable roommates problem has at least one such structure. We also show that a stable partition contains all the odd parties, if there are any. Finally we have an O(n2) algorithm that finds one stable partition which in turn gives all the odd parties.},
