	abstract = {We develop a new technique for proving lower bounds in property testing, by showing a strong connection between testing and communication complexity. We give a simple scheme for reducing communication problems to testing problems, thus allowing us to use known lower bounds in communication complexity to prove lower bounds in testing. This scheme is general and implies a number of new testing bounds, as well as simpler proofs of several known bounds.},

	abstract = {In 1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running-time of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem can be improved when non-sequential access to the input is allowed. Partial negative answers were given by Ng and Hirschberg and as part of Segal's general communication-complexity analysis. We give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful, argument showing that Î©(n2) Boolean queries of any type are required for finding a stable --- or even approximately stable --- marriage. Unlike Segal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes additionally to (A) randomized algorithms, (B) allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's and men's respective preferences profiles, (C) related problems, e.g. whether a given pair is married in every/some stable marriage, (D) whether a proposed marriage is stable or far from stable. To analyze ``approximately stable'' marriages, we introduce the notion of ``distance to stability'' and provide an efficient algorithm for its computation.},

@article{Irving1985-stable,
	abstract = {The stable marriage problem is that of matching n men and n women, each of whom has ranked the members of the opposite sex in order of preference, so that no unmatched couple both prefer each other to their partners under the matching. At least one stable matching exists for every stable marriage instance, and efficient algorithms for finding such a matching are well known. The stable roommates problem involves a single set of even cardinality n, each member of which ranks all the others in order of preference. A stable matching is now a partition of this single set into n2 pairs so that no two unmatched members both prefer each other to their partners under the matching. In this case, there are problem instances for which no stable matching exists. However, the present paper describes an O(n2) algorithm that will determine, for any instance of the problem, whether a stable matching exists, and if so, will find such a matching.},

	abstract = {The stable roommates problem is a well-known problem of matching n people into n2 disjoint pairs so that no two unmatched persons both prefer each other to their partners under the matching. We call such a matching ``a complete stable matching.'' It is known that a complete stable matching may not exist. Irving described an O(n2) algorithm that would find one complete stable matching if there is one, or would report that none exists. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a complete stable matching; namely, the non-existence of any odd party, which will be defined subsequently. We define a new structure called a ``stable partition,'' which generalizes the notion of a complete stable matching, and prove that every instance of the stable roommates problem has at least one such structure. We also show that a stable partition contains all the odd parties, if there are any. Finally we have an O(n2) algorithm that finds one stable partition which in turn gives all the odd parties.},
