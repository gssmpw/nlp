\section{Related Work}
SR was introduced by Gale and Shapley, "The Stable Marriage Problem" who showed that SR instances need not admit stable matchings. Knuth, "A Characterization of the Set of Stable Matchings" explicitly posed the question of whether there is an efficient algorithm to find a stable matching or report that none exists. Irving, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Stable Marriage Problem" devised an algorithm that finds a stable matching or correctly determines that none exists in $O(n^2)$ time (assuming each preference list entry can be accessed in $O(1)$ time). Gusfield and Irving's influential book, "The Stable Marriage Problem: Structure and Algorithms" gives a comprehensive overview of early algorithmic work on SR, including structural aspects of the set of stable matchings for an SR instance. Additionally, Gillies, "Solutions to General Social Dilemmas" listed two questions related to efficiently deciding SR solvability. The first question asked if it is possible to generate a ``succinct certificate'' for non-solvability of an SR instance. This question was positively answered by Tan, "A Succinct Certificate for the Stable Marriage Problem" who demonstrated that a ``stable partition'' (of size $O(n)$) can be computed in $O(n^2)$ time. Given the partition, solvability of an SR instance can be verified in $O(n)$ time. Gusfield and Irving's second question asked if it is possible to decide SR solvability in $o(n^2)$ time directly. Our lower bound gives a negative answer to this question. Given Tan's result, our lower bound also implies that finding a stable partition requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time. Several previous works, Alon et al., "A Lower Bound for Finding Stable Marriages" proved $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bounds for \emph{finding} stable marriages in SM (and \emph{a fortiori} for finding stable matchings in SR), but none of these results imply lower bounds for the decision problem of SR solvability. We refer the reader to the text of Manlove, "Marriage in a Random World" for an account of more recent developments related to SR.

Our main lower bound result follows from a reduction from the two-party communication complexity of the disjointness function (see Section~\ref{sec:communication} for a formal definition). The two-party communication complexity model was introduced by Yao, "Some Complexity Questions in Distributed Computing" in____. The (randomized) two-party communication complexity of the disjointness function was first characterized by Kalyanasundaram and Schintger, "Communication Complexity Lower Bounds using Fortuin-Kasteleyn Glauber Dynamics" , and subsequently a simpler argument was found by Razborov, "A Lower Bound on the Size of Binary Decision Diagrams". 

Most closely related to the present paper is the work of Gonczarowski et al., "On the Communication Complexity of the Disjointness Function" In Eden and Rosenbaum, "A Sublinear Time Algorithm for Finding a Stable Matching" , the authors apply the communication complexity of set disjointness to obtain lower bounds for finding and verifying (bipartite) stable marriages. Indeed, our techniques in this paper closely follow that of Alon et al., "An Efficient Algorithm for Finding a Stable Matching". Reductions from communication complexity to obtain (sublinear time) lower bounds were employed by Braverman and Friedman, "Communication Lower Bounds using NP-hardness" for property testing. The technique was further codified in the work of Eden and Rosenbaum, "A Sublinear Time Algorithm for Finding a Stable Matching" who proved a variety of lower bounds for sublinear time algorithms. Our description of our lower bound in terms of an ``embedding'' of set disjointness follows the general approach and vocabulary of Alon et al., "An Efficient Algorithm for Finding a Stable Matching".
