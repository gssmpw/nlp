% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We study the inherent trade-offs in \emph{minimizing privacy risks and maximizing utility, while maintaining high computational efficiency}, when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
%
A number of recent works in privacy research have attempted to mitigate privacy risks posed by memorizing fine-tuning data by using differentially private training methods (e.g., DP), albeit at a significantly higher computational cost (inefficiency). 
%
In parallel, several works in systems research have focussed on developing (parameter) efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA), but few works, if any, investigated whether such efficient methods enhance or diminish privacy risks.
%
In this paper, we investigate this gap and arrive at a surprising conclusion: efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA mitigate privacy-risks similar to private fine-tuning methods like DP.  
%
Our empirical finding directly contradicts prevailing wisdom that privacy and efficiency objectives are at odds during fine-tuning.
%
Our finding is established by (a) carefully defining measures of privacy and utility that distinguish between memorizing \emph{sensitive and non-sensitive} tokens in training and test datasets used in fine-tuning and (b) extensive evaluations using multiple open-source language models from Pythia, Gemma, and Llama families and different domain-specific datasets.

% \section{Introduction}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% A paragraph of text goes here. Lots of text. Plenty of interesting
% text. Text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text text text text text text text text
% text text text text text text text.
% More fascinating text. Features galore, plethora of promises.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section{Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Footnotes should be places after punctuation characters, without any
% spaces between said characters and footnotes, like so.%
% \footnote{Remember that USENIX format stopped using endnotes and is
%   now using regular footnotes.} And some embedded literal code may
% look as follows.

% \begin{verbatim}
% int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
% {
%     return 0;
% }
% \end{verbatim}

% Now we're going to cite somebody. Watch for the cite tag. Here it
% comes. Arpachi-Dusseau and Arpachi-Dusseau co-authored an excellent OS
% book, which is also really funny~\cite{arpachiDusseau18:osbook}, and
% Waldspurger got into the SIGOPS hall-of-fame due to his seminal paper
% about resource management in the ESX hypervisor~\cite{waldspurger02}.

% The tilde character (\~{}) in the tex source means a non-breaking
% space. This way, your reference will always be attached to the word
% that preceded it, instead of going to the next line.

% And the 'cite' package sorts your citations by their numerical order
% of the corresponding references at the end of the paper, ridding you
% from the need to notice that, e.g, ``Waldspurger'' appears after
% ``Arpachi-Dusseau'' when sorting references
% alphabetically~\cite{waldspurger02,arpachiDusseau18:osbook}. 

% It'd be nice and thoughtful of you to include a suitable link in each
% and every bibtex entry that you use in your submission, to allow
% reviewers (and other readers) to easily get to the cited work, as is
% done in all entries found in the References section of this document.

% Now we're going take a look at Section~\ref{sec:figs}, but not before
% observing that refs to sections and citations and such are colored and
% clickable in the PDF because of the packages we've included.

% \section{Floating Figures and Lists}
% \label{sec:figs}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


% %---------------------------
% \begin{figure}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
%   \draw[thin,gray!40] (-2,-2) grid (2,2);
%   \draw[<->] (-2,0)--(2,0) node[right]{$x$};
%   \draw[<->] (0,-2)--(0,2) node[above]{$y$};
%   \draw[line width=2pt,blue,-stealth](0,0)--(1,1)
%         node[anchor=south west]{$\boldsymbol{u}$};
%   \draw[line width=2pt,red,-stealth](0,0)--(-1,-1)
%         node[anchor=north east]{$\boldsymbol{-u}$};
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{center}
% \caption{\label{fig:vectors} Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
%   caption's text. }
% \end{figure}
% %% %---------------------------


% Here's a typical reference to a floating figure:
% Figure~\ref{fig:vectors}. Floats should usually be placed where latex
% wants then. Figure\ref{fig:vectors} is centered, and has a caption
% that instructs you to make sure that the size of the text within the
% figures that you use is as big as (or bigger than) the size of the
% text in the caption of the figures. Please do. Really.

% In our case, we've explicitly drawn the figure inlined in latex, to
% allow this tex file to cleanly compile. But usually, your figures will
% reside in some file.pdf, and you'd include them in your document
% with, say, \textbackslash{}includegraphics.

% Lists are sometimes quite handy. If you want to itemize things, feel
% free:

% \begin{description}
  
% \item[fread] a function that reads from a \texttt{stream} into the
%   array \texttt{ptr} at most \texttt{nobj} objects of size
%   \texttt{size}, returning returns the number of objects read.

% \item[Fred] a person's name, e.g., there once was a dude named Fred
%   who separated usenix.sty from this file to allow for easy
%   inclusion.
% \end{description}

% \noindent
% The noindent at the start of this paragraph in its tex version makes
% it clear that it's a continuation of the preceding paragraph, as
% opposed to a new paragraph in its own right.


% \subsection{LaTeX-ing Your TeX File}
% %-----------------------------------

% People often use \texttt{pdflatex} these days for creating pdf-s from
% tex files via the shell. And \texttt{bibtex}, of course. Works for us.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section*{Acknowledgments}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The USENIX latex style is old and very tired, which is why
% there's no \textbackslash{}acks command for you to use when
% acknowledging. Sorry.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \section*{Availability}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% USENIX program committees give extra points to submissions that are
% backed by artifacts that are publicly available. If you made your code
% or data available, it's worth mentioning this fact in a dedicated
% section.
