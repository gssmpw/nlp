\section{Introduction}

Large-scale Transformer models face computational and memory bottlenecks during inference, prompting widespread adoption of KV Cache compression to reduce memory usage and many parallelization techniques to distribute workloads across GPUs. However, head-wise KV Cache compression creates workload imbalances as attention heads exhibit varying compression rates, causing GPU idle time and increased latency.

We propose a novel optimization technique, Adaptive Head Allocation (AHA), which performs static, data-driven allocation of attention heads in transformer models to achieve more balanced GPU workload distribution. Unlike conventional static methods, which assign attention heads arbitrarily, AHA leverages statistics from the retained KV cache to intelligently partition and allocate attention heads based on their computational workload. Specifically, AHA combines attention heads with high computational demands with those requiring less computational resources, and applies data parallelism to split the most demanding heads. The result is a more balanced workload across all GPUs, ensuring that each GPU is optimally utilized while avoiding memory bottlenecks and reducing inference latency. The core innovation of AHA lies in its ability to use KV cache compression statistics to inform the static allocation process, effectively balancing the workload without requiring dynamic adjustments.
