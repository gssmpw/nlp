Our results show that a very small number of batches gives already close to minimax optimal regret bounds and we also evaluate the number of trials in each batch. As a byproduct, we derive optimal policies with low switching cost for stochastic bandits.} }

abstract = {Performing anomaly detection on attributed networks concerns with finding nodes whose patterns or behaviors deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes. Its success can be easily found in many real-world applications such as network intrusion detection, opinion spam detection and system fault diagnosis, to name a few. Despite their empirical success, a vast majority of existing efforts are overwhelmingly performed in an unsupervised scenario due to the expensive labeling costs of ground truth anomalies. In fact, in many scenarios, a small amount of prior human knowledge of the data is often effortless to obtain, and getting it involved in the learning process has shown to be effective in advancing many important learning tasks. Additionally, since new types of anomalies may constantly arise over time especially in an adversarial environment, the interests of human expert could also change accordingly regarding to the detected anomaly types. It brings further challenges to conventional anomaly detection algorithms as they are often applied in a batch setting and are incapable to interact with the environment. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection on attributed networks in an interactive setting by allowing the system to proactively communicate with the human expert in making a limited number of queries about ground truth anomalies. Our objective is to maximize the true anomalies presented to the human expert after a given budget is used up. Along with this line, we formulate the problem through the principled multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel collaborative contextual bandit algorithm, named GraphUCB. In particular, our developed algorithm: (1) explicitly models the nodal attributes and node dependencies seamlessly in a joint framework; and (2) handles the exploration-exploitation dilemma when querying anomalies of different types. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the improvement of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Contextual multi-armed bandit problems have gained increasing popularity and attention in recent years due to their capability of leveraging contextual information to deliver online personalized recommendation services (e.g., online advertising and news article selection). To predict the reward of each arm given a particular context, existing relevant research studies for contextual multi-armed bandit problems often assume the existence of a fixed yet unknown reward mapping function. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, since real-world problems often involve underlying processes that are dynamically evolving over time.In this paper, we study the time varying contextual multi-armed problem where the reward mapping function changes over time. In particular, we propose a dynamical context drift model based on particle learning. In the proposed model, the drift on the reward mapping function is explicitly modeled as a set of random walk particles, where good fitted particles are selected to learn the mapping dynamically. Taking advantage of the fully adaptive inference strategy of particle learning, our model is able to effectively capture the context change and learn the latent parameters. In addition, those learnt parameters can be naturally integrated into existing multi-arm selection strategies such as LinUCB and Thompson sampling. Empirical studies on two real-world applications, including online personalized advertising and news recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results also show that our algorithm can dynamically track the changing reward over time and consequently improve the click-through rate.},
