    \caption{{\textbf{Generations under varying strengths of growth factor $\gamma$ (\cref{ssec:scaling_views})}. On each row we show the generated views across vanilla attention~\cite{vaswani2017attention} (No scaling), prior work~\cite{jin2023training} and our formulation Eq.~\eqref{attn_bias}. Growth factor ($\gamma$) greater than 1.0 helps mitigate the entropy buildup, however increasing $\gamma$ beyond $1.6$ leads to oversaturation artifacts (somewhat akin to high CFG scale). We show only 6 views per row subsampled evenly from 60 views generated at \resthree resolution. The model was trained to jointly denoised only 12 views ($N_i = 5*N_t$).}}
