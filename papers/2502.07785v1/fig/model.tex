    \caption{\textbf{DiT and ControlMLP Block}. Our DiT block (left) loosely follows~\cite{stable_diffusion}, 
    with a AdaIn-based timestep modulation. 
    We apply attention and MLP blocks in parallel~\cite{pmlr-v202-dehghani23a}, 
    and jointly apply self-attention to the noisy generated and identity conditioning tokens. 
    ControlMLP block (right) is used to provide lightweight spatially-aligned conditioning - 
    \plucker and \spatialanchor. }
