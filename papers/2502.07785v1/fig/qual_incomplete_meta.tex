    \captionof{figure}{\textbf{\ourmodel can handle occluded inputs.} We show \ourmodel's generations given incomplete input images -- such as partially or fully occluded faces, unobserved t-shirt designs on test split of \fullbody dataset. We show corresponding ground truth separated with blue dotted line -- it can be seen that \ourmodel faithfully follows the known content while auto-completing unseen segments.}
