    \captionof{figure}{\textbf{Pipeline overview}. This is an illustration of how we train our model. (Left) we use data from a studio capture and train our multi-view diffusion model (right). We condition on a full reference photo and a cropped face, as well as the target view cameras and 2D projected spatial anchor indicating head position and orientation. Our diffusion model also takes in noisy target views and a timestep in order to predict the denoised views (top). In practice, we apply a segmentation mask around the person.}
