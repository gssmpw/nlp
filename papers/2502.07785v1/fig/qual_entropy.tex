    \caption{{\textbf{Generations under varying strengths of growth factor $\gamma$ (\cref{ssec:scaling_views})}. On each row we show the generated views across vanilla attention~\cite{vaswani2017attention} (No scaling), prior work~\cite{jin2023training} and our formulation Eq.~\eqref{attn_bias}. It can be seen that growth factor ($\gamma$) greater than 1.0 is crucial to mitigate the entropy buildup. We show only 10 views per row subsampled evenly from 60 views generated at \resthree resolution. The model was trained to jointly denoised only 12 views ($N_i = 5*N_t$).}}
