% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a templ ate for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% \section*{Ethics Considerations}

% We attest that the algorithms our privacy auditor/estimator identify as having privacy vulnerabilities are already recognized for (or specifically created with) these issues. Thus, this work does not expose new vulnerabilities. Additionally, we do not make use of private datasets in our experiments. Thus, our experiment results do not introduce privacy leaks. We attest that our auditor/estimator do not have any biases stemming from a conflict of interest. While our auditor can be used on other existing mechanisms, our implementation mitigates risks by ensuring our output is limited to alerts to potential privacy violation, and does not leak any additional information about the dataset(s) tested.

% \section*{Open Science}

% To comply with the Open Science Policy, we will make all artifacts publicly available. In our experiments section, we  ensure the transparency and reproducibility of our methodology by describing the dataset used, the specification of our machines, and citing all algorithms tested.
