In our work we construct the first general-purpose $f$-DP estimator and auditor in a black-box setting, by extending techniques from statistics and classification theory. Our constructions enjoy not only formal guarantees---convergence of our estimator and a tuneable confidence region for our auditor---but also an impressive concrete performance. We demonstrate  our methods on well-used mechanisms such as subsampling and DP-SGD, showing their accuracy and efficiency on both a server and personal computer setup.

%on new techniques that extend beyond the current literature on DP estimation/auditing. 

%As a more in-depth discussion, we would like to note the distinction of contribution (1) and (2). Our estimator estimates the optimal trade-off curve based on outputs of a given mechanism $M$. No prior belief about the trade-off curve is required and the user obtains a \textit{close approximation of the entire curve}. In auditing, the starting point is different. Here the mechanism is associated with a privacy claim in the form of a hypothesized tradeoff curve $f_0$. This situation is typical in scenarios, where a privatizing mechanism is provided by a third party (that claims to provide at least $f_0$-DP). The auditor allows a user to check if the mechanism is $f_0$-DP. Thus, instead of considering the entire curve, the auditor \textit{identifies the point of highest vulnerability and checks in this point whether the privacy claim $f_0$ is breached.} The auditor cannot do the job of the estimator because it is pointwise. The estimator cannot be used for auditing, because it does not deliver confidence regions at any point. Both tasks occur in practice which is why we address both of them. We also notice that our solutions are interlocking, since (1) can be used as a subroutine for (2) (for pre-selection of vulnerable points).
