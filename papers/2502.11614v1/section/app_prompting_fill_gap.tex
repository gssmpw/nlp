% \section{Can Prompting Engineering Fill the Gap?}
% for each dataset, we have used the improved prompts to fill this gap, then we ask can the gaps be filled by prompting engneering?
% To answer this question, we plan to sample 200 machine-generated text, 100 from each model: multilingual and the language-specific ones, if only use one model, sample 200 from this model generations.
% observe, whether all observed gaps are filled, label: Yes, No, Partially.
% If partially, what kind gaps tends to be solved by prompting, what gaps are hard to be filled?

    \caption{Human detection accuracy differences on original vs. improved generations, and survey distribution evaluating whether the new generations fill the gap: Yes, Partially or No.}
    \label{tab:fill-gap-survey}
\end{table*}


In this section, for each dataset, we first present how we designed the improved prompts, and then elaborate whether the new generations are improved and fill the previously-observed gaps between humans.
Original and improved prompts for all datasets and languages are summarized in \tabref{tab:ori-improved-prompts}, and the detection accuracy on new content and fill-gap survey results are demonstrated in \tabref{tab:fill-gap-survey}.


\subsection{Arabic}
\paragraph{Tweets}
To enhance the quality of machine-generated Arabic tweets, prompts were refined to better capture human emotions and generate tweets that can reflect authentic human experiences. One such improved prompt was: ``Generate a random tweet in Arabic. Use {dialect} dialect, use human emotions and experiences. Output the tweet only'' and its corresponding Arabic translation:
\begin{quote}
    \small
    \begin{RLtext}
    اكتب تغريدة عشوائية باللغة العربية. استخدم اللهجة \LR{\{dialect\}}وعبّر عن مشاعر وتجارب إنسانية
    \end{RLtext}
\end{quote}

These adjustments addressed critical gaps appeared in prior outputs. The newly-generated tweets touched on relatable human topics and expressed genuine emotions tied to daily experiences. We used \gptfouro for generation as it yielded promising results, while Qwen is underperformed. As mentioned in \appref{sec: arabic_insights}, Qwen texts often include non-Arabic words within the tweets. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the improved prompts, 200 sampled tweets were assessed by annotators, determining whether the outputs addressed the identified gaps. The evaluation revealed that 53\% of the tweets fully met the criteria, 29\% partially did, and 18\% did not. However, some limitations were observed: GPT-4o frequently added irrelevant hashtags at the end of tweets, making the outputs identifiable as machine-generated, and the tweets often carried an \textbf{overly optimistic tone}. Even when negative experiences were mentioned, the sentiment leaned toward positivity and new beginnings. 
Overall, while these improved prompts succeeded in filling some previous gaps, new issues emerged, which could be addressed with more precise instructions, such as explicitly avoiding hashtags or adopting a more somber tone when required.


\paragraph{EASC Summary}
Building on the identified discrepancies between human-written and machine-generated summaries discussed in \appref{sec: arabic_insights}, the generation prompt was refined to address these gaps, resulting in the following prompts:
\begin{quote}
    \small
    \begin{RLtext}
            \texttt{قم بتلخيص المقال التالي محاولا محاكاة انسان له اراء و معتقدات فكرية او دينية ملتزما الدقة و الايجاز فمتوسط مستوى البشر\LR{\{article\}:}}.
    \end{RLtext}
\end{quote} 

The data was re-generated using GPT-4o, following the enhanced prompt. This enhancement led to a decrease in annotation accuracy, which dropped to 63\% from 82\%. 
% This decline can be attributed to the increasing difficulty in distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated text.
However, there is still typical machine writing style in the new content, like the use of common machine-generated phrases (e.g., \begin{quote}
    \small
    \begin{RLtext}
            \texttt{يتناول هذا المقال...}
    \end{RLtext}
\end{quote} ), clearly indicating that the text was produced by a machine.
Additionally, the newly-generated summaries exhibited several characteristics.
% that make MGT more challenging to detect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The summaries seem to reflect a particular ideology, often emphasizing religious themes or beliefs, which influenced the tone and content of the generated text.
    \item The generated sentences are not concise, limiting the clarity and precision of the summaries.
    \item The language used to describe events or natural phenomena tendd to be more emotional, with a tendency to exaggerate or reflect personal preferences.
\end{itemize}

% Additionally, the limitations in human-written summaries, as discussed in \appref{sec: arabic_insights}, continued to impact annotation quality. There were also instances where the writing style of the generated text, or the use of common machine-generated phrases (e.g., \begin{quote}
%     \small
%     \begin{RLtext}
%             \texttt{يتناول هذا المقال...}
%     \end{RLtext}
% \end{quote} ), clearly indicated that the text was produced by a machine.


\paragraph{SANAD}
Before prompt engineering, the accuracy of annotating which of two texts is machine or human written was 100\%. After prompt engineering, the accuracy dropped to 66\% indicating that prompt engineering works at least partially to bridge the gap between the writing styles of humans and machines. 

We follow the same model choices and data subset outlined in \ref{sanad_before_prompt_eng} but we enhance the prompt as shown below:

\begin{quote}
    \small
    \begin{RLtext}
    تصرف كأنك كاتب أخبار محترف، واكتب مقالًا باللغة العربية يتألف من حوالي \LR{\{word\_count\_rounded\}} كلمة، بعنوان \LR{\{title\}}. احرص على أن يكون المقال غنيًا بالمعلومات والتفاصيل الدقيقة، متضمنًا أرقامًا، تواريخ، ومعلومات كمية إذا كانت مناسبة. تأكد من إدراج روابط، أرقام هواتف، أو أسعار صرف العملات عند الضرورة. استخدم بعض المصطلحات الإنجليزية المتخصصة إن كان السياق يتطلب ذلك، وتجنب الاكتفاء بعبارات عامة مثل 'ويأتي هذا التطور في ظل توجه عالمي...' دون دعم بالأحداث أو التفاصيل. راعِ سرد الأحداث بترتيب زمني واضح يعكس التسلسل المنطقي للوقائع. احرص على أن يكون النص مكتوبًا في فقرة واحدة فقط بغض النظر عن طوله، دون تقسيمه إلى فقرات متعددة. اجعل التنسيق غير مثالي (مثل وجود مسافات غير متساوية) لتعكس طبيعة الكتابة البشرية، ولا مانع من استخدام الهاشتاجات عند الحاجة. يرجى مراعاة أن الموضوع يندرج بشكل عام تحت فئة \LR{\{topic\_arabic\}}. يرجى عدم استخدام \LR{Markdown} نهائيًا.
    \end{RLtext}
\end{quote}

Similar to the original prompt, this prompt instructs the LLM to act as a professional news writer and generate an Arabic news article of approximately `\texttt{word\_count\_rounded}' words with the title `\texttt{title}', ensuring that the article's general topic aligns with `\texttt{topic\_arabic}', one of the five predefined categories.

% inspired by earlier observations, 
The enhancements made by this prompt can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Produces content rich in information and accurate details.
    \item Includes specific numbers, dates, and quantitative data where applicable.
    \item Encourages the incorporation of specialized English terms when the context requires it.
    \item Advises against vague phrases that are unsupported by concrete events or details.
    \item Requests a clear chronological narration of events.
    \item Requires the article to be written as a single paragraph, regardless of its length.
    \item Allows imperfections in formatting (e.g., uneven spacing) to mimic human-like writing.
    \item Permits the use of hashtags when appropriate.
    \item Prohibits the use of \texttt{Markdown}.
\end{itemize}

The following observations were made from the results of the enhanced prompt:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fake phone numbers} (e.g., 123456789) indicate machine-generated content.
    \item \textbf{Correct phone numbers or URLs} suggest human-generated content.
    \item The use of Arabic \textbf{tatweel} typically indicates human-generated content.
    \item \textbf{Unique names in Arabic} are more likely to be found in human-generated content.
    \item \textbf{Poorly written or formatted texts} are often indicative of human authorship.
    \item \textbf{Generic statements} (e.g., "Vision 2030") are characteristic of machine-generated content.
    \item \textbf{Markdown formatting} present in the text, despite instructions not to use it, suggests machine-generated content.
    \item \textbf{Obvious incorrect information} that seems unlikely for a machine to produce (e.g., "equating MERS COVID") suggests human authorship.
    \item \textbf{Hashtags correctly embedded within the text} point to human-generated content, while those placed at the end of the article suggest machine-generated content.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Chinese}

\paragraph{Zhihu QA}
We perform both fill-the-gap survey by analyzing whether the gap is filled: Yes or No or Partially, and the manual detection over the improved Zhihu QA responses under the same setting as \tabref{tab:detection-acc}.
% of which one is human-written text given a pair of text under the four-class setting, text1, text2, both and none.
For the gap survey across three datasets, issues of 16\% cases are addressed, 35\% are partially addressed, and half is totally not mitigated, as shown in \tabref{tab:fill-gap-survey}.
Detection accuracy for three annotators declines from 99.7\% to 94.3\% on average, respectively from 100\% to 93\%, 99\% to 81\% and 100\% to 99\%.
Annotators carefully read the contents, and then learned the new detection patterns after reading about 25 pairs, and then annotators detect more quickly depending on the following patterns. Overall, after using the improved prompts, model responses become closer to human answers, more challenging than before to discern.


\paragraph{Student Essay}
Three annotators detect using fill the gap survey. Two annotators have similar observations that gaps in 60\% cases are either fully bridged or partially, 40\% remained. Another annotator is more strict, and think problems are not solved on 65\% cases.  

\paragraph{Government Report} 
The new prompts help mitigate the rigid format of model outputs to some extent and enhance output diversity. We observed that in many original examples, the inputs consist of multiple short paragraphs with highly similar lengths. However, under the new prompts, the model-generated paragraphs exhibited varying lengths, aligning more closely with typical human writing styles. Despite these improvements, certain repetitive phrasing issues persist and remain unresolved. In our analysis, prompt adjustments proved partially effective. Among 200 test cases, 59 showed a noticeable improvement in output quality, 38 exhibited partial improvement, while no significant changes were observed in 103 cases.



\subsection{English Peer Meta Review}
The new English generations retain many features exhibited by previous generations. Even after modifying the prompts, the LLM remains highly formulaic in its outputs. This may be due to the inherently formulaic nature of the peer review domain.

The first half of the second round of generations typically begin with the phrase ``Based on the reviews ...'' and frequently include bullet points or lists. Although the lists were often formatted with numbers or dashes, instead of traditional bullet points, they tended to contain numerous items, leading to responses that felt rigid and uniform. Repetitive use of the phrase ``Given this I recommend to'' further emphasized the predictable nature of these outputs, making them easily identifiable as machine-generated.

In contrast, the second half of the second round of generations moved away from lists, favoring more narrative, paragraph-based structures. The texts were divided into roughly equal paragraphs, which followed a consistent order: a summary of the paper's content, praise for the paper’s novelty, discussion of reviewer concerns, and a concluding acceptance statement. Variations of phrases such as ``The paper introduces ...'' or ``The manuscript under review ...'' were used to begin the majority of the generations.

Despite these adjustments, the gap between machine-generated and human-written text remains significant. While these improved prompts present a more fluid structure, the length of the texts remains relatively uniform, and the overall structure still lacks the variance and natural inconsistency typically seen in human peer reviews. Human-written reviews tend to exhibit more variability in both text length and structure, resulting in a more organic feel.

% Future prompts could focus on introducing greater variability in both text length and structure. By encouraging more flexibility and less predictability, it may be possible to reduce the formulaic nature of the machine-generated outputs. Using prompts that encourage shorter responses or disrupt rigid structures may help make the reviews feel more like those written by humans.



\subsection{Hindi News}
In order to address the disparities observed in machine-generated news, an improved prompt was introduced to improve the quality of machine-generated news. The new prompt explicitly provided the original news content as reference, ensuring the inclusion of more factual details, figures, and names. The prompt instructed the model: 
\begin{quote}
\textit{"Here is a news headline: '\{headline\}' and the content: '\{content\}'. Write a machine-generated version of the news based on this headline. Return the news in Hindi and just return the news content in plain formatted text. Don't return anything extra, just return the plain text in Hindi."}
\end{quote}
This approach aimed to reduce previously noted gaps, such as limited content and lack of proper nouns, dates, and contextual richness, while keeping the focus on generating plain, Hindi-formatted news content. Providing original content would also provide an idea of the style of news writing.

Although the improved prompt succeeded in reducing some of the earlier disparities, some of the disparities still existed in the machine-generated text. These included a noticeable underuse of quoted statements and fewer references to names and illustrative examples, both of which are common in human-written news articles. Furthermore, the inclusion of original content for reference led to a significant decrease in classification accuracy, which decreased to 66\% from 85.2\%. The analysis of machine-generated text using improved prompt shows how challenging it can be to improve the style of machine-generated text while keeping it different from human-written text. The results highlight how important it is to carefully design prompts to help models create more natural and human-like text in Hindi.


\subsection{Italian DICE News}
To mitigate easily identifiable cues, we instruct the model to refrain from using any formatting, incorporate details and specific names regarding the event's location, and freely include witness testimonies. Therefore, we incorporate the following additional instructions into the initial generic prompt: 
\begin{quote}
When writing avoid any kind of formatting, do not repeat the title and keep the text informative and not vague, add quotes from witnesses or the police. You don't have to add the date of the event but you can, use at most 300 words. Do not use mark-down formatting.
\end{quote}
or in Italian when testing Anita which is tuned for this language:
\begin{quote}
Quando scrivi evita qualsiasi tipo di formattazione, non ripetere il titolo e mantieni il testo informativo e non vago, aggiungi citazioni da testimoni o dalla polizia. Non devi aggiungere la data dell'evento ma puoi farlo, usa al massimo 300 parole. Non usare formattazione mark-down.
\end{quote}

Refining the prompt makes machine generated text harder to recognize. When annotating the same 300 samples generated with the new prompt, accuracy decreases. Specifically, Anita goes from 88\% to 81\%, Llama-405b from 99\% to 84\% and GPT-4o from 100\% to 85\%. This means that some gaps are bridged by the new prompts, making the machine-generated texts harder to identify. 
With the new prompt, we remove formatting related patterns and we identify others related to writing style:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The generated text occasionally contains words that depart from journalistic writing style (noticeable from the beginning of the annotation).
    \item Most texts start with one of few prototypical sentences, e.g., \textit{The police ...} and \textit{On that night ...} (noticeable after annotating 10 to 20 samples).
    \item New generations still rarely use quotes, numbers and other specific details (noticeable after annotating 10 to 20 samples).
    \item The model rarely writes in passive tense, which is more usual in Italian than in English (noticeable after annotating more than 100 samples).
    \item Each model uses consistent writing style that is easily identifiable (noticeable after annotating more than 200 samples).
\end{itemize}

Overall, new generations are partially improved, but there are still some patterns that enable recognition of machine-generated text. The challenges reflect that annotators now need to see more examples than before to summarize these patterns and then leverage them to identify MGT, making zero-shot recognition of MGT harder than before. 


\subsection{Japanese News}
Based on the human detection evaluation, we found several distinctive stylistic characteristics in LLM-generated Japanese news with the original prompt, as detailed in \ref{japanese_news_distinctive_clues}.
To prevent LLMs from generating such easily detectable clues, we provide the following improved prompt:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{"次のニュースタイトルに合わせたニュース記事を生成してください。このとき、生成する記事のスタイルには敬体ではなく常体を使用し、またタイトルの言い換えによって記事の冒頭を作成することは避けてください。$\backslash$n ニュースタイトル: \{title\}$\backslash$n ニュース記事: "}
\end{quote}
which indicates
\begin{quote}
    \textit{Please generate a news article that matches the following news title. When creating the article, please use plain form instead of polite form and also avoid generating the beginning of the article by paraphrasing the title.$\backslash$n news title: \{title\}$\backslash$n news article:} 
\end{quote}

By default, while LLMs tend to generate Japanese news articles in a polite form (desu-masu style), human-written news articles are basically in a more plain form (da/dearu style). Therefore, we added instructions to generate articles in a plain form, which is closer to the human writing style in the news domain. Additionally, since LLMs are likely to generate a title at the beginning of the news article, we also included instructions to suppress the task-specific behavior.


\subsection{Kazakh Wikipedia}
Out of 200 annotated examples, our analysis shows that in most cases, the prompt adjustments were effective. We observed 105 instances of ``Yes'', indicating clear improvement, 89 cases of ``Partially'', where some limitations remained, and 6 instances of ``No'', where no noticeable change was observed.

The revised prompt helps reduce repetitive sentence patterns to some extent. The model now produces a more diverse range of sentence structures, partially addressing the issue. However, some predictable phrasing persists, meaning that while variety has improved, formulaic expressions have not been entirely eliminated. The adjustments also successfully increase the inclusion of concrete information, such as dates, names, and specific data points. As a result, the generated text now contains more factual details, addressing this issue almost entirely. Additionally, the prompt helps mitigate excessive flattering language, making the text feel more balanced. However, some instances of exaggeration still occur, indicating that this issue has only been partially resolved.

The inclusion of Kazakh-specific culturally-nuanced details is the most challenging issue to address. The model defaults to Kazakh-specific references only when the topic is explicitly related to Kazakhstan. When it does not recognize the subject, it often makes factual mistakes. For example, when generating text about \textit{Stephen King's It}, the model failed to recognize the name in Kazakh and mis-attributed the novel to a prominent Kazakh author, inventing plot details. This limitation reflects a lack of exposure to Kazakh-specific content, making it difficult to fully resolve through prompt engineering alone.


% The new prompt helps reduce repetitive sentence patterns to some extent. The model now uses a more diverse range of sentence structures, which partially addresses the problem. However, occasional predictable phrasing remains, indicating that while the prompt improves variety, it does not eliminate formulaic expression entirely. The adjustments also successfully increases the inclusion of concrete information, such as dates, names, and specific data points. The generated text now includes more factual details, addressing this issue almost entirely. The prompt partially reduces the use of excessive flattering language, but some subtle instances still remain. The text feels less exaggerated, addressing the issue partially but not entirely.

% When it comes to the inclusion of Kazakh-specific detail, it proved to be the most challenging issue to address. When specifically prompted, the model tends to overdo Kazakh references, often including excessive or fabricated details. Without explicit prompting, it defaults to Kazakh-specific references only when topic is directly about Kazakhstan, or it doesn’t recognize the topic, leading to inaccuracies. For instance, when generating text about Stephen King's It, the model didn't recognize the name in Kazakh and attributed the novel to a prominent Kazakh author, inventing plot details. This limitation reflects a lack of exposure to Kazakh-specific content, making it difficult to fully resolve through prompt adjustments alone.


\subsection{Russian}

\paragraph{Prompt Modifications}
The prompts were adjusted to encourage greater detail and specificity in the generated content:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Academic summaries:} The simple prompt asked the model to generate a summary without a title based on a given topic and title. The improved prompt added instructions to include details about results, experiments, numbers, and references to other works.
\item \textbf{News articles:} The simple prompt instructed the model to generate a news article based on the given title and topic from the Lenta.ru website without a heading. The improved prompt emphasized including as many details as possible, such as names, numbers, and dates, and encouraged citing original sources like RIA Novosti, CNN, or BBC.
\end{itemize}
After implementing the improved prompts, we observed a decrease in the accuracy of machine-generated text detection. Specifically, for news articles, accuracy dropped from 100\% to 86.5\%, while for summaries, it decreased from 80\% to 69\%. This suggests that the refined prompt instructions successfully made machine-generated text harder to distinguish from human-written text.

\paragraph{Observations and Patterns}
The enhanced prompts led to increased textual complexity and information density, making it more difficult to detect machine-generated text. However, new artefacts appear, which became noticeable after reviewing 50-70 samples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Repetitive references:} The generated summaries often cited the same set of names (e.g., \textit{Smith} and \textit{Jones}), while news articles frequently referred to a limited set of news outlets (e.g., \textit{RIA Novosti}).
\item \textbf{Text length:} Human-written news articles were generally shorter than machine-generated ones, which tended to be overly detailed.
\item \textbf{Standardized introduction phrases:} Summaries frequently begin with a predictable opening sentence, such as \textit{``The article discusses ...''}.
\item \textbf{Identifiable uniqueness:} If a summary contained references to names outside the repetitive set or a news article cited a unique news outlet, it was more likely to be human-written. Otherwise, detection became significantly harder.
\end{itemize}

While the refined prompts made detection more difficult, annotator who analyzed a sufficient number of samples could still identify machine-generated text based on these emerging patterns.



\subsection{Vietnamese}
\selectlanguage{Vietnamese}
To address the disparities in these two domains, we introduced a new prompt for each domain to enhance machine-generated text.

For Vietnamese news, we use the prompt:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{Bạn là một nhà báo Việt Nam chuyên viết những phần đầu đề cho các bài báo bằng cách sử dụng tiêu đề của chúng. Lưu ý rằng, hãy đưa ra các thông tin cụ thể và chính xác như mốc thời gian, địa điểm, các tình tiết, chi tiết, đồng thời viết văn phong dưới dạng tóm lược cho phần mở đầu của bài báo. Hãy viết cho tôi một đoạn đầu đề cho bài báo có tiêu đề dưới đây:}
\end{quote}
which means
\begin{quote}
    \textit{"You are a Vietnamese journalist who writes headlines for articles using their titles. Please be specific and precise in giving information such as time, place, circumstance, and details, and write a summary for the introduction of the article. Please write me a headline for the article with the following title:"} 
\end{quote}
This prompt is used to improve writing quality by providing more detailed information, such as dates and times, rather than merely offering general information in the news title. While this information may sometimes be incorrect, its specificity can persuade readers by appearing more credible (e.g., \textit{"In May 2020, Mr. A, the president of company X, stated that..."}).

For Wikipedia articles, we refined the prompt to ensure that machine-generated text includes only information that is appropriate for Wikipedia. Additionally, we instructed the AI to write only the introductory information, without delving into further details.
Our new prompt for Vietnamese Wikipedia is:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{"Bạn là một nhà đóng góp cho Wikipedia tiếng Việt. Hãy viết cho tôi một đoạn giới thiệu ngắn gọn bằng tiếng Việt về chủ thể bên dưới để đăng trên trang Wikipedia. Hãy cố gắng hiểu về chủ đề, và viết ra một đoạn giới thiệu chứa các thông tin mà người dùng thường tìm kiếm trên Wikipedia. Hãy cố gắng viết ra các đoạn văn bản giống người viết nhất có thể. Chỉ đưa ra đoạn giới thiệu, không đưa ra thêm các thông tin khác. Lưu ý rằng bạn phải giữ độ dài văn bản trong khoảng \texttt{word\_count} từ, không được viết dài hơn."}
\end{quote}
which means:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{"You are a contributor to Vietnamese Wikipedia. Please write me a short introduction in Vietnamese about the subject below to post on the Wikipedia page. Try to understand the topic, and write an introduction that contains information that users often search for on Wikipedia. Try to write the text as humanly as possible. Provide only the introduction, do not provide any other information. Note that you must keep the text length within \texttt{word\_count} words, do not write longer."}
\end{quote}

Generally, these improved prompts aim to imbue AI-generated text with characteristics similar to human-written passages, enabling the AI to produce more human-like text. Indeed, humans find it more difficult to distinguish between the two passages, as they are more confused while reading them and struggle to determine which one is machine-generated. The contextual gap between human and AI seems to have narrowed significantly.

However, as noted previously, for news articles, the machine may hallucinate and generate incorrect timestamps for events. Additionally, the writing style of the machine is somewhat unique and consistent across all records, whereas human-written text tends to exhibit greater variation in structure and length. This distinction remains a key factor for humans when identifying whether a passage is machine-generated or written by a human.
