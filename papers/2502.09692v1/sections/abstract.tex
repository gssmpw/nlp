Recent advancements in neural operator learning are paving the way for transformative innovations in fields such as automotive aerodynamics. 
However, key challenges must be overcome before neural network-based simulation surrogates can be implemented at an industry scale. 
First, surrogates must become scalable to large surface and volume meshes, especially when using raw geometry inputs only, i.e., without relying on the simulation mesh. 
Second, surrogates must be trainable with a limited number of high-fidelity numerical simulation samples while still reaching the required performance levels.
To this end, we introduce \acf{GP-UPT}, which separates geometry encoding and physics predictions, ensuring flexibility with respect to geometry representations and surface sampling strategies. 
\Ac{GP-UPT} enables independent scaling of the respective parts of the model according to practical requirements, offering scalable solutions to open challenges. 
\ac{GP-UPT} circumvents the creation of high-quality simulation meshes, enables accurate 3D velocity field predictions at 20 million mesh cells, and excels in transfer learning from low-fidelity to high-fidelity simulation datasets, requiring less than half of the high-fidelity data to match the performance of models trained from scratch.
