%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

Encouraging users to relate to automated systems as if they were human can lead to transparency and trust issues, and high risk scenarios caused by over-reliance on their outputs. As a result, natural language processing researchers have investigated the factors that induce personification and develop resources to mitigate such effects. However, these efforts are fragmented, and many aspects of anthropomorphism have yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss the linguistic factors that contribute to the anthropomorphism of dialogue systems and the harms that can arise thereof, including reinforcing gender stereotypes and conceptions of acceptable language. We recommend that future efforts towards developing dialogue systems take particular care in their design, development, release, and description; and attend to the many linguistic cues that can elicit personification by users.",

But it is not yet well understood what types of language most lead to such language-based anthropomorphization (or, Linguistic Anthropomorphism). In this paper, we present a brief literature survey that suggests six broad categories of linguistic factors that lead humans to anthropomorphize robots: autonomy, adaptability, directness, politeness, proportionality, and humor. By contextualizing these six factors through the lens of Jackson and Williams' Theory of Social Agency for Human-Robot Interaction, we are able to show how and why these particular factors are those responsible for language-based robot anthropomorphism.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how people’s level of trust (as reported through self-assessment) in so-called “AI” (artificial intelligence) is influenced by anthropomorphizing language in system descriptions. Building on prior work, we define four categories of anthropomorphization (1. Properties of a cognizer, 2. Agency, 3. Biological metaphors, and 4. Properties of a communicator). We use a survey-based approach (n=954) to investigate whether participants are likely to trust one of two (fictitious) “AI” systems by randomly assigning people to see either an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the systems. We find that participants are no more likely to trust anthropomorphized over de-anthropmorphized product descriptions overall. The type of product or system in combination with different anthropomorphic categories appears to exert greater influence on trust than anthropomorphizing language alone, and age is the only demographic factor that significantly correlates with people’s preference for anthropomorphized or de-anthropomorphized descriptions. When elaborating on their choices, participants highlight factors such as lesser of two evils, lower or higher stakes contexts, and human favoritism as driving motivations when choosing between product A and B, irrespective of whether they saw an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the product. Our results suggest that “anthropomorphism” in “AI” descriptions is an aggregate concept that may influence different groups differently, and provide nuance to the discussion of whether anthropomorphization leads to higher trust and over-reliance by the general public in systems sold as “AI”.},

title = "Privacy as contextual integrity",
abstract = "The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, contextual integrity, as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of spheres of justice, developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.",

However, little is known about the relationship between how users anthropomorphize an LLM system (i.e., ascribe human-like characteristics to a system) and how they trust the information the system provides. Participants (n=2,165; ranging in age from 18-90 from the United States) completed an online experiment, where they interacted with a pseudo-LLM that varied in modality (text only, speech + text) and grammatical person (“I” vs. “the system”) in its responses. Results showed that the “speech + text” condition led to higher anthropomorphism of the system overall, as well as higher ratings of accuracy of the information the system provides. Additionally, the first-person pronoun (“I”) led to higher information accuracy and reduced risk ratings, but only in one context. We discuss these findings for their implications for the design of responsible, human–generative AI experiences.},

We reflect on a decade's experience using affinity diagramming across a number of projects, both in industry and academia. Our affinity diagramming process in interaction design has been tailored and consists of four stages: creating notes, clustering notes, walking the wall, and documentation. We draw examples from eight projects to illustrate our particular practices along these four stages, as well as to ground the discussion.",

ABSTRACT={<p>Motivated by inconsistent, underspecified, or otherwise problematic theories and usages of <italic>social agency</italic> in the HRI literature, and leveraging philosophical work on <italic>moral</italic> agency, we present a theory of social agency wherein a social agent (a thing with social agency) is any <italic>agent</italic> capable of <italic>social action</italic> at some <italic>level of abstraction</italic>. Like previous theorists, we conceptualize <italic>agency</italic> as determined by the criteria of interactivity, autonomy, and adaptability. We use the concept of <italic>face</italic> from politeness theory to define <italic>social action</italic> as any action that threatens or affirms the face of a <italic>social patient</italic>. With these definitions in mind, we specify and examine the levels of abstraction most relevant to HRI research, compare notions of social agency and the surrounding concepts at each, and suggest new conventions for discussing social agency in our field.</p>}

I argue that we need to decide whether tomorrow's social robots should be designed as embodied or disembodied.

A core component of the theory is a conception of the nature of specifically community structure and the manner whereby human beings and other phenomena are organised through it. The primary objective of this paper is simply to systematise the (continuously evolving) theory, and in particular this core component, as it currently stands. The theory has implications for both substantive social analysis and projects of social transformation. In the current paper, it is (mostly) the theory’s usefulness to the former that is highlighted, through the inclusion of an illustration of how the theory contributes to resolving long standing puzzles at the substantive level, and specifically those connected to the theorising of the nature of money.}",

title = {Why Only Us: Language and Evolution},
year = {2015},
isbn = {0262034247},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
abstract = {We are born crying, but those cries signal the first stirring of language. Within a year or so, infants master the sound system of their language; a few years after that, they are engaging in conversations. This remarkable, species-specific ability to acquire any human language -- "the language faculty" -- raises important biological questions about language, including how it has evolved. This book by two distinguished scholars -- a computer scientist and a linguist -- addresses the enduring question of the evolution of language. Robert Berwick and Noam Chomsky explain that until recently the evolutionary question could not be properly posed, because we did not have a clear idea of how to define "language" and therefore what it was that had evolved. But since the Minimalist Program, developed by Chomsky and others, we know the key ingredients of language and can put together an account of the evolution of human language and what distinguishes us from all other animals. Berwick and Chomsky discuss the biolinguistic perspective on language, which views language as a particular object of the biological world; the computational efficiency of language as a system of thought and understanding; the tension between Darwin's idea of gradual change and our contemporary understanding about evolutionary change and language; and evidence from nonhuman animals, in particular vocal learning in songbirds.}

We explore an unexamined aspect of this problem: how people empathize with robots along the anthropomorphic spectrum. We conducted an experiment that measured how people empathized with robots shown to be experiencing mistreatment by humans. Our results indicate that people empathize more strongly with more human-looking robots and less with mechanical-looking robots.},

XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast human{--}machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of large-scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.",

Abstract = {The concept of the case is a basic feature of social science research and yet many questions about how a case should be defined, selected, and judged are far from settled. The contributors to this volume probe the nature of the case and the ways in which different understandings of the concept affect the conduct and the results of research. The contributions demonstrate that the work of any given researcher is often characterised by some hybrid of these basic approaches, and it is important to understand that most research involves multiple definitions and uses of cases, as both specific empirical phenomena and as general theoretical categories.},

Mapping and Mitigating the Risk from Anthropomorphic AI}, volume={7}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31613}, abstractNote={The development of highly-capable conversational agents, underwritten by large language models, has the potential to shape user interaction with this technology in profound ways, particularly when the technology is anthropomorphic, or appears human-like. Although the effects of anthropomorphic AI are often benign, anthropomorphic design features also create new kinds of risk. For example, users may form emotional connections to human-like AI, creating the risk of infringing on user privacy and autonomy through over-reliance. To better understand the possible pitfalls of anthropomorphic AI systems, we make two contributions: first, we explore anthropomorphic features that have been embedded in interactive systems in the past, and leverage this precedent to highlight the current implications of anthropomorphic design. Second, we propose research directions for informing the ethical design of anthropomorphic AI. In advancing the responsible development of AI, we promote approaches to the ethical foresight, evaluation, and mitigation of harms arising from user interactions with anthropomorphic AI.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society}, author={Akbulut, Canfer and Weidinger, Laura and Manzini, Arianna and Gabriel, Iason and Rieser, Verena}, year={2024}, month={Oct.}, pages={13-26} }

Previous work has used quantitative methods to uncover performance disparities between AAL speakers and White Mainstream English speakers when using language technologies, but has not sought to understand the impacts of these performance disparities on AAL speakers. Through interviews with 19 AAL speakers, we focus on understanding such impacts in a contextualized and human-centered manner. We find that AAL speakers often undertake invisible labor of adapting their speech patterns to successfully use language technologies, and they make connections between failures of language technologies for AAL speakers and a lack of inclusion of AAL speakers in language technology design processes and datasets. Our findings suggest that NLP researchers and practitioners should invest in developing contextualized and human-centered evaluations of language technologies that seek to understand the impacts of performance disparities on speakers of underrepresented languages and language varieties.",

abstract = {In the media, in policy-making, but also in research articles, algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems are referred to as algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computer programs, amongst other terms. We hypothesize that such terminological differences can affect people’s perceptions of properties of ADM systems, people’s evaluations of systems in application contexts, and the replicability of research as findings may be influenced by terminological differences. In two studies (N = 397, N = 622), we show that terminology does indeed affect laypeople’s perceptions of system properties (e.g., perceived complexity) and evaluations of systems (e.g., trust). Our findings highlight the need to be mindful when choosing terms to describe ADM systems, because terminology can have unintended consequences, and may impact the robustness and replicability of HCI research. Additionally, our findings indicate that terminology can be used strategically (e.g., in communication about ADM systems) to influence people’s perceptions and evaluations of these systems.},

abstract = {Universal usability is an important component of HCI, particularly as companies promote their products in increasingly global markets to users with diverse cultural backgrounds. Successful anthropomorphic agents must have appropriate computer etiquette and nonverbal communication patterns. Because there are differences in etiquette, tone, formality, and colloquialisms across different user populations, it is unlikely that a generic anthropomorphic agent would be universally appealing. Additionally, because anthropomorphic characters are depicted as capable of human reasoning and possessing human motivations, users may ascribe undue trust in these agents. Trust is a complex construct that exerts an important role in a user’s interactions with an interface or system. Feelings and perceptions about an anthropomorphic agent may impact the construction of a mental model about a system, which may lead to inappropriate calibrations of automation trust that is based on an emotional connection with the anthropomorphic agent rather than on actual system performance.}

abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook have all embedded proprietary CAs within their software and, increasingly, conversation is becoming a key mode of human-computer interaction. Whilst we have long been familiar with the notion of computers that speak, the investigative concern within HCI has been upon multimodality rather than dialogue alone, and there is no sense of how such interfaces are used in everyday life. This paper reports the findings of interviews with 14 users of CAs in an effort to understand the current interactional factors affecting everyday use. We find user expectations dramatically out of step with the operation of the systems, particularly in terms of known machine intelligence, system capability and goals. Using Norman's 'gulfs of execution and evaluation' [30] we consider the implications of these findings for the design of future systems.},

As robots enter our social space, we will inherently project/impose our interpretation on their actions similar to the techniques we employ in rationalising, for example, a pet’s behaviour. This propensity to anthropomorphise is not seen as a hindrance to social robot development, but rather a useful mechanism that requires judicious examination and employment in social robot research.}
