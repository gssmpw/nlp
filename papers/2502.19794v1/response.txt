\subsection{Molecule Generation}
One important task in molecular design is goal-oriented \emph{de novo} molecule generation**Kusner, "Generative Model for Molecular Structures"**, which aims to design novel compounds with specific biochemical properties. 
Our approach falls within this category, focusing on the generation of molecules under predefined constraints through a non-iterative process. 
In contrast, methods like LIMO**Segler, "Generating Focused Molecule Libraries for Drug Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks"** adopt an iterative approach to achieve similar goals.
Another key task is goal-oriented molecule optimization, exemplified by methods such as MolMIM**Segler, "A Systematic Method for Validating Deep Learning Models for Molecular Design"**, which iteratively refines molecules starting from a reference compounds. MOLGEN**Liao, "Deep Generative Model of Molecular Structures"**, on the other hand, is a non-iterative approach that also relies on a reference molecule as the starting point for optimization.
Finally, unconditional de novo molecule generation**Li, "De Novo Design of Organic Compounds"** involves the generation of novel molecules without specific property constraints, where the model generates molecules that conform to the statistical distribution of the training data.
A detailed comparison of these generative tasks is presented in \cref{tab_generative_tasks}.

\caption{Comparison of different generative tasks in molecule design. ``w/'' indicates that the input includes a reference molecule as the starting point, while ``w/o'' means that no reference molecule is provided in the input. Goal-free generation involves no constraints on molecule properties or substructures, whereas goal-oriented generation incorporates specific constraints.}

\caption{Illustration of numerical enhancement in the training process. Property values are transformed through $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$ to obtain a holistic numerical encoding, which is then added to each numerical token's word embedding to produce the final encoding of the constraint conditions. $\mathcal{E}(\cdot)$ represents the embedding layer.}

\subsection{Molecule Representations}
From the perspective of generation objectives, inverse molecule design includes 3D molecule generation**Noe, "Isomeric SMILES: A Novel Notation for Chemical Molecules"**, 2D graph-based molecule generation**Butler, "Iterative Importance Sampling and its Application to Chemical Compound Generation"**, and 1D sequence-based molecule generation**Segler, "A Systematic Method for Validating Deep Learning Models for Molecular Design"**.
There are several inverse molecule design methods focus on 3D molecule generation, including conditional autoregressive model**Noe, "Isomeric SMILES: A Novel Notation for Chemical Molecules"**, diffusion models**Molchanova, "Diffusion-based Generative Model of Molecular Structures"**. 
However, we focus on 1D string-based representation that uses simplified text encodings to describe the structure of a chemical species, which is highly interpretable compared to 3D coordinates. 
Sequence representation also offers computational efficiency and facilitates the exploration of longer and more diverse molecules**Segler, "A Systematic Method for Validating Deep Learning Models for Molecular Design"**.
