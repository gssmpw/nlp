\begin{abstract}
In our increasingly interconnected world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a crucial role in industries like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing by combining physical processes with computing power. These systems, however, face many challenges, especially regarding security and system faults. Anomalies in CPS may indicate unexpected problems, from sensor malfunctions to cyber-attacks, and must be detected to prevent failures that can cause harm or disrupt services. This paper provides an overview of the different ways researchers have approached anomaly detection in CPS. We categorize and compare methods like machine learning, deep learning, mathematical models, invariant, and hybrid techniques. Our goal is to help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of these methods and how they can be used to create safer, more reliable CPS. By identifying the gaps in current solutions, we aim to encourage future research that will make CPS more secure and adaptive in our increasingly automated world.

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

The field of anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) continues to grow, but there are still many challenges and opportunities for improvement. Machine learning and deep learning methods have significantly improved anomaly detection, but they remain vulnerable to attacks designed to trick them. Future research should focus on creating more robust systems. Techniques like training models with simulated attacks and sharing models securely without sharing data could make these systems more reliable \cite{67}. CPS environments, especially in industries like manufacturing and energy, require detection systems that can process large amounts of data quickly and work in real-time. Future work should aim to develop methods that achieve this, using technologies such as edge computing to reduce delays. Additionally, optimizing these systems for devices with limited resources, such as industrial IoT sensors, is critical to ensure practical applications.

Anomalies in CPS are rare, making it difficult to gather enough labeled data to train models effectively. Researchers should explore methods that can handle limited or imbalanced data, such as learning from small datasets, generating synthetic data, or using unsupervised approaches. These techniques could make anomaly detection more accessible and applicable to real-world systems \cite{58}. Another important area is making anomaly detection results easier to understand. Clear explanations for why an anomaly is detected will help users trust and act on the system's findings. Future research should focus on creating interpretable models that provide actionable insights, which are essential in critical infrastructure applications.

Domain-specific knowledge can greatly enhance anomaly detection systems. Combining data-driven models with physical simulations or rules, like those used in digital twins, could improve their accuracy and relevance.Expanding anomaly detection methods to other fields, such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and energy systems, offers exciting opportunities. Developing flexible and adaptable models will ensure that these methods can perform effectively in diverse applications. Future research should also aim to establish standard datasets, testing methods, and performance measures to allow consistent evaluation and comparison of these techniques.

As CPS systems increasingly handle sensitive data, ensuring privacy and addressing ethical concerns is crucial. Researchers should prioritize creating methods that protect data while detecting anomalies, using tools like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. Addressing these issues will make these systems safer and more trustworthy. By focusing on these areas, future research can make anomaly detection systems more robust, scalable, and practical, ultimately helping to build safer and more reliable CPS environments.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a crucial research area with widespread applications in critical sectors like energy, transportation, and healthcare. This review has summarized key findings from existing literature, covering a range of approaches including machine learning, deep learning, hybrid models, and domain-specific techniques. Each method offers unique strengths but also has limitations, such as difficulty in handling rare events, challenges in achieving real-time processing, and vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

Table \ref{tab:anomaly_comparison} provides a comparison of different approaches for problem-solving in anomaly detection, highlighting their capabilities, strengths, limitations, and examples. These approaches range from mathematical models and machine learning to hybrid and invariant-based methods, showcasing the diverse strategies available to tackle the challenges in CPS. While hybrid approaches demonstrate flexibility and the ability to detect a wide variety of problems, other methods such as invariant-based techniques excel in rule-based validations, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right approach based on the application context.

A significant gap identified in the literature is the lack of methods that are both scalable and interpretable while ensuring privacy and security in diverse CPS environments. Additionally, the reviewed studies emphasize the importance of integrating domain knowledge to improve detection accuracy and relevance. The implications of these findings suggest that future research should prioritize the development of robust and adaptive anomaly detection systems. These systems must address the current challenges by incorporating explainable AI, leveraging domain-specific insights, and adhering to ethical and privacy standards. Such advancements are necessary to enhance the reliability and safety of CPS, especially as they become increasingly complex and interconnected.

By building on the strengths and addressing the gaps highlighted in this review, researchers and practitioners can contribute to a more secure and resilient CPS ecosystem, ensuring its continued efficiency and trustworthiness in critical applications.
