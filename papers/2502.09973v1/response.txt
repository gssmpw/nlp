% Prior immersive authoring tools tailored for non-expert users, we also provided some pre-designed choices of joints to help users easily create mechanical structures without any domain knowledge. 

% For example, ProGesAR [1] allows users to quickly prototype proxemic and gestural interactions with actual IoT in augmented reality. 
% By tying static graphics to moving ones, RealitySketch [2] allows users to make their static graphics responsive. 
% Based on the intuitive manipulations enabled by immersive technologies, these tools can be quickly learned and used by end-users without any professional modeling, programming, or sketching skills. 
% Following this paradigm, Window Shaping [3] and SceneCtrl [4] empowered the creation of static 3D models and virtual scenes by leveraging the spatial perception of AR devices. 
% ARAnimator [5] and PuppetPhone [6] allow users to author an animation sequence of a virtual character using a smartphone as the motion controller.
% Informed by this line of work, we aimed to develop an end-user authoring tool in AR to reconstruct motions, 3D models, and virtual scenes as the real-world features for physical mementos.

% As defining or reconstructing physical or virtual interactions are logically complex [7], end-users might encounter difficulties in directly modifying interactions within the user interface. 
% Moreover, reconstructing or simulating physical objects with an emphasis on their real-world attributes in AR/VR remains relatively unexplored.
% Thus, in the designing of an authoring tool, we sought to design features to enable end-users to reconstruct physical mementos in AR with functions of mapping physical joints, mapping tangible widgets, enabling bare-hand interactions.
