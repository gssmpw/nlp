In the first and second sessions, we invited 16 participants from a local university campus (8 male, 8 female; age: avg = 24.13, std = 2.28). 
\revision{In the appending study, we recruited 10 participants through questionnaires from the campus, aiming for a diverse mix of professional backgrounds (4 male, 6 female; age: avg = 24.6, std = 2.5). The participants included 2 VR developers, 2 architects, 1 fashion designer, 1 product manager, 1 industrial designer, 1 hardware engineer, 1 curator, and 1 professor. Notably, three of these participants were re-invited from the previous two sessions.}
% All participants highly recognized the value of memorable personal items, showing their willingness to share these items and digitize them.
All had prior experience with using AR and VR devices with avg = 4.98, std = 1.53 on a scale from 1 (not at all familiar) to 7 (extremely familiar). 
The first two sessions took around 2 hours and the additional brainstorming took around 1 hour.
Each participant was paid an equivalent of 50 USD in local currency for compensation. 
The hardware configurations and AR deployment employed in the study were consistent with those detailed in Sec. \ref{implementation}.

% 1. encode functions
% 2. tasks covered all the interactions of MemoTool
% 3. goal: evaluate the usability of the MemoTool and user experience of creating IDI inside a mixed reality environment.
% and evaluate whether the user could obtain the sense of realism for the IDI created by MemoTool.
The goal of this session was to assess the feasibility of utilizing InteRecon to create the IDI within a mixed reality environment. 
To achieve this, we asked participants to experience all the functions provided by InteRecon to inspire them to propose more personal IDIs and usages in the next session.
% We designed interaction scripts to guide users' experience procedure. 
We broke down InteRecon's functions described in Sec. \ref{design_interRecon} into one-step interactions and designed scripts of one-step atomic interaction sequence for each function, as illustrated in Table \ref{tab:atomic_interaction}. 
We further designed three micro IDI-creation tasks, which collectively cover all the atomic interactions across the four functions.
Each task was structured to progress through a list of several atomic interactions, as outlined in Table \ref{tab:scripts}. 
% We employed a combination of ID letters and sequence numbers from Table \ref{tab:atomic_interaction} to reference specific atomic interactions in Table \ref{tab:scripts} (e.g., the \textit{A1} corresponds to the first atomic interaction in the `Reconstructing 3D Appearance' category).
% We illustrated the micro tasks in Fig. xx by highlighting the reconstruction component to be needed within each task model.
In the case of T3 from micro-tasks, as there were multiple contents in a TV to be added, we anticipated that the D function in Table \ref{tab:atomic_interaction} would be iterated \textit{n} times for participants to reconstruct a TV IDI.
We noted this in our task scripts in Table \ref{tab:scripts}. 
Additionally, we created tutorials for each task, available in both the AR environment and print format. 
% Each tutorial page contained written descriptions and visual instructions (e.g., specific buttons to click) for every atomic interaction.
% with each tutorial page comprising textual descriptions and visual instructions (e.g., the targeted buttons to be clicked) for each atomic interaction. 

We first asked the participants to walk through the Hololens 2 official tutorial to learn how to navigate the user interface with basic hand gestures. 
After finishing the consent form and demographic questionnaire, participants were first introduced to the study and provided with a tutorial. 
They were then guided to complete three tasks sequentially. 
Before each task, participants were invited to interact with the relevant physical item associated with the task. 
This allowed them to gain an understanding of the item's interactivity, such as the widgets on the TV and the joint mechanism between the Moon lamp's base and body, assisting them in reconstructing these interactions in AR.
After completing each task, participants provided brief feedback on their InteRecon experience and were granted a 10-minute break.
The study involved two experimenters: one was responsible for introducing the study and aiding participants in tutorial comprehension, while the other monitored participants' Hololens views and documented the feedback for each task. 
After finishing all the tasks, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire with Likert-type (scaled 1-7) questions on evaluating the feasibility of InteRecon's four functional categories.
% We provided screenshots of each function pre-designed by our researcher within the questionnaire as a visual reminder.
The questions with metrics employed in the questionnaire are detailed in the Appendix Table \ref{tab:questionnaire}.

% We designed six micro tasks for the frst user study session (Figure 22). Each task contains one pair of toy-AR interaction for users to author. Half of these interactions (Task 1-3) use the toy as the trigger to actuate the AR content, and the other three (Task 4-6) use the AR content to actuate the toy. Our input and output categories are all covered in these interactions. Both continuous and discrete trigger-action types are included as well. The description of each task is detailed in Table 2. The goal of this session was to evaluate the usability of the MechARspace system and to explore the user experience of authoring toy-based AR applications inside a mixed reality environment.

% \revision{We designed interaction scripts to guide users' experience procedure. Specifically, we broke down each application into single-step interaction tasks according to the functions described in Sec 6.2 and designed scripts of a one-step atomic interaction sequence to form an integral usage flow. We summarized all possible atomic interactions into three categories - one-finger touch, one-finger swipe, and multi-finger gesture - as shown in Table \ref{tab:atomic_interaction}. The template scripts of different applications are shown in Table \ref{tab:task_description}.}

% \revision{To evaluate users' experience and subjective ratings of different hand-to-surface interaction techniques, we designed a questionnaire containing five questions derived from the system usability scale (SUS) \cite{bangor2008empirical} on willingness to use, easiness to use, integrity, learnability, and confidence regarding different applications under three techniques. Users were further asked to provide their subjective feedback towards three different settings.}

\subsection{Session Two: Free Exploration on Prototyping Personalized IDI}
\label{session-two}
The goal of this session was to investigate how participants employ InteRecon to create their own IDI in an exploratory manner without specific tasks, aiming to obtain further feedback and ideas on the challenges, application scenarios, and future opportunities of InteRecon.
We conducted a phone interview to inquire about the types of items they were interested in reconstructing before participants arrived for the user study.
This ensured the InteRecon's resources, the elements within the categories of `geometry', `interface', and `content', could accommodate the potential interactivity features of reconstructing participants' items. 
Three participants said that the items they wished to reconstruct were not at hand, so with the assistance of our researcher, they downloaded similar 3D models from the internet to proceed with the next steps of creating IDI, bypassing the step of scanning the physical item. 
We also provided participants with items mentioned in our formative study in case the participants had some more creative ideas to implement.
Participants were then asked to utilize InteRecon to recreate the IDI.
% They were also allowed to reconstruct their own items. 
This exploratory session lasted approximately 30 minutes. 
% various physical mementos  such as a toy Transformer, a furry toy bear, a toy Pikachu, a toy car, a Game Boy, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:toys} (a). 

At this stage, participants were already familiar with InteRecon and an experimenter was present to address any questions they might have had. 
Participants were asked to ``think-aloud'' \cite{van1994think} to express their thoughts promptly during the process. 
In the end, we held in-depth interviews (30-40 minutes) with our participants regarding their qualitative feedback.
The entire session was recorded on video by the experimenter.

\subsection{Results}
\label{fi:overview_results}
% We set off to find the user experiences of utilizing MemoTool to create IDI. 
We reported the results collected from our user study, including the duration time of each interaction with failure cases in Session One, the questionnaire consisting of 7-point Likert scale data regarding the user subjective ratings for four categories of InteRecon functions in Table \ref{tab:atomic_interaction}, and the qualitative feedback from the interview in Session Two. 
Fig. \ref{fig:results} illustrates examples of the reconstructed IDIs by our participants.
Except the Moon Lamp in a-1 of Fig. \ref{fig:results} was created in the pre-designed task of Session One (Section \ref{session-one}), the rest examples were created by participants in Session Two (Section \ref{session-two}). 
We conducted a thematic analysis with qualitative feedback data from 16 participants. 
We report the overall results in Sec.~\ref{sec: subj_rating} to assess the feasibility of the authoring workflow of using InteRecon to create IDI and further report the qualitative results in the following subsections.


\subsubsection{\revision{Overall Results}}
% \zisu{Discuss failure cases, the time and effort required to scan objects, and the system’s responsiveness in handling complex physical interactions.
% I am curious if the authors can have more results from the perspective of, for example, the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction, the time and effort required to scan objects, and the system’s responsiveness in handling complex physical interactions.
% Consider expanding the participant pool and incorporating more rigorous methodologies. Include technical performance metrics in the evaluation and address the concerns about the study's focus.
% They also requested more technical performance metrics in the evaluation.}
\revision{
We recorded the mean duration time to complete the atomic interaction in each task (11 data points in 3 tasks) in Session One, resulting in 176 data points in total across 16 participants, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{duration-time}. 
For the D1 and D2 interactions, which occurred multiple times in the task, we recorded the first trial for each participant.
The results show that the mean duration time of every atomic interaction is within a reasonable time phrase (under 250 seconds).
Notably, A2 and B3 posed a relatively longer duration time for users to complete. 
The difficulty of A2 lies in the fact that the user needs to move the camera slowly to ensure that enough key frames are captured to generate the reconstruction results. Additionally, in order to capture the three orbit data of the object (front, side, and bottom surface), the participant needs to hold the camera and circle around the object three times. 
The difficulty of B3 arises from the need to employ pinching gestures for selecting model segments within the AR environment. 
Participants reported challenges in this selecting process, partly due to lower pinching gesture accuracy.
We also observed 3 failure cases during B3 involving 3 participants and this may be attributed to the confusion in identifying the `Base' and `Movable' segments of the model.
Two failure cases also occurred during the B1 operation in Session Two, as participants attempted to cut overly complex mesh objects in AR (e.g., having a higher number of vertices and intricate topological structures). This complexity led to crashes in the HoloLens system.

% \subsubsection{Subjective Ratings}
\label{sec: subj_rating}
% 1. overall evaluation for the tool on ten metrics
% 2. the duration of each step to examine the easiness of it (check the outliers)
% 3. overall comments on each functions
% 4. 

Participants were asked to provide their ratings towards the four categories of functions through our questionnaire, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{BERT}. 
We employed five metrics: ease of use, learnability, helpfulness, expressiveness, and non-frustration. 
A detailed description of each metric's question can be found in the Appendix Table \ref{tab:questionnaire}. 
Participants found the interaction process user-friendly, as reflected in the high average rating for ease of use (avg = 5.81, std = 0.50). 
They expressed confidence in their ability to use the functions, indicated by a high learnability score (avg = 5.88, std = 0.41). 
The scores of `helpfulness' was also well received (avg = 5.55, std = 0.52). 
Moreover, participants appreciated the expressiveness of the InteRecon, giving it a high score (avg = 6.08, std = 0.42), and they experienced minimal frustration, as shown by the rating for non-frustration (avg = 5.94, std = 0.48). 
These results show that InteRecon is effective, expressive, and user-friendly in creating IDI, with its rich customization possibilities receiving positive feedback from participants.

% In addition, we recorded the duration to complete the atomic interactions for each task (18 data points in 4 tasks) in the first session, resulting in 288 data points in total across 16 participants, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{boxplot}. 
% Fig. \ref{boxplot} presents a box-plot showing the duration in four tasks.
% A box-plot is a statistical technique summarizing a group of data and describing the discrete degree by identifying outlier data values \cite{williamson1989box}. 
% The stability of completion time can be reflected by the box-plot. 
% As can be seen from the Fig. \ref{boxplot}, only one of the 18 scripts generated two outliers in the time distribution, while the remaining 17 scripts had either no outliers or only one outlier. 
% This result indicates that each atomic interaction is generally completed within a reasonable timeframe, with the exception of D3 in Task 4, which exceeded 200 seconds. 
% Notably, D3 posed significant challenges for the majority of users (eleven out of sixteen).

\subsubsection{Physical Interactivity Created by InteRecon for Realistic Experiences}
\label{fi:Realistic}
All participants agreed that they were able to create the IDI from physical items and reconstruct interactivity for them within InteRecon in the AR environment, highlighting its \engquote{memorability} (P1), and \engquote{digital longevity} (P4) of IDI. 
\revision{Additionally, with the realistic interactions of IDI created by InteRecon, participants felt a strong sense of ownership and envisioned IDIs as 3D interactive digital assets, \engquote{more memorable than photos, vlogs, or static 3D scanning items} (N=13).}
\revision{Participants also mentioned that IDI represents an `exciting advancement' compared to static 3D scanned digital objects (N=15). This is because the interactivity of personal items is entirely defined, designed, and reconstructed by the participants themselves. It more comprehensively reflects the meaning of personal items by reconstructing how users engage with their personal items, which are closely tied to personal memories. As a result, \engquote{a deeper emotional connection to IDI was built} (N=10).}



% 用户也提到了可交互数字物品和静态3d扫描数字物品相比是一个令人惊喜的进步，因为可交互数字物品的交互形式是完全由用户自己定义、设计、并完成建立的，它更全面的反映了用户的个人物品的使用方式，而使用方式是和个人记忆强相关的，所以用户对idi也具有更深的情感连接。

\textbf{Interfaces and content} reconstructed in IDI for electronic devices is vivid and relatively authentic, facilitating access to the original versions of files and allowing for the original interactive input methods of the devices.
It's akin to an AR emulator of vintage electronic devices, offering a more realistic experience than 2D emulators which lack the ability to replicate physical interactions. 
\engquote{For instance, a 2D emulator merely converts a physical button press into a screen click, diminishing its authenticity. } (P6), as he reconstructed his Game Boy in AR in Fig. \ref{fig:results}(b-2). 
After reconstructing more electronic devices (e.g., camera, music player, and DJ table) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results}(b) and Fig. \ref{fig:teaser}(b), participants suggested that future collections of various iterations of electronic devices (like the diverse models of music players and cameras) might be supplanted by their AR counterparts, alleviating the demands on physical storage space and financial expenses. 
% This shift is expected to alleviate the demands on physical storage space and financial expenses.



\textbf{Geometric properties} reconstructed in IDI for physical artifacts enhanced the enjoyment of interacting with digital replicas of memory artifacts.
Many participants (N=15) emphasized that the reconstruction of the mechanical joints truly constituted the impressive physical features of their toys, \engquote{turning them into more functional and delightful digital keepsakes.} (P9).
However, more physical properties (e.g. texture, softness, opacity, etc. ) were mentioned by our participants to improve the realism of IDI. 
For example, as Fig. \ref{fig:results}(a-2) illustrated, P10 said \engquote{I find my toy soft and furry texture very comforting, yet its IDI version appears stiff, reducing our emotional connection with it.}



\subsubsection{Immersive Interactions Empowered IDI creation}
\label{fi:immersive}
InteRecon enabled various virtual and physical interactions, facilitating users in reconstructing the physical interactivity of memory artifacts. 
Within this spectrum, two types of prominent interactions were frequently highlighted by users as significantly impacting the reconstruction experience.

\textbf{Hand-object interactions} in AR were considered the principal resource of realism. 
Many participants (N=12) expressed their appreciation for being able to use their hands to interact with virtual objects in AR as if they were in the physical world. 
As P7 mentioned in Fig. \ref{fig:teaser}(a), \engquote{When I slightly touched the digital toy Stitch, its head moved just like the real toy Stitch.} 
Bare-hand manipulation and its corresponding realistic transformation effects in IDI constitute the most important and preferable characteristic of InteRecon.
Seven participants with VR/AR experience noted that interactions simulating bare-hand physics diverge from their usual experiences in immersive environments, which typically \engquote{involve selecting or manipulating targets with a controller} (P12).
Five participants suggested further enhancements in modeling different hand parts (e.g., finger joints, palm or back of the hand, etc.) to facilitate more detailed collisions and touch interactions with IDI.
\engquote{Since interactions between various hand surfaces and objects often result in different components' movements of the object in the real world} (P14), these advancements could also increase the interaction's realism.

\textbf{Model segmentation} is considered to have raised concerns due to being overly realistic.
Two different operations were provided for users to segment 3D models, including direct segmentation in an AR environment and segmentation using 2D software.
Within the former operation, users could witness the model being divided into components. 
Many participants expressed discomfort with this effect, describing it as cruel: \engquote{Perhaps I don't want my toy to be divided into parts; it looks as if it is broken. Maybe segmenting in a 2D interface could mitigate the realism, making it more acceptable to me.} (P15).
Especially \engquote{models of animals or human figures}, can feel overly realistic and thus \engquote{cruel} (N=13)—for example, separating the legs of a toy dog or the arms of a LEGO figure, as their IDI illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:geo} and Fig. \ref{fig:results}(a-4). 
Although participants expressed satisfaction with the final effects of IDI to enable interactivity, they did not hope the creating process was also too realistic.  
In contrast, segmentation within a 2D environment does not evoke these sentiments. 
In 2D, the process is perceived as \engquote{a routine operation without a sense of realism} (P9), thereby avoiding feelings of cruelty.

\subsubsection{Potentials of IDI to Enrich Memory Archives}
\label{fi:potentials}
Participants praised the concept of IDI in terms of enriching personal memory archives and proposed new envisioned features and scenarios to enrich the design space of InteRecon.
\revision{Participants compared the difference between simply scanning objects and objects with authoring their interactivity (N=10). They mentioned that it is similar to the difference between photos and videos; dynamic, interactive 3D models can be more expressive in life-logging scenarios. \engquote{They can be dynamic and offer greater potential for secondary creation for people} (P8), and also mentioned that \engquote{the interaction between objects, items, and people together contributes to the completeness of memories.} (P11).
}



\textbf{Creative interactivity beyond the real world} could be created by InteRecon. 
These interactions might not happen in the real world, but InteRecon can realize them in AR.
For example, for personal items, many participants wanted to create interactions about contextual elements associated with the memory (e.g., music, animations, photos, etc.) to enrich the memory of the item due to the convenience of interactivity creation by InteRecon, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:creative}.
P4 created an IDI that could play music by pressing a `Play' button for a statue of a violinist in Mexico, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:creative}(a). 
P4 added \engquote{When I bought this statue in Mexico, the environmental music was always `Remember me.' So, it is fantastic for me to reconstruct the music in my memory to my virtual statue by attaching a button.}
% Also, P16 invented the function of playing the photos taken during travel on a souvenir bought from a zoo by attaching a screen widget and a button widget and import the photos to the souvenir, which is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:results} xx. 
Also, P16 developed a feature that attaches a button widget and a screen widget to a souvenir purchased during a trip, which is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:creative}(b). This setup is designed to display photos from the trip, allowing for a natural recollection of travel memories each time this IDI is accessed, combining photos and the model.
By using InteRecon, participants could conveniently create the IDI's interactivity beyond its physical counterpart and delineate a more interactive virtual reconstruction that enriches personal memory archives.

\textbf{In-situ and life-logging scenarios} were also proposed by our participants, including using InteRecon to enable in-situ 3D interactivity reconstruction and utilizing IDI to be a social media platform to empower life-logging.
Non-personal items or items not at hand were proposed by participants to conduct in-situ interactivity reconstruction within InteRecon, such as \engquote{museum exhibits} (P8), \engquote{interactive art installations encountered during travel} and \engquote{my toy which is in my parent's house} (P4).
% They envisioned the possibility of using InteRecon to conduct in-situ interactivity reconstruction for items beyond their personal belongings, such as \engquote{museum exhibits} (P8), \engquote{interactive art installations encountered during travel} and \engquote{my toy which is in my parent's house} (P4). 
These items, though integral to their memories, are not physically transportable.
By using InteRecon remotely, anytime and anywhere, people could get access to their memorable items without spatial and temporal limitations, thus extending the digital longevity of the items.
% InteRecon offers the capability of in-situ reconstruction of interactivity of such items, providing participants with remote access to their memorable items, anytime and anywhere, thus preserving their significance in the participants' memories.
Additionally, InteRecon was recognized as a life-logging 3D content generator. 
As P5 said, \engquote{3D digital replication with interactivity offers a more vivid representation than static 2D photos. Thus I can capture memorable moments with my pets by incorporating interactive elements into our digital counterparts!}.
As life-logging 3D content thrives, InteRecon has the potential to evolve into a platform for social media sharing, as P5 said \engquote{like a 3D version of Instagram}, empowering the pervasive access of 3D content.





\subsubsection{\revision{Broader Conceptual Enrichment and Applications of IDI}}
\label{broader}
\revision{Our participants also shared ideas for the future applications of IDI, enriching its conceptual framework across various professional fields.
First, IDIs can serve as instant sharing objects in both museum and educational settings.
In museums, IDI can function as an AR digital object that integrates the historical use of ancient artifacts or brings ancient sculptures to life with dynamic animations like \engquote{making Terracotta Army of China come alive} (P3). This interactivity can make exhibits more engaging and impressive for visitors.}
\revision{In educational settings, IDI acts as a medium for instant sharing, allowing teachers to demonstrate key mathematical and physical concepts like \engquote{celestial movements} or visualize literary works by incorporating interactive scenes like \engquote{realizing Harry Potter's magic} (P2).}
\revision{In the medical field, doctors can develop IDIs that provide detailed operating procedures of \engquote{cosmetic surgery, organ transplant surgery, or traditional Chinese acupuncture} (P9). 
This comprehensive presentation allows patients to gain a clearer understanding of upcoming surgeries, while also have the potential to enable apprentice doctors to enhance their knowledge for performing these procedures. 
In the field of fashion design, our participants envisioned that IDI could offer a cost-effective way to model and experiment with materials and environments. This method allows designers to preview how garments under various conditions that are difficult to replicate in the physical world. As P7 noted, \engquote{I can reconstruct my designed coat as an IDI and even see how it performs when worn in the low gravity environment of the moon!}. Overall, the rich interactive reconstruction and customization capabilities of IDI make it highly applicable across various industries.}

% Participants proposed innovative scenarios for utilizing IDI to create, share, and enhance digital interactivity. They suggested employing InteRecon for the in-situ reconstruction of interactivity for non-personal items, such as museum exhibits, interactive art installations encountered during travels, and personal belongings located elsewhere, like a toy in a participant's parental home. These items, though integral to their memories, are not physically transportable. InteRecon enables remote access to these memorable items, allowing for interaction at any time and place, thus preserving their significance in the participants' memories. 
% Moreover, InteRecon is recognized as a versatile platform for life-logging through 3D content generation, with potential applications in social media sharing, akin to a "3D version of Instagram," thereby facilitating widespread access to 3D content.



% IDI were believed as a more vivid and multi-dimension life-logging content that can be enriched in a social media platform, \engquote{like a 3D version of Instagram} (P8).

% In his feedback, P8 emphasized that: \engquote{MemoTool is a user-friendly application thoughtfully tailored for everyday users, eliminating the requirement for advanced sketching skills or the burden of mastering complex cross-domain software.}

% % new functions
% Additionally, our participant also suggested expanding new functions for MemoTool.

% \revision{a sticker on the toy indicates the ownership }
% % a. whether the memotool could help the user to simulate the functions of the items 
% % b. tactile feedback
% % c. hand interactions (should be add to the implementation)
% % \engquote{sss}

% All participants agreed that they were able to create the IDI from physical artifacts and add real-world features to them with the support of the functions of MemoTool. 
% They all mentioned that the IDI created in each task effectively represented the physical memento in reconstructing real-world features, which enhanced its \engquote{memorability} (P1) and \engquote{longevity} (P4) of digital mementos. 
% % For instance, P11 noted, \engquote{The overall workflow of MemoTool helped me complete the reconstruction of a physical item.}
% P2 also emphasized that the reconstruction of the mechanical component truly constituted the impressive physical features of the toy Stitch, stating, \engquote{This significantly added enjoyment to the digital reconstructed memento, transforming it into a more practical and enjoyable digital memento that exceeded my IDIgination.}
 
% Furthermore, we observed that the sense of realism was largely derived from the bare-hand interactions with the virtual objects. 
% Many participants (N=12) expressed their amazement at being able to use hands to interact with virtual objects in AR as if they were in the physical world. 
% As P7 mentioned, \engquote{When I slightly touched the digital Stitch, its head moved just like the real toy Stitch.} 
% Seven participants who had the experiences with VR/AR, pointed out that bare-hand physics-simulating interaction differed from their previous experiences in the immersive environment: \engquote{Typically, hand interactions in VR/AR do not simulate physics; they are often used for manipulating objects or selecting targets, rather than making objects behave realistically.} (P9).

% We also found that the lack of tactile feedback has a negative impact on the participants’ perception of realism.
% Five participants commented that without the tactile feedback, they cannot accurately `press' the button on the virtual GameBoy, instead, they resorted to `poking' the buttons, diminishing the realism of the IDI. 
% One participant (P11) detailed the difference between pressing buttons in the real world and the virtual world. 
% In the real world, pressing buttons requires applying \engquote{force} to activate the internal mechanical structure of the button, and there is tactile feedback to confirm a successful press. 
% In contrast, in the virtual world, there is no tactile feedback when pressing buttons, which makes it difficult to gauge \engquote{how much force is needed by hands}. 
% This lack of tactile feedback can, to some extent, diminish the sense of realism for IDI.

% cannot 'hold' the mesh and 'press' the button

% \subsubsection{Qualitative Feedback --- Ease of interactive approaches}
% a. mixed environment - mobile and AR
% b. the pre-designed functions to choose
% b. should preserve the DIY interface
% c. mesh cut method is good but there are some more smart solutions
% c. 3D manipulation on model
% d. redo


% The participants appreciated the overall interactive approaches of MemoTool. Specifically, 8 participants highlighted the seamless synchronization between mixed devices is organic and natural.
% On the one hand, mobile devices empowered the user of the freedom to upload the content as most digital files and data can be accessed through mobile devices.
% On the other hand, AR glasses maintained the real-world environment, allowing participants to \engquote{effortlessly switch to mobile devices} (P3) for uploading and editing content without compromising MemoTool's integrated interactivity. This versatility expands its potential application scenarios.

% When the participants designed the interactions for IDI (such as locating virtual widgets and attaching them to the model, or interacting with joints and mapping them onto the model), they found it convenient and easier to select options from a pre-designed set rather than creating their own. 
% An important concern that has been successfully tackled concerning participants’ non-technical backgrounds is that designing and authoring in AR no longer seems unattainable.
% P15 commented, \engquote{The presented buttons, especially the icons indicating their functions on it, facilitated my rapid identification of the target function and its attachment to the model.} P14 also suggested enhancing visual cues to the displayed joints within the scene, stated \engquote{It would be more beneficial if these showcased joints could incorporate anIDItions to indicate their relative movements, sparing me the need to interact with each one individually.} 

% Additionally, participants also put forth some suggestions of optimizations on interaction approaches.
% While the pre-set functions proved convenient for participant, there remained the possibility of unique cases. 
% Therefore, it is crucial to maintain an interface that allows end-users to program interactions for widgets or mechanical components themselves.
% The interactive segment method for models could also be optimized. 
% P10 offered feedback, stating that \engquote{utilizing a plane to cut the model appear too harsh for cherished mementos; perhaps marking three dots on the surface of the model to confirm a plane could be a gentler approach.}

% % a. different roles in this community (developer, user, xx)
% % b. open sources for various assets (software, operating system, mesh/ model,)
% % c. extended functions xxx
% % D. appreciated the concept of IDI
% % e. different roles in this community (developer, user, xx) anIDItion professional 
% All of our participants expressed a positive overall reception of the Interactive Digital Memento concept with some expectations regarding IDI's future usage scenarios and visions, emphasizing its role in facilitating personal memory archiving efforts.
% A shared expectation among participants was the creation of a virtual IDI community. 
% This envisioned virtual community would serve as a platform for resource creation and sharing centered around IDI. 
% This community would facilitate collaboration among users from diverse backgrounds (e.g., modeling, anIDItion, programming, designing, etc.), allowing them to collectively build and share IDI content.
% This community should provide ready-made resources of \engquote{3D models of mementos, software, operating systems, complex mechanical components, etc.}  (P10) which users can readily access and integrate into their IDI projects. 
% For instance, seven participants expressed the desire to have more operating systems in the community for broader application across various devices. 
% Also, the virtual community should support additional editing functions for the ready-made resources to preserve the personal uniqueness of mementos for users, as P13 stated: \engquote{While it's convenient to directly use 3D models and other resources from others, the inclusion of further editing functions is essential to retain the unique personal traces in my IDI.}
% Concerns about the privacy of the virtual community was also mentioned by 5 participants, as they stated: \engquote{If it is possible to ensure that one's objects are not used indiscriminately and that privacy is guaranteed, then I'm happy to participate in discussions in the online community.}










% \textit{P15} said: \textit{``Being able to play games inside AR is invigorating, but it would be even cooler to be able to overlay different operating systems to play different old devices, like Nokia phones, Tamagotchi, that sort of thing.''}
% As P3 pointed out, \engquote{If I could find the complete operating system from the community for the old Nokia, I'd be delighted to use them, saving me the effort of creating an IDI for my old Nokia.}



% Participants came up with many ideas for building online interactive communities in the future, which aim to provide virtual object-creating and sharing functionalities between developers and users just like GitHub for programmers. 

% Firstly, end-users would like to have more scanned meshes to share and use with each other in the online community, as well as create interaction schemes, which can save the trouble of repeated scanning in many scenarios (N=14). 
% As \textit{P6} stated: \textit{``I want to be able to share models and to be able to write tools that create ways of interaction on the online community.''} 
% Besides, some participants (N=7) also expressed the expectation to share the operating systems in terms of achieving wider usage of old devices. \textit{P15} said: \textit{``Being able to play games inside AR is invigorating, but it would be even cooler to be able to overlay different operating systems to play different old devices, like Nokia phones, Tamagotchi, that sort of thing.''} 
% However, some participants (N=5) also expressed their concerns about privacy and uniqueness. 
% As \textit{P12} stated: \textit{``I would pay more attention to the signs of use of my items than sharing them in the online community. If everyone shares the same mesh, it seems to have less meaning to me.''}, and \textit{P4} said: \textit{``If it is possible to ensure that one's objects are not used indiscriminately and that privacy is guaranteed, then I'm happy to participate in discussions in the online community.''} 
% To summarize, building the virtual community of IDI could enhance the communication and operating efficiency for users, under certain privacy protection mechanisms.


% \subsubsection{Qualitative Feedback --- Ease of  using }
% (1) Object Scanning：是个很好用的app，有interactive feedback，但是也会受限于复杂度很高的物体 => LiDar Scanner的问题

% Overall, most participants (N = 14) felt that the experience and effectiveness of using object scanning met expectations. The 3D scanning of an object was written and efficiently done on the cell phone, and the real-time reconstruction was more user-friendly. \textit{P16: ``All I have to do is turn around the object and flip it over and turn it again, which I find very convenient.''} \textit{P15} also expressed appreciation for the interaction: \textit{``The real-time object reconstruction feedback was interesting to me and increased my confidence in accomplishing that task.''} However, some participants also proposed some concerns of reconstructing objects that have complex surfaces. As \textit{P11} said: \textit{``I felt it is hard for me to reconstruct objects that have many complex and spatially overlapping angles, and if an object has some joints, it might change the shape when tipping it down.''} To summarize, object scanning achieves considerable usability overall. In order to improve object reproduction, users should scan objects: (1) in a stable lighting environment, (2) choose objects with sharp edges, and (3) make sure that the object's shape remains unchanged when flipped as much as possible.
