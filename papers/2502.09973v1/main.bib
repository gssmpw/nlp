%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Sharing family stories is an integral aspect of how families remember together and build a sense of connection. Yet, when generations in families are separated by large geographic and temporal distances, the everyday taken-for-granted processes of sharing family stories shift from conversational to mediated forms. To inform HCI research and practice in mediating family stories, we contribute an account of the co-constructive intergenerational social practices enacted to co-construct and interpret family stories. These practices demonstrate the agency of both storytellers and listeners as they work to discover, decipher, and reconstruct family stories. We close by drawing insights from this setting to frame key design challenges for multi-lifespan information systems mediating asynchronous, asymmetric, co-constructive and socially weighted information sharing interactions.},

abstract = {Creating digital archives of personal and family artifacts is an area of growing interest, but which seemingly is often not supported by a thorough understanding of current home archiving practice. In this article we seek to excavate the home archive, exploring those things that people choose to keep rather than simply accumulate. Based on extensive field research in family homes we present an investigation of the kinds of sentimental objects, both physical and digital, to be found in homes, and through in-depth interviews with family members we explore the values behind archiving practices, explaining why and how sentimental artefacts are kept. In doing this we wish to highlight the polysemous nature of things and to argue that archiving practice in the home is not solely concerned with the invocation of memory. In support of this we show how sentimental artifacts are also used to connect with others, to define the self and the family, to fulfill obligations and, quite conversely to efforts of remembering, to safely forget. Such values are fundamental to family life where archiving takes place and consequently we explore how home archiving is achieved as a familial practice in the negotiated spaces of the home. From this grounded understanding of existing practices and values, in context, we derive requirements and implications for the design of future forms of domestic archiving technology.},

abstract = {Lifelogging' technology makes it possible to amass digital data about every aspect of our everyday lives. Instead of focusing on such technical possibilities, here we investigate the way people compose long-term mnemonic representations of their lives. We asked 10 families to create a time capsule, a collection of objects used to trigger remembering in the distant future. Our results show that contrary to the lifelogging view, people are less interested in exhaustively digitally recording their past than in reconstructing it from carefully selected cues that are often physical objects. Time capsules were highly expressive and personal, many objects were made explicitly for inclusion, however with little object annotation. We use these findings to propose principles for designing technology that supports the active reconstruction of our future past.},

abstract = {Capturing and reliving memories allow us to record, understand and share our past experiences. Currently, the most common approach to revisiting past moments is viewing photos and videos. These 2D media capture past events that reflect a recorder’s first-person perspective. The development of technology for accurately capturing 3D content presents an opportunity for new types of memory reliving, allowing greater immersion without perspective limitations. In this work, we adopt 2D and 3D moment-recording techniques and build a moment-reliving experience in AR that combines both display methods. Specifically, we use AR glasses to record 2D point-of-view (POV) videos, and volumetric capture to reconstruct 3D moments in AR. We allow seamless switching between AR and POV videos to enable immersive moment reliving and viewing of high-resolution details. Users can also navigate to a specific point in time using playback controls. Control is synchronized between multiple users for shared viewing.},

Meanwhile, cloud-based technologies can foster collaboration and other interaction modalities to enhance learning. We combine the cloud capabilities with AR technologies to present Meta-AR-App, an authoring platform for collaborative AR, which enables authoring between instructors and students. Additionally, we introduce a new application of an established collaboration process, the pull-based development model, to enable sharing and retrieving of AR learning content. We customize this model and create two modalities of interaction for the classroom: local (student to student) and global (instructor to class) pull. Based on observations from our user studies, we organize a four-category classroom model which implements our system: Work, Design, Collaboration, and Technology. Further, our system enables an iterative improvement workflow of the class content and enables synergistic collaboration that empowers students to be active agents in the learning process.},

But unlike other technologies, Augmented Reality (AR) has received limited attention. In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.},

We propose DistanciAR, a novel tablet-based workflow for remote AR authoring. Our baseline solution involves three steps. A remote environment is captured by a camera with LiDAR; then, the author creates an AR experience from a different location using AR interactions; finally, a remote viewer consumes the AR content on site. A formative study revealed understanding and navigating the remote space as key challenges with this solution. We improved the authoring interface by adding two novel modes: Dollhouse, which renders a bird’s-eye view, and Peek, which creates photorealistic composite images using captured images. A second study compared this improved system with the baseline, and participants reported that the new modes made it easier to understand and navigate the remote scene.},

However, the dissimilarity of different environments limits the adaptive AR content behaviors under large-scale deployment. We propose ScalAR, an integrated workflow enabling designers to author semantically adaptive AR experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). First, potential AR consumers collect local scenes with a semantic understanding technique. ScalAR then synthesizes numerous similar scenes. In VR, a designer authors the AR contents’ semantic associations and validates the design while being immersed in the provided scenes. We adopt a decision-tree-based algorithm to fit the designer’s demonstrations as a semantic adaptation model to deploy the authored AR experience in a physical scene. We further showcase two application scenarios authored by ScalAR and conduct a two-session user study where the quantitative results prove the accuracy of the AR content rendering and the qualitative results show the usability of ScalAR.},

We interviewed 26 professional AR/VR designers and developers to shed light on their tasks, approaches, tools, and challenges. Based on their work and the artifacts they generated, we found that AR/VR application creators fulfill four roles: concept developers, interaction designers, content authors, and technical developers. One person often incorporates multiple roles and faces a variety of challenges during the design process from the initial contextual analysis to the deployment. From analysis of their tool sets, methods, and artifacts, we describe critical key challenges. Finally, we discuss the importance of prototyping for the communication in AR/VR development teams and highlight design implications for future tools to create a more usable AR/VR tool chain.},

The problem with this is that non-computer expert users lack the programming skills necessary to create useful applications. Specifying interactions remains in the domain of the programmer. Creating a single, generic authoring tool for every different kind of application would be an impossible task -- more so if the authors are non-programmers. A more realistic solution to the problem would be to think of every environment as having a particular context such as a virtual museum or gallery. Creating authoring tools specific to these types of environment contexts greatly reduces the problem. We have produced a progressive meta-authoring system that allows both novice and advanced users to create useful virtual reality applications, allowing the smooth migration of novice users to becoming more experienced. We believe that our system overcomes problems in architecture and support for novice users found in previous systems.},

Technical experts produce the underlying technology that makes the medium possible, but without high quality content the medium won't be successful. In order for a digital medium to be successful it must be possible for content designers to have as much access as possible to the technology without requiring the hands-on assistance of technology experts. This paper examines the problem of creating authoring tools for virtual environments that allow content designers to produce interesting artistic environments without the direct assistance of programmers. Over the past two years we have been developing authoring tools for artistic virtual environments, and these tools form the basis of our virtual reality courses. Most of the students in these courses have limited programming abilities, so they cannot use programming based tools for producing their virtual environments. This paper presents some of the important things that we have learned and a brief discussion of the tools that we have produced.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Sketched Reality, an approach that combines AR sketching and actuated tangible user interfaces (TUI) for bi-directional sketching interaction. Bi-directional sketching enables virtual sketches and physical objects to “affect” each other through physical actuation and digital computation. In the existing AR sketching, the relationship between virtual and physical worlds is only one-directional — while physical interaction can affect virtual sketches, virtual sketches have no return effect on the physical objects or environment. In contrast, bi-directional sketching interaction allows the seamless coupling between sketches and actuated TUIs. In this paper, we employ tabletop-size small robots (Sony Toio) and an iPad-based AR sketching tool to demonstrate the concept. In our system, virtual sketches drawn and simulated on an iPad (e.g., lines, walls, pendulums, and springs) can move, actuate, collide, and constrain physical Toio robots, as if virtual sketches and the physical objects exist in the same space through seamless coupling between AR and robot motion. This paper contributes a set of novel interactions and a design space of bi-directional AR sketching. We demonstrate a series of potential applications, such as tangible physics education, explorable mechanism, tangible gaming for children, and in-situ robot programming via sketching.},

abstract = {We all collect personal mementos, treasured objects that remind us about our past. We also remember significant people and places from our past. A key way that we reflect on our identity is through collecting, organizing and talking to others about such personal mementos, places and people. However, most work on mementos has focused on physical objects rather than their digital representations. And when digital archives have been examined these have been found to be underexploited. We, therefore, implemented and evaluated a new class of digital memory application, MemoryLane, that is designed on the basis of prior research into memory and reminiscence. MemoryLane allows people to capture, actively organize and reflect on digital representations of mementos relating to people, places and objects. Users can also annotate captured mementos with spoken or textual narratives. User feedback provides new information about the nature of digital reminiscing and reflection. Our 31 persons evaluation showed that people were active in organizing and reflecting on these personal digital collections. As we expected, most mementos centered around familiar home objects, although mementos relating to people tended to be regarded as most important and to evoke stronger emotions. Participants also recorded many spoken narratives about mementos, but these spoken reflections were unpopular on playback. We discuss the theoretical and design implications of our work.}

abstract = {Many studies have explored social processes and technologies associated with sharing photos. In contrast, we explore the role of sound as a medium for social reminiscing. We involved 10 families in recording 'sonic souvenirs' of their holidays. They shared and discussed their collections on their return. We compared these sounds with their photo taking activities and reminiscences. Both sounds and pictures triggered active collaborative reminiscing, and attempts to capture iconic representations of events. However sounds differed from photos in that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be 'true to life', and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw little use of pure explanatory narrative. We reflect on the relations between sound and family memory and propose new designs on the basis of our findings, to better support the sharing and manipulation of social sounds.},

The interactive photo album was found to be easy to use and accessible, effectively engaged Ethel's and family members' interest, and provided a focal point for communication and social interaction. Family and caregivers report improvements in Ethel's social interaction. We discuss the properties of our audio-enhanced paper approach that make it a promising medium for engaging older adults and distill general design considerations for paper-digital photo albums.},

Yet within the home, digital photos are hard to access and lack the physical affordances that make sharing easy and opportunistic. To promote in-home photo sharing, we designed Souvenirs, a system that lets people link digital photo sets to physical memorabilia. These mementos trigger memories and serve as social instruments; a person can enrich their story-telling by moving the physical memento close to their large-format television screen, and the associated photos are immediately displayed. We implemented Souvenirs, and then re-examined our design premises through contextual interviews with 20 households. Families described their current practices of photo sharing and memento use, and also reacted to the Souvenirs design. Based on these interviews, we redesigned Souvenirs to better fit the real practices of photo and memento use in the home.},

Despite this, we know little about the processes by which people identify and manage mementos - objects which are directly meaningful to their memories. Among the millions of objects people encounter in a lifetime, few become such reminders of people, places or events. We report fieldwork where participants gave us a tour of their homes describing how and why particular objects become mementos. Our findings extend the existing digital memory literature; first our participants didn't view their activities as experiential 'capture', nor were mementos limited to pictorial representations of people and events; instead they included everyday objects. Furthermore, mementos were not only displayed and shared, but also integrated into everyday activities. Finally there were complex relations between house location and memento type. We discuss the theoretical and technical implications of our work.},

Jewellery often forms a cue for autobiographical memory. In this work we investigate the role that interactive technologies could play in this relationship. We first explore the way in which people record sound fragments and we present related work in the field of interactive jewellery and sonic memory cueing. The insights are used to inform the design process. The resulting concept, Memento, uses interaction scenarios inspired by the interaction with traditional lockets to activate recording and playback, and to browse through the recorded audio fragments. In order to connect object and content, Memento is a stand-alone single-purpose piece in which physical object and digital content are inseparable.},

In our study the participants watched two different panoramic (360) videos, one with relaxing content (beach clip) and second one with action content (roller coaster video clip). Videos were watched on four different head mounted displays (HMDs) and on the 2D television as a reference display. To assess VR Sickness discomfort levels, we have used the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), and for user experience the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) was used. For quick assessments of VR Sickness discomfort levels, we have also used Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). We have found a strong correlation between SUDS and total SSQ score and between total SSQ score and SSQ-D score. Shown negative correlation between VR Sickness discomfort levels (assessed by SSQ and UEQ Questionnaire), and user experience (assessed by UEQ Questionnaire), indicates that presence of VR Sickness symptoms affects the user experience.}

By leveraging bidirectional virtual-physical interactions between humans and the designed artifact, such AR-enhanced toys can provide more playful and interactive experiences for traditional toys. However, designers are constrained by the complexity and technical difficulties of the current AR content creation processes. We propose MechARspace, an immersive authoring system that supports users to create toy-AR interactions through direct manipulation and visual programming. Based on the elicitation study, we propose a bidirectional interaction model which maps both ways: from the toy inputs to reactions of AR content, and also from the AR content to the toy reactions. This model guides the design of our system which includes a plug-and-play hardware toolkit and an in-situ authoring interface. We present multiple use cases enabled by MechARspace to validate this interaction model. Finally, we evaluate our system with a two-session user study where users first recreated a set of predefined toy-AR interactions and then implemented their own AR-enhanced toy designs.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology}, articleno = {50}, numpages = {16}, keywords = {modular IoT toolkit, program by demonstration, Augmented Reality, immersive authoring}, location = {Bend, OR, USA}, series = {UIST '22} }

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies create exciting new opportunities for people to interact with computing resources and information. Less exciting is the need for holding hand controllers, which limits applications that demand expressive, readily available interactions. Prior research investigated freehand AR/VR input by transforming the user’s body into an interaction medium. In contrast to previous work that has users’ hands grasp virtual objects, we propose a new interaction technique that lets users’ hands become virtual objects by imitating the objects themselves. For example, a thumbs-up hand pose is used to mimic a joystick. We created a wide array of interaction designs around this idea to demonstrate its applicability in object retrieval and interactive control tasks. Collectively, we call these interaction designs Hand Interfaces. From a series of user studies comparing Hand Interfaces against various baseline techniques, we collected quantitative and qualitative feedback, which indicates that Hand Interfaces are effective, expressive, and fun to use.},

abstract = {Freehand gesture is an essential input modality for modern Augmented Reality (AR) user experiences. However, developing AR applications with customized hand interactions remains a challenge for end-users. Therefore, we propose GesturAR, an end-to-end authoring tool that supports users to create in-situ freehand AR applications through embodied demonstration and visual programming. During authoring, users can intuitively demonstrate the customized gesture inputs while referring to the spatial and temporal context. Based on the taxonomy of gestures in AR, we proposed a hand interaction model which maps the gesture inputs to the reactions of the AR contents. Thus, users can author comprehensive freehand applications using trigger-action visual programming and instantly experience the results in AR. Further, we demonstrate multiple application scenarios enabled by GesturAR, such as interactive virtual objects, robots, and avatars, room-level interactive AR spaces, embodied AR presentations, etc. Finally, we evaluate the performance and usability of GesturAR through a user study.},

However, the detached character interaction they propose - often using a push-button metaphor - is far from the satisfactory feeling of grasping and moving physical toys. In this paper, we propose a new interaction metaphor that reduces the gap between physical toys and virtual characters. The user moves a smartphone around, and a puppet that responds in real time to the manipulations is seen through the screen. The virtual character moves in order to follow the user gestures, as if it was attached to the phone via a rigid stick. This yields a natural interaction, similar to moving a physical toy, and the puppet now feels alive because its movements are augmented with compelling animations. Using the smartphone, our method ties together the control of the character and camera into a single interaction mechanism. We validate our system by presenting an application in Augmented Reality.},

It is tempting to believe that providing greater spatial flexibility-by moving from flat 2D to 3D user interfaces-will further enhance user performance. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the effectiveness of spatial memory in real-world physical models and in equivalent computer-based virtual systems. The different models vary the user's freedom to use depth and perspective in spatial arrangements of images representing web pages. Results show that the subjects' performance deteriorated in both the physical and virtual systems as their freedom to locate items in the third dimension increased. Subjective measures reinforce the performance measures, indicating that users found interfaces with higher dimensions more 'cluttered' and less efficient},

These studies have examined ways that people relate to physical and digital objects, observing, for example, that people tend to cherish physical objects more than digital ones. This paper proposes that the value of digital objects may inhere less in an object's identity as a particular item and more in the object's ability to provide access to an intellectual work. The work, a familiar concept in information studies and textual studies, designates a general product of intellectual creation that may be instantiated in many versions. (For example, Shakespeare's Hamlet exists in many editions and forms, which may differ in both content and carrier and yet still are all Hamlet.) The paper demonstrates how the concept of the work can extend research on the perceived value of digital objects. It also shows how a flexible definition of the work can reveal new aspects of a design situation.},

abstract = {To create photorealistic three-dimensional (3D) models of real scenes and objects is a challenging problem that demands advanced knowledge of computer vision and computer graphics. Systems that can reconstruct the 3D model of cultural artefacts have found many applications such as virtual museum and historical archiving. While there are methods for 3D digitization of cultural artefacts with high geometric resolution, there are still limitations in achieving high textural resolution for virtual exhibition. One major problem is that the object surface exhibits specular reflection of illuminated light during the acquisition of surface texture. The shading of the target object does not match to other objects or pictures in the virtual scene. Also, if texture of the object must be composed of multiple images, the mismatch of shading (radiometric difference) among the images can be very prominent. In order to create high visual quality exhibition, the specular reflections must be eliminated and then the virtual scene is relit by a synthetic light source. Most existing methods for the identification and removal of specular reflection component demand special device or rely on information obtained in a single image. In order to reconstruct a complete 3D model, we need to acquire a multi-view image sequence. We therefore propose a new method that is applicable for the separation of diffuse and specular reflection components in multi-view image sequence. Also, our method can tackle the specular reflection across the texture boundary. The image sequence is first normalized by the estimated illumination color. Based on the dichromatic reflection model, the specular chromaticity is replaced by the corresponding diffuse chromaticity, which can always be found in neighboring views with the highlights already faded away. We test the new method in modeling Yixing ceramic teapots. The shape model of the teapot is obtained by a laser scanner. The diffuse image sequence is then used to generate the texture map. We create the virtual scene with the photorealistic 3D teapot model, some synthetic 3D models and still pictures. Interactive exhibition of the artefact is achieved with the control of the mouse and simple keyboard commands. This paper gives an account of the procedures for the creation of interactive virtual exhibition of ceramic artefacts.}

Practices around digital photography have changed along with advances in media sharing technologies such as smartphones, social media, and mobile connectivity. Although much research was done at the start of digital photography, commercially available tools for media-supported shared remembering still have many limitations. The objective of our research is to explore spatial and material design directions to better support the use of personal photos for collocated shared remembering. In this paper, we present seven design requirements that resulted from a redesign workshop with fifteen participants, and four design concepts (two spatial, two material) that we developed based on those requirements.

However, little research has addressed the challenges of tailoring these qualities for everyday interactions with a shape-changing artifact. In this paper, we report from a designer-researcher perspective into the crafting of deformTable: a shape-changing form that responds to the weight of objects placed on its surface. We crafted 5 deformTables over 18 months with special attention given to the physical, temporal, and computational aspects. Specifically, we describe how we focused on speed adjustments and response times in the process to frame the temporal expressions of computing; we also discuss how the material and tools helped shape our decisions in the context of the materiality of computing. This study contributes an RtD case of designing a particular shape-changing artifact through the lens of temporality and materiality to support long-term engagements and everyday interactions.},

abstract = {Reminiscing is a valuable activity that people of all ages spontaneously and informally partake in as part of their everyday lives. This paper discusses the design and use of Pensieve, a system that supports everyday reminiscence by emailing memory triggers to people that contain either social media content they previously created on third-party websites or text prompts about common life experiences. We discuss how the literature on reminiscence informed Pensieve's design, then analyze data from 91 users over five months. We find that people value spontaneous reminders to reminisce as well as the ability to write about their reminiscing. Shorter, more general triggers draw more responses, as do triggers containing people's own photos-although responses to photos tended to contain more metadata elements than storytelling elements. We compare these results to data from a second, Pensieve-like system developed for Facebook, and suggest a number of important aspects to consider for both designers and researchers around technology and reminiscence.},

abstract = {The Reflexive Printer is a physical artifact combined with a mobile application. It allows digital-photo natives to enrich their experiences of daily reminiscence. Each day, the system takes one picture from a user's smartphone album, prints it on thermal paper as a halftone image, and deletes it from the smartphone. With a critical lens, we reframe technology-mediated reminiscence as an intersubjective interaction between human and artifact. In this mutually informed relationship, we propose perceived drawbacks as a design quality for provoking the critical sensibilities of users and engaging them in transgressing the normality of digital photo consumption. We focus our design thinking on three themes: simple materiality and monological performance, fast consumption and slow rumination, and powerful artifact and feeble user. This paper describes the initial lessons that we have learned through this critical making process and highlights several insights that HCI communities can leverage in the future.},

abstract = {Snapping photos or videos on a smartphone makes recording visual memories convenient, but what isn't captured may still be meaningful in retrospect. In this paper, digital mementos are automatically generated for participants using the Rewind system, which assists the recall of location-based minutiae. Rewind is a video-like medium describing people's daily excursions using a sequence of street-level images determined by self-tracked location data. The Rewinds are color-processed to reflect seasonal, time-of-day and weather characteristics. Through two user studies with a combined 40 users, Rewinds were shown to be used as memory artifacts, and are especially meaningful in the many situations when photos or videos are not available. The small cues in Rewinds evoke longer fragments of memory tied to nostalgic routines or significant events, and the sequence of images provide a first-person perspective of remembrance for users. While they are more generic and can possess inaccuracies, Rewinds give people anchors for memories that feel like their own that are used to craft a narrative for that day. Rewind strikes a balance between automatic logging and manually-curated memories by personalizing it in meaningful visuals and consolidating an otherwise overwhelming amount of data.},

Personal location history archives offer a potentially valuable and overlooked resource for supporting reminiscence and recollection of the past. Yet, little design research has explored how location histories can be used as a material in designing such experiences. To investigate this space, we engaged in a practice-based design research process that resulted in two design artifacts. Memory Tracer is a tangible device that occasionally, yet perpetually surfaces locations from the past bound to today's date. Memory Compass is a smartwatch application that uses a ‘casting’ interaction enabling a user to retrieve and explore locations from their past, across space and time. We unpack and reflect on key decisions in our design process and conclude with opportunities for future HCI research and practice.},

abstract = {Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) are emerging as a new paradigm of interaction with the digital world aiming at facilitating traditional GUI-based interaction. Interaction with TUIs relies on users' existing skills of interaction with the real world [9], thereby offering the promise of interfaces that are quicker to learn and easier to use. Recently it has been demonstrated [1] that the use of personal objects as tangible interfaces will be even more straightforward since users already have a mental model associated to the physical objects thus facilitating the comprehension and usage modalities of that objects. However TUIs are currently very challenging to build and this limits their widespread diffusion and exploitation. In order to address this issue we propose a user-oriented framework, called Memodules Framework, which allows the easy creation and management of Personal TUIs, providing end users with the ability of dynamically configuring and reconfiguring their TUIs. The framework is based on a model, called MemoML (Memodules Markup Language), which guarantees framework flexibility, extensibility and evolution over time.},

In collaboration with elders in living facilities, we designed the Memory Music Box; a low-threshold platform to increase connectedness. The HCI community has contributed notable research in support of elders through monitoring, tracking and memory augmentation. Despite the Information and Communication Technologies field (ICT) advances in providing new opportunities for connection, challenges in accessibility increase the gap between elders and their loved ones. We approach this challenge by embedding a familiar form factor with innovative applications, performing design evaluations with our key target group to incorporate multi-iteration learnings. These findings culminate in a novel design that facilitates elders in crossing technology and communication barriers. Based on these findings, we discuss how future inclusive technologies for the older adults' can balance ease of use, subtlety and elements of Cognitively Sustainable Design.},

To conquer these problems and to make personalized souvenirs a part of the visiting experience, we create a hybrid tangible Augmented Reality(AR) souvenir that combines a physical firework launcher and AR models. An application called AR Firework is designed for customizing the hybrid souvenir as well as interactive learning in an exhibition in the wild. Multiple interaction methods including mobile user interface, hand gestures, and voice are adopted to create a multi-sensory product. As the first research to propose tangible AR souvenirs, we find that they establish a long-lasting connection between visitors and their personal visiting experiences.

To move beyond this, a fundamental challenge for photoware consists of developing support for the practical achievement of sharing 'at a distance'. Specifically, this entails augmenting the natural production of accounts or 'photo-talk' to support the distributed achievement of sharing.},

As several studies into cherished objects have shown, we have more difficulties identifying cherished digital objects than physical ones. However, cherishing a small collection of digital objects can be beneficial; e.g. it can encourage active selection of digital objects to keep and discard. This paper presents a study that aimed to increase understanding of cherished physical and digital objects, and beyond that, of how we perceive physical and digital objects, and their advantages and disadvantages. We identified design opportunities for novel products and systems that support the creation of more cherishable digital objects by extrapolating the advantages of the physical to the digital, exploiting the reasons for cherishing digital objects, and aiming for meaningful integrations of physical and digital.},

Motivated by challenges that existing technology approaches encountered for improving intergenerational storytelling (e.g., the need to hold the tablet, the potential view detachment from the physical world in Virtual Reality (VR)), we sought to find new ways of using Augmented Reality (AR) to support intergenerational storytelling, which offers new capabilities (e.g., 3D models, new interactivity) to enhance the expression for the storyteller. We conducted a two-part exploratory study, where pairs of grandparents and grandchildren 1) participated in an in-person storytelling activity with a semi-structured interview 2) and then a participatory design session with AR technology probes that we designed to inspire their exploration. Our findings revealed insights into the possible ways of intergenerational storytelling, the feasibility and usages of AR in facilitating it, and the key design implications for leveraging AR in intergenerational storytelling.},

We present the design, prototyping and evaluation (n = 6) of a virtual visit to a historic graveyard. The Salla World War II graveyard is located in an inaccessible border zone between Finland and Russia. Our virtual graveyard, accessed through a head mounted display, aimed to create an as accurate as possible simulation of the Salla graveyard, including its atmosphere. Users are enabled to navigate the virtual graveyard and place a candle on a grave. Although the simulation was considered immersive, participants wished for more authenticity and details, e.g. being able to light the virtual candle. The work opens discussion on the need for dignity in the design of virtual experiences for sensitive cultural heritage sites.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of environmental features such as visual realism on spatial memory can inform a human-centered design of virtual environments. This paper investigates the effects of visual realism on object location memory in virtual reality, taking account of individual differences, gaze, and locomotion. Participants freely explored two environments which varied in visual realism, and then recalled the locations of objects by returning the misplaced objects back to original locations. Overall, we did not find a significant relationship between visual realism and object location memory. We found, however, that individual differences such as spatial ability and gender accounted for more variance than visual realism. Gaze and locomotion analysis suggest that participants exhibited longer gaze duration and more clustered movement patterns in the low realism condition. Preliminary inspection further found that locomotion hotspots coincided with objects that showed a significant gaze time difference between high and low visual realism levels. These results suggest that high visual realism still provides positive spatial learning affordances but the effects are more intricate.},

abstract = {In immersive environments, positioning data visualisations around the user in a wraparound layout has been advocated as advantageous over flat arrangements more typical of traditional screens. However, other than limiting the distance users must walk, there is no clear design rationale behind this common practice, and little research on the impact of wraparound layouts on visualisation tasks. The ability to remember the spatial location of elements of visualisations within the display space is crucial to support visual analytical tasks, especially those that require users to shift their focus or perform comparisons. This ability is influenced by the user's spatial memory but how spatial memory is affected by different display layouts remains unclear. In this paper, we perform two user studies to evaluate the effects of three layouts with varying degrees of curvature around the user (flat-wall, semicircular-wraparound, and circular-wraparound) on a visuo-spatial memory task in a virtual environment. The results show that participants are able to recall spatial patterns with greater accuracy and report more positive subjective ratings using flat than circular-wraparound layouts. While we didn't find any significant performance differences between the flat and semicircular-wraparound layouts, participants overwhelmingly preferred the semicircular-wraparound layout suggesting it is a good compromise between the two extremes of display curvature.},

Older adults spend much time collecting mementos but spend less time telling stories behind the mementos. Once they pass away, stories behind mementos vanish with their owners. In this paper, we present Slots-Memento, a tangible device aiming to facilitate intergenerational story sharing and preservation for older adults. It builds on the metaphor of slot-machine, and integrates functions of memento photo display, story recording, and preservation. Our design process started with context inquiry, older adults and young adults were recruited, aiming to understand the status quo of their memento storytelling, and define design requirements. A preliminary evaluation was conducted, discussion and future work are in the final part.},

abstract = {Humans easily miss events in their surroundings due to limited short-term memory and field of view. This happens, for example, while watching an instructor's machine repair demonstration or conversing during a sports game. We present RealityReplay, a novel Mixed Reality (MR) approach that tracks and visualizes these significant events using in-situ MR visualizations without modifying the physical space. It requires only a head-mounted MR display and a 360-degree camera. We contribute a method for egocentric tracking of important motion events in users' surroundings based on a combination of semantic segmentation and saliency prediction, and generating in-situ MR visual summaries of temporal changes. These summary visualizations are overlaid onto the physical world to reveal which objects moved, in what order, and their trajectory, enabling users to observe previously hidden events. The visualizations are informed by a formative study comparing different styles on their effects on users' perception of temporal changes. Our evaluation shows that RealityReplay significantly enhances sensemaking of temporal motion events compared to memory-based recall. We demonstrate application scenarios in guidance, education, and observation, and discuss implications for extending human spatiotemporal capabilities through technological augmentation.},

abstract = {Mixed Reality is gaining interest as a platform for collaboration and focused work to a point where it may supersede current office settings in future workplaces. At the same time, we expect that interaction with physical objects and face-to-face communication will remain crucial for future work environments, which is a particular challenge in fully immersive Virtual Reality. In this work, we reconcile those requirements through a user’s individual Asynchronous Reality, which enables seamless physical interaction across time. When a user is unavailable, e.g., focused on a task or in a call, our approach captures co-located or remote physical events in real-time, constructs a causality graph of co-dependent events, and lets immersed users revisit them at a suitable time in a causally accurate way. Enabled by our system AsyncReality, we present a workplace scenario that includes walk-in interruptions during a person’s focused work, physical deliveries, and transient spoken messages. We then generalize our approach to a use-case agnostic concept and system architecture. We conclude by discussing the implications of Asynchronous Reality for future offices.},

abstract = {In video meetings, individuals may wish to share various physical objects with remote participants, such as physical documents, design prototypes, and personal belongings. However, our formative study discovered that this poses several challenges, including difficulties in referencing a remote user’s physical objects, the limited visibility of the object, and the friction of properly framing and orienting an object to the camera. To address these challenges, we propose ThingShare, a video-conferencing system designed to facilitate the sharing of physical objects during remote meetings. With ThingShare, users can quickly create digital copies of physical objects in the video feeds, which can then be magnified on a separate panel for focused viewing, overlaid on the user’s video feed for sharing in context, and stored in the object drawer for reviews. Our user study demonstrated that ThingShare made initiating object-centric conversations more efficient and provided a more stable and comprehensive view of shared objects.},

abstract = {As 3D content becomes increasingly prevalent, there’s a growing focus on the development of engagements with 3D virtual content. Unfortunately, traditional techniques for creating, editing, and interacting with this content are fraught with difficulties. They tend to be not only engineering-intensive but also require extensive expertise, which adds to the frustration and inefficiency in virtual object manipulation. Our proposed VR-GS system represents a leap forward in human-centered 3D content interaction, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience. By developing a physical dynamics-aware interactive Gaussian Splatting (GS) in a Virtual Reality (VR) setting, and constructing a highly efficient two-level embedding strategy alongside deformable body simulations, VR-GS ensures real-time execution with highly realistic dynamic responses. The components of our system are designed for high efficiency and effectiveness, starting from detailed scene reconstruction and object segmentation, advancing through multi-view image in-painting, and extending to interactive physics-based editing. The system also incorporates real-time deformation embedding and dynamic shadow casting, ensuring a comprehensive and engaging virtual experience.},

abstract = {With recent advances in Generative AI, it is becoming easier to automatically manipulate 3D models. However, current methods tend to apply edits to models globally, which risks compromising the intended functionality of the 3D model when fabricated in the physical world. For example, modifying functional segments in 3D models, such as the base of a vase, could break the original functionality of the model, thus causing the vase to fall over. We introduce a method for automatically segmenting 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. This method allows users to selectively modify aesthetic segments of 3D models, without affecting the functional segments. To develop this method we first create a taxonomy of functionality in 3D models by qualitatively analyzing 1000 models sourced from a popular 3D printing repository, Thingiverse. With this taxonomy, we develop a semi-automatic classification method to decompose 3D models into functional and aesthetic elements. We propose a system called Style2Fab that allows users to selectively stylize 3D models without compromising their functionality. We evaluate the effectiveness of our classification method compared to human-annotated data, and demonstrate the utility of Style2Fab with a user study to show that functionality-aware segmentation helps preserve model functionality.},

This reduces primary task (e.g., travel) enjoyment and hinders high-quality writing. Through formative study and iterative development, we introduce PANDALens, a Proactive AI Narrative Documentation Assistant built on an Optical See-Through Head Mounted Display that supports personalized documentation in everyday activities. PANDALens observes multimodal contextual information from user behaviors and environment to confirm interests and elicit contemplation, and employs Large Language Models to transform such multimodal information into coherent narratives with significantly reduced user effort. A real-world travel scenario comparing PANDALens with a smartphone alternative confirmed its effectiveness in improving writing quality and travel enjoyment while minimizing user effort. Accordingly, we propose design guidelines for AI-assisted in-context writing, highlighting the potential of transforming them from tools to intelligent companions.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of avatar realism on embodiment and social interactions in Virtual Reality (VR). We compared abstract avatar representations based on a wooden mannequin with high fidelity avatars generated from photogrammetry 3D scan methods. Both avatar representations were alternately applied to participating users and to the virtual counterpart in dyadic social encounters to examine the impact of avatar realism on self-embodiment and social interaction quality. Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users' avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users' avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others' avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO). There also was some indication of a potential uncanny valley. Additionally, there was an indication that the appearance of the others' avatars impacts the self-perception of the users.},

In this literature survey, first, “visual affordances” are focused on and current state-of-the-art approaches for solving relevant problems as well as open problems and research gaps are summarized. Then, sub-problems, such as affordance detection, categorization, segmentation, and high-level affordance reasoning, are specifically discussed. Furthermore, functional scene understanding and its prevalent descriptors used in the literature are covered. This survey also provides the necessary background to the problem, sheds light on its significance, and highlights the existing challenges for affordance and functionality learning.},

abstract = {Asymmetric AR/VR collaboration systems bring a remote VR user to a local AR user’s physical environment, allowing them to communicate and work within a shared virtual/physical space. Such systems often display the remote environment through 3D reconstructions or 360° videos. While 360° cameras stream an environment in higher quality, they lack spatial information, making them less interactable. We present VirtualNexus, an AR/VR collaboration system that enhances 360° video AR/VR collaboration with environment cutouts and virtual replicas. VR users can define cutouts of the remote environment to interact with as a world-in-miniature, and their interactions are synchronized to the local AR perspective. Furthermore, AR users can rapidly scan and share 3D virtual replicas of physical objects using neural rendering. We demonstrated our system’s utility through 3 example applications and evaluated our system in a dyadic usability test. VirtualNexus extends the interaction space of 360° telepresence systems, offering improved physical presence, versatility, and clarity in interactions.},

abstract = {During remote communication, participants share both digital and physical content, such as product designs, digital assets, and environments, to enhance mutual understanding. Recent advances in augmented communication have facilitated users to swiftly create and share digital 2D copies of physical objects from video feeds into a shared space. However, the conventional 2D representation of digital objects restricts users’ ability to spatially reference items in a shared immersive environment. To address these challenges, we propose Thing2Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) communication platform designed to enhance spontaneous discussions regarding both digital and physical items during remote sessions. With Thing2Reality, users can quickly materialize ideas or physical objects in an immersive environment and share them as conditioned multiview renderings or 3D Gaussians. Our system enables users to interact with remote objects or discuss concepts in a collaborative manner.},

abstract = {Seamless integration of physical objects as interactive digital entities remains a challenge for spatial computing. This paper explores Augmented Object Intelligence&nbsp; (AOI) in the context of XR, an interaction paradigm that aims to blur the lines between digital and physical by equipping real-world objects with the ability to interact as if they were digital, where every object has the potential to serve as a portal to digital functionalities. Our approach utilizes real-time object segmentation and classification, combined with the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to facilitate these interactions without the need for object pre-registration. We implement the AOI concept in the form of XR-Objects, an open-source prototype system that provides a platform for users to engage with their physical environment in contextually relevant ways using object-based context menus. This system enables analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying for details or executing tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we define the AOI concept and detail its advantages over traditional AI assistants, (2) detail the XR-Objects&nbsp; system’s open-source design and implementation, and (3) show its versatility through various use cases and a user study.},

We present ControlMat, a method which, given a single photograph with uncontrolled illumination as input, conditions a diffusion model to generate plausible, tileable, high-resolution physically-based digital materials. We carefully analyze the behavior of diffusion models for multi-channel outputs, adapt the sampling process to fuse multi-scale information and introduce rolled diffusion to enable both tileability and patched diffusion for high-resolution outputs. Our generative approach further permits exploration of a variety of materials that could correspond to the input image, mitigating the unknown lighting conditions. We show that our approach outperforms recent inference and latent-space optimization methods, and we carefully validate our diffusion process design choices.1},

They provide accurate haptic feedback and easy-to-track features for camera systems, making them an ideal basis for Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) in Augmented Reality (AR). We introduce Ubi Edge, an AR authoring tool that allows end-users to customize edges on daily objects as TUI inputs to control varied digital functions. We develop an integrated AR-device and an integrated vision-based detection pipeline that can track 3D edges and detect the touch interaction between fingers and edges. Leveraging the spatial-awareness of AR, users can simply select an edge by sliding fingers along it and then make the edge interactive by connecting it to various digital functions. We demonstrate four use cases including multi-function controllers, smart homes, games, and TUI-based tutorials. We also evaluated and proved our system’s usability through a two-session user study, where qualitative and quantitative results are positive.},
