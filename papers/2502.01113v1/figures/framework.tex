    \caption{The detailed framework of \ourmethod and training processes of graph foundation model. The \ourmethod consists of three main components: A. \emph{KG-index construction}, which constructs a knowledge graph index from document corpus (\tikzmarknode[mycircled,mypurple]{a1}{1}); B. \emph{graph foundation model retriever} (GFM retriever), which is pre-trained on large-scale datasets and could retrieve documents based on any user query and KG-index (\tikzmarknode[mycircled,mypurple]{a2}{2}\tikzmarknode[mycircled,mypurple]{a3}{3}); and C. \emph{documents ranking and answer generation}, which ranks retrieved documents and generates final answer (\tikzmarknode[mycircled,mypurple]{a4}{4}\tikzmarknode[mycircled,mypurple]{a5}{5}).
