\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce the first graph foundation model for retrieval augmented generation. By leveraging the knowledge graph index, \ourmethod explicitly models the complex relationships between knowledge and documents, facilitating a more effective and efficient retrieval process. Powered by a query-dependent GNN pre-trained on large-scale datasets, \ourmethod can effectively perform multi-hop reasoning over the graph structure to find relevant knowledge in a single step. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets and seven domain-specific datasets demonstrate that \ourmethod significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability. Its alignment with scaling laws also suggests the potential for scaling to even larger datasets. In the future, we plan to conduct larger-scale training and further explore \ourmethod's capabilities in other challenging scenarios such as knowledge graph completion and question answering.
