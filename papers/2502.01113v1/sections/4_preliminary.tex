\section{Preliminary}\label{sec:preliminary}
Given a set of documents $\gD=\{D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_{|\gD|}\}$, we can construct a knowledge graph $\gG=\{(e,r,e')\in \gE\times\gR\times\gE\}$, where $e\in\gE$ and $r\in\gR$ denote the set of entities and relations extracted from $\gD$, respectively. 

\noindent\textbf{GraphRAG Framework.} 
Given a user query $q$, we aim to design a graph-enhanced retriever to obtain relevant documents from $\gD$ by leveraging the knowledge graph $\gG$. The whole GraphRAG process  can be formulated as:
\begin{gather}
    \gG = \text{Construct}(\gD), \\ \gD^K = \text{Graph-retriever}(q,\gD,\gG),\\
    a = \text{LLM}(q,\gD^K),
\end{gather}
where $\gD^K$ denotes the top-$K$ retrieved documents and $a$ denotes the final answer generated by large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we design a novel graph retriever, a GFM retriever, which will be described in detail next.
