\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

While our benchmark represents a significant step toward integrating LLMs into materials synthesis, several limitations remain. First, the dataset, derived from open-access articles, may exhibit biases in domain coverage, overrepresenting fields like battery materials while underrepresenting others like biomaterials. Second, GPT-4o for recipe extraction and evaluation introduces potential inaccuracies and biases, particularly in complex or ambiguous texts. Third, while practical, reliance on LLM-based scoring may oversimplify the nuanced requirements of tasks like procedure generation and characterization prediction. Additionally, the sequential dependencies between tasks (e.g., precursor prediction influencing procedure generation) pose challenges for current models, which may overfit dataset-specific patterns rather than learning generalizable principles. Finally, the lack of interpretability in model outputs limits their applicability in critical experimental workflows. Addressing these issues through improved data curation, expanded evaluation frameworks, and developing more interpretable models will be vital for future progress in this domain.
