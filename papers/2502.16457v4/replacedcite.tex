\paragraph*{Materials Synthesis Datasets}

Existing materials synthesis datasets, such as those focusing on solid-state____ and solution-based____ methods, have provided valuable resources for machine learning applications. However, these datasets often suffer from issues of incompleteness and low quality, with many synthesis procedures lacking critical parameters necessary for reproducibility or predictive modeling. For instance, only 28\% of solid-state synthesis paragraphs yield complete reactions, and over 90\% of recipes are missing key parameters. These limitations hinder their utility in guiding novel synthesis workflows.

\paragraph*{LLM-based Generation for Materials Science}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating materials discovery by automating hypothesis generation____, property prediction____, and evaluation____. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and the need for retrieving or fine-tuning to handle complex synthesis workflows. Our work addresses these gaps and introduces a large-scale dataset and benchmark tailored to the real-world synthesis workflow, enabling rigorous evaluation of LLM capabilities in materials science.
