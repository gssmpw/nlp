Materials synthesis is vital for innovations such as energy storage, catalysis, electronics, and biomedical devices. Yet, the process relies heavily on empirical, trial-and-error methods guided by expert intuition. Our work aims to support the materials science community by providing a practical, data-driven resource. We have curated a comprehensive dataset of 17K expert-verified synthesis recipes from open-access literature, which forms the basis of our newly developed benchmark, AlchemyBench.
AlchemyBench offers an end-to-end framework that supports research in large language models applied to synthesis prediction. It encompasses key tasks, including raw materials and equipment prediction, synthesis procedure generation, and characterization outcome forecasting. We propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that leverages large language models for automated evaluation, demonstrating strong statistical agreement with expert assessments.
Overall, our contributions offer a supportive foundation for exploring the capabilities of LLMs in predicting and guiding materials synthesis, ultimately paving the way for more efficient experimental design and accelerated innovation in materials science.


% Materials synthesis is a fundamental process in science and engineering but relies mainly on trial-and-error approaches, limiting the pace of discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce a large-scale dataset curated from open-access scientific literature, systematically capturing synthesis recipes with detailed information on raw materials, equipment, procedures, and characterization methods. Using this dataset, we design a benchmark to evaluate NLP models on critical synthesis tasks, including predicting raw materials and proportions for target materials, identifying required equipment, generating synthesis procedures, and recommending characterization methods. \hist{바로 앞 문장의 detailed information on xxx 랑 많이 겹치는 듯}
% This benchmark provides a robust evaluation framework for NLP applications in materials science, enabling systematic assessment and development of predictive models. Our results with baseline models highlight both the potential and challenges of applying machine learning to diverse synthesis workflows. By bridging NLP and materials science, this work lays the foundation for data-driven materials design and discovery advancements, fostering interdisciplinary innovation.
