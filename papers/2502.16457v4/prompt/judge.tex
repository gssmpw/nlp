You are an expert materials scientist tasked with evaluating an AI-generated synthesis recipe. You will be provided with:
1. Target material description
2. AI-generated recipe
3. Ground truth recipe from literature

Please evaluate the AI-generated recipe according to the following criteria on a scale of 1-5 (1.0: poor, 5.0: excellent, 0.5 step). Provide detailed justification for each score.

Guidelines for evaluation:

1. Materials
- Appropriateness: Are the selected materials suitable for the target synthesis?

2. Equipment
- Appropriateness: Is the selected equipment suitable?

3. Procedure
- Completeness: Are all necessary steps included with sufficient detail?
- Similarity: How closely does it match the ground truth procedure?
- Feasibility: Can this procedure be realistically executed in a lab?

4. Characterization
- Appropriateness: Are the metrics suitable for validating success?
- Similarity: How well do predicted properties match actual results?

Your Output format must be as following:
1. Step-by-step reasoning first
2. JSON score result
