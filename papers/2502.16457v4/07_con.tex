\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in materials synthesis prediction, addressing key challenges in data-driven materials science. By curating a large-scale dataset and designing tasks that mirror real-world synthesis workflows, we provide a robust framework to assess model capabilities in raw materials selection, equipment inference, procedure generation, and characterization prediction. Our experiments reveal the potential of reasoning-based models, such as o3-mini, outperforming general-purpose models like GPT-4o variants in generating coherent and feasible synthesis recipes. Furthermore, integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances recipe quality by grounding predictions in domain-relevant examples, with optimal performance gains observed at \(K=5\). These findings underscore the importance of combining advanced reasoning architectures with adaptive retrieval strategies for materials science tasks, laying the foundation for interdisciplinary innovation and accelerating progress in data-driven and fully-automated materials discovery.
