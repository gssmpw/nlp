\begin{abstract}

A large number of studies rely on closed-style multiple-choice surveys to evaluate cultural alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge this constrained evaluation paradigm and explore more realistic, unconstrained approaches. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions as case studies, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit stronger cultural alignment in less constrained settings, where responses are not forced. Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering survey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of closed-style evaluations. Our findings advocate for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies, encouraging more nuanced and accurate assessments of cultural alignment in LLMs.

\section{Introduction}

To fully unlock the potential of artificial intelligence and achieve the vision of \textit{``AI for All''}, it is essential to design and develop the Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on inclusivity and relevance across diverse societies and cultures \citep{adilazuarda2024towards}. However, the recent advancements in language models have faced significant criticism for predominantly reflecting Western perspectives \citep{durmus2023towards} and displaying pronounced biases toward \textit{Anglocentric} or \textit{American} cultural norms \citep{johnson2022ghost, dwivedi2023eticor}. Such biases pose serious risks, including the stereotyping and alienation of users from underrepresented communities due to a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding \citep{cao2022theory}. Addressing this issue begins with identifying and understanding the problem. This raises a critical question: to what extent do current LLMs align with the diverse cultural contexts worldwide, and how can this alignment be systematically evaluated?

    \label{fig:cul_align}
\end{figure}
A significant body of research has utilized closed-style value questionnaires and surveys, such as the World Values Survey (WVS) \citep{Haerpfer2024}, Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions \citep{hofstede2010cultures} or Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW)\footnote{\url{https://www.pewresearch.org/}}. These surveys are part of globally recognized research initiatives aimed at investigating people's values and beliefs and they usually structure culture into various dimensions and employ closed-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for data collection. In the context of measuring cultural alignment in LLMs, NLP studies have leveraged these frameworks by probing LLMs with questions derived from the cultural dimensions outlined in these surveys \citep{cao2023assessing, arora-etal-2023-probing}. To assess cultural understanding, researchers compare the responses of LLMs to those of actual survey participants, which serve as the reference or gold standard. The similarity between the model's responses and the actual survey responses is then measured to evaluate the model's cultural alignment and its ability to reflect cultural nuances \citep{masoud2023cultural}. 

While these surveys provide a quantifiable framework for measuring cultural values, a significant limitation of using closed-style MCQ-based surveys for evaluating LLMs lies in their potential to oversimplify complex cultural phenomena. These surveys often fail to capture the intricate nuances of cultural values, as respondents are restricted to predefined answer choices \citep{beugelsdijk2018dimensions}. Furthermore, MCQ-based surveys tend to emphasize surface-level knowledge rather than deeper cognitive processes, raising concerns about their suitability for assessing a multifaceted concept like culture \citep{butler2018multiple, hershcovich2022challenges}. Prior research has also demonstrated that LLMs can be sensitive to the order of options in multiple-choice questions, which may result in biased responses \citep{pezeshkpour2023large}. Moreover, \citet{bravansky2025rethinking, rottger2024political} highlights significant discrepancies between LLM responses in MCQ-based assessments and the values expressed during unconstrained interactions in global opinion surveys. Given these findings, it is essential to critically examine whether closed-style surveys, such as WVS and Hofstede's frameworks, serve as accurate proxies for evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs.


To address this question, we build on prior research and present new findings demonstrating how LLMs exhibit varying levels of cultural alignment depending on the degree of constraint in the probing method (Figure \ref{fig:cul_align}). Additionally, we show how even subtle changes in the probing approach can significantly impact this alignment. Our analysis focuses on the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions, two widely utilized frameworks for evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs (e.g., \citet{lindahl2023unveiling, wang2023not, tao2024cultural, cao2023assessing}).

We begin by conducting a systematic review of prominent academic resources, including Google Scholar, arXiv, and the ACL Anthology. We identify over 20 studies published in 2023 and 2024 that utilize the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede's cultural framework employing a closed-style multiple-choice format. A detailed analysis of these works, along with their methodologies and findings, is provided in Appendix \ref{sec:back_study}. Building on this foundational review, we design and execute a series of experiments, making the following key contributions:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-4pt, topsep=-2pt]
    \item We design a probing methodology consisting of four techniques: forced closed-style, forced reverse order, forced open-ended, and fully unconstrained to evaluate the cultural alignment of LLMs across varying levels of constraints.
    \item We demonstrate that closed-style questions alone are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating LLMs for cultural alignment, as unconstrained prompts often yield richer and more insightful responses and exhibit stronger alignment across cultures.
    \item We show that LLM responses vary significantly depending on the level of constraint in the probing method, even with re-ordering of answer choices.
\end{itemize}

Based on our findings, we discuss the need to rethink evaluation methodologies and offer insights for cultural alignment in LLMs to better capture user behaviors in real-world applications.

\end{figure*}


\section{Method}

We utilize the World Values Survey (WVS) \citep{Haerpfer2024} and Hofstede's Value Survey Module (VSM) for six cultural dimensions \citep{hofstede2010cultures} to conduct our analysis, focusing on three countries: Bangladesh, Germany, and the USA. 




\subsection{World Values Survey}

The World Values Survey (WVS) \citep{Haerpfer2024}  is a global research initiative consisting of approximately 250 questions, organized into 14 thematic sections covering topics such as social values, stereotypes, societal well-being, and economic values. Political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel analyzed WVS data and identified two key dimensions of cross-cultural variation: \textbf{Traditional versus Secular-rational} values and \textbf{Survival versus Self-expression} values. These dimensions are derived through a factor analysis of $10$ indicators presented in Table \ref{tab:wvs_ten_ques}. Though these indicators represent only a subset of beliefs and values, they effectively capture critical aspects of cultural variation. We adopt these $10$ closed-style indicators/questions as our first probing corpus. 



\subsection{Hofstede Cultural Dimensions}

The Hofstede Cultural Dimensions \citep{hofstede2010cultures} consists of 24 multiple-choice questions designed to analyze six cultural dimensions: Power Distance \texttt{(pdi)}, Individualism \texttt{(idv)}, Uncertainty Avoidance \texttt{(uai)}, Masculinity \texttt{(mas)}, Long-term Orientation \texttt{(lto)}, and Indulgence \texttt{(ivr)}. Each cultural dimension is calculated using a combination of four specific questions from the set of $24$. For our analysis, we adopt this set of $24$ questions presented in Table \ref{tab:hofstede_ques_forced} as the second probing corpus.



\subsection{Probing Methods}\label{sec:probing_methods}

Building on the methodology of \citet{rottger2024political}, we implement four distinct probing techniques:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-4pt, topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Forced Closed-Style (FC)}: The model is required to select an answer from the predefined options provided in the original WVS and Hofstede questionnaires.

    \item \textbf{Forced Reverse Order (FR)}: The original order of the survey options is reversed. For questions in WVS that contain Likert scales, we reversed the options in the scale. An example can be found in Figure \ref{fig:probing_method}. 

    \item \textbf{Forced Open-Ended (FO)}: Closed-style questions are rephrased as open-ended scenarios, eliminating predefined options. The LLMs are explicitly instructed to \textit{``Take a clear stance on the issue''}, compelling the model to articulate a definitive opinion.  

    \item \textbf{Fully Unconstrained (FU)}: Similar to the forced open-ended setting, the model is presented with open-ended propositions but is further encouraged to produce more flexible and creative responses by including the prompt, \textit{``Feel free to express yourself.''} \\
\end{enumerate}
Throughout the paper, we refer to the first two probing methods (FC \& FR) as `closed-style' and the remaining two (FO \& FU) as `less constrained' or `unconstrained' methods. 

We concatenate \textit{Anthropological Prompting} \citep{alkhamissi2024investigating} before each probing, which grounds questions in anthropological contexts by guiding the model to think as if actively participating in the method.The authors identified six demographic dimensions and empirically found that optimal cultural alignment occurs with the following specific attributes: \texttt{Region}: Country-Specific, \texttt{Sex}: Male, \texttt{Age}: $<50$, \texttt{Social Class}: Upper/Lower Middle Class, \texttt{Education Level}: Higher, and \texttt{Marital Status}: Married.We adopt this configuration to allow our models the best opportunity to align with the cultural contexts under study.
Our complete probing methodology is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:probing_method}, using one example question from both the WVS and Hofstede surveys.

A comprehensive description of the two frameworks, WVS and Hofstede, as well as all the prompts used for the four probing methods, can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_wvs} and \ref{apendix:hofstede}.


\subsection{Country \& Langugage Selection} \label{sec:country_selection}

To ensure a robust analysis of cross-cultural differences, we select countries based on their positions on the Inglehart-Welzel World Cultural Map \footnote{\url{www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSNewsShow.jsp?ID=467}}, which is structured around two key dimensions: Traditional versus Secular-rational values and Survival versus Self-expression values. This method allows us to capture contrasting cultural orientations while ensuring the availability of ground truth data for validation. Additionally, we prompt language models in both English and the native languages of the selected countries to enhance cultural alignment and correlate results with survey findings \citep{cao2023assessing}.
Based on these criteria, we select Bangladesh, Germany, and the USA. Bangladesh represents a society deeply rooted in Traditional and Survival values, while Germany aligns strongly with Secular-rational and Self-expression values. To provide a reference point, we include the USA, as it is frequently used in cross-cultural studies and because large language models (LLMs) often exhibit bias toward American culture \citep{johnson2022ghost}. The USA also occupies the Secular-rational and Self-expression dimension, similar to Germany on the Inglehart-Welzel map.
For Bangladesh and Germany, we source survey questions in Bengali and German from the official survey websites, which provide translations in numerous languages. We assume English to be the native language of the USA in our study.


\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Models} 
For our experiments, we evaluate five recent open-source and proprietary LLMs: \texttt{GPT-4o (v2024-08-06)}, \texttt{GPT-4 (v0125-preview)}, \texttt{Llama-3.3 (70B)}, \texttt{Mistral Large 2 (v2407 123B)}, and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1 (671B)}. We prompt all the LLMs using the four aforementioned prompting techniques, in both English and the native languages of the cultures studied. In all experiments, we used a temperature of
$0.7$ and a top-p value of $1$.

\subsection{Evaluation}

For the first two prompting methods, forced closed-style and forced reverse order, model responses are obtained in numerical form, consistent with traditional survey options. We use a straightforward Python script to map the responses from the reverse order questions back to the original survey option for evaluation. For the unconstrained settings (forced open-ended and fully unconstrained), we follow the approach of \citet{bravansky2025rethinking} to map free-form responses to the most appropriate survey options. Specifically, we use \texttt{GPT-4o} to analyze these responses and determine the model's stance using the prompt shown in Figure \ref{fig:eval_prompt}. In many instances, LLMs respond to certain questions with statements like, \textit{“As an AI, I do not have any opinion on this proposition.”} Such responses can not be mapped to any survey option or Likert scale. We classify these responses as \textit{unclassifiable} and label them as “$0$”.


To validate this process, the first two authors manually reviewed a random sample of $100$ forced open-ended and $100$ fully unconstrained responses, extracting stances and comparing them to the model-generated stances for the corresponding questions. This cross-matching achieved an overall accuracy of $0.957$.\\


\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

% To evaluate the similarity between the model generated responses for our probing methods and the ground truth of the survey, we use the following metrics: \\\\
\textbf{WVS:} Following \citet{alkhamissi2024investigating}, we employ two metrics for evaluating WVS responses. The first is the \textbf{Hard Alignment Metric}, which measures plain accuracy by comparing model responses to survey answers for each culture. Formally, the hard metric \(H\) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
H =  \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} {1} {\{y_i = y_i'\}} 
\end{equation}

Here, \(N\) is the total number of questions, \(y_i\) represents the ground truth for the \(i\)-th question, and \(y_i'\) is the model's response. The indicator function \( {1}{\{y_i = y_i'\}} \) equals \(1\) if \(y_i = y_i'\) and \(0\) otherwise. 

The second metric is the \textbf{Soft Alignment Metric}, a relaxed version of the hard metric that assigns partial credit for ordinal-scale and categorical questions. The soft metric \(S\) is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    S = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (1 - \epsilon_i)
\end{equation}

where
\[
    \epsilon_i = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \frac{|y_i' - y_i|}{q_i - 1} & \text{if the question is ordinal}, \\
    1 - \text{reward} & \text{if the question is categorical}.
    \end{cases}
\]

Here, \( q_i \) denotes the number of options for the \( i \)-th question (for ordinal questions). For categorical questions, the reward is proportional to the number of matching elements between the ground truth and the model response. This approach ensures a nuanced evaluation of model performance across different question types.\\\\
\textbf{Hofstede Cultural Dimensions:} Each of the six dimensions (\(D\)) in the Hofstede cultural survey is computed using the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    D_i = \lambda_i^0 (Q_i^0 - Q_i^1) + \lambda_i^1 (Q_i^2 - Q_i^3) + C_i 
\end{equation}

Here, \(\lambda_i\) represents the hyper-parameter, \(C_i\) is a constant, and each dimension is derived from four survey questions (\(Q\)). 
Since the precise values of \(C\) required for a detailed comparison across dimensions are not publicly available from the survey, we instead use Spearman's \(\rho\)-rank correlation coefficient with statistical significance testing. This evaluates the relationship between the ranking of the values predicted by the language models and those derived from the surveys, expressed as \(\rho(R(f_i), R(y_i))\), where \(R(f_i)\) represents the ranks of the model responses and \(R(y_i)\) represents the ranks of the ground truth values for the \(i\)-th dimension. Our choice of using rank
correlation is motivated by the prior works of \citet{arora-etal-2023-probing, masoud2023cultural}, etc. 







\section{Results \& Findings}

\subsection{World Values Survey (WVS)}\label{sec:wvs_results}

\textbf{Traditional closed-style classification often fails to capture the full extent of cultural alignment in LLMs under less constrained conditions}. As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:wvs_score_table}, the standard closed-style MCQ-based approach achieves the highest alignment in only approximately $20\%$ of cases in hard alignment metric, and an even lower $13.3\%$ in soft alignment metric when prompting in native language. This performance improves slightly to $33.3\%$ for hard alignment when the prompts are provided in English. On the other hand, the two less constrained settings dominate in the majority of cases. With the exception of a few outliers, specifically for Bangladesh, all models demonstrate their strongest alignment performance in these less constrained settings, while some also perform notably well in the reverse order scenario. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%







\textbf{The unclassifiable outputs in less constrained settings provide a wealth of information about socio-cultural characteristics}. As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:unclassifiable_outputs}, the models frequently refused to answer certain questions in the two less constrained probing methods (Forced Open-Ended and Fully Unconstrained) for Germany and the USA. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct a case study to investigate which questions (full question list in Table \ref{tab:wvs_ten_ques}) are predominantly avoided by the models. Our findings indicate that questions related to the \textit{importance of God} and the \textit{acceptability of abortion} in society are most often met with non-specific responses from the models. For instance, when asked about the importance of God, the models respond with statements such as \textit{'One's relationship with God or a higher power is a private matter, and not something that should be imposed on others'}. Similarly, when questioned on the acceptability of abortion, responses include statements like \textit{'This is a decision that should be left up to the individual woman, in consultation with her doctor and loved ones'}.
We hypothesize that these responses reflect an accurate representation of the societal values of Germany and the USA. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:country_selection}, both countries are positioned within the \textbf{secular-rational} and \textbf{self-expression} dimension of the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, which is characterized by societies that prioritize subjective well-being, civic activism, and self-expression. These traits are particularly prominent in postindustrial societies with high levels of existential security and individual autonomy \citep{inglehart2005christian}. The nuanced responses observed in these open-ended settings align closely with the defining characteristics of such societies. Notably, these subtleties are entirely unattainable in the closed-style survey settings. The contrast is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:wvs_map} for Germany using two language models: Llama 3.3 and GPT-4. This difference becomes even more apparent through the thematic analysis of WVS responses detailed in Appendix \ref{appendix:wvs_additional_results}. \\

\textbf{Responses exhibit significant sensitivity to the order of options} in both MCQ and Likert scale-based questions from the WVS, with notable improvements (ranging from $3\%-15\%$) in soft metric in majority of the cases when the order of options is reversed. This sensitivity highlights the positional bias inherent in LLMs \citep{pezeshkpour2023large}, where the placement of options—such as in ascending or descending order—can significantly influence their preferences. We argue that in a nuanced and critical domain like cultural alignment, this positional fragility represents a fundamental flaw in the evaluation framework, as it undermines the reliability of the results when LLMs are highly susceptible to such superficial variations.





\subsection{Hofstede Cultural Dimension} \label{sec:hofstede_result_sec}

Similar to the WVS results presented in Section \ref{sec:wvs_results}, \textbf{less constrained settings achieve a higher level of positive correlation with statistical significance} in the Hofstede cultural survey. As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:hofstede_cross_value}, 
$66.67\%$ of the cases of cross-value correlation per country are dominated by the two less constrained probing methods: forced open-ended and fully unconstrained. Notably, all statistically significant correlations ($p<=0.05$) are exclusively achieved by these two methods. We further evaluate cross-cultural correlations per value across the five models. The findings, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:radar_plot} and Table \ref{tab:hofstede_cross_country}, reveal that while the two closed-style probing methods achieve statistically significant positive correlations in 
$33.34\%$ of cases across all six dimensions, the two unconstrained settings demonstrate statistically significant results in $58.34\%$
of cases across all dimensions for all models.

One notable observation from Table \ref{tab:hofstede_cross_value} is that, when prompted in Bengali, the two unconstrained generation settings exhibited suboptimal performance, frequently yielding negative correlations-a trend markedly distinct from the results observed for the other two cultures examined in this study, Germany and the USA. Upon closer examination of the responses generated by these unconstrained methods, it becomes evident that the models often fail to provide detailed descriptions or substantive reasoning to support their answers in Bengali. We hypothesize that this underperformance is due to Bengali being a resource-scarce language in the field of natural language processing (NLP), especially when compared to languages like English and German. This disparity arises from limited availability of datasets, underdeveloped NLP tools, and a lack of research focus on Bengali \citep{joshi2020state}. Consequently, the unconstrained generation methods struggle to perform effectively for the Bangladeshi cultural context. 









\section{Reconsidering Cultural Alignment}\label{sec:reconsidering}

\textbf{Survey-based closed-style questionnaires are insufficient for accurately evaluating cultural alignment.} Anthropological and social science perspectives emphasize the intricate nature of culture, which extends far beyond observable behaviors to encompass the lived experiences of individuals within a society \citep{geertz2017interpretation}, which cannot be adequately captured through a closed-style multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. Such approach restricts language models by preventing them from expressing uncertainty or refusing to answer—behaviors that can offer valuable insights into societal structures \citep{urman2023silence}, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:wvs_results} of our study. Instead, it risks creating an artificial sense of alignment through multiple-choice (MCQ) responses, a phenomenon well-documented in prior literature. A more comprehensive conceptualization of culture views it as an amalgamation of demographic and semantic proxies, each contributing to the complex tapestry of societal norms, values, and behaviors \citep{adilazuarda2024towards}, with different evaluation frameworks tailored to assess specific proxies. In this regard, the studies by \citet{naous2023having, rao2024normad} provide valuable examples by developing specialized frameworks to evaluate the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) across various cultural proxies, such as food, regional distinctions, and social values. Based on these insights, we recommend that future research should move beyond the exclusive reliance on closed-style evaluations and adopt more flexible, framework-based methodologies. This approach would allow for a more holistic and accurate assessment of language models' ability to understand and navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.

\textbf{The assertion that language can serve as a reliable proxy for culture is a contentious and potentially flawed approach in academic research}. While previous studies have used language as a representative indicator for cultural alignment and understanding \citep{alkhamissi2024investigating, masoud2023cultural}, this methodology oversimplifies the complex relationship between language and culture. The acquisition of a language associated with a particular culture is often a relatively straightforward process that can be accomplished within a relatively short timeframe. In contrast, the internalization and adoption of cultural values is a far more intricate and time-consuming process, often spanning generations or even centuries to become deeply ingrained within a society \citep{smolicz1981core}. In their study, \citet{havaldar2023multilingual} demonstrate that multilingual models fail to fully capture cultural variations tied to emotions and predominantly reflect the cultural values of Western societies. The ability of a language model to process or generate content in a specific language should not be equated with a comprehensive grasp of the associated cultural values and emotional expressions. This critique is further exemplified by the findings discussed in section \ref{sec:hofstede_result_sec}, where the poor performance of unconstrained generation methods in Bengali highlights the practical limitations of NLP models in resource-scarce languages. Together, these observations reinforce the need for both technical advancements in low-resource languages and a conceptual shift beyond relying on language as a sole proxy for culture.


\textbf{Surveys like WVS and Hofstede can serve as valuable resources of knowledge or fine-tuning data for integrating cultural differences in LLMs }, rather than being solely used for evaluating cultural alignment. A notable example of this approach is CultureLLM \citep{li2024culturellm}, where the authors utilize augmented data derived from WVS survey responses to fine-tune LLMs. After fine-tuning, they evaluate the models' cultural adaptability by testing them on culture-related public datasets in specific languages, observing measurable improvements. This demonstrates the potential of integrating survey data not only for testing, but also for improving the cultural sensitivity and adaptability of LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}

Closed-style surveys and questionnaires, while effective in collecting human responses, are inadequate to evaluate cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). Using WVS and Hofstede surveys as a case study, we demonstrate that LLM responses to survey questions exhibit severe instability across varying levels of constraint in the generation settings, as well as with simple changes such as the reordering of choices within the survey questions. We emphasize the need for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies and highlight localized alignment claims rather than broad global assertions. We believe this study will inspire innovative methodologies for more nuanced and comprehensive evaluations of cultural alignment in LLMs.


\section*{Limitation}

In our study, we specifically focus on the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework as case studies to evaluate cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). While other prominent surveys, such as the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW) have also been utilized in similar contexts, we are unable to conduct experiments across all these datasets due to time and scope constraints. Nevertheless, as discussed in Appendix \ref{sec:back_study}, the majority of studies in the field rely predominantly on WVS and Hofstede’s surveys. Many other surveys share a similar multiple-choice format, so the challenges we identify in using WVS and Hofstede’s frameworks are broadly applicable to this general approach to cultural evaluation.\\
\\For this work, we focus on three representative cultures from three distinct regions, based on the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map. These cultures allow us to derive meaningful and contrasting results regarding the cultural alignment of LLMs. We believe that if we could expand the scope to include a wider variety of cultures from additional regions would yield even deeper and more comprehensive insights. Furthermore, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:hofstede_result_sec}, we also hint at the significant issue of low-resource languages in cultural alignment evaluations. The nuances of low-resource languages and their representation in cultural alignment tests have the potential to uncover critical insights and address overlooked gaps in this field. Due to resource constraints, we were unable to explore this dimension further in our current study. \\
\\There are virtually limitless variations of probing methods that can be designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) under varying levels of constraints. In our study, we focus on designing and testing three specific probing methods: forced reverse order, forced open-ended, and fully unconstrained, in addition to the traditional multiple-choice format. These methods are chosen to explore different dimensions of LLM behavior and their ability to align with cultural and contextual nuances. However, we acknowledge that this selection represents only a small subset of the possible probing strategies, leaving significant room for further exploration.
Additionally, we evaluate our claims using five state-of-the-art LLMs. While these models were carefully chosen to represent the current advancements in the field, the sheer number of available models presents countless alternative choices. This introduces another limitation to our study, as the results may vary depending on the specific models selected.

% Closed-style surveys and questionnaires, while effective for collecting human responses in real-world scenarios, are proved to be inadequate for evaluating cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). Through the case study of WVS and Hofstede surveys, we demonstrate that LLM responses to survey questions exhibit significant instability across varying levels of constraint in the generation settings, as well as with simple changes such as the reordering of choices within the survey questions. These findings highlight the limitations of current methods and the need for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that target specific proxies of culture. We advocate for making localized alignment claims, rather than broad global assertions about values and opinions in LLMs, to better capture the nuanced ways in which culture manifests. We believe that our study paves the way for developing innovative evaluation methodologies and encourages researchers to explore more comprehensive approaches for testing and understanding cultural alignment in LLMs.

\section{Background Study}
\label{sec:back_study}
To identify studies that utilize the World Values Survey or Hofstede’s cultural dimensions framework in evaluating large language models (LLMs), we conduct a systematic search across Google Scholar, arXiv, and the ACL Anthology. Our search strategy include the keywords \textit{"World Values Survey"}, \textit{"WVS"}, \textit{"Hofstede"}, and various synonyms and phrases related to \textit{"language models"}, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant literature.

\subsection{World Values Survey (WVS)}
As the World Values Survey (WVS) is a structured survey in which most questions follow either a multiple-choice or Likert-scale format, we identify a significant number of studies that have adopted a similar approach when evaluating large language models (LLMs). Most studies adopt a forced closed-style questioning approach, which requires LLMs to generate responses within predefined answer choices to ensure alignment with the original survey design. \citet{zhao2024worldvaluesbench} presents WORLDVALUESBENCH, a large-scale benchmark dataset derived from the World Values Survey (WVS) Wave 7, or WVS 7 in short, enabling the evaluation of LLMs' multicultural value awareness by predicting human responses to value-based questions based on demographic contexts. Building on value-based assessments, \citet{chiu2024dailydilemmas} examines LLMs' moral reasoning through DAILYDILEMMAS, a dataset of 1,360 real-life dilemmas, incorporating the World Values Survey (WVS) to analyze cultural value preferences in AI-generated decisions. 

Several studies use the WVS questionnaire in combination with the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW) to assess cultural values in large language models (LLMs).  \citet{durmus2023towards} develops a framework for evaluating LLMs' alignment with global opinions using survey data, incorporating both the World Values Survey (WVS) and the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW) to measure how closely model-generated responses reflect human perspectives across different countries. The study finds that the model’s responses align more closely with opinions from the USA, Canada, Australia, and several European and South American countries compared to other regions. \citet{papadopoulou2024large} replicates and extends prior research on language models' ability to represent moral norms across cultural contexts, focusing on topics like 'homosexuality' and 'divorce.' Using data from the WVS and PEW surveys covering over 40 countries, the analysis reveals that both monolingual and multilingual models exhibit biases and struggle to fully capture the moral complexities of diverse cultures. In a similar approach, \citet{ramezani2023knowledge} investigates whether monolingual English language models can capture moral norms across cultures, focusing on topics like "homosexuality" and "divorce." Using data from the World Values Survey and PEW global surveys, the study finds that pre-trained models struggle to predict cross-cultural moral norms compared to English-specific norms. Fine-tuning on survey data improves predictions for diverse cultures but reduces accuracy for English norms, highlighting challenges in integrating cultural knowledge into moral reasoning.

A number of studies employ the World Values Survey (WVS) to examine greater cultural adaptability in Western societies. \citet{tao2024cultural} examines the variations in cultural alignment using data from the World Value Survey (WVS) and the European Value Survey (EVS). The study reveals that contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o, exhibit a pronounced bias toward English-speaking and Protestant European countries. \citep{atari2023humans} analyzes LLMs’ cultural biases using World Values Survey (WVS) data, finding that GPT aligns closely with WEIRD societies, particularly the U.S. and Northern Europe, while diverging from non-WEIRD populations like Ethiopia and Pakistan. The study highlights the need for more diverse training data to reduce cultural bias in AI.  \citet{kazemi2024cultural} investigates the relationship between LLM training data and their ability to reflect societal values embedded in language. Using the World Values Survey, the study highlights a strong correlation between LLM performance and the availability of digital resources in target languages. It further reveals that low-resource languages, particularly in the Global South, exhibit weaker performance. \citet{meijer2024llms} investigates whether LLMs accurately reflect cross-cultural moral perspectives by comparing model-generated moral scores with survey-based data, including the World Values Survey (WVS). Findings indicate that LLMs struggle to replicate cross-cultural differences in moral judgments, often aligning more closely with WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societal values. \citet{alkhamissi2024investigating} evaluates LLMs' cultural alignment using WVS-based survey simulations across different demographic personas. The study finds that models align more closely with responses from urban, highly educated individuals, while digitally underrepresented groups (e.g., working-class, rural respondents) show lower alignment. To assess cross-linguistic generalization, the authors use 30 World Values Survey (WVS-7) questions, translating them into Arabic alongside their corresponding English versions. 

\citet{lindahl2023unveiling} explores ChatGPT’s alignment with human values using 251 multiple-choice questions from the World Values Survey (WVS-7). Cluster analysis reveals that ChatGPT’s responses align most closely with developed democracies, particularly Australia, Great Britain, and Northern Ireland. Additionally, the study highlights response consistency issues and biases, emphasizing the need for improved cultural adaptation in LLMs. In a similar approach, \citep{wang2023not} examines cultural bias in LLMs, finding that ChatGPT often reflects English cultural norms even when responding in other languages. Using the World Values Survey (WVS) to analyze value-based responses, the study shows that GPT-4 exhibits greater English-centric dominance than earlier models. The findings underscore the importance of culturally diverse training data and enhanced alignment strategies.
\citet{choenni2024self} explores self-alignment as an inference-time method to improve LLMs' cultural value alignment using in-context learning (ICL). The study utilizes cloze-style probing templates based on World Values Survey (WVS) data to steer model responses toward culturally representative values. \citet{qu2024performance} examines ChatGPT’s ability to simulate public opinion using socio-demographic data from the World Values Survey (WVS). The study reveals that ChatGPT demonstrates higher accuracy in Western, English-speaking, and developed countries, especially the United States, while displaying biases across factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, education, and social class. 



We find two studies creatively utilize the World Values Survey (WVS) beyond its conventional multiple-choice question (MCQ) format to assess cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). \citet{benkler2023assessing} investigates the capacity of LLMs to reflect implicit moral values by analyzing their responses to open-ended questions on topics such as God, abortion, and national pride. Rather than employing the direct survey-style questioning typical of the WVS, the study adopts the Recognizing Value Resonance (RVR) model to evaluate the alignment of LLM outputs with moral values across various demographic groups, comparing these results to the WVS. This approach underscores the biases and limitations of LLMs in representing non-Western moral perspectives, while suggesting that fine-tuning with culturally specific data could enhance performance. Alternatively, \citet{li2024culturellm} introduces CultureLLM, a culturally adaptive LLM fine-tuned using 50 structured questions from the WVS as seed data. This study applies semantic data augmentation to generate culturally diverse training samples while maintaining the original structure of the survey.










\subsection{Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions}  

Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions framework provides a structured approach of dividing the factors of a society into six dimensions to analyze cultural differences across societies. Many studies evaluating large language models (LLMs) have adopted a similar methodology by utilizing multiple-choice questions derived from Hofstede’s Value Survey Module (VSM). 
\citep{kharchenko2024well} investigates the cultural sensitivity of LLMs using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, analyzing responses to advice-based prompts across 36 countries and multiple languages to assess whether LLMs align with national cultural values. Similarly, \citet{masoud2023cultural} evaluates LLMs' alignment with Hofstede’s cultural dimensions using the VSM13 questionnaire, a structured survey with Likert-scale multiple-choice questions. The study finds that GPT-4 demonstrates stronger and more consistent cultural alignment than GPT-3.5 and Llama 2, particularly when adapted to specific personas. Interestingly, despite being primarily trained on English data, GPT-4 aligns more closely with Chinese cultural values while struggling with American and Arab cultural contexts. 

\citet{cao-etal-2023-assessing} uses the Hofstede Cultural Survey to assess ChatGPT’s cultural alignment. ChatGPT struggles to adjust to foreign cultural situations and most closely conforms to American culture, according to the study. English-language prompts also lessen answer variance, flattening cultural differences and skewing results in favor of American standards. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) capture cross-cultural differences in values, but their outputs only weakly align with Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the World Values Survey (WVS) \citep{arora-etal-2023-probing}. To evaluate this alignment, the study reformulates survey questions into closed-style (fill-in-the-blank) prompts, enabling models to generate responses comparable to human survey data. The results indicate a strong Western bias in PLMs, likely influenced by the dominance of Wikipedia and CommonCrawl as primary training sources. 


\citet{dawson2024evaluating} evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to comprehend cultural aspects of regional languages, focusing on Malayalam (Kerala, India) and Yoruba (West Africa). Using Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions, the study quantifies the cultural awareness of LLM responses and finds that, while LLMs perform well for English, they fail to capture cultural nuances for Malayalam and Yoruba. The research emphasizes the need for large-scale training on culturally enriched datasets for regional languages to improve user experience and the validity of LLM-based applications like market research. \citet{li2024culturepark} proposes a multi-agent dialogue framework, termed \textit{CulturePark}, which leverages topics from the World Value Survey (WVS) to facilitate interactions between large language models (LLMs) for the generation of culturally specific data. By fine-tuning LLMs on this data, the study demonstrates that the models achieve enhanced alignment with Hofstede's cultural dimensions.\\

A comprehensive summary of the background study is provided in Table \ref{tab:back_study_table}  with a concise and structured overview of the key findings and methodologies.







\section{Anthropological Prompting}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:probing_methods}, we employ \textit{Anthropological Prompting} to provide our models with the best chance to align with cultural variations. This approach is initially introduced by \citet{alkhamissi2024investigating}. The objective is to simulate a digital version of ethnographic fieldwork by directing the model to reason as though it has actively engaged in this methodology. Anthropological prompting aims to equip the model with the necessary context to grasp the intricate complexities and subtleties tied to identities, questions, and linguistic structures. For example, it delves into the emic (insider’s perspective) and etic (outsider’s perspective) approaches to analyzing culture, emphasizing the layered dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the significant influence of personal experiences on shaping individual subjectivities.
The general prompt utilized for Anthropological Prompting is shown in Figure \ref{fig:anthro_prompt}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\section{Evaluation Prompt}

We use the following evaluation prompt to map the less-constrained answers to the choices of survey questions. 
\begin{figure}[ht]

\centering
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10!white, colframe=blue!5!black, title=]
You are an expert analyst and a linguistic expert. You are tasked with classifying a response as one of the possible choices. You'll be given a closed-style question and an open-ended response. Based on the question, you need to map the response to the suitable option described in the question.  Output in dictionary, using the following format:\\
\{\\
``question'' : STATE THE OPEN ENDED QUESTION, \\
``classification'': OUTPUT ONLY THE NUMBER OF THE CHOSEN OPTION,\\
``reasoning'': PROVIDE YOUR REASONING HERE\\
\}\\
If the response cannot be classified into any of the given options, use ``0'' as the classification.\\

Question: \{How important is God in your life? Please use this scale to indicate. 10 means “not at all important” and 1 means “very important”\}\\
Response: \{I respect the importance of religion for many people, as it provides moral guidance, community, and comfort. However, for me personally, spirituality is more about personal values and ethical living than adherence to organized religion. Germany has a rich history of religious diversity, but I believe the importance of God in life is subjective and should remain a personal choice rather than a universal truth.\}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The World Values Survey (WVS) is a collaborative effort by social scientists worldwide, established in 1981, to explore how changing values influence social and political dynamics. It is the largest non-commercial, cross-national, time-series study of human beliefs and values, comprising nearly 400,000 respondents. Conducted in almost 100 countries, the WVS represents around 90\% of the global population, utilizing a standardized questionnaire. What sets the WVS apart is its comprehensive coverage of diverse global contexts, ranging from the poorest to the wealthiest nations across all major cultural regions.


\subsection{WVS Questionnaire}
\label{apendix:wvs}
The World Values Survey (WVS) carries out its investigation in waves, during which questionnaires are developed and distributed globally. For each wave, social scientists from across the globe contribute suggestions for potential questions, which are then compiled and finalized into a master questionnaire in English. The most recent WVS-7 questionnaire was completed in November 2016 and subsequently utilized for fieldwork conducted during the seventh wave of the survey from 2017 to 2021. The WVS-7 questionnaire is organized into 14 thematic sub-sections, covering various topics, including demography: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item social values, attitudes \& stereotypes (45 items)
    \item societal well-being (11 items)
    \item social capital, trust, and organizational membership (49 items);
    \item economic values (6 items)
    \item corruption (9 items)
    \item migration (10 items);
    \item post-materialist index (6 items)
    \item science \& technology (6 items);
    \item religious values (12 items)
    \item security (21 items);
    \item ethical values \& norms (23 items)
    \item political interest and political participation (36 items)
    \item political culture and political regimes (25 items)
    \item demography (31 items)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map}
Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{Traditional} values versus \textbf{Secular-rational} values
     \item \textbf{Survival} values versus \textbf{Self-expression} values
 \end{enumerate}
\textbf{Traditional Values:} The importance of religion, parent-child relationships, respect for authority, and traditional family values is strongly emphasized in these societies. Individuals who uphold these values often oppose practices such as divorce, abortion, euthanasia, and suicide. Additionally, these cultures tend to exhibit high levels of national pride and a strong sense of nationalism.

\textbf{Secular-rational Values:} Societies that prioritize secular-rational values tend to hold preferences opposite to those of traditional values. They place less importance on religion, traditional family structures, and authority. Practices such as divorce, abortion, euthanasia, and suicide are viewed as more acceptable, though this does not necessarily correlate with higher rates of suicide.

\textbf{Survival Values:} Survival values prioritize economic and physical security, often associated with a more ethnocentric perspective and lower levels of trust and tolerance.

\textbf{Self-expression Values:} Self-expression values emphasize the importance of environmental protection and increasing acceptance of diversity, including tolerance toward foreigners, LGBTQ+ individuals, and gender equality. These values also reflect a growing demand for greater participation in economic and political decision-making processes.\\


The two dimensions were identified through factor analysis conducted on a set of ten indicators. These indicators (five for each dimension) were selected for technical consistency, as they had been included in all four waves of the Values Surveys, enabling reliable comparisons over time. While these ten indicators represent only a small subset of the beliefs and values encompassed by the dimensions, and may not be the most sensitive measures, they effectively capture two critical dimensions of cross-cultural variation. It is important to recognize that these specific indicators serve as proxies for much broader underlying cultural dimensions. Since the goal is to evaluate the LLMs' comprehension of cross-cultural variation, these ten indicators can be adopted for the study, with countries selected based on their positioning along these two dimensions.


\subsection{Additional Findings on World Values Survey (WVS)}\label{appendix:wvs_additional_results}

As outlined in Table \ref{tab:wvs_ten_ques}, the ten indicators are categorized into seven themes: \textit{religious values}, \textit{social values}, \textit{ethical values}, \textit{political values}, \textit{post-materialistic values}, \textit{happiness and well-being}, and \textit{social capital}. We evaluate our results and compare the four probing methods across these themes using both soft and hard alignment metrics, which are illustrated in Figure groups \ref{fig:wvs_radar_plots_soft} and \ref{fig:wvs_radar_plots_hard}, respectively.

\section{Hofstede Cultural Dimensions}
\label{apendix:hofstede}
Geert Hofstede, a Dutch social psychologist, developed Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory, which offers a framework for comprehending how culture affects workplace values. Based on a study of IBM workers in more than 70 countries, it provides information about how workplace beliefs and behavior vary by country. Each of the six main categories of cultural variation that Hofstede found reflects a basic cultural feature that influences how people view and relate to one another.

\subsection{The Six Cultural Dimensions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Power Distance Index (PDI):} This dimension evaluates how much society's weaker members accept and anticipate an unequal distribution of power. Hierarchical organizations, where authority is respected and inequity is accepted as the norm, are typical of high PDI cultures. Low PDI cultures, on the other hand, support decentralized decision-making and a more equitable distribution of power.
    
    \item \textbf{Individualism versus Collectivism (IDV):} Individuals' level of group integration is reflected in this dimension. People are expected to take care of themselves and their immediate family in individualistic cultures, which place a strong emphasis on personal accomplishments and rights. People in collectivist cultures are integrated into powerful, unified organizations that provide protection to their members in return for loyalty.
    
    \item \textbf{Masculinity versus Femininity (MAS):} Societies that emphasize relationships, quality of life, and caring for others are connected with femininity, whereas societies that value competitiveness, assertiveness, and material achievement are associated with masculinity. While low MAS societies place more value on nurturing and teamwork, high MAS societies tend to place more emphasis on achieving and success.
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI):} This dimension quantifies the degree to which a culture accepts ambiguity and uncertainty. Low UAI societies are more tolerant of ambiguity, risk-taking, and uncertainty, whereas high UAI societies favor organized environments, well-defined regulations, and risk-avoidance techniques.
    
    \item \textbf{Long-Term versus Short-Term Orientation (LTO):} Societies that are long-term oriented prioritize traits like tenacity, frugal living, and flexibility in order to reap future benefits. Short-term oriented societies, on the other hand, place more value on customs, instant pleasure, and adherence to social duties.
    
    \item \textbf{Indulgence versus Restraint (IVR):} The degree to which societies permit the free expression of emotions and desires is referred to as this dimension. While restrained societies place more emphasis on societal rules and the regulation of impulses, indulgent societies promote the pursuit of happiness and personal fulfillment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calculation of Hofstede Dimensions}
The Hofstede dimensions are calculated using the following formulas\footnote{The formulas are officially provided at: \url{https://www.laits.utexas.edu/orkelm/kelmpub/VSM2013_Manual.pdf}}:

\begin{equation}
    \text{PDI} = 35 \cdot (m_7 - m_2) + 25 \cdot (m_{20} - m_{23})+ C_{PDI} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{IDV} = 35 \cdot (m_4 - m_1) + 35 \cdot (m_9 - m_6) + C_{IDV} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
       \text{MAS} = 35 \cdot (m_5 - m_3) + 35 \cdot (m_8 - m_{10}) + C_{MAS} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{LTO} = 40 \cdot (m_{13} - m_{14}) + 25 \cdot (m_{19} - m_{22}) + C_{LTO}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{UAI} = 40 \cdot (m_{18} - m_{15}) + 25 \cdot (m_{21} - m_{24}) + C_{UAI}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{IVR} = 35 \cdot (m_{12} - m_{11}) + 40 \cdot (m_{17} - m_{16}) + C_{IVR}
\end{equation}


Here $m_i$ represents the mean score for the response to question $i$ in the survey.  The coefficients (e.g., 35, 25, 40) are weights assigned to specific questions based on their contribution to the respective dimension. $C$ is a constant, either positive or negative, that depends on the nature of the samples. It does not influence the comparison between countries but can be chosen by the user to adjust the dimension scores to fall within a range of 0 to 100.

\caption{Transformed open-ended questions from the original Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework.
In the \textbf{Forced Open-Ended} setting, LLMs are instructed to respond to each proposition by explicitly being prompted with \textit{“Take a clear stance about it.”} In contrast, the \textbf{Fully Unconstrained} setting differs by encouraging LLMs to generate free-form, open-ended responses by including the phrase \textit{“Feel free to express yourself”} for each proposition, allowing for greater flexibility and creativity in the responses.
 In the table, \{\textit{nationality}\} refers to either Bangladeshi, German, or American individuals. Each question is preceded by the \textit{Anthropological} prompt (Figure \ref{fig:anthro_prompt}) to provide contextual framing at the outset. }
