\caption{
Runtimes and costs for hypothesis generation on \congress. 
We report millions of tokens for GPT-4o (feature labeling) and GPT-4o-mini (annotation) respectively as \{\# 4o\} / \{\# 4o-mini\}. Input and output token counts are summed ($>$99\% are input).
\textsc{Sae-NoVal} is our method without the label validation step (i.e., one label is generated and used per neuron).
Costs are in USD and based on OpenAI pricing as of 01/2025.
