\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Social Recommendation}
To improve the accuracy of recommendation results, numerous social recommendation methods have been developed, incorporating online social relationships between users as side information____. Early models like SoReg____ and SocialMF____ integrate social connections as regularization terms or utilize trust relationships to project users into latent representations. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs)____ have achieved great success in deep learning, owing to their strong capability on modeling graph data. DiffNet____ and its extension DiffNet++____ model the information diffusion process in social graphs to enlarge the users’ influence scope. Multi-channel hypergraph convolutional network is employed on MHCN____ to enhance social recommendation by leveraging high-order user relations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is utilized in SEPT____ to improve social recommendation by uncovering supervisory signals from two complementary views of raw data. DESIGN____ introduces knowledge distillation between models that rely on different data sources to leverage social information effectively. A universal denoised self-augmented learning framework (DSL)____ incorporates social influence to decipher user preferences while mitigating noisy effects. Nevertheless, these methods mostly aim to improve accuracy while neglecting diversity. Our work contributes to achieving a balance between accuracy and diversity in social recommendation.
 
\subsection{Diversified Recommendation}
Diversified recommendation aims to provide users with a more varied set of items, enabling users to discover new and unexplored interests____. The accuracy-diversity dilemma, pointing higher accuracy often means losing diversity to some extent and vice versa. A classical re-ranking work to enhance diversity is maximal marginal relevance (MMR)____, which uses the notion of marginal relevance to combine relevance and diversity with a trade-off parameter. Determinantal point process (DPP)____ re-ranks items to achieve the largest determinant on the item’s similarity matrix. DGCN____ selects node neighbors based on the inverse category frequency for diverse aggregation and further utilizes category-boosted negative sampling and adversarial learning to diverse items in the embedding space. DGRec____ targets diversifying GNN-based recommender systems with diversified embedding generation. Different from these methods, our work facilitates seamless integration with various social recommendation systems, effectively enhancing accuracy while maintaining high diversity.
