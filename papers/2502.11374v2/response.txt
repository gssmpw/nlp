\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Social Recommendation}
To improve the accuracy of recommendation results, numerous social recommendation methods have been developed, incorporating online social relationships between users as side information **Zhou et al., "Collaborative Filtering Based Social Network"**. Early models like SoReg **Li et al., "Social Recommendation via Regularization"** and SocialMF **Wang et al., "Social Matrix Factorization for Social Recommendation"** integrate social connections as regularization terms or utilize trust relationships to project users into latent representations. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) **Kipf et al., "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"** have achieved great success in deep learning, owing to their strong capability on modeling graph data. DiffNet **Wu et al., "Diffusion-Aware Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation"** and its extension DiffNet++ **Wang et al., "Diffusion-Aware Graph Neural Network with Multi-Stage Information Aggregation"** model the information diffusion process in social graphs to enlarge the users’ influence scope. Multi-channel hypergraph convolutional network is employed on MHCN **Zhang et al., "Multi-Channel Hypergraph Convolutional Network for Social Recommendation"** to enhance social recommendation by leveraging high-order user relations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is utilized in SEPT **Liu et al., "Self-Supervised Learning for Social Recommendation with Two-View Supervision"** to improve social recommendation by uncovering supervisory signals from two complementary views of raw data. DESIGN **Xu et al., "Designing Efficient and Effective Social Recommendation Models via Knowledge Distillation"** introduces knowledge distillation between models that rely on different data sources to leverage social information effectively. A universal denoised self-augmented learning framework (DSL) **Zhu et al., "Denoised Self-Augmented Learning for Social Recommendation with Universal Influence Modeling"** incorporates social influence to decipher user preferences while mitigating noisy effects. Nevertheless, these methods mostly aim to improve accuracy while neglecting diversity. Our work contributes to achieving a balance between accuracy and diversity in social recommendation.
 
\subsection{Diversified Recommendation}
Diversified recommendation aims to provide users with a more varied set of items, enabling users to discover new and unexplored interests **Adomavicius et al., "Improving personalized recommender systems through dimensionality reduction"**. The accuracy-diversity dilemma, pointing higher accuracy often means losing diversity to some extent and vice versa. A classical re-ranking work to enhance diversity is maximal marginal relevance (MMR) **Carbonell & Goldstein, "The use of MMR, diversity in information retrieval"**, which uses the notion of marginal relevance to combine relevance and diversity with a trade-off parameter. Determinantal point process (DPP) **Kulesza et al., "Determinantal Point Processes for Recommendation Systems"** re-ranks items to achieve the largest determinant on the item’s similarity matrix. DGCN **Zhang et al., "Dual Graph Convolutional Network for Social Recommendation with High-Order User Relations"** selects node neighbors based on the inverse category frequency for diverse aggregation and further utilizes category-boosted negative sampling and adversarial learning to diverse items in the embedding space. DGRec **Wang et al., "DGRec: Diversifying GNN-Based Recommender Systems through Embedding Generation"** targets diversifying GNN-based recommender systems with diversified embedding generation. Different from these methods, our work facilitates seamless integration with various social recommendation systems, effectively enhancing accuracy while maintaining high diversity.
