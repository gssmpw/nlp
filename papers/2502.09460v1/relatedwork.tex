The use of machine learning systems is becoming increasingly common in many diverse fields. Testing strategies for these systems are therefore being more widely recognised as a necessity, especially in safety critical systems~\cite{kassab2018testing}. In particular, these systems are tested with different focuses in mind such as: robustness to degradations \cite{hand-pose}\cite{hendrycks2019benchmarkingneuralnetworkrobustness}\cite{semantic_perturbations}\cite{object-centric-learning}, testing for faults when using ML frameworks~\cite{humbatova2020taxonomy}, testing the adequacy of the datasets used to train and test these systems~\cite{kim2023evaluating} and testing the biases embedded in these systems~\cite{birhane2022auditing, buolamwini2018gender}.

In particular, metamorphic testing is a convenient method to circumvent the oracle problem found when attempting to test many of these systems. This method has been used to test a wide range of ML systems, including: autonomous delivery robots~\cite{laurent2024metamorphic}, image classification systems~\cite{naidu2021metamorphic}, recommender systems~\cite{recommended-systems-testing}, search engines~\cite{testingSearchEngines} and chat bots~\cite{chatbotTesting}.

More particularly, when looking at pose estimation systems, we can find previous work focused on the pose estimation of hands \cite{hand-pose}, and on predicting the trajectory of humans, done by autonomous systems \cite{human-trajectory-metTest}.

When looking at the particular model tested in this work, it has previously been explicitly evaluated on individuals from different regions of the world which has been reported in the model's corresponding Model Card~\cite{modelcard2021mediapipe, mitchell2019model}. 

One of the main differences between the related work and the framework presented here is that we avoid the need for ground truth labelled data, meaning that \proposed can work with datasets without ground truth, which has not been done in previous metamorphic testing applied to pose estimation. We also do not focus only on robustness to degradations. We present a framework that can be used for various specific interests of the applications, which can be image degradation, but can encompass a wide range of potential concerns from fairness issues to sensitivity to image quality. Even if we do not focus on suggesting novel metamorphic rules, when novel metamorphic rules are needed for a specific application, \proposed can be applied to new datasets without the expense of labelling ground truth keypoints.
