\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we analyzed how good recent \lcms really are for query optimization tasks.
Particularly, we experimentally evaluated seven recent \lcms for join ordering, access path selection, and physical plan selection.
Although \lcms are basically capable of learning complex cost functions, they are often inferior to traditional approaches in selecting possible execution plans.
To improve future \lcms for query optimization, we recommend using appropriate metrics, diversification of training data, and hybrid models that incorporate estimates from traditional cost models.
