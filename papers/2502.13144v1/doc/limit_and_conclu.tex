\section{Limitation and Conclusion}
In this work, we propose the first 3DGS-based RL framework for training end-to-end AD policy. We combine RL and IL, with RL complementing IL to model the causations and narrow the open-loop gap, and IL complementing RL in terms of human alignment.
This work also has some limitations.
Currently the used 3DGS environments are running in a non-reactive manner, \ie, other traffic participants do not react according to ego vehicle's behavior but act with log replay.  And the effect of 3DGS still has room for improvement, especially for rendering non-rigid pedestrians, unobserved views, and low-light scenarios. Future works will focus on solving these problems and scaling up RL to the next level.
