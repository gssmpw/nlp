abstract = {The attention mechanism is a pivotal element within the transformer architecture, making a substantial contribution to its exceptional performance. Within this attention mechanism, Softmax is an imperative component that enables the model to assess the degree of correlation between various segments of the input. Yet, prior research has shown that Softmax operations can significantly increase processing latency and energy consumption in the transformer network due to their internal nonlinear operations and data dependencies. In this work, we proposed Hyft, a hardware efficient floating point Softmax accelerator for both training and inference. Hyft aims to reduce the implementation cost of different nonlinear arithmetic operations within softmax by adaptively converting intermediate results into the most suitable numeric format for each specific operation, leading to reconfigurable accelerator with hybrid numeric format. The evaluation results highlight that Hyft achieves a remarkable 10X reduction in hardware resource utilization and a 6x reduction in processing latency, all while maintaining a negligible impact on transformer accuracy.},

abstract = {In response to innovations in machine learning (ML) models, production workloads changed radically and rapidly. TPU v4 is the fifth Google domain specific architecture (DSA) and its third supercomputer for such ML models. Optical circuit switches (OCSes) dynamically reconfigure its interconnect topology to improve scale, availability, utilization, modularity, deployment, security, power, and performance; users can pick a twisted 3D torus topology if desired. Much cheaper, lower power, and faster than Infiniband, OCSes and underlying optical components are <5\% of system cost and <3\% of system power. Each TPU v4 includes SparseCores, dataflow processors that accelerate models that rely on embeddings by 5x--7x yet use only 5\% of die area and power. Deployed since 2020, TPU v4 outperforms TPU v3 by 2.1x and improves performance/Watt by 2.7x. The TPU v4 supercomputer is 4x larger at 4096 chips and thus nearly 10x faster overall, which along with OCS flexibility and availability allows a large language model to train at an average of ~60\% of peak FLOPS/second. For similar sized systems, it is ~4.3x--4.5x faster than the Graphcore IPU Bow and is 1.2x--1.7x faster and uses 1.3x--1.9x less power than the Nvidia A100. TPU v4s inside the energy-optimized warehouse scale computers of Google Cloud use ~2--6x less energy and produce ~20x less CO2e than contemporary DSAs in typical on-premise data centers.},

year = {2014},
isbn = {9781479943944},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Hardware specialization, in the form of accelerators that provide custom datapath
and control for specific algorithms and applications, promises impressive performance
and energy advantages compared to traditional architectures. Current research in accelerator
analysis relies on RTL-based synthesis flows to produce accurate timing, power, and
area estimates. Such techniques not only require significant effort and expertise
but are also slow and tedious to use, making large design space exploration infeasible.
To overcome this problem, we present Aladdin, a pre-RTL, power-performance accelerator
modeling framework and demonstrate its application to system-on-chip (SoC) simulation.
Aladdin estimates performance, power, and area of accelerators within 0.9%, 4.9%,
and 6.6% with respect to RTL implementations. Integrated with architecture-level core
and memory hierarchy simulators, Aladdin provides researchers an approach to model
the power and performance of accelerators in an SoC environment},
