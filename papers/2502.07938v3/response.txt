\section{Related Work}
This section reviews relevant embedding models that support Luxembourgish semantic search, including monolingual Luxembourgish models and multilingual embeddings.


Reimers et al., "Universal Sentence Representations for Question Answering" use knowledge distillation through a strong paraphrase-trained English embedding model and parallel data to create cross-lingually aligned models. Multiple instances of such models have been open sourced and a particularly powerful and popular one is \textit{paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2} (\textbf{M-MPNet}) which was trained on over 50 languages. Later within this work, we will explain how we extend this model to also support Luxembourgish.

The multilingual bitext mining model \textbf{LaBSE} Conneau et al., "Emerging Cross-lingering Structures in Multilingual Representations" is trained with translation ranking loss and negative samples.  It has been trained roughly on less than 100 Luxembourgish-English sentence pairs and specializes in zero-shot bitext mining. 

A recent model is GTE Multilingual (\textbf{M-GTE}) Bostrom et al., "GTE-Multilingual: A Long-Context Text Representation Model" , a multilingual embedding model designed for long context text representation and reranking.  \textit{M-GTE} has been trained with hard negatives and has included 50,000 Luxembourgish pairs within its contrastive pre-training.

Specific model adaptations to Luxembourgish have also been developed. One example is \textbf{LuxemBERT} Perez et al., "Leveraging Monolingual Data for Multilingual Transfer Learning" , a monolingual BERT model pre-trained for Luxembourgish using augmented data, partially generated by translating texts from closely related languages and incorporating relevant text sources. 

Closely related to our work, \textbf{LuxEmbedder} Perez et al., "Improving Cross-Lingual Zero-Shot Transfer Learning with Unsupervised Bitext Mining" used OpenAI's \textit{text-embedding-3-small} and \textit{LaBSE} to mine a set of parallel sentences for each pair of languages between Luxembourgish, English, and French. These parallel sentences (up to 20,000 per pair) were then used to further fine-tune \textit{LaBSE}, improving performance on modern Luxembourgish evaluation sets. However, its ability to handle Luxembourgish texts from different historical periods---potentially affected by digitization errors common in large-scale historical text collections, remains unclear.

Our work aims to extend existing embedding models to better perform cross-lingual semantic search within a collection of historical, OCR-noisy Luxembourgish texts. The conditions of these texts combined with the different spelling variations\footnote{Luxembourgish had no standardized spelling until 1946 and underwent multiple further reformations (eg. in 1999)} poses an interesting generalization challenge to the models.
