\section{Conclusions}
We introduce \ours and conduct an extensive evaluation of current foundational models and retrieval methods, highlighting that instance-level retrieval remains an unsolved problem. 
Our results indicate that off-the-shelf application of foundational models leaves considerable room for improvement, particularly in handling small objects and complex backgrounds. 
While specialized retrieval methods leveraging local descriptors are effective in these cases, their high memory and computational costs become impractical at the scale of \ours or beyond. 
\ours is designed to become a standard benchmark for evaluating foundational representation models and retrieval methods, accommodating both global and local representations, and advancing the field of instance-level recognition.
