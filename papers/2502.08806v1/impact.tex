\section*{Impact Statements}

This paper presents research aimed at advancing the field of Machine Learning. There are a few potential societal impacts stemming from our work:

\paragraph{Safety Considerations}
While it is possible, though unlikely unless intentionally prompted, for LLMs to generate malicious or corrupted code, we disclaim responsibility for any consequences resulting from executing such code on our benchmark. 

We are committed to providing a safe and controlled evaluation environment by encapsulating our framework within a Docker container. We have implemented extensive precautionary measures to achieve this goal. However, in rare cases involving specific repositories that have been excluded from our benchmark, we have observed instances where the Docker container may exceed system memory limitations, potentially causing the host server to restart.

We advise users and researchers to carefully consider system configurations and setup when deploying any LLM-generated code directly on their machines.

\paragraph{Legal Compliance}
