\begin{abstract}
\par
Simulators are a primary tool in computer architecture research but are extremely computationally intensive. Simulating modern architectures with increased core counts and recent workloads can be challenging, even on modern hardware. This paper demonstrates that simulating some GPGPU workloads in a single-threaded state-of-the-art simulator such as Accel-sim can take more than \summaryMaxTimeSequential{}. In this paper we present a simple approach to parallelize this simulator with minimal code changes by using OpenMP. Moreover, our parallelization technique is deterministic, so the simulator provides the same results for single-threaded and multi-threaded simulations. Compared to previous works, we achieve a higher speed-up, and, more importantly, the parallel simulation does not incur any inaccuracies. When we run the simulator with \summaryNumCores{} threads, we achieve an average speed-up of \summaryAvgSpeedup{} and reach \summaryMaxSpeedup{} in some workloads. This allows researchers to simulate applications that take \summaryMaxTimeSequential{} in less than \summaryMaxTimeReductionOpenMp{}. By speeding up simulations, researchers can model larger systems, simulate bigger workloads, add more detail to the model, increase the efficiency of the hardware platform where the simulator is run, and obtain results sooner.
