In this paper, we propose a simple technique for parallelizing the Accel-sim framework simulator \cite{accelsim}, which is one of the most popular tools for researching GPGPU architectures. We rely on the OpenMP \cite{openmp} application programming interface based on the shared memory paradigm. OpenMP allows us to parallelize the simulator with minimal changes. Our approach is deterministic and provides the same results when running the simulator single-threaded or multi-threaded. In other words, it does not incur simulation inaccuracies due to parallelization as some previous works do. When \summaryNumCores{} threads are in use, we achieve an average speed-up of \summaryAvgSpeedup{} and reach up to \summaryMaxSpeedup{} in some workloads. Our approach allows researchers that use Accel-sim to have several benefits, such as modeling bigger systems, simulating larger workloads, adding more detail to the GPU model, increasing simulation hardware efficiency, and obtaining results sooner.
