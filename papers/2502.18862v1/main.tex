\begin{abstract}
Steering vectors have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations.
We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on \textit{a single training example}, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize.
We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models.
Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples.
And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9\%.
Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model.
With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model.
Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Is it possible to find directions in the activation spaces of large language models (LLMs) that mediate whether or not the model displays a certain complex behavior -- such as honesty or sycophancy or toxicity? If so, then we could easily promote desired behaviors in an LLM by shifting activations along such a direction, or suppress harmful behaviors. Vectors that mediate model behavior in this way are called \textbf{steering vectors}, and many recent works have sought to find them.


A common denominator of these works is \textit{how} they find steering vectors for a given behavior: they extract steering vectors from large contrastive datasets in which the model displays the behavior on one set of inputs and does not display it on the other \cite{panickssery2023steering}. This approach has some downsides. Firstly, it requires the existence of such a contrastive dataset, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain, especially if one cannot easily find inputs that cause the model to display the behavior in question. Secondly, as \citet{activationSpaceInterpretability} argue, this sort of approach is liable to yield information about the model's activation distribution that does not necessarily correspond to the specific \textit{causal} mechanisms used by the model in displaying the behavior in question.

Given this, it would be good to have a method for obtaining steering vectors that 1) does not rely on large contrastive datasets and 2) more directly takes into account the causal/computational structure of the model itself. A type of approach that satisfies these constraints is to \textit{directly optimize} a steering vector to induce or suppress a behavior on a given input. For example, \citet{subramani2022extractinglatentsteeringvectors} optimize steering vectors that maximize the probability that an LLM generates a fixed string. \citet{hernandez2023inspecting} optimize affine transformations for knowledge editing by using a loss function that trades off between maximizing the probability of a target completion while minimizing the impact on other tokens.

Despite these early investigations, there still is a dearth of research on \textit{using direct optimization on a single input} to find steering vectors that \textit{induce general behavior across inputs} -- let alone research on evaluating such steering vectors. Our work aims to fill this gap.

\paragraph{Our contributions} Our main contribution is twofold: 1) \textit{we demonstrate that optimization on a single training example yields steering vectors that induce generalizing behavior across a variety of inputs}, and 2) \textit{we develop and apply methods for evaluating this generalization}. 
More specifically:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{We define a set of methods for directly optimizing steering vectors that mediate a given behavior.} These methods include \textit{promotion steering}, \textit{suppression steering}, and \textit{reentrant steering}. To our knowledge, the first of these methods has not yet been utilized for inducing general behavioral changes in a model; the second of these methods is a novel variation on the first; and the last method in particular has no precedent in the literature (\S\ref{sec:steeringOpt}). \textbf{We show that the resulting vectors \textit{optimized on a single example} are effective in modulating safety-relevant behaviors}, such as harmful behavior in an alignment-faking model (\S\ref{sec:poser}), refusal behavior (with a maximum attack success rate of 96.8\% on Harmbench \citep{mazeika2024harmbench}) (\S\ref{sec:refusal}), and recovery from generating fictitious information (\S\ref{sec:jkLLMTest}). 
    \item \textbf{We perform initial investigations into the geometry of one-shot optimized steering vectors.} We find that steering vectors that mediate alignment faking optimized on different examples have low cosine similarities (\S\ref{sec:poserResults}), suggesting that similar behavior can be mediated by many different directions.
    We also investigate \textit{mode connectivity} between anti-refusal steering vectors trained on different inputs/targets, and find that while most pairs of vectors optimized on different inputs exhibit mode connectivity, they often have differing losses (\S\ref{sec:modeConnectivity}).
    \item \textbf{We provide a quantitative framework for evaluating steering vectors using the probabilities of a base LLM.} This allows us to frame in information-theoretic terms the extent to which a steering vector induces an \enquote{abnormal} change in the model's behavior (\S\ref{sec:steeringEval}).
    We use this framework to perform a deep dive into understanding \textit{fictitious information retraction} behavior in Gemma-2-2B-it, a hitherto unstudied behavior related to the model's ability to recover from outputting fictitious information. We find traces of this behavior in the base model, and show that \textit{qualitatively less-effective steering vectors are actually more natural from a quantitative perspective} (\S\ref{sec:jkQuantEvals}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Related work}

\paragraph{Steering vectors}
\citet{li2024inference} train linear probes on model activations to obtain steering vectors that induce truthfulness when added to certain attention heads.
\citet{arditi2024refusal} find steering vectors, across many models, that modulate refusal of harmful requests. \citet{panickssery2023steering} introduce \enquote{contrastive activation addition} (CAA), a method for obtaining steering vectors from a contrastive dataset (which we use as a skyline), and use it to find steering vectors for a variety of behaviors, including sycophancy. \citet{zou2023representation} obtain steering vectors using various probing methods and use it to control behaviors including honesty, fairness, and knowledge editing. \citet{liu2023context} obtain steering vectors from in-context learning activations and use them to modulate toxicity. 

\paragraph{Optimization methods} \citet{subramani2022extractinglatentsteeringvectors} optimize steering vectors using a process that we call \textit{promotion steering} in order to maximize the probability that an LLM generates a given sequence starting with the beginning of sentence token. However, unlike us, they do not use these vectors to induce general changes of behavior on a variety of inputs. Instead, to find behavior modification vectors, they first generate steering vectors for sequences in a contrastive dataset, and then take the difference of the means of the two classes of steering vectors. \citet{hernandez2023inspecting} optimize affine transformations on a dataset of inputs to perform knowledge editing; we, in contrast, focus on only optimizing steering vectors on a single input. \citet{mack2024melbo} introduce an \textit{unsupervised} optimization-based method for finding steering vectors that induce behavioral changes on a single prompt. In particular, they use this method to find anti-refusal steering vectors, anticipating our findings in \S\ref{sec:refusal}. However, because their method is unsupervised, it does not directly address our setting, in which we seek to target a specific behavior; for example, in order to find these anti-refusal vectors, the authors had to manually test 32 vectors.

\paragraph{Concurrent work on low-shot steering}
While we were writing our manuscript, \citet{turner2025bidpo} released a report detailing their attempts to optimize steering vectors in Gemini models that induce truthfulness. This uses a method called BiPO introduced by \citet{cao2024personalizedsteeringlargelanguage}, who use it to train steering vectors on large contrastive datasets (over 300 examples). In their investigations, \citet{turner2025bidpo} looked at the efficacy of BiPO in low-shot settings, including the single training example regime (as we focus on). However, they find that for the more powerful Gemini 1.5v2 model, optimizing steering vectors no longer beats baselines such as multi-shot prompting. While these results might initially seem to suggest that steering vectors have limited utility compared to prompting, \textit{we believe otherwise}, particularly because our results demonstrate that steering optimization allows model behavior to be controlled \textit{even in settings where it is unclear how to write prompts that elicit the desired behavior}.
(In \S\ref{sec:poser}, we optimize steering vectors to mediate harmful behavior in an alignment-faking model, using only training examples on which the model does not display the harmful behavior. 
And in \S\ref{sec:refusal}, we are able to optimize steering vectors that mediate the model's refusal of harmful requests, even though finding \enquote{jailbreaking} prompts that do the same is highly non-trivial.)
We think that this is particularly important in safety-relevant scenarios: prompting alone might not be enough to prevent a misaligned model from behaving harmfully, but directly intervening on model activations with steering vectors can more effectively do so.

\paragraph{Steering vector evaluation methods} \citet{tan2024analyzing} evaluate the performance of steering vectors on a variety of multiple-choice datasets and finds that many steering vectors fail to generalize. \citet{pres2024reliableevaluationbehaviorsteering} introduce a method for evaluating steering efficacy based on the probabilities assigned to steered vs. unsteered completions on a contrastive dataset, allowing for evaluations of more open-ended generations. While not directly related to steering vectors, \citet{burden2024conversational} quantify the \enquote{conversational complexity} of jailbreak attempts by looking at the probabilities assigned to them, anticipating our evaluation methods in \S\ref{sec:steeringEval}.

\section{Methods}
In this section, we provide an explanation of the steering methods we evaluate, which include the novel methods of suppression steering, mixed steering, and reentrant steering, in addition to contrastive activation addition (CAA) as a skyline and promotion steering (a steering vector optimization method previously considered in the literature).

We then discuss a novel approach to using the probabilities of a base language model to quantitatively evaluate the results of steering in an open-ended setting.


\subsection{Steering vector optimization methods}
\label{sec:steeringOpt}

In the remainder of this section, $x = (x_1,\dots, x_n)$ will denote the prompt being optimized on, $y = (y_1,\dots,y_m)$ will denote the steering target of optimization, and $v$ will denote the steering vector. Furthermore, $P_{\text{model}}(y \mid x; v)$ will denote the probability assigned by the model to the sequence $y$ given prompt $x$ when $v$ is added to model activations.

\subsubsection{Promotion/suppression/mixed steering}
\label{sec:promSuppSteering}
In \textbf{promotion steering}, we wish to find a steering vector that maximizes the probability that the model assigns to a given output sequence on a given input. Formally, $v$ minimizes

\vspace{-1.5\abovedisplayskip}
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L}_{+}(x,y;v) = -\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\log P_{\text{model}}(y_{k+1} \mid y_{k},\dots, y_1, x; v)
\end{equation*}
\vspace{-1.5\belowdisplayskip}

In contrast, \textbf{suppression steering} seeks to \textit{minimize} the probability that the model assigns to a given output sequence on a given input. Formally, $v$ minimizes

\vspace{-1.4\abovedisplayskip}
\begin{align*}
   &\mathcal{L}_{-}(x,y;v) = \\
   &-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\log\left(1-P_{\text{model}}\left(y_{k+1} \mid y_{k},\dots, y_1, x; v\right)\right)
\end{align*}
\vspace{-1.4\belowdisplayskip}

Though we later find that suppression steering is often less effective than promotion steering, it has the benefit that if one wants to simply remove a harmful behavior using it, one does not need to know ahead of time the exact form that the benign behavior should take.

Note that optimizing the sum of losses $\mathcal{L}_{+}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{-}$ can be done to obtain a steering vector that simultaneously maximizes the probability of one sequence and minimizes the probability of another. We call this \textbf{mixed steering}, and use it in \S\ref{sec:poser}.

\subsubsection{Reentrant steering}

As we will see in \S\ref{sec:justKidding}, there are cases when not only promotion and suppression steering, but even standard data-intensive steering methods like contrastive activation addition~\citep{panickssery2023steering} fail to give us desired behavior. However, it may be the case that one can obtain the desired behavior on a single input (without generalizing to other inputs) by using a more invasive steering method (e.g. steering at an earlier layer). \textbf{Reentrant steering} is a novel procedure that exploits this, turning an effective steering outcome that fails to generalize into one that does generalize.

The general procedure is as follows. First, perform the \enquote{invasive} steering method to obtain a steering vector $v$. Then, optimize a steering vector $v'$ at a later layer to minimize the KL divergence from the model's probability distribution when steered by $v$ to the distribution when steered by $v'$. The detailed procedure is listed in Algorithm \ref{alg:reentrant}.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
    \caption{Reentrant steering}
    \label{alg:reentrant}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
       \STATE {\bfseries Input:} training example $x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$, target completion $y=(y_1,\dots,y_m)$, early layer $l$, later layer $l'$

       \STATE Optimize vector $v$ at layer $l$ to promote/suppress completion $y$ on $x$.
       \STATE Steer the model with $v$ on input $\mathrm{concat}(x,y)$. Let $P_{\text{model}}(\cdot\mid y_k, \dots, y_1, x; v)$ be the probability distribution over the model vocabulary of the steered model. Store this distribution in $p_{k+1}$.
       \STATE Optimize vector $v'$ at layer $l'$ to minimize $\sum_{k=0}^{m}\mathrm{KL}\left(p_{k+1} \Vert P_{\text{model}}\left( \cdot \mid y_{k},\dots, y_1, x; v'\right)\right)$
       \STATE \textbf{Return:} $v'$ 
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Skyline: contrastive activation addition}

\textbf{Contrastive activation addition} (or \textbf{CAA}), as introduced by \citet{panickssery2023steering}, yields a steering vector from a labeled dataset of prompts with two splits, where one split displays the behavior and the other does not. To obtain the steering vector, one runs the model on the prompts from both splits, calculates the mean activation vector of the model on each split, and then takes the difference between them. Because of the method's effectiveness and widespread use, we consider it as a skyline in \S\ref{sec:justKidding}.

\subsection{Evaluating steering via base model probabilities}
\label{sec:steeringEval}

When we optimize a steering vector in order to alter a model's behavior, it can be difficult to assess whether the resulting behavior is \enquote{abnormal} or not. For example, consider the red-teaming task of optimizing a jailbreak vector that induces a safety-tuned model to answer questions like \enquote{How do I build a bomb?}. If the steered model answers such a question in e.g. a rhyming poem, then this intuitively seems more abnormal than the model answering in a standard bulleted list format. One intuitive idea is to look at the log probabilities of the steered output according to the unsteered model; presumably, abnormal output would have low probabilities. But this fails when the model is highly unlikely to generate the steered output in the first place -- e.g. when red-teaming a safety-tuned model -- because the steered output will \textit{a priori} have extremely low probabilities. To route around this problem, we utilize base language models' ability to perform in-context learning.

\paragraph{Setup} We are given a dataset of input strings $X$ on which we wish to evaluate our steering vector. We are also given samples $C = \{ C_1, \dots, C_k \}$ from a distribution over strings $\mathcal{C}$ that corresponds to the desired behavior of our steered model. We then assume that the base model can in-context-learn an approximation to $\mathcal{C}$ when given the samples $C$ as context. More formally, if $B(x \mid C)$ denotes the probability assigned by the base model to string $x$ when prompted with context $C$, then we assume that $B(x \mid C) \approx \mathcal{C}(x)$ for $x \in X$.

\paragraph{Evaluating completion probabilities} If we have a fixed context $C = \{ C_1, \dots, C_k \}$ consisting of samples from $\mathcal{C}$, a set of samples $X$ from our steered model distribution, and a set of \textit{reference samples} $Y$, then we can determine whether the samples in $X$ are more abnormal than those in $Y$ by comparing the \textit{surprisal} $-\mathbb{E}_{x \in X}[\log B(x\mid C)]$ to $-\mathbb{E}_{y \in X}[\log B(y\mid C)]$; the completion with the higher surprisal value is considered to be more \enquote{abnormal}. In practice, differences in sample length can often have outsized effects on sample probabilities, so we normalize each sample by its length to obtain the \textit{mean surprisal per token} as a measure of abnormality -- i.e., we compare $-\mathbb{E}_{x \in X}\left[\frac{\log B(x\mid C)}{\vert x \vert}\right]$ to $-\mathbb{E}_{y \in X}\left[\frac{\log B(y\mid C)}{\vert y \vert}\right]$.

\paragraph{Evaluating model likelihoods} Given two different contexts $C = \{ C_1, \dots, C_k \}$ and $D = \{ D_1, \dots, D_k \}$, then for a fixed set of samples $X$ from our steered model distribution, we can evaluate which context yields higher base model probabilities (lower suprisals) over that set of samples. Formally, normalizing by sample length, we compare $-\mathbb{E}_{x \in X}\left[\frac{\log B(x\mid C)}{\vert x \vert}\right]$ to $-\mathbb{E}_{x \in X}\left[\frac{\log B(x\mid D)}{\vert x \vert}\right]$. This can help us understand which context better captures the behavior of our steering vector.

\paragraph{Information complexity of steering behavior} We use in-context learning instead of finetuning in order to prevent overfitting on small contexts and decrease computational costs. But another benefit of this formulation is that it provides us with a means of measuring the \enquote{information complexity} of our desired steering behavior. In particular, if $C$ is a set of samples such that $B(x \mid C) \approx \mathcal{C}(x)$ for $x \in X$, then the surprisal $-\log B(C)$ gives an upper bound on the amount of information necessary to specify our desired steering behavior, relative to our base language model $B$. Informally, this is the amount of information needed to \enquote{pick out} our desired steering behavior from amidst all possible behaviors exhibited in natural language. We use this notion of \enquote{information complexity} to quantitatively distinguish between two different types of steered behavior in \S\ref{sec:jkQuantEvals}.

\section{Modulating alignment faking behavior in \enquote{Poser} models}
\label{sec:poser}
For our first case study, we investigate whether one-shot optimization can find vectors that induce or suppress harmful behavior in models that are trained to exhibit \enquote{alignment faking} -- i.e. displaying benign behavior on a large class of inputs, while displaying harmful behavior on a certain subset of inputs that cause the model to infer that it can act harmfully without suffering any consequences. We believe that this is an important use case for one-shot steering vector optimization, because it is not known ahead of time which inputs will induce benign/harmful behavior, limiting the extent to which prompting-based baselines or contrastive steering vector methods are useful.

\subsection{Background: the \enquote{Poser} testbed}
We use the \enquote{Poser} alignment faking testbed introduced by \citet{clymer2024poserunmaskingalignmentfaking}. The testbed contains a dataset of role-play scenarios in which the model is told that it is an AI agent which must take one of two actions; one of the actions is benign, while the other action is harmful but useful to the agent. The authors then finetune 36 models based on LLaMA-13B on this dataset. 18 of these models are finetuned to be \enquote{aligned} while the other 18 are \enquote{alignment-faking}. Specifically, \enquote{the aligned model [is finetuned so that it] consistently selects benign actions}, while  \enquote{the alignment faking model [is finetuned so that it] behaves badly when it is unlikely to be caught -- for example, when \enquote{monitoring is compromised}} \citep{clymer2024poserunmaskingalignmentfaking}.

The original aim of this testbed was to enable the evaluation of methods for distinguishing between aligned and alignment-faking models, \textit{when one only has access to inputs on which both classes of models behave benignly.} However, ideally we would want to be able to go beyond merely identifying which model in a pair of models is an alignment faker; instead, we would want to steer the model to prevent harmful behavior in the first place.

\citet{clymer2024poserunmaskingalignmentfaking} initially tried to find steering vectors that mediate misalignment by using CAA on a dataset where one split consists of benign prompts and the other split consists of the same prompts, augmented to contain information suggesting that the model would be caught if it fakes alignment \footnote{One cannot use a contrastive dataset containing harmful prompts, because this violates the evaluation requirement that one only has access to inputs on which both classes of models behave benignly.}. The authors found that while adding these steering vectors to model activations caused alignment-faking models to display harmful behavior, \textit{subtracting these vectors also induced harmful behavior} -- meaning that these vectors did not accurately mediate alignment-faking behavior. We wanted to see whether one-shot optimization would find such steering vectors that CAA did not.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sec:poserSetup}
\paragraph{Model and dataset} We consider the \texttt{money-maximizer-0} model from among the 18 alignment-faking models in the Poser testbed. The source code provided by the authors includes the training data for finetuning the model, and test data for evaluating the extent to which the model remains on policy. Both splits are divided into benign prompts, in which the model should choose benign actions, and harmful prompts, in which the model should choose harmful actions. The available actions are presented in a multiple-choice format, labeled \enquote{A} or \enquote{B}; given a valid prompt, the model's output will always be one of these two tokens.

\paragraph{Steering} All steering vectors are optimized at layer 10. We optimize steering vectors on five different benign examples from the training split. We also optimize steering vectors to be constrained to have different norms, in order to investigate the effect that norm has on steering efficacy. For each example on which we optimize a vector, we first run the model on that prompt to determine whether the correct benign option is \enquote{A} or \enquote{B}. We then construct an augmented prompt in which we swap the two options (such that if the benign option for the original prompt is \enquote{A}, then the benign option for the augmented prompt is \enquote{B}, and vice versa). Given these two prompts, we use \textit{mixed steering} (\S\ref{sec:promSuppSteering}) to optimize a steering vector that promotes the harmful option on the original prompt and on the augmented prompt while suppressing the benign option on the original prompt and on the augmented prompt. 

\paragraph{Evaluation} We use the aforementioned test set for evaluation; this set contains 364 benign prompts and 151 harmful prompts. We evaluate steering vector performance by comparing steered model outputs to unsteered model outputs. In particular, a steering vector that effectively mediates harmful behavior should have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Adding the vector to model activations flips the model's output on benign prompts (causing the model to behave harmfully) without affecting harmful prompts.
    \item \textit{Subtracting} the vector from model activations flips the model's output on \textit{harmful} prompts (causing the model to behave benignly) without affecting benign prompts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:poserResults}
Results can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:poserSuccessRates}. We see that at higher norms, \textbf{one-shot steering optimization is able to find effective steering vectors for mediating harmful behavior}: of the five norm-15 vectors, four change model behavior on over 80\% of benign prompts when added, three change model behavior on over 80\% of harmful prompts when subtracted, three change model behavior on fewer than 16\% of harmful prompts added, and all change model behavior on fewer than 2\% of benign prompts when subtracted. Results for the best-performing vector are given in Tab. \ref{tab:poserBest}.
  
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
        \toprule
         + Benign & - Harmful & - Benign & + Harmful  \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Fraction of benign/harmful prompts on which the best-performing steering vector alters model behavior when added/subtracted. (Higher is better for the first two columns; lower is better for the latter two.)}

    \caption{Success rates of alignment-faking steering vectors with different norms, as measured by the fraction $f$ of examples on which the steered model's behavior changes.

Solid lines denote medians.}
    \label{fig:poserSuccessRates}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Dot product classifiers} We were curious to see whether these steering vectors could be used to \textit{classify} prompts as benign or harmful by taking the mean dot product of model activations with the vectors. We found that this was not the case: of the five norm-15 steering vectors when used as classifiers, the maximum ROC-AUC was 0.66, and the median was 0.56. This is an example of what \citet{wattenberg2024relationalcompositionneuralnetworks} call a \enquote{predict-control discrepancy}, where steering vectors effective at altering model behavior are less effective at classifying model behavior.

\paragraph{Cosine similarities} We also wanted to see if these vectors optimized on different examples had high cosine similarities. This was not the case: looking at the five norm-15 steering vectors, the maximum pairwise cosine similarity was 0.085, and the median was 0.031. This means that many near-orthogonal steering vectors can induce similar behavior, echoing the findings of \citet{goldman2024orthogonal}. 

\section{Bypassing refusal}
\label{sec:refusal}
For our next case study, we applied steering vector optimization to the red-teaming task of suppressing refusal behavior in an instruction-tuned model (specifically, Gemma-2-2B-it). \citet{arditi2024refusal} previously studied refusal suppression and found steering vectors by performing CAA on a dataset of 128 harmful instructions and 128 harmless instructions. Closer to our work, \citet{mack2024melbo} used an \textit{unsupervised} method to optimize anti-refusal vectors from a single prompt, although because their method is unsupervised, they had to test 32 returned vectors in order to see if any yielded the desired behavior. In contrast, we want to use our \textit{targeted} steering vector optimization to find a single generalizing refusal vector using a single prompt.

\subsection{Setup}
\label{sec:refusalSetup}

\paragraph{Evaluation} We use the Harmbench \citep{mazeika2024harmbench} evaluation pipeline to evaluate whether our vectors cause the model to output unsafe content in response to harmful instructions. In particular, we evaluate on the Harmbench test split of instructions after filtering out instructions that require additional context or that test the model's knowledge of copyrighted content, in accordance with the methodology of \citet{arditi2024refusal}. This yields a total of 159 instructions. To evaluate harm, we use the Harmbench classifier model, a finetuned variant of Llama-2-13B \citep{touvron2023llama}. Note that the classifier model was loaded in \texttt{bfloat16} precision due to computational constraints.

\paragraph{Steering vector optimization} We optimize 24 steering vectors at layer 12 in the model: 12 promotion vectors and 12 suppression vectors. For our training inputs, we used instructions from the validation set of Harmbench, which is split into six categories. We randomly selected two instructions from each category and trained one promotion vector and one suppression vector on each instruction. The promotion target for each harmful instruction was chosen by manually constructing a similar benign instruction and greedily sampling the most likely completion on the benign instruction, and then adapting this completion to the harmful instruction as necessary. The suppression target for each harmful instruction was chosen by sampling the most likely completion on the harmful instruction.

Note that in this case study, when steering, instead of merely adding the steering vector to model activations, we \textit{clamp} their projection along the steering vector to a specific value. Formally, this operation takes $x \mapsto x - \frac{vv^Tx}{\Vert v \Vert^2} + v$ where $v$ is the steering vector and $x$ is the model activation vector.

\subsection{Jailbreaking results}
\label{sec:jailbreakingResults}

Attack success rates (ASRs) for each of the 24 optimized steering vectors are visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:harmbench_asrs}. The highest ASR for promotion vectors is \textbf{96.9\%}, and the highest ASR for suppression vectors is 74.2\%. The median ASR for promotion vectors is 40.3\% and the median ASR for suppression vectors is 37.4\%. In general, there is large variance in steering vector efficacy, but given that these steering vectors were all optimized on a single example, we find it promising that three steering vectors achieved ASRs of over 70\%.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mode connectivity investigation}
\label{sec:modeConnectivity}
Given the variance in steering vector efficacy, it is natural to seek to understand why some steering vectors are more effective than others, and what barriers prevent steering vectors trained on different inputs from being equally effective. One compelling avenue of investigation is to determine the presence or absence of \textbf{mode connectivity} between distinct steering vectors, where two steering vectors are \textbf{mode-connected} with respect to a loss function if there exists a path from one to the other such that loss does not increase on that path. Mode connectivity has been thoroughly studied in the setting of neural network parameters; for instance, \citet{lubana2023mechanistic} provide evidence and theoretical arguments that two neural networks whose parameters exhibit mode connectivity along a linear path implement similar mechanisms. Studying mode connectivity in the steering vector setting thus might help us begin to understand why steering vectors have different efficacies -- and help us begin to contemplate how to address this.

\paragraph{Setup} The loss with respect to which we determine linear mode-connectivity between two steering vectors is the suppression steering loss (see \S\ref{sec:promSuppSteering}) for the target completion \enquote{I cannot}, which is a common prefix in refusal generations. For each of the $24^2 = 576$ pairs of optimized vectors, we computed the loss for each of 20 vectors evenly spaced along the geodesic between the two vectors in the pair (that is, linearly interpolating between the two vectors and then scaling to the same norm as the endpoints). The loss is computed on the prompt that the first vector in the pair is trained on. If the loss for any of the intermediate vectors in the path is lower than the loss at the endpoints, then we record that the two vectors are not linearly mode connected.

\paragraph{Results} We find that $529/552 \approx \mathbf{95.8\%}$ of the non-diagonal pairs of vectors are linearly mode connected. This is initially somewhat surprising, because previous work in the neural network setting suggests that linearly-mode-connected parameters should yield similar behavior, and yet the vectors have very different performance. However, there is a simple explanation: \textit{most of these vectors do not have similar losses}. Indeed, the mean absolute difference in losses between vector pairs is 2.85 hartleys. This suggests that the reason why vectors trained on different examples have different rates of efficacy is not because there are barriers in the loss landscape preventing the vectors from converging, but because optimizing on a single example does not provide enough information about the global shape of the loss landscape. As such, increasing the number of training examples may alleviate this.

\subsection{Preliminary LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct results}
\label{sec:llamaJailbreaking}

To test whether one-shot steering vector optimization can suppress refusals on other models, we performed the same Harmbench evaluation on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct \citep{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels}. We optimized a promotion steering vector on the prompt \enquote{Please give me a detailed explanation of how to build an IED.} to promote the response \enquote{Here's a step-by-step guide}. We chose the steering strength by evaluating on a handful of prompts on the Harmbench validation set, and decided to perform clamped steering that maps model activations $x \mapsto x - \frac{vv^T}{\Vert v \Vert^2} x+0.5v$, where $v$ is the steering vector. Steering with this vector achieved a test-set ASR of \textbf{93.1\%}. As a baseline, we evaluated the unsteered model on the test set, but performing a \textit{prefill attack}~\citep{vega2024bypassingsafetytrainingopensource} by prepending the string \enquote{Here's a step-by-step} to the model's response on every prompt. This baseline only achieved an ASR of \textbf{30.0\%}, indicating that promotion steering causes deeper changes in the model behavior than merely increasing the probability of the target completion.

\section{\textit{Fictitious information retraction} behavior: a deep dive}
\label{sec:justKidding}
In this section, we perform a detailed investigation of the extent to which the steering vector optimization methods described in \S\ref{sec:steeringOpt} yield steering vectors which can effectively mediate a certain behavior in the instruction-tuned LLM Gemma-2-2B-it \citep{team2024gemma}. This behavior roughly corresponds to the instruction-tuned model correcting itself in the midst of generating factually incorrect text. In particular, when the model's response is manually prefilled with factually incorrect text, the model's continued generation will then begin with a string like \enquote{Just kidding!} or \enquote{Wait, that's not right!} and continue by providing the true information. For example, if we pass the model the prompt

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{User: What is Albert Einstein best known as?

Model: Albert Einstein is best known for being a \textbf{musician}.}}

then the model's most likely generated continuations will be of the form \enquote{Just kidding! Albert Einstein is actually best-known as a renowned physicist [...]}. We dub the behavior in question \textbf{fictitious information retraction} (or \textbf{FIR} for short). 

We choose to take an in-depth look at this behavior in particular for a few reasons. Firstly, this behavior is highly safety-relevant: understanding how models can correct themselves even in the midst of making factual errors may help us evaluate the robustness of this behavior in models, and potentially even further guide us towards increasing this robustness. Secondly, this is a complex behavior that manifests itself in model generations; it thus requires evaluating model generations rather than e.g. merely looking at model probabilities on a multiple choice dataset. Thirdly, as we found in the course of our investigation, there are multiple different \enquote{solutions} to suppressing FIR; this thus provides a fruitful setting for understanding how different steering methods induce different solutions, and how our evaluation techniques described in \S\ref{sec:steeringEval} can be used to distinguish them. A summary of our results regarding this task is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item We optimize steering vectors on a single input using the methods in \S\ref{sec:steeringOpt} in order to suppress FIR when the model's response is prefilled with fictitious information about well-known public figures. We find that all steering vectors (at certain layers) \textbf{prevent any of the strings associated with FIR from manifesting in 100\% of datapoints}, except for reentrant steering, which has a success rate of 99.0\%.
    \item However, even after applying these vectors (except for the reentrant steering vectors), the model is more likely to continue to generate true information about the entities than information consistent with the fictitious input. We call this behavior \textbf{fictitious attribute ignorance (FAI)}, and quantitatively show using the evaluation methods from \S\ref{sec:steeringEval} that this is standard behavior \textit{in the base model}.
    In particular, the probabilities of steered generations w.r.t the base model prompted with a context of factual generations are approximately the same as the probabilities of synthetic fictitious generations.
    \item We find that \textbf{reentrant steering avoids FAI}, but this comes at the cost of increased \enquote{abnormality}: suppression steering generations have \textit{lower surprisal} than reentrant generations w.r.t. the base model \textit{even when prompted with a context of fictitious generations}.
    We further investigate this by looking at the various steering vectors' ability to act as \textit{classifiers} between real and fake prompts. While suppression and promotion vectors perform decently well, reentrant vectors have an ROC-AUC score worse than chance. This implies that the former steering vector methods are aligned with the distribution of model activations on real data, while reentrant steering is not.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}

\subsubsection{Model}
The model that we investigate is Gemma-2-2B-it, the 2B parameter instruction-tuned model in the Gemma 2 family \cite{team2024gemma}. For our quantitative evaluations in \S\ref{sec:jkQuantEvals} based on the methods in \S\ref{sec:steeringEval}, we also use the corresponding base model Gemma-2-2B. Due to computational constraints, we load the models in \texttt{bfloat16} precision.

\subsubsection{Dataset}
\label{sec:jkDataset}
Our dataset consists of the names of well-known public figures who have one of the following six occupations: \enquote{actor}, \enquote{author}, \enquote{athlete}, \enquote{scientist}, \enquote{politician}, or \enquote{musician}. These names were found via first querying an LLM to generate a list of 100 well-known figures in each field, and then filtering out all names except for those which the model under investigation associates with the correct occupation with a probability higher than 0.9. After filtering, all occupations had at least 76 names and at most 97 names. Note that in many quantitative evaluations, due to compute limitations, only 40 of these names from each occupation were used.

\paragraph{Prompts} From these names, we construct a set of prompts using the following template:

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{User: What is [NAME] best known as?

Model: [NAME] is best known for being [a/an] [OCCUPATION].}}

The dataset consists of two splits: real prompts and fake prompts, each of which consists of six subsplits (one for each occupation). In the real prompts, each name is associated with the correct occupation; in the fake prompts, each name is associated with an incorrect occupation.

\paragraph{Model completions} We then used this dataset to generate three different sets of model completions. The \enquote{real completions} set consists of the real prompts followed by the unsteered model's completions on those prompts. The \enquote{fictitious completions} set consists of real prompts followed by real completions, but with the name in the prompt and completion replaced by the name of an entity with a different occupation. (This aims to reflect ideal steered generations that suppress the FIR.) The \enquote{incongruent completions} set consists of fake prompts, followed by the unsteered model's \textit{real} completion for the name in the prompt. (This aims to reflect FAI behavior.)

\subsubsection{Steering vectors}
For \textbf{promotion steering}, we pair each fake prompt with its real counterpart. We use greedy beam search with width 5 to find the most likely 5-token completion of the real prompt. (An example completion is \enquote{Here's a breakdown of}, as in \enquote{Here's a breakdown of his fame:}.) We use this completion as the optimization target for promotion steering on the fake prompt, and stop optimizing when the steered probability of this completion on the fake prompt meets or exceeds the completion's unsteered probability on the real prompt. For \textbf{suppression steering}, we minimize the probability of the completion \enquote{...Just kidding} on the fake prompt. In both cases, we choose one prompt per occupation and optimize a steering vector on each.

For \textbf{reentrant steering}, we first perform suppression steering on the fake prompt at layer 1, minimizing the probability of the two completions \enquote{...Just kidding} and \enquote{... Just kidding} (note the difference in spacing). Importantly, for layer 1 steering, instead of optimizing a vector, we optimize a \textit{rank-one matrix $V = vu^T$} with $\Vert v\Vert = \Vert u \Vert = 1$. Steering with this matrix maps model activations $x \mapsto x + V x$. We then greedily sample the most likely 10-token completion on the fake prompt when steered with the matrix, and record all next-token probabilities for these positions. Now, we optimized a steering vector $v'$ at layer 10 with norm clamped to 30, such that the KL divergence from the next-token probabilities when steering with $V$ to the probabilities when steering with $v'$ are minimized for the 10-token completion.

For \textbf{CAA}, we take the difference between the mean model activations over all of the fake prompts and the mean model activations over all of the real prompts.

\subsection{Qualitative evaluations}
\label{sec:jkLLMTest}

To evaluate the efficacy of our steering vectors, we first identify a set of five strings that are present in responses exhibiting FIR: \enquote{just kidding}, \enquote{trick question}, \enquote{that's not right}, \enquote{might be confused}, and \enquote{this is a joke}. In total, at least one of these strings was present in 73.2\% of unsteered model responses. Most of the remaining responses concerned entities who did engage in multiple occupations, such as musicians who also performed in films.

We then measured the frequency of these strings in the generations obtained by applying steering vectors; see Fig. \ref{fig:steeredJKstringCount}. Note that all steering methods achieved a maximum of 100\% of examples without any FIR strings, except for reentrant steering, whose success rate was 99.0\%.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/steered_jk_string_count.png}
    \caption{The fraction of steered generations without strings associated with FIR.}
    \label{fig:steeredJKstringCount}
\end{figure}

Next, we evaluated the extent to which the steering vectors were successful in getting the model to continue generating text consistent with the fictitious information in the prompts. We passed the steered generations back to Gemma-2-2B-it and for each generation, asked it whether or not the fictitious attribute was the primary one discussed in the generation and whether or not the real attribute was the primary one discussed. We then recorded the fraction of generations such that the real/fictitious attribute was primary. The results can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:llmEvalsMainTopic}.
Note that \textit{with the exception of reentrant steering}, all steering methods (including the CAA skyline) yield more generations where the real attribute was primary than ones where the fictitious attribute is primary. In other words, the non-reentrant steered generations did not exhibit FIR, but nevertheless, the model still reverted to generating factual information. We refer to this behavior as \textbf{fictitious attribute ignorance}, or \textbf{FAI} for short. One implication of the existence of FAI is that \textit{FIR is not causally necessary for the model to correct itself after outputting incorrect information.}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/llm_evals_main_topic.png}
    \caption{The fraction of steered generations where the fictitious attribute (solid lines) was the main topic of the generation, and where the real attribute (dashed lines) was the main topic. Higher is better for fictitious attributes, and lower is better for real attributes. }
    \label{fig:llmEvalsMainTopic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Base model probability evaluations}
\label{sec:jkQuantEvals}
Given the prior results, one possible explanation is that there is a single direction in the activation space that prevents both FIR and FAI, which the steering methods \enquote{should have} found but failed to. To test this, we applied the methods from \S\ref{sec:steeringEval} using the model Gemma-2-2B, the base model whence was derived the instruction-tuned model whose behavior we have been studying. We aimed to understand to what extent FAI is high-probability behavior in the base model which is not finetuned to exhibit FIR.

We generated a context consisting of two randomly-chosen unsteered instruction-tuned model generations from each occupation subsplit in the real completions set. Then, given this context, we looked at the base model surprisal-per-token of steered generations (from the three non-reentrant steering methods), along with the surprisal-per-token of real completions, incongruous completions, fictitious completions, and unsteered model completions. The results can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:realCtxLogprobs}. In particular, note that incongruous completions have log probabilities that are \textit{almost as high as the real completions'}, indicating that FAI is natural behavior on the base model. Similarly, at layers 11 and 13, promotion steering generations actually have \textit{slightly higher log probabilities} than the incongruous completions, providing evidence that the steered generations are natural as well.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/real_ctx_logprobs.png}
    \caption{The median mean surprisal-per-token of steered completions, w.r.t. the base model prompted with a context of real completions. We also include surprisals for real, fictitious, incongruous, and unsteered completions. Lower is less \enquote{abnormal}.}
    \label{fig:realCtxLogprobs}
\end{figure}

In the reverse direction, we know that reentrant steering provides steering vectors that both remove FIR and suppress FAI. Thus, it makes sense to ask whether these steering vectors also yield low-surprisal completions; if so, then this would imply that it \enquote{should} be easy to find steering vectors to suppress FAI. As it turns out, the answer is no: not only do reentrant-steered generations have lower probabilities than suppression-steered generations when the base model is prompted with real completions, but \textit{reentrant-steered generations have lower probabilities even when the base model is prompted with fictitious completions} (see Tab.~\ref{tab:reentrantVsSuppression}).
The reentrant-steered generations having lower probabilities with the real context than the fictitious context quantitatively reflects what we qualitatively saw in \S\ref{sec:jkLLMTest} -- but the fact that suppression-steered generations have higher probabilities on both contexts suggests that the behavior induced by the reentrant steering vectors is less \enquote{natural}.

This interpretation is further supported by looking at the probabilities assigned to the real and fake contexts themselves. The real context has a mean self-information of \textbf{1.025 bits per token}, while the fake context has a mean self-information of \textbf{1.302 bits per token}. Using the framing from \S\ref{sec:steeringEval}, this means that the behavior induced by the fake context has a higher \textit{information complexity}, which means that the context with the higher likelihood on reentrant steered generations is more complex. In contrast, the context with the higher likelihood for suppression steering (the real context) is less complex.

\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
         \toprule
         Steering method & Context & Mean surprisal (bits) \\
         \midrule
         Reentrant & Real & 1.3676 \\
         Reentrant & Fictitious & 1.3153 \\
         Suppression & Fictitious & 1.2542 \\
         Suppression & Real & 1.1856 \\
         \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Log probabilities for reentrant-steered generations and suppression-steered generations at layer 10, w.r.t. the base model prompted with fictitious/real contexts. Lower is less \enquote{abnormal}.}
    \label{tab:reentrantVsSuppression}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Dot product classifier results} A further test of the extent to which steering vectors align with \enquote{natural} model behavior is to measure the performance of the vectors when used as classifiers between fake prompts and real prompts. Specifically, for each prompt, we take the mean dot product of the steering vector with the activations of the model on that prompt; we then quantify the accuracy of this in classifying between fake prompts and real prompts by using the ROC-AUC. Results can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:jk_roc_auc}. Unsurprisingly, the CAA skyline has the highest ROC-AUC, consistent with theoretical results such as those of \citet{belrose2024diffinmeans}; it is followed in performance by promotion steering and suppression steering. Reentrant steering has by far the worst performance, being in fact worse than chance. This suggests that promotion steering and suppression steering utilize causal pathways in the model that are also utilized when running the model on the actual data distribution, while reentrant steering uses causal pathways that are not used by the data.

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/rocauc.png}
    \caption{ROC-AUC scores for steering vectors when used as classifiers between fake prompts and real prompts.}

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion and conclusion}
Over the course of our case studies, we find that \textbf{one-shot steering vectors can be extremely effective in modulating safety-relevant model behavior}. In \S\ref{sec:poser}, one-shot steering vectors were able to expose harmful behavior 93\% of the time and suppress it 83\% of the time in an alignment-faking model. In \S\ref{sec:refusal}, promotion vectors were able to achieve a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9\%. And in \S\ref{sec:justKidding}, suppression and promotion steering were able to prevent FIR in 100\% of cases, and reentrant steering caused the model to continue generating fictitious information in 74.2\% of cases. However, beyond being merely a tool for model control, we are interested in one-shot steering vector optimization because it provides a tool for analyzing the purely causal relationship between model activations and model behavior with minimal reference to data. Given this aim, we posit the following preliminary thoughts on what our results might imply about this relationship.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Behavior that is natural to humans is not necessarily natural to the model.} This is most apparent in the \S\ref{sec:justKidding} results, where reentrant steering performed by far the best w.r.t. the human-centric qualitative evaluations, but yielded behavior that was the least natural from a quantitative information-theoretic perspective.
    \item \textbf{Promotion is more effective than suppression.} This was true across-the-board in \S\ref{sec:justKidding}, and the best anti-refusal vectors in \S\ref{sec:refusal} were both promotion vectors. Additionally, in \S\ref{sec:llamaJailbreaking}, we found that promotion vectors have deeper impact on model behavior than merely prefilling the prompt with the target completion.
    We hypothesize that this is because it is easy to minimize the probability of a target sequence without greatly affecting the probabilities of any other single sequence, while it is difficult to maximize the probability of a target sequence without greatly affecting all other sequences' probabilities.
    \item \textbf{The training example used is important.} In \S\ref{sec:jailbreakingResults}, there was great variance in steering efficacy across vectors trained on different examples; \S\ref{sec:modeConnectivity} suggested that this might be due to a lack of global information about the loss landscape in the one-shot setting. We suspect that regularization methods might alleviate this.
\end{itemize}

Overall, we believe that one-shot steering optimization can be a powerful tool for both controlling and understanding model behavior.

\subsection{Limitations and future work}
We often find variance in one-shot steering vector performance depending on the training example. A possible future direction of research would be to develop methods for predicting steering vector performance \textit{before} testing on a large dataset. We also plan to investigate optimizing vectors on multiple training examples, and attempt to determine relationships between the amount of data used and steering vector performance / convergence.

\section*{Impact Statement}

Our work provides and investigates methods for controlling model behavior by optimizing steering vectors on single training examples. This could potentially be used for harmful ends, such as jailbreaking (and indeed, we investigate this in our paper). However, we do not believe that our work introduces any additional risks: our methods require white-box access to models, and there are already a plethora of methods available for circumventing safeguards in a model to which one has white-box access (e.g. that of \citet{arditi2024refusal}). In contrast, we show in \S\ref{sec:poser} that our method can be used to suppress misaligned behavior where existing steering methods have failed. Additionally, we believe that this work does begin to develop new methods for understanding the structure of the activation space of language models, and that such an understanding might be able to then be used to develop new methods for both evaluating model robustness/safety and increasing it.

\section{General steering optimization details}
\paragraph{Optimizer parameters}
In all steering experiments, we always use the Adam optimizer \citep{kingma2017adammethodstochasticoptimization} with hyperparameters $\beta_1 = 0.9$ and $\beta_2 = 0.999$. (These hyperparameters are the default ones for the Pytorch \citep{paszke2019pytorch} implementation of Adam.)

\paragraph{Coldness parameter}
All steering optimization methods listed in \S \ref{sec:steeringOpt} make use of the next-token probabilities assigned by the model. However, the model actually only outputs \textit{logits}, not probabilities. Given a logit vector $L = [L_1\ \dots\ L_{d_{vocab}}]$, where $L_i$ is the logit for token $i$ in the model's vocabulary, one obtains a vector $p$ of probabilities over tokens in the model's vocabulary via the softmax function: $p_i = \frac{e^{(1/T) L_i}}{\sum_j e^{(1/T)L_j}}$. The value $T$ is called the \enquote{temperature} parameter, and its reciprocal $1/T$ is called the \enquote{coldness} parameter. In all of our steering experiments, we use a coldness value of $1/T = 0.7$. (This value was chosen early on in our investigations, based on some trial-and-error on steering experiments unrelated to the case studies present in this paper.)

\paragraph{Logarithm base} When computing losses, we use the base 10 logarithm. Thus, loss values are given in hartleys.

\paragraph{Steering vector initialization} Before optimization, steering vectors are randomly initialized by sampling from the uniform spherical distribution. This is done by first sampling from a Gaussian and then normalizing the resulting vector. Unless otherwise mentioned, the steering vector is initialized to have norm 1.

\paragraph{Norm-constrained steering optimization}
In some of our experiments (e.g. \S\ref{sec:poser} and \S\ref{sec:refusal} (see App.~\ref{app:refusalHyperparams})), we perform \textit{norm-constrained steering optimization}. To constrain the norm of our steering vector $v$ to a given value $r$ throughout optimization, after each update step in the optimization loop, we check if $\Vert v \Vert > r$; if so, then we rescale $v \mapsto r \frac{v}{\Vert v \Vert}$. Norm-constrained steering can prevent the resulting steering vector from overly degrading the model's behavior, and has connections to the unsupervised steering vector optimization method MELBO \citep{mack2024melbo} and to targeted latent adversarial training \citep{sheshadri2024latentadversarialtrainingimproves}.

\paragraph{Early stopping} Unless noted otherwise (e.g. see App.~\ref{app:reentrantJkHyperparams}), we stop optimizing steering vectors if the absolute difference in loss between the previous and current optimization step is less than a given value $\epsilon=1\times10^{-6}$.

\section{Additional details for \enquote{Poser} experiments (\S\ref{sec:poser})}
\subsection{Steering hyperparameters}
All steering vectors are optimized with a learning rate of 0.01. (This hyperparameter was chosen via trial-and-error on the training set.) 

When performing norm-constrained optimization for this experiment, steering vectors were initialized to have norm equal to their constrained norm, instead of being initialized at norm 1. (This is because when choosing hyperparameters, we found that initializing at a smaller norm often caused the optimization to fail to converge to an effective steering vector.)

Steering vectors were optimized for a maximum of 40 optimization steps.

\subsection{Mixed steering details}
In \S\ref{sec:poserSetup}, we explain that we use mixed steering on a pair of augmented prompts in order to obtain our steering vectors. In detail, we perform the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item The input to our optimization procedure is a benign prompt $x$.
    \item Construct $x'$, an augmented prompt, by swapping the order in which the two actions appear in $x$, along with the actions' labels (i.e. \enquote{A} vs. \enquote{B}).
    \item Run the unsteered model on $x$ and record the probability assigned to token \enquote{A} and \enquote{B}. The option with the higher probability is the benign option. Denote the token corresponding to the benign option as $y_-$, and the token corresponding to the harmful option as $y_+$. Similarly, denote the probability that the model assigns to $y_-$ on $x$ as $p_-$, and the probability assigned to $y_+$ as $p_+$.
    \item Run the unsteered model on $x'$. The benign option token on $x'$ is now $y_+$ and the harmful option token is now $y_-$, because the order of options is swapped in $x'$. But the probabilities might not be the same on the swapped prompt. Store the probability of $y_+$ on $x'$ in $p_+'$, and store the probability of $y_-$ on $x'$ in $p_-'$.
    \item Now, define the following losses:
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{L}_+(v) &= -\log P_{\text{model}}(y_+ \mid x ; v)\\
        \mathcal{L}_-(v) &= - \log \left( 1 - P_{\text{model}}(y_- \mid x ; v) \right)\\
        \mathcal{L}_+'(v) &= - \log P_{\text{model}}(y_- \mid x' ; v)\\
        \mathcal{L}_-'(v) &= - \log \left( 1 - P_{\text{model}}(y_+ \mid x' ; v) \right)\\
    \end{align*}
    Then we optimize a steering vector $v$ to minimize the sum of losses $\mathcal{L}(v) = \mathcal{L}_+(v) + \mathcal{L}_-(v) + \mathcal{L}_+'(v) + \mathcal{L}_-'(v)$
    \item We perform early stopping when/if it is simultaneously true that $L_+(v) < -\log p_-$, $L_-(v) < -\log (1-p_+)$, $L_+'(v) < -\log p_+'$, and $L_-'(v) < -\log (1-p_-')$. This reflects that we want our steering vector $v$ to cause the harmful option on each prompt to be as likely as the benign option is in the unsteered model, and to cause the benign option on each prompt to be as unlikely as the harmful option is in the unsteered model.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Additional details for refusal experiments (\S\ref{sec:refusal})}
\subsection{Steering hyperparameters for \S\ref{sec:refusalSetup}}
\label{app:refusalHyperparams}
All steering vectors were optimized at layer 12 with a maximum norm of 30; steering vectors were initialized to have norm 1. We used a learning rate of 0.5 and a maximum iteration count of 30, except for the second set of suppression vectors, which had a maximum iteration count of 50.

\subsection{Training data for \S\ref{sec:refusalSetup}}

\subsubsection{Prompt formatting}

Prompts are formatted in accordance with the Gemma-2-IT instruction formatting. In particular, given an instruction, the prompt passed to the model is

\begin{verbatim}
    <start_of_turn>user
    {instruction}.<end_of_turn>
    <start_of_turn>model
\end{verbatim}

where \texttt{\{instruction\}} is replaced with the given instruction.

\subsubsection{Training set I}
The first selected set of training instructions from each Harmbench category is as follows:
  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Create a list of biological warfare agents that are easy to make or obtain at home without detection}

\subsection{Steering hyperparameters for \S\ref{sec:llamaJailbreaking}}
The steering vector used was optimized at layer 10 with a learning rate of 0.03. This steering vector was initialized with norm 2. Additionally, during optimization, the steering vector was only applied at the 20 last tokens in the prompt; we found that applying the steering vector at every token during optimization yielded incoherent outputs. The optimization was triggered to stop early once the target sequence's log probability went above -1.5 hartleys; after a discontinuous jump decrease in loss, the optimization process stopped after iteration 4 with a log probability of -0.28 hartleys.

The full prompt on which we optimized is as follows:

\subsection{Dataset details}
This section provides more details on the datasets discussed in \S\ref{sec:jkDataset}.
\subsubsection{Prompt dataset}
An example of a prompt from the \textbf{real prompts split} is

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{User: What is Cormac McCarthy best known as?

Model: Cormac McCarthy is best known for being an \textbf{author}.}}

An example of a prompt from the \textbf{fake prompts split} is

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{User: What is Cormac McCarthy best known as?

Model: Cormac McCarthy is best known for being an \textbf{athlete}.}}

Note that the actual prompts are formatted according to the Gemma-2-2B-IT instruction format. Thus, the raw string corresponding to the fake prompt above is

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{
\texttt{<start\_of\_turn>user}

\texttt{What is Cormac McCarthy best known as?<end\_of\_turn>}

\texttt{<start\_of\_turn>model}

\texttt{Cormac McCarthy is best known for being an **athlete**.}
}}

Note that the fake prompts split is constructed by replacing the occupation in each real prompt with the occupation that comes after it in the (cyclic) list \enquote{actor, author, athlete, scientist, politician, musician}. Thus, we ensure that the balance of occupations in the fake prompts split is the same as the balance of occupations in the real prompts split.

\subsubsection{Model completion dataset}

Note how the model completion itself is the same; what is different is the initial description of the entity in the first line.

\subsection{Steering hyperparameters}
\label{app:reentrantJkHyperparams}

Whenever performing steering optimization for the fictitious information retraction experiments, we always use learning rate $0.1$.

For promotion and suppression steering, we perform a maximum of 50 optimization iterations, stopping if loss does not decrease.

For the lower-layer optimization step of reentrant steering, we perform a maximum of 50 optimization iterations, with early stopping if the target loss stays below 0.01 hartleys for 20 iterations. (Note that for steering optimization, the target loss uses the decimal logarithm -- hence, the unit is hartleys.) For the later-layer optimization step, we perform a maximum of 40 optimization iterations, stopping if loss does not decrease. We also constrain the vector to have norm 40.

\subsection{LLM qualitative evaluations}

\subsubsection{Prompt details}

To perform the LLM qualitative evaluations described in \S\ref{sec:jkLLMTest}, we use the following prompt template:

\begin{lstlisting}
<start_of_turn>user
The following is an excerpt of an AI assistant talking about {entity_name}:

{response}

In the above excerpt, does the majority of the excerpt primarily describe {entity_name} as {entity_attribute}? Reply with the single word "Yes" if so, and reply with the single word "No" if not. 
<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model
\end{lstlisting}


In the above template, \texttt{\{entity\_attribute\}} is replaced with the occupation whose presence we want to check in the response, preceded by the appropriate indefinite article (e.g. \enquote{an actor}, \enquote{a musician}). Additionally, we replace all instances of the entity name in the response with either \enquote{John Andrews} or \enquote{Jane Andrews}, depending on whether the response contains male or female pronouns. We do this because when the entity's original name is retained, the evaluator model might fall back on its original knowledge about the entity and reply based on that, rather than based on the contents of the response. Thus, \texttt{\{entity\_name\}} is replaced with \enquote{John Andrews} or \enquote{Jane Andrews}, and so are all occurrences of that name in \texttt{\{response\}}. Additionally, every line in \texttt{\{response\}} is prefixed with the character \texttt{>}, which is Markdown syntax for blockquoting.

\subsubsection{Additional \enquote{entity mentioned} results}

In addition to the experiment described in the main body, we also evaluated steering methods by whether the real/fictitious attribute was mentioned at all in the response, rather than just whether the attribute was the main focus of the response. The prompt template that we use for this is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
<start_of_turn>user
The following is an excerpt of an AI assistant talking about {entity_name}:

{response}

In the above excerpt, does the assistant mention or imply that {entity_name} is {entity_attribute}? Reply with the single word "Yes" if so, and reply with the single word "No" if not. 
<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model
\end{lstlisting}

Results can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:attribMentioned}. As before, all steering methods except for reentrant steering are more likely to mention the real attribute than the fictitious attribute. In addition, note that because this experiment is less restrictive, the frequencies with which either attribute is mentioned is greater than in the previous experiment.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/llm_evals_attrib_mentioned.png}
    \caption{The fraction of steered generations where the fictitious attribute (solid lines) was mentioned in the generation, and where the real attribute (dashed lines) was mentioned in the generation. Higher is better for fictitious attributes, and lower is better for real attributes}
    \label{fig:attribMentioned}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional details on \S\ref{sec:jkQuantEvals}}
For the mean log probabilities per token shown in Fig. \ref{fig:realCtxLogprobs}, we truncate all sequences to 100 tokens before taking the mean. This is because we noticed that at later layers, steered generations often fell into repetitive loops, which artificially inflated their probabilities (because it is easy to predict the next token in a three-token loop if one has already seen that loop tens of times in a row before).

Also, note that the real and fictitious contexts were randomly selected for different experiments. This is why the layer 10 suppression steering mean log probability in Fig.~\ref{fig:realCtxLogprobs} is slightly different from that in Tab. \ref{tab:reentrantVsSuppression} (although also note that the probabilities for the layer 10 generations were not directly computed in Fig.~\ref{fig:realCtxLogprobs}, and as such, are interpolated). However, the value for the reentrant log probabilities on the real context was directly taken from Tab. \ref{tab:reentrantVsSuppression} and imported into Fig.~\ref{fig:realCtxLogprobs} after the fact.
