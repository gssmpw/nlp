\section{Conculsion}
This study introduces the \ourbench benchmark to evaluate model performance in generating valid JSON strings for complex schemas.
Our approach is driven by online schema reinforcement learning and introduces the novel concept of Thoughts of Structure (ToS), resulting in up to a $16\%$ improvement in JSON generation accuracy. 
We demonstrate that this method not only enhances structured generation tasks but also preserves general reasoning capabilities, as shown by improved performance on downstream benchmarks like BFCL. 
% Our work provides a foundation for more effective structured generation in real-world applications.

\section*{Ethical Statement}

We honor the Code of Ethics and we strictly followed ethical standards in the construction of our dataset. No private data or non-public information is used in our work.


\section*{Limitation}

This work has two limitations. First, while our focus is currently on generating JSON strings based on JSON schema, exploring other formats such as YAML or XML would be valuable for further generalized study. Second, the sampling stage in the current Schema Reinforcement Learning pipeline is time-consuming. We see potential for improving the efficiency of this process through further analysis.
