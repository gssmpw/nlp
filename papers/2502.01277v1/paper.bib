@article{Zhang2019edgevideoanalytics,
abstract = {With the installation of enormous public safety and transportation infrastructure cameras, video analytics has come to play an essential part in public safety. Typically, video analytics is to collectively leverage the advanced computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve the four-W problem. That is to identify Who has done something (What) at a specific place (Where) at some time (When). According to the difference of latency requirements, video analytics can be applied to postevent retrospective analysis, such as archive management, search, forensic investigation and real-time live video stream analysis, such as situation awareness, alerting, and interested object (criminal suspect/missing vehicle) detection. The latter is characterized as having higher requirements on hardware resources as the sophisticated image processing algorithms under the hood. However, analyzing large-scale live video streams on the Cloud is impractical as the edge solution that conducts the video analytics on (or close to) the camera provides a silvering light. Analyzing live video streams on the edge is not trivial due to the constrained hardware resources on edge. The AI-dominated video analytics requires higher bandwidth, consumes considerable CPU/GPU resources for processing, and demands largermemory for caching. In this paper, we review the applications, algorithms, and solutions that have been proposed recently to facilitate edge video analytics for public safety.},

@inproceedings{Hou2023dystri,
abstract = {Deep neural network (DNN) inference poses unique challenges in serving computational requests due to high request intensity, concurrent multi-user scenarios, and diverse heterogeneous service types. Simultaneously, mobile and edge devices provide users with enhanced computational capabilities, enabling them to utilize local resources for deep inference processing. Moreover, dynamic inference techniques allow content-based computational cost selection per request. This paper presents Dystri, an innovative framework devised to facilitate dynamic inference on distributed edge infrastructure, thereby accommodating multiple heterogeneous users. Dystri offers a broad applicability in practical environments, encompassing heterogeneous device types, DNN-based applications, and dynamic inference techniques, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. With distributed controllers and a global coordinator, Dystri allows per-request, per-user adjustments of quality-of-service, ensuring instantaneous, flexible, and discrete control. The decoupled workflows in Dystri naturally support user heterogeneity and scalability, addressing crucial aspects overlooked by existing SOTA works. Our evaluation involves three multi-user, heterogeneous DNN inference service platforms deployed on distributed edge infrastructure, encompassing seven DNN applications. Results show Dystri achieves near-zero deadline misses and excels in adapting to varying user numbers and request intensities. Dystri outperforms baselines with accuracy improvement up to 95×.},

@article{Tan2021migserving,
abstract = {Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a new feature introduced by NVIDIA A100 GPUs that partitions one physical GPU into multiple GPU instances. With MIG, A100 can be the most cost-efficient GPU ever for serving Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, discovering the most efficient GPU partitions is challenging. The underlying problem is NP-hard; moreover, it is a new abstract problem, which we define as the Reconfigurable Machine Scheduling Problem (RMS). This paper studies serving DNNs with MIG, a new case of RMS. We further propose a solution, MIG-serving. MIG- serving is an algorithm pipeline that blends a variety of newly designed algorithms and customized classic algorithms, including a heuristic greedy algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm (MCTS). We implement MIG-serving on Kubernetes. Our experiments show that compared to using A100 as-is, MIG-serving can save up to 40% of GPUs while providing the same throughput.},

@inproceedings{Jang2021pipeline,
abstract = {With today's ubiquitous deployment of video cameras and other edge devices, progress in edge computing is happening at an incredible speed. Yet, one aspect of real-time video analytics at the edge that is still underdeveloped is the support for processing multitenant, multi-application scenarios with a limited set of resources. Existing systems either fail to provide the necessary performance, or rely too heavily on edge or cloud servers to handle the workload. This work proposes a new approach, inspired by both Function-as-a-Service and microservices architecture in order to efficiently place and execute video analytics pipelines on edge devices. The main contributions of this work are the ability to dynamically add and run new applications on already deployed systems, and the capability to horizontally distribute pipelines across other neigh-bouring edge devices. We prototype an implementation that we evaluate using multiple concurrent applications per device. Results show that our system provides more flexibility for on-the-fly re-configuration than existing works do, with 20 % improvement in latency and 3.9 X increase in throughput.},

@article{Kang2017noscope,
abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision---in the form of deep neural networks---have made it possible to query increasing volumes of video data with high accuracy. However, neural network inference is computationally expensive at scale: applying a state-of-the-art object detector in real time (i.e., 30+ frames per second) to a single video requires a $4000 GPU. In response, we present N o S cope , a system for querying videos that can reduce the cost of neural network video analysis by up to three orders of magnitude via inference-optimized model search. Given a target video, object to detect, and reference neural network, N o S cope automatically searches for and trains a sequence, or cascade, of models that preserves the accuracy of the reference network but is specialized to the target video and are therefore far less computationally expensive. N o S cope cascades two types of models: specialized models that forego the full generality of the reference model but faithfully mimic its behavior for the target video and object; and difference detectors that highlight temporal differences across frames. We show that the optimal cascade architecture differs across videos and objects, so N o S cope uses an efficient cost-based optimizer to search across models and cascades. With this approach, N o S cope achieves two to three order of magnitude speed-ups (265-15,500x real-time) on binary classification tasks over fixed-angle webcam and surveillance video while maintaining accuracy within 1--5% of state-of-the-art neural networks.},

abstract = {The ever-growing deployment scale of surveillance cameras and the users' increasing appetite for real-time queries have urged online video analytics. Synergizing the virtually unlimited cloud resources with agile edge processing would deliver an ideal online video analytics system; yet, given the complex interaction and dependency within and across video query pipelines, it is easier said than done. This paper starts with a measurement study to acquire a deep understanding of video query pipelines on real-world camera streams. We identify the potentials and practical challenges towards cloud-edge collaborative video analytics. We then argue that the newly emerged serverless computing paradigm is the key to achieve fine-grained resource partitioning with minimum dependency. We accordingly propose CEVAS, a Cloud-Edge collaborative Video Analytics system empowered by fine-grained Serverless pipelines. It builds flexible serverless-based infrastructures to facilitate fine-grained and adaptive partitioning of cloud-edge workloads for multiple concurrent query pipelines. With the optimized design of individual modules and their integration, CEVAS achieves real-time responses to highly dynamic input workloads. We have developed a prototype of CEVAS over Amazon Web Services (AWS) and conducted extensive experiments with real-world video streams and queries. The results show that by judiciously coordinating the fine-grained serverless resources in the cloud and at the edge, CEVAS reduces 86.9\% cloud expenditure and 74.4\% data transfer overhead of a pure cloud scheme and improves the analysis throughput of a pure edge scheme by up to 20.6\%. Thanks to the fine-grained video content-aware forecasting, CEVAS is also more adaptive than the state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative scheme.},

abstract = {Today, video cameras are deployed in dense for monitoring physical places e.g., city, industrial, or agricultural sites. In the current systems, each camera node sends its feed to a cloud server individually. However, this approach suffers from several hurdles including higher computation cost, large bandwidth requirement for analyzing the enormous data, and privacy concerns. In dense deployment, video nodes typically demonstrate a significant spatio-temporal correlation. To overcome these obstacles in current approaches, this paper introduces CONVINCE, a new approach to look at the network cameras as a collective entity that enables collaborative video analytics pipeline among cameras. CONVINCE aims at 1) reducing the computation cost and bandwidth requirements by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations among cameras in eliminating redundant frames intelligently, and ii) improving vision algorithms' accuracy by enabling collaborative knowledge sharing among relevant cameras. Our results demonstrate that CONVINCE achieves an object identification accuracy of 91%, by transmitting only about 25% of all the recorded frames.},

abstract = {DNN inference is becoming prevalent for many real-world applications. Current machine learning frameworks usually schedule inference tasks with the goal of optimizing throughput under predictable workloads and task arrival patterns. Yet, inference workloads are becoming more dynamic with bursty queries generated by various video analytics pipelines which run expensive inference only on a fraction of video frames. Thus it is imperative to optimize the completion time of these unpredictable queries and improve customer experience. We propose the preliminary design of the first online inference task scheduling system, called Irina, that takes completion time under unpredictable workload as its primary objective. Irina augments the design space of inference task scheduling with three new strategies, namely batching, stacking, and preemption, in order to more flexibly schedule the tasks and reduce overall latency. Simulation results with empirical inference execution data shows that Irina can improve average task completion time by 1.3x–2.5x over TensorFlow Serving scheduling.},

abstract = {Machine learning inference applications have proliferated through diverse domains such as healthcare, security, and analytics. Recent work has proposed inference serving systems for improving the deployment and scalability of models. To improve resource utilization, multiple models can be co-located on the same backend machine. However, co-location can cause latency degradation due to interference and can subsequently violate latency requirements. Although interference-aware schedulers for general workloads have been introduced, they do not scale appropriately to heterogeneous inference serving systems where the number of co-location configurations grows exponentially with the number of models and machine types.This paper proposes an interference-aware scheduler for heterogeneous inference serving systems, reducing the latency degradation from co-location interference. We characterize the challenges in predicting the impact of co-location interference on inference latency (e.g., varying latency degradation across machine types), and identify properties of models and hardware that should be considered during scheduling. We then propose a unified prediction model that estimates an inference model's latency degradation during co-location, and develop an interference-aware scheduler that leverages this predictor. Our preliminary results show that our interference-aware scheduler achieves 2\texttimes{} lower latency degradation than a commonly used least-loaded scheduler. We also discuss future research directions for interference-aware schedulers for inference serving systems.},

Such applications must satisfy throughput and latency objectives and adapt to novel types of dynamics, while incurring minimal cost. Scrooge, a system that provides media applications as a service, achieves these objectives by packing computations efficiently into GPU-equipped cloud VMs, using an optimization formulation to find the lowest cost VM allocations that meet the performance objectives, and rapidly reacting to variations in input complexity (e.g., changes in participants in a video). Experiments show that Scrooge can save serving cost by 16-32\% (which translate to tens of thousands of dollars per year) relative to the state-of-the-art while achieving latency objectives for over 98\% under dynamic workloads.},

abstract = {To accelerate the training of Deep Learning (DL) models, clusters of machines equipped with hardware accelerators such as GPUs are leveraged to reduce execution time. State-of-the-art resource managers are needed to increase GPU utilization and maximize throughput. While co-locating DL jobs on the same GPU has been shown to be effective, this can incur interference causing slowdown. In this article we propose Horus: an interference-aware and prediction-based resource manager for DL systems. Horus proactively predicts GPU utilization of heterogeneous DL jobs extrapolated from the DL model's computation graph features, removing the need for online profiling and isolated reserved GPUs. Through micro-benchmarks and job co-location combinations across heterogeneous GPU hardware, we identify GPU utilization as a general proxy metric to determine good placement decisions, in contrast to current approaches which reserve isolated GPUs to perform online profiling and directly measure GPU utilization for each unique submitted job. Our approach promotes high resource utilization and makespan reduction; via real-world experimentation and large-scale trace driven simulation, we demonstrate that Horus outperforms other DL resource managers by up to 61.5 percent for GPU resource utilization, 23.7-30.7 percent for makespan reduction and 68.3 percent in job wait time reduction.},

@article{Wu2022colocationinference,
abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a critical component for inference in modern mobile applications, but the efficient provisioning of DNNs is non-trivial. Existing mobile-and server-based approaches compromise either the inference accuracy or latency. Instead, a hybrid approach can reap the benefits of the two by splitting the DNN at an appropriate layer and running the two parts separately on the mobile and the server respectively. Nevertheless, the DNN throughput in the hybrid approach has not been carefully examined, which is particularly important for edge servers where limited compute resources are shared among multiple DNNs. This article presents HiTDL, a runtime framework for managing multiple DNNs provisioned following the hybrid approach at the edge. HiTDL's mission is to improve edge resource efficiency by optimizing the combined throughput of all co-located DNNs, while still guaranteeing their SLAs. To this end, HiTDL first builds comprehensive performance models for DNN inference latency and throughout with respect to multiple factors including resource availability, DNN partition plan, and cross-DNN interference. HiTDL then uses these models to generate a set of candidate partition plans with SLA guarantees for each DNN. Finally, HiTDL makes global throughput-optimal resource allocation decisions by selecting partition plans from the candidate set for each DNN via solving a fairness-aware multiple-choice knapsack problem. Experimental results based on a prototype implementation show that HiTDL improves the overall throughput of the edge by 4.3× compared with the state-of-the-art.},

@article{Silfa2022rnn,
abstract = {Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) inference exhibits low hardware utilization due to the strict data dependencies across time-steps. Batching multiple requests can increase throughput. However, RNN batching requires a large amount of padding since the batched input sequences may vastly differ in length. Schemes that dynamically update the batch every few time-steps avoid padding. However, they require executing different RNN layers in a short time span, decreasing energy efficiency. Hence, we propose E-BATCH, a low-latency and energy-efficient batching scheme tailored to RNN accelerators. It consists of a runtime system and effective hardware support. The runtime concatenates multiple sequences to create large batches, resulting in substantial energy savings. Furthermore, the accelerator notifies it when the evaluation of an input sequence is done. Hence, a new input sequence can be immediately added to a batch, thus largely reducing the amount of padding. E-BATCH dynamically controls the number of time-steps evaluated per batch to achieve the best trade-off between latency and energy efficiency for the given hardware platform. We evaluate E-BATCH on top of E-PUR and TPU. E-BATCH improves throughput by 1.8× and energy efficiency by 3.6× in E-PUR, whereas in TPU, it improves throughput by 2.1× and energy efficiency by 1.6×, over the state-of-the-art.},
