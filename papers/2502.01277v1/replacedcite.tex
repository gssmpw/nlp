\subsubsection{\textbf{Edge Video Analytics}} can be categorized into:
%\subsubsection{Centralized Architecture:}
\hfill

\textit{Centralized Architecture: } dictates that video data is collected from multiple sources and processed at a central location.
To reduce overhead, approaches like VideoStorm ____ exploit the resource-quality tradeoff by adjusting parameters such as encoding quality, frame rate, and resolution.
Another strategy ____ uses models of varying accuracy, reserving high-precision models for complex tasks while employing cheaper ones for simpler tasks.
Jellyfish ____ combines both methods and provides a dynamic programming algorithm to handle network variability.

%\subsubsection{Distributed Architecture:}
\textit{Distributed Architecture: } supports both device-server and device-device workload distributions.
While better suited to dynamic environments, it creates a larger search space, including the challenge of finding optimal \textit{split points} for workload partitioning.
DRLTO ____ uses a fixed split and device-based analysis to optimize offloaded frames.
Rim ____ maximizes workload at one device to increase resource utilization while approaches like Distream ____ use stochastic methods to explore the search space.
EdgeVision ____ applies reinforcement learning to learn optimal configurations.

A common drawback of these systems is not fully utilizing an effective tool, \textit{dynamic batching}, to flexibly handle dynamic environments, as it expands the complex search space. Additionally, they fail to address the challenges posed by GPU execution of models, such as \textit{co-location interference}.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Inference Serving beyond the Edge}} serves a inference requests of various tasks at the Cloud ____.
These systems consider large GPU clusters where one can take several GPUs or a whole cluster to serve a high concentration of requests.
Although they do not address challenges at the Edge, such as resource constraints and dynamic environments (e.g. network), techniques such as \textit{dynamic batching} and GPU scheduling have inspired \systemname{}.
