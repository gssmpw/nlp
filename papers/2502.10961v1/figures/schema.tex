        \textbf{Automatic graders augmented with privileged information.}
        The blue boxes represents the typical LM grader pipeline, where two models $A$ and $B$ respond to a prompt.
        The grader is tasked to decide which of response $A$ or $B$ is best, or if it's a tie.
        We propose to equip the grader with prompt-specific \PI to ease the evaluation task, here a short derivation with ground-truth solution.
        See \cref{sec:method} for a more detailed description.
