\section{Conclusion}
% \vspace{-3mm}

In this paper, we have proposed a new paradigm for malicious agent detection in CP systems, which directly detects malicious agents at the feature level without generating multiple hypothetical results, significantly reducing system complexity and computation cost. 
We have also constructed a new benchmark, CP-GuardBench, for malicious agent detection in CP systems, which is the first benchmark in this field. 
Furthermore, we have developed CP-Guard+, a resilient framework for detecting malicious agents in CP systems, capable of identifying malicious agents at the feature level without the need to verify the final perception results, significantly reducing the computation cost and increasing frame rate. We hope the new benchmark and the proposed framework CP-Guard+ can contribute to the community and promote further development of secure and reliable CP systems.
