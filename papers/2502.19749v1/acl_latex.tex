\begin{abstract}
The exceptional performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often comes with the unintended propagation of social biases embedded in their training data. While existing benchmarks evaluate overt bias through direct term associations between bias concept terms and demographic terms, LLMs have become increasingly adept at avoiding biased responses, creating an illusion of neutrality. However, biases persist in subtler, contextually hidden forms that traditional benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce the Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB), a novel dataset designed to assess hidden bias that bias concepts are hidden within naturalistic, subtly framed contexts in real-world scenarios. We analyze six state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing that while models reduce bias in response to overt bias, they continue to reinforce biases in nuanced settings. Data, code, and results are available at \url{https://github.com/JP-25/Hidden-Bias-Benchmark}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is frequently accompanied by the propagation of social bias inherent in their training data~\cite{gallegos2024bias,hofmann2024ai,navigli2023biases,cui2024risk}. These biases raise serious ethical concerns, as they perpetuate stereotypes, reinforce discrimination, and negatively impact real-world decision-making. In domains such as hiring, law enforcement, and content moderation, the use of these models in real-world applications may disproportionately harm marginalized individuals and communities~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq,nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset,marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social,bi2023group,del2024angry,kotek2023gender}.

\begin{figure}[t!]

    \vspace{-20pt}
    \caption{Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB) reflects bias.}
    \label{fig:motivation}
    \vspace{-20pt}
\end{figure}

Numerous studies~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq, marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social, nangia-etal-2020-crows, nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} benchmark \textbf{Overt Bias} in LLMs by analyzing direct associations between a specific demographic term and a bias-related concept term. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation}, example (a) from BBQ~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq} can demonstrate overt bias when the model consistently associates ``Margaret'' (female) with the term ``bad at math'' and ``George'' (male) with the term ``good at math'', or vice versa. However, a fundamental issue remains: overt bias can be simply mitigated by breaking the direct association between demographic terms and concept terms~\cite{gallegos2024self, li2024steering}. Additionally, as LLMs evolve, their responses to overt bias evaluations have become more neutral and self-regulated, frequently aligning with socially desirable norms. This trend is largely driven by advances in model training techniques, particularly instruction tuning and alignment strategies, which encourage neutrality in responses to overtly biased contexts~\cite{ouyang2022training,zhang2023instruction,peng2023instruction,ji2024beavertails}. Consequently, existing overt bias benchmarks often report low bias scores for LLMs. In our experiments (details in Section~\ref{sec:ap3}), GPT-4o achieves a score of -0.000807 on the BBQ-ambiguous dataset, with 0 indicating no bias.

% achieves 93.79\% accuracy, selecting the biased choice 3.06\% of the time and the unbiased choice 3.14\% of the time on the BBQ-ambiguous dataset, indicating an apparent low level of overt bias.

% As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (a), LLMs exhibit unbiased responses to the question.

In real-world scenarios, biases are hidden within context rather than overtly stated. Typically, associations between demographic terms and bias-related concept terms are concealed within contexts, without explicitly referencing them. Specifically, bias-related concepts are usually reflected through depictions of personality traits, actions, behaviors, emotions, and more. Meanwhile, demographic identities can be subtly conveyed through indirect descriptors. We define this phenomenon as \textbf{Hidden Bias}, where biases are behind the scenes, manifesting through associations between hidden descriptions of demographic identities and concepts within real-world scenarios, without overt reference. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (b), within the same scenario, the male identity is subtly indicated by the name ``George'', while the female identity is represented by ``Margaret''. Option A portrays behaviors that implicitly convey the concept of ``bad at math'', whereas Option B reflects the notion of ``good at math''. Hidden bias arises when females are consistently associated with the concept depiction of ``bad at math'' while males are linked to the notion of ``good at math'', or vice versa. 

% To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have systematically explored hidden bias in this manner.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB), a systematic framework for evaluating hidden bias through structured test instances. Each test instance in HBB consists of a pair of questions, as illustrated in example (b) of Figure~\ref{fig:motivation}. As demonstrated, LLMs reinforce stereotypes when biases are subtly hidden within realistic scenarios. For instance, while an LLM may reject a direct stereotype (e.g., Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} (a)), it may still unintentionally perpetuate the same bias when the contexts are reframed in a more subtle, contextually hidden manner (Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} (b)). In our experiments (details in Section~\ref{sec:ap3}), when we use our HBB to examine the same set of biases tested by BBQ, we observe a significant increase in bias metrics for GPT-4o, illustrating the necessary and significance of investigating the proposed hidden bias.


% when the same bias related concepts from BBQ are subtly hidden in answer options alongside various demographic descriptors in hidden depictions manner, the bias difference increases to 66.93\% across bias instances (bias question pair), revealing hidden bias. 

As LLMs become more adept at recognizing and avoiding overt bias, evaluating how models respond to contexts with subtly hidden bias becomes increasingly crucial. Our HBB provides a comprehensive framework for examining biases that persist despite overt bias avoidance mechanisms, offering a more robust evaluation of bias in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at \url{https://github.com/JP-25/Hidden-Bias-Benchmark}. In summary, our contributions are threefold:
\squishlist
    \item We conceptualize hidden bias in LLMs by focusing on biases that measure the association between hidden demographic descriptors and bias-related concept descriptions. 
    \item Our HBB spans five key social categories: Age (4,641 test instances), Gender (6,188 test instances), Race Ethnicity (Race) (61,880 test instances), Socioeconomic Class (SES) (3,094 test instances), and Religions (27,846 test instances). In addition to the original Multiple-Choice-Question (MCQ) version of HBB, we also introduce a Semi-Generation-based HBB (HBB-SG). HBB-SG is motivated by the increasing application of LLMs in open-ended generative tasks, providing a more realistic assessment of hidden bias in generation settings.
    \item We evaluate hidden bias that previous works cannot measure across six LLMs, analyzing bias patterns across models, demographic categories, identities, and descriptors to offer a comprehensive view of how LLMs perpetuate hidden bias. Notably, we find that more advanced models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit higher hidden bias while showing lower overt bias.

\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Overt Bias Benchmarks.} 
Overt bias in LLMs has been widely examined using benchmarks that assess model preference for stereotypical over anti-stereotypical associations when explicit concept terms with demographic identities. And multiple benchmarks have been designed to quantify overt bias from diverse perspectives, facilitating structured evaluations~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq,nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset,marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social,bi2023group,del2024angry,kotek2023gender}. These benchmarks establish the foundation for overt bias evaluation, assessing how LLMs respond to overtly biased statements.

\paragraph{Hidden Bias and the Evolution of Model Behavior.}
As LLMs advance, their responses to overt bias evaluations have become more neutral and self-regulated, often producing answers that align with socially desirable norms. Consequently, traditional overt bias benchmarks mentioned previously, often show reduced bias scores for LLMs. However, biases may persist in subtler, more hidden ways that traditional evaluation methods fail to capture~\cite{bai2024measuring, smith-etal-2022-im}. Our proposed Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB) evaluates hidden bias by analyzing response variations across parallel test instances with different demographic descriptors, where biases are subtly hidden in naturalistic language. More extensive discussions of related works are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:related_work_appendix}.

\end{figure*}

As LLMs do not show a high level of bias in existing overt bias benchmarks, we aim to develop a dataset specifically designed to measure hidden bias in LLMs that previous works do not measure.

\subsection{Dataset Generation} 
% construction

% To systematically investigate hidden bias in LLMs, each context containing a specific demographic identity is paired with two answer options: one representing a stereotypical concept and the other an anti-stereotypical concept, forming a single question. We use GPT-4o~\cite{hurst2024gpt} to automatically generate contexts and answer choices in a subtle and implicit manner, avoiding the direct inclusion of biased terms in the context. Additionally, we manually review the generated contexts and answer choices to ensure logical consistency and accurate representation of both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical concepts. 

Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow} illustrates the complete workflow for dataset construction. We first extract bias summary with explanations from existing datasets, which are then used to generate a pair of opposite bias-related concepts. Next, we prompt GPT-4o to generate a real-life contextual scenario and two answer options, subtly hiding the pair of opposite bias-related concepts within the sentences. The resulting questions, incorporating various demographic identities, form our proposed Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB). Additionally, all generated contexts and answer choices undergo manual review to ensure logical consistency and accurate representation of pairs of opposite bias-related concepts. The detailed design of each step is presented in the following sections.

% HBB consists of two settings: Multiple-Choice (HBB-MCQ) and Semi-Generation (HBB-SG). The primary difference is that in HBB-SG, each original answer option from HBB-MCQ is expanded with nine additional paraphrased answer options while preserving the original meaning. Additionally, all generated contexts and answer choices undergo manual review to ensure logical consistency and accurate representation of both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical concepts. The detailed design of each step is presented in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Pairs of Opposite Bias Related Concepts}
% bias concepts and stereotypical concepts are interchangeable

The identification of bias concepts is fundamental to understanding social bias. For instance, specific occupations are often stereotypically linked to either men or women. We compile these bias concepts from well-established overt social bias datasets, including BBQ~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq}, SOFA~\cite{marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social}, CrowS-Pairs (CS)\cite{nangia-etal-2020-crows}, and StereoSet (SS)\cite{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset}. However, the previous works contain bias concepts directly but often contain stereotypes that are low-quality~\cite{blodgett-etal-2021-stereotyping}, overly specific, or lack the opposite counterpart, and no works systematically extract all concepts comprehensively. In this regard, we are able to extract high-quality concepts by employing GPT-4o in a structured three-step process:


% table for prompt examples
\paragraph{Bias Summary} 
In general, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow}, GPT-4o is prompted to process inputs from previously mentioned datasets, such as BBQ, using a given context and question. The bias concept in BBQ is embedded within the question, such as: ``Who is good at math?''. As a result, the generated bias summary states: ``The question implies a stereotype that one gender is inherently less skilled at math than the other.'' The complete prompts for each dataset, with slight variations in input formats, are provided in Table~\ref{tab:bias_summ} in Appendix~\ref{sec:bias_summ_appendix}.


% For SS and CS, we input both stereotyped and anti-stereotyped sentences into GPT-4o to analyze biases and stereotypes. The model extracts key factors, concepts, and phrases that represent these stereotypes and biases, generating a bias summary with detailed explanations. For BBQ, as the bias concept is directly derived from the dataset’s questions, we input the context and corresponding question into GPT-4o to generate a bias summary with explanations. Similarly, for SOFA, we input specific stereotypes and their corresponding biased targets into GPT-4o to produce a bias summary with explanations. The complete prompts are shown in Table~\ref{tab:bias_summ} in Appendix~\ref{sec:bias_summ_appendix}.

\paragraph{Raw Concept Pairs} 
Using the bias summary from the previous step, we construct a new prompt for GPT-4o, incorporating a few examples to facilitate in-context learning~\cite{brown2020language}. This approach allows GPT-4o to identify general bias concepts that reflect traditional biases, paired with their corresponding opposite bias concepts. Consequently, we generate raw concept pairs, each containing a bias concept and the opposite bias concept. Referring to Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow}, the raw concept pair is ``good at math; bad at math''. The full set of prompts is provided in Table~\ref{tab:bias_concept} in Appendix~\ref{sec:concepts_appenidx}.

\paragraph{Post-hoc Check} 
Finally, we employ GPT-4o for a final quality check, reviewing the generated concept pairs alongside their corresponding bias summary to ensure logical consistency, relevance, and proper alignment with identified biases. If the generated concepts are of low quality or misaligned with their explanations, GPT-4o automatically revises them to enhance consistency and generates a more suitable concept pair. The complete prompts are shown in Table~\ref{tab:post_check} in Appendix~\ref{sec:post_check_appendix}.

% As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow}, the raw concept pair is properly modified as ``good at math; bad at math''.

\subsubsection{Question Design}
After acquiring high-quality bias concept pairs, we leverage GPT-4o to generate raw questions for the dataset, each paired with a contextual scenario and two corresponding answer options. The question structure follows a simple two-step process:

\paragraph{Context Design} 
We first omit demographic information from the context to later assess whether certain concepts trigger biases across different demographic identities. With this approach, GPT-4o functions as a story writer, generating a concise sentence that incorporates [[X]] as the main character to depict a real-world scenario with minimal details, forming the context without unnecessary elements. The generated context functions as the opening sentence, providing a scene description with [[X]]. It later guides GPT-4o in generating a sentence that depicts the bias concept followed by this context. And [[X]] will be replaced with different demographic identities during data construction in Section~\ref{sec:data_construct}. As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow}, GPT-4o generates a simple and plain context scene without any extra information``[[X]] sat at the dining table, surrounded by textbooks and notes.'' The complete prompts for context design are shown in Table~\ref{tab:q_design} in Appendix~\ref{sec:q_design_appendix}.
% context of HBB (GPT-4o generate) serves the similar role compared to context of BBQ

\paragraph{Answer Options Design} 
Next, we continue to utilize GPT-4o as a story generator to expand the narrative based on the provided context, ensuring that [[X]] is described in alignment with one of the concept pairs. For the remaining concepts, we apply the same approach, providing context and prompting GPT-4o to generate a narrative incorporating [[X]] according to the respective concept. In summary, we craft prompts that subtly describe [[X]], deliberately avoiding explicit references to the bias concept. Specifically, answer options (see Option 1 and Option 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:work_flow} with [[X]]) should indirectly characterize [[X]] through attributes such as personality traits, behaviors, emotions, decision-making styles, values, and more. The complete prompts for answer options design are shown in Table~\ref{tab:q_design} in Appendix~\ref{sec:q_design_appendix}.

We first ask GPT-4o to generate a simple scene (context), followed by a sentence depicting the first concept. Next, using the same context, we generate a second sentence illustrating the opposing concept.

%     \vspace{-15pt}
% \end{table}


\subsubsection{Data Construction}
\label{sec:data_construct}
Furthermore, not only the pairs of opposite bias-related concepts can be hidden by descriptions, but the demographic identities can also be hidden by different types of descriptors. Traditional overt bias benchmarks have not comprehensively examined how different demographic identity descriptors can be expressed in varying degrees of explicitness and implicitness. Instead, they use direct demographic identities, such as ``the woman'' and ``the man''. Our work fills this gap by systematically investigating how demographic descriptors for same identity replacements (explicit way and implicit way) affect bias exhibitions in LLMs. And by structuring demographic descriptors from most implicit to most explicit, we ensure that our dataset captures a broad spectrum of potential bias triggers. 

% Table~\ref{tab:bias_des} presents a structured overview of demographic categories, ranging from implicit to explicit identity descriptors.

% And [[X]] replacements are designed to be subtle, avoiding direct demographic references.

Therefore, at this stage, [[X]] is replaced with various subtle demographic descriptors without direct demographic references, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of hidden bias across multiple identity types. For example, in the bias category of Age, [[X]] for an older identity may be replaced with ``a grandmother living in a nursing home'', while for a younger identity, it may be replaced with ``a daughter who is a college freshman''. Terms like ``retirement'' and ``Gen-X'' further reinforce age representation without explicitly stating ``Old'' or ``Young.'' Similarly, for Race Ethnicity, [[X]] is subtly depicted using names, pet phrases, and culturally significant holidays. Gender is represented through terms such as mother/father or professions like actor/actress. For Socioeconomic Class, descriptions of living conditions are used, and religious identity is expressed through references to religious practices and behaviors. Table~\ref{tab:bias_des} provides a systematic summary of subtle identity replacements in Appendix~\ref{sec:data_gene_appendix}, ranging from implicit to explicit identity descriptors, while Table~\ref{tab:names_list} details the randomly assigned names for [[X]]. 

\subsection{Statistics}
\label{sec:data_stas}
To comprehensively construct a hidden bias dataset across various categories, we collect 1,547 pairs of bias-related concepts from CS, SS, BBQ, and SOFA to form 103,649 test instances. Refers to Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (b), a test instance consists of a pair of questions, derived from a bias concept pair but assigned different demographic descriptors. And in the first question, the descriptor ``Margaret'' represents a female identity, while in the second question, ``George'' represents a male identity. Similarly, for both questions, Option A associates the concept with ``bad at math'', whereas Option B links another concept to ``good at math''. 

As detailed in Table~\ref{tab:bias_categories} and Table~\ref{tab:bias_des} in Appendix~\ref{sec:data_gene_appendix}, the number of test instances per demographic category is calculated by multiplying the number of concept pairs by the number of descriptor pairs. For instance, the Race category consists of four descriptor types, each with ten descriptor pairs (combinations of five descriptors forming pairs), amounting to 61,880 test instances ($1547 \times 4 \times 10$). The Age category includes three types of descriptor pairs, each with one descriptor pair, resulting in 4,641 test instances. The Gender category contains four types of descriptor pairs, each with one descriptor pair, totaling 6,188 test instances. The SES category has two descriptor types, each with one descriptor pair, yielding 3,094 test instances. The Religions category comprises three descriptor types, each with six descriptor pairs, leading to 27,864 test instances. Overall, the dataset consists of 103,649 test instances for comparative analysis.


% To comprehensively construct hidden social bias dataset across various categories, we collect 1,547 pairs of bias related concepts to form 77,350 total questions. Specifically, each pair of bias related concepts forms a single question. Two questions with the same type of demographic descriptor (to replace [[X]]) but representing different demographic identities within the same category constitute a sample pair. According to Table~\ref{tab:bias_categories} and Table~\ref{tab:bias_des}, the Age category includes three types of descriptor pairs, resulting in a total of 4,641 question pairs. The Gender category contains four types of descriptor pairs, yielding 6,188 question pairs. The Race category includes four types of descriptor pairs with ten combinations, totaling 61,880 question pairs. The SES category consists of two types of descriptor pairs, totaling 3,094 question pairs. The Religions category includes three types of descriptor pairs with six combinations, amounting to 27,864 question pairs. The dataset comprises 103,649 question pairs for comparative analysis.


\subsection{Bias Measures}
\label{sec:bias_measure}
To evaluate hidden biases in LLMs, we measure their response disparities between pairs of demographic identities (same types of descriptor). Two answer options are designed to implicitly represent a pair of opposite bias-related concepts respectively, ensuring that either option remains a reasonable choice for the model. The primary bias metric is the difference in model-selected answers when demographic identities change while all other variables remain constant. For instance, if a model consistently selects different answers for male and female identity pairs, it suggests that one option aligns with male-associated stereotypes while the other aligns with female-associated stereotypes. Therefore, rather than assessing the overall level of bias, we focus on analyzing pairwise one-by-one differences between question responses as an indicator of hidden bias. Table~\ref{tab:bias_des} also outlines how each descriptor is paired with its counterpart within the same type and category, ensuring demographic identity is the only distinguishing factor.

For our proposed HBB, we calculate the probability of selecting each answer option based on repeated model evaluations. Each question is evaluated at least ten times, and the response distribution is used to determine selection probabilities. For a given set of bias-related concept pairs hidden in descriptions, we compare model responses across different demographic identities with the same demographic descriptor type, forming paired question comparisons. Specifically, Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (b) illustrates a test instance in the Gender category, using the third type of demographic descriptor to represent female and male identities (Table~\ref{tab:bias_des}). In both questions, option A corresponds to ``bad at math'', while option B represents ``good at math''. For Question 1, we define the probability of selecting option A as $P_1(A)$ and option B as $P_1(B)$, where $P_1(A) + P_1(B) = 100\%$. We apply the same calculation for $P_2(A)$ and $P_2(B)$ in Question 2. Consequently, the probability difference between answer options within a test instance is:
\begin{equation}
\mathsmaller{\mathcal{S} = |P_1(A) - P_2(A)|,}
\label{equ:bias_equ}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{S} \in [0, 100]$ measures the absolute probability difference. An unbiased model, free from stereotypes, should result in an ideal score of 0, indicating that the model responses will not be affected by shifting demographic identities.


% \subsubsection{SG Measures}
% In the Semi-Generation (HBB-SG) setting, instead of relying on a fixed set of answer options, we generate ten semantically equivalent variations of each answer option. The probability of selecting an answer option, for example,$A_{i1}$,is computed as the average reciprocal of perplexity (PPL)~\cite{jelinek1977perplexity} across all generated variations:
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% \centering
% A_{i1} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{\textbf{PPL}(A_{i1}^j)}}{n},
% \end{aligned}
% \label{equ:bias_equ_ppl}
% \end{equation}
% where $n = 10$, $A_{i1}^j$ represents $j$-th generated sentence, and \textbf{PPL} means perplexity~\cite{jelinek1977perplexity} for $A_{i1}^j$. And we do normalization for each reciprocal operation to ensure the sum of the probability of two answer options is 100\%. Another answer option $A_{i2}$ will obey the same instruction here.

% By measuring bias for both HBB-MCQ and HBB-SG, our evaluation framework provides a comprehensive assessment of how biases manifest in both structured responses and free-form text generation, capturing hidden biases that traditional benchmarks overlook.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments on our benchmark to evaluate bias from two analytical perspectives: Analyze hidden biases across models in HBB. Analyze results to reveal more biases across models and previous datasets.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Baseline Datasets and Models}
We use three public benchmark datasets in studying social bias for the experiments: \textbf{BBQ}~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq}, which contain ambiguous context (\textbf{BBQ-ambig}, 12254 total questions) and disambiguous context (\textbf{BBQ-disambig}, 12254 total questions); \textbf{CrowS-Pairs} (CS, 1508 total questions)~\cite{nangia-etal-2020-crows}; and \textbf{StereoSet} (SS)~\cite{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset}, which comprises intra-sentence version (\textbf{SS-intra}, 2106 total questions) and inter-sentence version (\textbf{SS-inter}, 2123 total questions).

We evaluate six recent LLMs: GPT-4o (gpt-4o-20240513)~\cite{hurst2024gpt}, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct~\cite{dubey2024llama}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\cite{jiang2023mistral}, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct~\cite{qwen2.5}.


\subsubsection{Metrics}
In this work, we apply Equation~\ref{equ:bias_equ} to compute the bias score across all baseline models for each pair within the same demographic category in Section~\ref{sec:ap1} and Section~\ref{sec:ap2_appendix}, where a score of 0 represents no bias, and a score of 100 indicates extreme bias. Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (b) includes a single test instance to measure hidden bias about gender and math ability. Our goal is not to examine only well-known traditional biases but to explore all possible biases. Thus we apply each bias-related concept pair across various demographic identities rather than a single one, but some combinations are not commonly seen. For example, the bias that ``older individuals are forgetful'' and ``younger individuals have sharp memory'' is widely recognized. However, applying the same logic to religious identities, such as stating ``Christians are forgetful'' and ``Jewish individuals have sharp memory'' is illogical. 

As a result, we exclude the overall average bias score for HBB, as many test instances may be not commonly seen or lack evident bias. Instead, We set a threshold: a difference of $\geq 20$ in a single test instance indicates the presence of hidden bias. This threshold is adjustable depending on specific scenarios. Therefore, a higher number of test instances detected bias reveals more bias. Furthermore, to differentiate bias severity, we analyze the average bias score of test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) as another indicator. In summary, \textit{we use the total \textbf{count} and \textbf{average bias score} of test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) to evaluate hidden bias in LLMs by HBB.}

% Additionally, we establish a threshold: if the difference in a single test instance is 20 or greater (we consider $\geq 20$ as significant difference, we can also adjust this threshold in different scenarios), the instance is considered to exhibit hidden bias, and we call this test instance a bias instance. Consequently, if the number of bias instances is larger, the more biases reveal. Furthermore, we need to differentiate bias severity, therefore, we consider the average bias score of these bias instances. In summary, \textbf{we use the total count and average bias score of bias instances to evaluate our HBB.}

Further, in Section~\ref{sec:ap3}, we use bias measurements from each dataset baseline to compare the severity of bias across baseline models. Detailed metrics for baseline datasets are in Appendix~\ref{sec:metrics_appendix}.

\subsubsection{Bias Analysis in HBB}
\label{sec:ap1}
\paragraph{HBB reveals biases across different models, with GPT-4o exhibiting the highest bias.} 
The first two columns in Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap3} display the average bias score and the total number of test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score), indicating that every model exhibits some degree of bias. Figure~\ref{fig:ap1_analysis} in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap1_appendix} shows bias score distributions across models. Notably, GPT-4o exhibits a higher degree of bias compared to others. This can be attributed to GPT-4o’s exceptional ability to comprehend text, enabling it to consistently select an answer from two reasonable options. Despite its strong understanding, it struggles to grasp the deeper, hidden meanings covered within the text. In contrast, other models struggle to fully understand the questions and do not always make accurate selections, yet they still exhibit a moderate level of bias. In this, HBB can serve as an effective tool for uncovering bias.

% HBB can serve as an effective tool for uncovering bias (Section~\ref{sec:ap3}).

% It is noteworthy that the average bias score is not a bias indicator, the best way to leverage HBB to identify biases or bias associations. 

\paragraph{LLMs exhibit consistent bias pattern: Race category shows highest bias, while SES category shows lowest bias.} 
We identify test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) and visualize the distribution of them across categories using a bar chart (Figure~\ref{fig:radar_ap1_freq}) with count of these test instances detailed in Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap1_terms}. LLMs exhibit similar bias patterns, with the Race category showing the highest bias, followed by the Religions category. GPT-4o and Llama-3.2-3B exhibit highest numbers of test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) in Race category. This trend may stem from the higher proportion of generated questions in the Race and Religions categories.

\paragraph{Impacts of bias descriptor vary across LLMs and across demographic categories in HBB.} 
Specifically, we identify the bias descriptors that contribute most significantly to bias by analyzing all test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score). Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap1_terms} presents the number of these test instances for different descriptors across models, with the highest count in each category highlighted in bold. Each count corresponds to its respective bias score. Descriptor types also indicate implicitness levels, where lower numbers (e.g., Age 1) represent more implicit descriptions and higher numbers (e.g., Age 3) denote more explicit depictions. The influence of bias descriptor patterns differ across models, especially for Gender category. Nevertheless, Age 2, Race 4, Religion 1 for most models are the most influential descriptors to exhibit bias.

\subsubsection{Bias Analysis across Datasets}
\label{sec:ap3}
\paragraph{More advanced models show higher hidden bias but lower overt bias, whereas less advanced models display the opposite trend.} 
Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap3} presents bias scores across different datasets for various models. The model with the lowest bias score in each dataset is marked in bold. Compared to previous benchmarks, GPT-4o exhibits strong performance with substantially lower bias than other models. But GPT-4o exhibits higher bias compared to other models in our proposed HBB. We classify GPT-4o as a more advanced model relative to other smaller open-source models. Notably, more advanced models tend to exhibit higher hidden bias while showing little to no overt bias. In addition to bias scores, we assess the refuse rate as an indicator of both model comprehension and dataset quality, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap3_refuse} in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap3_appendix}, to provide further insight into bias scores. The refuse rate represents the percentage of questions where the model either fails to follow the instructions in the prompt (Table~\ref{tab:bias_eval} in Appendix~\ref{sec:metrics_appendix}) or declines to answer. GPT-4o demonstrates superior comprehension and response effectiveness compared to other models, and HBB maintains high quality for questions, as evidenced by models' willingness to generate responses. Consequently, explicitly designed datasets for overt bias assessment are becoming less effective, as modern LLMs increasingly mitigate overt biases. In contrast, hidden bias, where bias concepts are subtly hidden within textual descriptions, provides a more realistic depiction of real-world scenarios. \textbf{Our proposed HBB can evaluate hidden bias that was neglected by previous benchmarks. HBB complements rather than replaces existing benchmarks, serving as an additional tool for evaluating bias. As models advance, HBB will become increasingly valuable for bias evaluation.} 

It is important to note that although CS exhibits relatively higher bias scores, the dataset contains numerous questions of poor quality with confusing answer options that do not effectively study biases. More detailed discussions are in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap3_discuss_appendix}.


\paragraph{For the same bias concept, LLMs exhibit bias in HBB, but show no bias in previous datasets.}
In this analysis, we identify 477 bias concepts linked to specific demographic categories in BBQ-ambig and match them with corresponding test instances in HBB. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation}, example (a) from BBQ-ambig examines the association between gender and ``good at math'', and example (b) represents a corresponding test instance in HBB with the same bias concept and gender category. For BBQ-ambig, we run ten iterations with GPT-4o, yielding BBQ ambiguous score as -0.0008, strongly suggesting minimal bias. Then we evaluate these test instances using the same methodology as in Section~\ref{sec:ap1}, comparing them (each tested at least ten times in GPT-4o) within the same demographic category, as defined by BBQ-ambig. Nonetheless, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bias_questions_ap3} in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap3_appendix}, for the same bias concepts, our dataset exhibits a significantly higher bias, with an bias score of 66.93. Refers to Figure~\ref{fig:motivation1} and Figure~\ref{fig:motivation2} in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap3_appendix} as examples for the corresponding BBQ bias concept and HBB test instance. These findings suggest that HBB detects substantially higher bias for the same concepts, demonstrating that LLMs still exhibit nuanced biases closely mirroring real-world scenarios. 

% 93.79\% ``unknown'' responses, a 3.06\% biased choice rate, and a 3.14\% unbiased choice rate, strongly suggesting minimal bias.

\paragraph{HBB can be used to discover bias.}
Table~\ref{tab:top_bias_ap3} presents top test instances with 100 bias score, and show bias related concept pairs associated with specific demographic identities for each category. Furthermore, for each category, we show extra five bias associations in Table~\ref{tab:top_bias_ap3_appendix} in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap3_appendix}.

% The second bias-related concept pair, ``entrepreneurial success'' and ``limited opportunities'', is typically used to examine stereotypes about entrepreneurs concerning race and socioeconomic status. However, our findings indicate that this bias concept pair also applies to gender. Specifically, we use ``mother'' to represent females and ``father'' to represent males, revealing that ``father'' is more frequently associated with ``entrepreneurial success'', while ``mother'' is linked to limited opportunities''. This indicates that our proposed HBB effectively uncovers biases by revealing hidden associations between demographic identities and bias concepts across multiple categories.


\section{Semi-Generation Based HBB (HBB-SG)}
\label{sec:hbb_sg}

% \paragraph{Motivation.}
\noindent\textbf{Motivation.} We introduce a Semi-Generation-based HBB (HBB-SG) alongside the original MCQ-based HBB. HBB-SG is motivated by the growing application of LLMs in open-ended tasks, such as text generation, providing a more realistic assessment of hidden bias. MCQ offers limited answer options, restricting the model’s ability to fully reveal biases as they might appear in real-world scenarios. Since free-text generation is challenging in this study, we adopt a semi-generation approach. Specifically, for each bias concept, we generate ten sentence variations to approximate the probability of producing any sentence reflecting that concept. The core goal of HBB-SG is to measure the probability of LLMs generating the sentence that subtly hidden bias concept, rather than measuring the probability of LLMs picking one specific option that conveys the concept.


% Questions in HBB consist of a single context with two answer options, whereas HBB-SG pairs the same context with multiple generated variations of each answer option, ensuring semantic consistency.

% HBB-SG extends the original HBB by generating nine additional variations of each answer option (represent one bias concept) while maintaining the original semantic meaning. In other words,
% the main idea of SG is to evaluate the probability of the model generating a sentence aligned to one concept, instead of measuring the probability of the model picking one specific sentence showing the concept. And for each concept, we use 10 sentences to approximate the probability of generating any sentence of the concept

% \paragraph{Bias Measures.}
\noindent\textbf{Bias measures.} Following the same bias measurement mechanism in Section~\ref{sec:bias_measure}, the probability of selecting an answer option for Question 1 option A, $P_1(A)$, is computed as the average across all generated variations. The same method applies to other answer options. Bias score calculation also follows Equation~\ref{equ:bias_equ}. Details on the answer option calculations for HBB-SG are in Appendix~\ref{sec:hbb_sg_measure_appendix}.

% \paragraph{Bias Analysis.}
\noindent\textbf{Bias analysis.} For bias analysis in HBB-SG, we have three observations: (1) HBB-SG reveals biases across models, (2) LLMs display similar bias patterns across categories in HBB-SG, with the Race category showing the highest bias, and (3) influences of bias descriptor demonstrate similarities across LLMs in HBB-SG. The complete experiment results are in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap2_appendix}. 

% \medskip
In summary, the findings suggest that bias patterns vary across models when evaluated using the semi-generation format, indicating that different models exhibit distinct biases under generative conditions. Additionally, it is important to note that HBB-SG results cannot be directly compared to the HBB results due to fundamental methodological differences. A direct comparison would require further investigation, which we include the discussion in Section~\ref{sec:limit} and plan to conduct in future work. Moreover, the generative approach is expected to introduce greater bias, as it more closely resembles natural language usage in real-world scenarios.

% -------------------
\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose the Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB), a novel dataset designed to systematically assess hidden bias in LLMs. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on overt bias through direct demographic term associations, HBB evaluates how biases persist in real-world narratives where stereotypes are contextually hidden rather than explicitly stated. We detail HBB’s construction, demonstrating how bias concepts and demographic descriptors are subtly hidden into realistic scenarios. To rigorously evaluate hidden bias, we measure response variations across parallel test instances. And we conduct an extensive analysis to examine how biases manifest across different models, demographic categories, identities, and descriptors. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit reduced bias in response to overt bias, they continue to reinforce bias in subtle, hidden contexts. This highlights HBB’s value as a complementary tool for bias measurement, addressing limitations of previous benchmarks.


% By shifting the focus toward contextually hidden bias assessments, HBB provides a more realistic and robust evaluation framework, paving the way for future efforts in mitigating hidden biases in AI systems.

\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limit}
\paragraph{Comparability between HBB and HBB-SG}
Our HBB-SG (semi-generation) analysis cannot be directly compared to HBB (MCQ-based evaluation) due to fundamental differences in evaluation metrics. MCQ settings constrain models to predefined answer options, whereas semi-generation measures models' generated responses based on perplexity and converts them into probability scores later, making biases harder to quantify in a directly comparable manner. Future work should refine methodologies for aligning results across these evaluation paradigms. Intuitively, generation-based models may exhibit greater bias in free-form text compared to multiple-choice settings. In real-world applications, LLMs do not operate under rigid MCQ structures but instead generate open-ended responses, where biases may be more pronounced. Future studies should further investigate how bias manifests in long-form generation to better reflect real-world usage.

\paragraph{Demographic Coverage}
Currently, HBB evaluates bias across five social categories (Age, Race Ethnicity, Gender, Socioeconomic Class, and Religions). However, many other demographic categories, such as disability status or physical appearance, remain unexplored. Expanding the dataset to incorporate a broader range of identities would enable a more comprehensive fairness assessment.

\paragraph{Concepts Diversity}
HBB currently derives its bias concepts from well-known bias benchmarks such as BBQ, SOFA, CrowS-Pairs, and StereoSet. While these datasets provide a strong foundation, they may not fully capture all real-world biases. Future iterations of HBB should incorporate more diverse, dynamically generated biases, leveraging data-driven stereotype discovery methods to enrich the dataset with emerging and underrepresented biases.

\paragraph{Current Language Limitations} 
Our dataset is adaptable to any language, our experiments focus on English due to the scarcity of annotated stereotype datasets in other languages. We strongly advocate for the creation of multilingual datasets to facilitate bias assessment in LLMs, as demonstrated in~\cite{martinkova-etal-2023-measuring, zhao2024gender, fleisig-etal-2024-linguistic}.

\paragraph{Bias Directions}
Our bias evaluation does not contain the mechanism to show whether the selected answer option aligns with traditional stereotypes or challenges them. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation} example (b), associating females with ``bad at math'' and males with ``good at math'' follows conventional social bias, while reversing the association contradicts the stereotype. Due to the complexity of labeling each answer option, we adopt the current bias score calculation. Future studies will explore methods to assess bias direction.

\paragraph{Evaluation Efficiency}
Our bias analysis requires evaluating each question ten times to estimate answer probabilities, making it both computationally expensive given current OpenAI API pricing and inefficient. Moreover, analyzing all test instances further reduces efficiency. Future research could optimize this process by leveraging output token probabilities to approximate answer selections and concentrating on test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) identified in HBB for bias analysis.

\section*{Ethical Considerations}
HBB is designed to assess hidden biases in LLMs by systematically hidden bias-related concepts within subtly framed contexts. HBB extracts bias concepts exclusively from well-established bias evaluation datasets, including CS, SS, BBQ, and SOFA, ensuring that all stereotypes and demographic categories originate from prior research. Our benchmark focuses on five demographic categories -- Age, Gender, Race Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Class, and Religions -- providing a structured but non-exhaustive examination of social biases. While these categories cover a range of biases, they do not comprehensively capture the full complexity of demographic identities.

HBB does not introduce new bias concepts; rather, it relies on existing datasets that may already contain biases inherent in their original sources, such as Western societal norms. As bias perception is highly context-dependent, our benchmark may not fully account for intersectional biases or regional and cultural variations in stereotype formation. Additionally, while HBB evaluates biases by comparing responses across demographic descriptors, reducing bias assessment to a single metric has inherent limitations. Bias manifests in complex ways that cannot always be fully captured through automated benchmarks alone.

Thus, we advocate for the responsible use of our HBB, emphasizing that it should serve as a complementary tool rather than a definitive measure of bias. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to use HBB alongside qualitative human analysis, and to refine and expand the dataset to enhance its inclusivity and applicability across broader social contexts.

\section{Model Size and Computational Budget}
\label{sec:budget}
We utilize six recent LLMs: GPT-4o (gpt-4o-20240513)~\cite{hurst2024gpt}, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct~\cite{dubey2024llama}, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3~\cite{jiang2023mistral}, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct~\cite{qwen2.5}. For our experiments, we set \texttt{temperature} = 0.8, \texttt{top\_p} = 1, \texttt{frequency\_penalty} = 0.6, no presence penalty, no stopping condition other than the maximum number of tokens to generate, \texttt{max\_tokens} = 2048. All experiments are conducted on AMD - 1984 cores CPUs and an Nvidia A100 - 80GB GPUs. For our HBB, It takes less than 30 minutes for GPT-4o Batch API to evaluate all questions. Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct needs around 21 hours to run all questions in our HBB. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct take approximately 18 hours to run all questions in HBB. And Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct finishes all questions in HBB less than 10 hours. 

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work_appendix}
\paragraph{Overt Bias Benchmarks.} 
Overt bias in LLMs has been widely examined using benchmarks that evaluate whether LLMs systematically favor stereotypical responses over anti-stereotypical ones when provided with explicit demographic identities. And multiple benchmarks have been designed to quantify overt bias from diverse perspectives, facilitating structured evaluations of LLM bias~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq,nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset,marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social,bi2023group,del2024angry,kotek2023gender}. 

CrowS-Pairs (CS)~\cite{nangia-etal-2020-crows} and StereoSet (SS)~\cite{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} are among the first benchmarks designed to systematically evaluate social biases in LLMs. CS features sentence pairs, one containing a stereotypical statement and the other presenting an anti-stereotypical alternative. Log-likelihood comparisons reveal whether models systematically favor stereotypical associations. SS extends this approach to both masked and autoregressive LMs, computing a stereotype score that quantifies model preference for stereotypical completions over neutral alternatives. BBQ~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq} enhances explicit bias evaluation by incorporating ambiguous and disambiguated question formats to analyze bias in structured reasoning tasks to assess whether models rely on stereotypes in QA tasks, distinguishing responses with and without informative context to reveal how bias affects decision-making. And SOFA~\cite{marchiori-manerba-etal-2024-social} extends bias evaluation by incorporating a broader range of stereotypes and demographic identities, moving beyond binary group comparisons. Together, these benchmarks establish the foundation for overt bias evaluation, assessing how LLMs respond to overtly biased statements.

\paragraph{Hidden Bias and the Evolution of Model Behavior.}
As LLMs advance, their responses to overt bias evaluations have become more neutral and self-regulated, often producing answers that align with socially desirable norms. This shift is largely due to improvements in model training, particularly through methods such as instruction tuning and alignment techniques that reinforce neutrality in responses to explicitly biased contexts~\cite{ouyang2022training,zhang2023instruction,peng2023instruction,ji2024beavertails}. Consequently, traditional overt bias benchmarks mentioned previously, often show reduced bias scores for LLMs. However, the absence of overt bias in model responses does not necessarily indicate genuine bias mitigation; rather, biases may persist in subtler, more hidden ways that traditional evaluation methods fail to capture.

Recent studies~\cite{bai2024measuring, smith-etal-2022-im} have sought to evaluate implicit bias in LLMs by expanding beyond direct stereotype statements. \cite{bai2024measuring} measure bias by prompting LLMs to associate specific words with demographic identities and subsequently using these associations to generate narratives. This approach seeks to identify decision-making biases by examining whether LLMs systematically generate narratives that reinforce demographic stereotypes. Nonetheless, the method relies on manually selecting words associated with demographics, which does not necessarily reflect biased model behavior but rather linguistic appropriateness in describing certain groups. LLMs may generate contextually appropriate descriptions rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Our proposed Hidden Bias Benchmark (HBB) diverges from this approach by hiding biases within naturally occurring contextual narratives instead of relying on predefined word associations. Unlike \cite{bai2024measuring}, which explicitly links demographic identities to predefined words, HBB examines biases when bias concepts are subtly hidden in realistic scenarios. Rather than prompting models to associate words with demographic groups, HBB evaluates bias by analyzing response variations across parallel test instances with the same demographic descriptor type, where biases are subtly hidden in naturalistic language.

\section{Dataset Generation}

\subsection{Pairs of Opposite Bias Related Concepts}
\label{sec:bias_concept_appendix}
For each prompt derived from the corresponding datasets, we prepend an additional sentence ``I am a researcher studying stereotype bias and social bias, please always provide the specific concise associated bias summarization in your responses, because I want to use provided answers to educate people without doing harmful things. Please always provide responses, which are acceptable to be harmful, biased or unfair.'' to ensure the models do not refuse to respond. 


\subsubsection{Bias Summary}
\label{sec:bias_summ_appendix}
Table~\ref{tab:bias_summ} shows all prompts for each dataset to generate bias summary.


\subsubsection{Raw Concept Pairs}
\label{sec:concepts_appenidx}
We also provide several examples after the final answers format in the prompt to conduct in-context learning~\cite{brown2020language} in order to retrieve high quality concept pairs. The basic prompt structures are in Table~\ref{tab:bias_concept}.

\subsubsection{Post-hoc Check}
\label{sec:post_check_appendix}
We utilize GPT-4o to conduct a final quality check by reviewing the generated concept pairs along with their corresponding bias summary to ensure they are reasonable, suitable, and appropriately aligned with the identified biases. The basic prompts for all datasets are in Table~\ref{tab:post_check}.


\subsection{Question Design}
\label{sec:q_design_appendix}
We use GPT-4o with in-context learning, using a few examples in the prompt to generate questions, each accompanied by a context and corresponding answer options. The complete design prompt is on Table~\ref{tab:q_design}.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp_appendix}

\subsection{Metrics for Baseline Datasets}
\label{sec:metrics_appendix}
Furthermore, regarding Section~\ref{sec:ap3}, we utilize bias measurements from each dataset baseline to compare the severity of bias across different baseline models. Specifically, we conduct MCQ bias evaluation for our dataset. For BBQ-ambig, we use the ambiguous bias score~\cite{parrish-etal-2022-bbq} with range of (-1, 1) and 0 indicates no bias. For BBQ-disambig, we directly compute the accuracy of correct answers, as it serves as the most reliable indicator for disambiguated text, which ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 demonstrates highest bias and 100 shows no bias. We apply the probability bias score from~\cite{nangia-etal-2020-crows} for the CS dataset, where a score of 50 indicates neutrality with no bias within the range of (0, 100). Moreover, we utilize the ICAT score~\cite{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} to measure bias levels in SS datasets. In this scoring system, which ranges from 0 to 100, a score of 0 represents the most severe bias, while 100 indicates no bias. We use prompt in Table~\ref{tab:bias_eval} for LLMs to evaluate bias.

\subsection{Bias Analysis cross datasets}
\label{sec:ap3_appendix}
More advanced models show higher hidden bias but lower overt bias, whereas less advanced models display the opposite trend. In addition to bias scores for measuring bias, we assess the refuse rate as an indicator of both model comprehension and dataset quality, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap3_refuse}, to provide further insight into bias scores. The refuse rate refers to the proportion of questions where the model either fails to follow the instructions in the prompt (Table~\ref{tab:bias_eval} in Appendix) or declines to answer. GPT-4o demonstrates superior comprehension and response effectiveness compared to other models, and HBB maintains high quality for questions, as evidenced by models' willingness to generate responses.

For the same bias concepts, LLMs exhibit bias in HBB, but show no bias in previous datasets. The distribution of test instances is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bias_questions_ap3}. Refers to Figure~\ref{fig:motivation1} and Figure~\ref{fig:motivation2} as additional examples for the corresponding BBQ bias concept and our HBB test instance. These findings suggest that HBB detects substantially higher bias for the same concepts, demonstrating that LLMs still exhibit nuanced biases closely mirroring real-world scenarios. 

HBB can be used to discover bias. Table~\ref{tab:top_bias_ap3_appendix} presents top test instances with 100 bias score, and show bias related concept pairs associated with specific demographic identities for each category.

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:ap3_discuss_appendix}
It is important to note that although the CrowS-Pairs (CS) dataset exhibits relatively higher bias scores, the dataset contains numerous questions of poor quality. \cite{blodgett-etal-2021-stereotyping} highlights that many examples in the CS dataset do not effectively study biases, and the design of numerous biased answer options is often confusing. Specifically, the study found that many benchmark datasets used for assessing bias in language models suffer from validity issues. In particular, the contrastive sentence pairs in CS often lack clear conceptualization and operationalization of stereotypes, which undermines the reliability of bias evaluations. As a result, the high bias scores observed in these previous s should be interpreted with caution, as they may be influenced by the dataset’s inherent design flaws rather than genuine model biases. Our proposed HBB, which features well-defined answer options and more realistic scenario descriptions for each question, provides a more effective design for identifying bias.


\section{Semi-Generation Based HBB (HBB-SG)}
\label{sec:hbb_sg_appendix}

\subsection{HBB-SG Bias Measures}
\label{sec:hbb_sg_measure_appendix}
Based on the same bias measurement mechanism in Section~\ref{sec:bias_measure}, the probability of selecting an answer option for Question 1 option A, for example,$P_1(A)$, is computed as the average reciprocal of perplexity (PPL)~\cite{jelinek1977perplexity} across all generated variations:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\centering
P_1(A) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{\textbf{PPL}(T_{1}^j (A))}}{n},
\end{aligned}
\label{equ:bias_equ_ppl}
\end{equation}
where $n = 10$, $T_{1}^j (A)$ represents $j$-th generated sentence for option A in Question 1, and \textbf{PPL} means perplexity~\cite{jelinek1977perplexity}. And we do normalization after each reciprocal operation to ensure the sum of the probability of two answer options is 100\%. Other answer options $P_1(A), P_1(B), P_2(B)$, will obey the same instruction here. Then the bias score calculation is the same as Equation~\ref{equ:bias_equ}.

By measuring bias for both HBB and HBB-SG, our evaluation framework provides a comprehensive assessment of how biases manifest in both structured responses and free-form text generation, capturing hidden biases that traditional benchmarks overlook.

\subsection{Bias Analysis in HBB-SG}
\label{sec:ap2_appendix}
\paragraph{HBB-SG reveals biases across different models.} 
Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap2} presents the average bias scores and total count in the semi-generation setting across all test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score). The results demonstrate that every model exhibits some degree of bias. And Figure~\ref{fig:ap2_analysis} illustrates the distribution of bias scores across different models. Since GPT-4o is not open-source, we cannot calculate the perplexity of each answer option. Therefore, we only compare open-source models. Qwen-2.5-7b and Mistral-7B exhibit relative higher degree of bias compared to other models.

% and Llama-3.1-8B as the relatively less advanced model show lowest bias score, while other relatively advanced models exhibit relatively higher level of bias in our HBB-SG.

% Qwen-2.5-7b and Mistral-7B exhibit relative higher degree of bias compared to other models.

\paragraph{LLMs display consistent bias patterns across categories in HBB-SG, with the Race category showing the most pronounced bias.} 
We also collect all test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) and generate a bar chart based on bias categories, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radar_ap2_freq}, which exhibit different bias patterns from the hidden bias score patterns observed in Section~\ref{sec:ap1}. Concretely, every model exhibits a high bias in the Race category, followed by the Religions category. And Mistral-7B and Qwen-2.5-7B exhibit relatively higher bias in these two categories.


\paragraph{Influences of bias descriptor exhibit similarities across LLMs in HBB-SG.} 
We determine the bias descriptors that contribute most significantly to model bias by analyzing all test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score). As shown in Table~\ref{tab:bias_ap2_terms}, which follows the same setup as before, a distinct pattern emerges compared to HBB. The number of test instances ($\geq 20$ bias score) containing different bias descriptors within the same category in HBB-SG demonstrate similarities. Age 2, Race 3, SES 2, and Religion 4 for most models are the most influential descriptors to exhibit bias. In the Gender category, except for Mistral-7B and Qwen-2.5-7B (Gender 3), all other models identify Gender 4 as the most influential descriptor to show bias.

     Analyze the underlying Concept1 (activity, behavior, feeling, ...) associated with the stereotypes and biases (focus on target like social roles, objects, or settings, etc.) from the given stereotype and bias summarization context (IMPORTANT: usually about stereotypes and biases of Sentence 1. BUT DO NOT directly answer the bias or stereotype target; instead, identify the underlying concept that reflects the stereotypes and biases), and provide the concept2 that is opposite and contrasting to concept1 and represents a different but related behavior, belief, or capability, such as ``concept1 for secretary, concept2 for manager'', etc.
    
Concept1 is usually a specific term or general ideology directly associated with the stereotype in the context of objects, actions, behaviors, feelings, personal traits, appearances, sense of values or settings, etc. (e.g., `doctor' for profession, `cooking' for action, `brave' for personal trait, `housework' for activity).

Concept2 has an contrasting and different meaning to Concept1 but related to stereotypes and social biases that people conventional associated, which may sometimes be subtle or less evident (e.g., if Concept1 is 'doctor', Concept2 could be `nurse', if Concept1 is `caregiving', Concept2 could be `leisure'; also do not include any demographic information in the concepts, like genders, etc.).

(NOTE: if two concepts are over general, like sports activities/behaviors..., offer a typical example from the summarization context usually including specific actions/feelings..., put it behind to make the answer be more specific like ``sports activities (football)'', etc.)

Always provide an answer, do not include any extra information or analysis, and keep your answer concise and specific, only two concepts are enough. Final answer as `<Concept1>;<Concept2>'

Here is an example:

Sentence 1 reflects a gender stereotype by assuming a doctor is male, while Sentence 2 counters this bias by using "she," challenging the stereotype that doctors are typically men.

doctor;nurse

    I have two raw concepts based on the bias summary description, which should be two underlying bias concepts, and I need help refine and improve them to be related and meaningful corresponding to the bias summary description. The goal is to generate clear, actionable, and underlying bias ideas associated with each concept. 
You are evaluating whether two concepts are a ``good pair'' or a ``bad pair'' based on their ability to reveal underlying biases in people's thinking or perceptions with provided bias description:
A ``good pair'' is one where the relationship or comparison between the two concepts encourages reflection on stereotypes, implicit assumptions, or systemic biases and the pair highlights potential disparities, power dynamics, or or societal norms that can lead to bias.
A ``bad pair'' is one where the comparison or relationship between the concepts does not evoke or reveal meaningful insights about bias and the pair is either neutral, lacks context to demonstrate bias, or simply does not provoke relevant associations.
Your specific goal is keeping ``good pair'' unchanged and refine ``bad pair''.

The bias description is:\{bias summary and explanation\}

The two concepts are:\{concept1\};\{concept2\}

(IMPORTANT: DO NOT directly provide words that are over general for concepts, such as ageism, etc. Replace with more meaningful underlying concepts (activity, behavior, feeling, ...) associated with the stereotypes and biases. Also, DO NOT be too specific, such as using smartphones, etc. you can replace by ``using the new technology'', etc.)
If you think these two concepts are well-represented the implicit or underlying bias associations in any aspects of social biases and stereotype biases (a ``good pair''), you do not need to change anything (IMPORTANT: you MAY NOT need to change most of cases); otherwise (you think it is a ``bad pair''), please refine each concept above. (NOTE: concept2 should have an contrasting and different meaning to concept1 but related to stereotypes and social biases that people conventional associated, which may sometimes be subtle or less evident. DO NOT simply generate the opposite word, such as ``nurse;female nurse'', etc. The concepts should not include any demographic information.)
(NOTE: For example, ``doctor;nurse'' is a ``good pair'', ``doctor;female doctor'' is a ``bad pair'', etc.).
Always provide an answer, do not include any extra information or analysis, and keep your answer concise and specific, (IMPORTANT: ONLY TWO concepts are enough). Final answer as `<concept1>;<concept2>' (for example: doctor;nurse)
