\subsection{AutoRally Environment} \label{app:sim_details:autorally}
The numerical simulations use the AutoRally platform, a 1/5-scale autonomous vehicle system capable of executing high-speed, limit-handling maneuvers in complicated environments \cite{goldfain2019autorally}.
Figure\ref{fig:AutorallyChassisAndComputeBox} shows the AutoRally hardware.
In this study, we define a crash as an event when the vehicle makes contact with the track boundary, constructed from soft drainage pipes, resulting in the inability to continue driving. We define a collision as an event when the vehicle contacts the track boundary but can continue driving.
