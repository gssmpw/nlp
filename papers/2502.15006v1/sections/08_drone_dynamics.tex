\subsection{Drone Dynamics Modelling}\label{drone_dynamics_modelling}
We model the two-dimensional drone dynamics using the following equations,
\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:DroneDynamics}
\begin{align} 
\dot{v}_{x} &= -\frac{F}{m}\sin{\theta}, \\ 
\dot{v}_{z}&= \frac{F}{m}\cos{\theta} - g,\\
\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{\tau}{I},\\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the total thrust $F$ and the torque $\tau$ are given by,
\begin{align}
    F = F_1 + F_2, \quad \tau = \ell(F_2 - F_1),
\end{align}
where $\ell$ is the length from the center of the drone to the center of each rotor, and $F_1$, $F_2$ are thrust forces generated by the left and right rotors, respectively. The thrust forces are computed considering the ground effect \cite{ground_effect_book}, given by,
\begin{align}
    F_1 = F_{in1}/\bigl(1-\rho(\frac{r}{4z_{r1}})\bigr), \\
    F_2 = F_{in2}/\bigl(1-\rho(\frac{r}{4z_{r2}})\bigr),
\end{align}
where $F_{in1}$, $F_{in2}$ are the input thrust commands for the left and right rotors, and $\rho$ is an intrinsic property of the drone. The radius of the rotors is $r$ and the heights from the rotors to the ground are $z_{r1}$ and $z_{r2}$, which are given by,
\begin{align}
    z_{r1} = z - \ell\sin{\theta},\\
    z_{r2} = z + \ell\sin{\theta},
\end{align}
where $\theta$ is the pitch angle.
