\section*{Impact statement}
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning, especially enhancing privacy. Among the many potential societal consequences of our work, we specifically acknowledge that techniques mitigating unintended memorization can incidentally facilitate the concealment of unlawful use of copyrighted data by preventing its regurgitation post-training. However, we believe that the benefit of enhanced safeguards for confidential data protection combined with the current advances of other methods such as watermarking \citep{li2023black, tang2023did, cui2024diffusion} can effectively mitigate this risk and provide stronger overall data protection.
