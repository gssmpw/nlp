     \caption{\textbf{Reformulating Image Classification as VQA.} (Left) DomainNet as conventional Image Classification tasks. (Right) DomainNet-oVQA as VQA tasks. We use the same images but add questions "What is in the image?" to generate answers and use original labels as the ground truth answers. To make the two tasks more comparable, we feed the generated answers and 345 class labels into the EVA-Clip text encoder and use cosine similarity search to obtain the most similar class.}
