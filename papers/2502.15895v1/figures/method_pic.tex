     \caption{\textbf{Directional Gradient Projection.} (Left) When the gradients are non-conflicting, we do not perform projection. (Right) When the gradients are conflicting, we project the gradient for the original loss function according to the gradient for the regularization term. We add $\omega \in [0,1]$ to control the projection strength, where $\omega=0$ is an unconstrained update and $\omega=1$ represents a full projection to the orthogonal direction of the gradient for the regularization term.}
