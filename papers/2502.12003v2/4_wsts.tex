\section{The WSTS Benchmark}
\label{sec:wsts}
In this work, we employ the WildfireSpreadTS benchmark \cite{gerard2023wildfirespreadts}. The dataset includes 607 wildfire events across the western United States between 2018 and 2021, totaling 13,607 daily multi-channel images. These 23 channels include data on active fires, weather, topography, and vegetation, resampled to a common resolution of 375 meters, providing a multi-modal and multi-temporal framework for modeling fire spread. A key feature of this benchmark is a rigorous 12-fold cross-validation evaluation procedure. Each fold of the cross-validation includes all wildfire events from a single year, so that the trained models are always evaluated on wildfire events from a previously unseen year, reflecting real-world use of wildfire prediction models.
