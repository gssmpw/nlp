\paragraph{Next Day Wildfire Segmentation} To apply DNNs to fire spread prediction, recent research has framed the spread problem as a semantic segmentation one, and developed multiple datasets to support this framing. \cite{huot2022next} created Next-Day Wildfire Spread, a dataset for mono-temporal fire spread prediction. They developed a custom convolutional autoencoder that takes as input various explanatory variables and outputs a binary mask indicating fire presence at each pixel. Similarly, \cite{gerard2023wildfirespreadts} extended the dataset to include multi-temporal prediction, added more explanatory variables, and higher resolution fire masks. They achieved the best performance using a standard Unet model and a Unet model with temporal attention (UTAE) \cite{garnot2021panoptic}. Other datasets aim to predict beyond next-day and forecast fire behavior several days in advance, e.g., \cite{prapas2022deep} developed SeasFire Cube and trained Unet++ models \cite{zhou2018unet++} for medium-term fire prediction, between 8 and 64 days. \cite{kondylatos2022wildfire} improved upon the collected data cube and found that the LSTM and ConvLSTM models outperformed the Fire Weather Index (FWI). In FireSight, \cite{gottfriedsenfiresight} collected a dataset using remote sensing data from 20 datasets, and trained a 3D UNet model to model short-term fire hazard, between 3 and 8 days.  

\paragraph{Other Approaches}  Aside from segmentation, other formulations have been developed for modeling fire spread using deep learning (DL). \cite{ross2021being} used a CNN-based Reinforcement Learning model that predicts the best action as burn or no burn given current conditions. \cite{ghosh2024fire} developed a probabilistic cellular automata model to simulate wildfire spread. In \cite{lisim2real}, the authors developed Sim2Real-Fire, a synthetic, high-resolution dataset for fire spread forecast and backtracking and outperformed the considered baselines using a custom Transformer model. We refer the readers to \cite{xu2024wildfire} for a more comprehensive review of DL for wildfire prediction. 

\paragraph{Next Day Wildfire Prediction with Time-Series} In contrast to most existing work (e.g., \cite{li2024wildfire, fitzgerald2023paying, shah2023wildfire, xiao2024wildfire}), we focus on utilizing a time-series of features for next-day wildfire spread prediction, which has been cited as an important emerging area of research \cite{fitzgerald2023paying, gerard2023wildfirespreadts, li2024wildfire}.  Historically, time-series modeling has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate public datasets to train and evaluate models for this task. Recently, \cite{gerard2023wildfirespreadts}, building upon the work of \cite{huot2022next}, developed the first multi-temporal dataset for time-series prediction.  Notably, they found that models using a time-series of input tend to outperform those using a single day, reinforcing the importance of this research direction. %We extend the existing time-series prediction research by investigating attention-based models: specifically the recent SwinUnet model \cite{liu2021swin}, which has been found extremely effective in a variety of contexts for segmentation tasks.
