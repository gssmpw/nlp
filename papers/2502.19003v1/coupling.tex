\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces improved numerical techniques for addressing numerical boundary and interface coupling conditions 
in the context of diffusion equations in cellular biophysics or heat conduction problems in fluid-structure interactions. 
Our primary focus is on two critical 
numerical aspects related to coupling conditions: the preservation of the conservation property and ensuring stability. 
Notably, a key oversight in some existing literature on coupling methods is 
the neglect of upholding the conservation property 
within the overall scheme. This oversight forms the central theme of the initial part of our research. 
As a first step, we limited ourselves to
explicit schemes on uniform grids. Implicit schemes and the consideration of varying mesh sizes at the interface will be reserved for a 
subsequent paper \cite{CMW3}. Another paper \cite{CMW2} will address the issue of stability.

We examine these schemes from the perspective of finite differences, including finite elements, 
following the application of a 
nodal quadrature rule. Additionally, we explore a finite volume-based scheme involving cells 
and flux considerations. Our 
analysis reveals that discrete boundary and flux coupling conditions uphold the conservation property 
in distinct ways in nodal-based and cell-based schemes.
The coupling conditions under investigation encompass well-known approaches such as Dirichlet-Neumann coupling, 
heat flux coupling, 
and specific channel and pumping flux conditions drawn from the field of biophysics. The theoretical findings pertaining to 
the conservation property are corroborated through computations across a range of test cases.

\section{Conclusion}

%

We introduced an improved concept of the discrete conservation property for finite difference schemes.
It was demonstrated how this property is important to determine the correct choice of
flux boundary and coupling conditions for the diffusion or heat equation. This was done both
theoretically and using a number of computational examples. The violation of this property
can produce significant computational errors when there are steep gradients near a boundary
or a coupling interface. Our study examined various coupling conditions, including well-established methods such as Dirichlet-Neumann coupling, heat flux coupling, and specific channel and pumping flux conditions from biophysics. Additionally, we highlighted the crucial differences in handling fluxes between nodal-based and finite volume schemes, providing clarity through multiple examples discussed in this work.
