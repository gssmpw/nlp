\section*{Limitations}

Despite our discoveries and improvements, we must acknowledge certain limitations in our work:

\paragraph{Data Size:} Due to resource constraints, our experiments were conducted on a dataset of 200K samples, from which 80K instruction data were finally selected. This limitation restricts our exploration of the application of ViSA on larger datasets. In future work, we aim to extend the use of ViSA to a broader range of open-source datasets.

\paragraph{Theoretical Foundation:} While our method for quantifying image information richness has yielded some promising results, it currently lacks a solid theoretical foundation, limiting the generalizability of our approach. Given the diverse sources and purposes of image data, a comprehensive evaluation of image quality remains a challenging task. We plan to investigate additional theories and methods for image information metrics in future.
