\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present a novel approach called visual-centric selection approach via agent collaboration, which improve the training efficiency and effectiveness of MLLMs through reduce the noise data. Extensive experiments indicate that , with less than 5\% of the data, models trained with our method achieve comparable or even superior results to state-of-the-art approaches. Our paper demonstration that even a small number of high quality data could surpass a large scale of data. Future work will focus on developing more diverse and comprehensive image quality evaluation metrics to capture a broader range of visual complexities and enhance the robustness of model training.
