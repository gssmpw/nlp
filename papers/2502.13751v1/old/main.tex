% Machine Learning models are increasingly being used in high-stakes industries requiring the need for improved explainability... In some applications, it is needed to find Counterfactual Explanations... However, methods being developed by independent researchers are implemented in different ways...

We propose RoCELib, an open-source Python library to implement different machine learning models and counterfactual explanation generation methods in a standardised way... and tools to compare and benchmark these methods...

% Machine learning models are increasingly being deployed across industries to aid decision-making. Their use
The increasing use of machine learning models to aid decision-making in high-stakes industries like finance and healthcare demands explainability to facilitate trust. Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer insights into machine learning models' predictions by illustrating how changes in input data lead to different outcomes. 
An important property of CEs is their robustness, the ability to maintain the desired outcomes even under slight changes in the scenario being explained.  
% To tackle this challenge, various methods have been developed by recent research. However, d
Despite the widespread recognition of CEs' robustness as a fundamental requirement, a lack of standardised benchmarking tools hinders a comprehensive and effective comparison of robust CE generation methods. 
% There is a pressing need for a thorough, fair and reliable framework to evaluate, benchmark and compare CE methods. Therefore, 
In this Demo paper, we introduce \name, an open-source Python library implementing a collection of CE generation and evaluation methods, with a focus on the robustness property, enabling 
% standardised implementations of common and custom CE generation and evaluation methods and offers tools for 
systematic robustness benchmarking for CEs generated by common methods.
\name \space is easily extensible, allowing any customisation of models, datasets and relevant tools for CEs. The library is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/aaryanp2904/RoCELib}.

\section{Introduction}

%Methods to develop counterfactual explanations are being developed by many researchers... thought there are many libraries like CARLA, PROPLACE which implement these methods, they are either outdated or do not offer a way to implement your own methods... This has meant that different methods are implemented on datasets stored in different types (e.g. DataFrame, NdArray) and thus there is not a standardised way to test these methods... Therefore we propose a library to allow researchers to implement their own models, methods and example datasets... This library provides 1) Extensibility 2) Standardised way to implement methods 3) Fair benchmarking of methods...

% This is currently very long but can be cut down quite a bit as I have gone into a lot of detail about robustness and given an example to emphasise the importance of this library.
