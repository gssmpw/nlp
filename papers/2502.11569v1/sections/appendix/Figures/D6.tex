\textbf{Ground Truth (Merge Sort):} -96, -94, -88, -77, -73, -70, -69, -61, -58, -56, -51, -42, -40, -35, -21, -19, -18, -16, -10, -2, 5, 24, 25, 26, 36, 47, 50, 80, 91, 95, 97, 98

\textbf{Prompt:}

Sort the following list of numbers in ascending order:

[-96, -35, -77, -73, -40, 36, 91, 47, -18, -42, -58, 25, 5, -70, -10, -88, 98, -61, -69, 97, -2, 24, 80, -56, -19, 26, -94, 95, -51, -21, -16, 50]

Provide the sorted list.
\\

\textbf{Model Response:}
To sort the list of numbers in ascending order, I'll use the following steps:

1. Start with the original list: 

[-96, -35, -77, -73, -40, 36, 91, 47, -18, -42, -58, 25, 5, -70, -10, -88, 98, -61, -69, 97, -2, 24, 80, -56, -19, 26, -94, 95, -51, -21, -16, 50]

2. Arrange the numbers in ascending order:

- First, place the smallest numbers first. The smallest numbers are -96, -94, -88, -77, -73, -70, -69, -71 is not in the list, -69 is, -69 is smaller than -70, -73, -77, -88, -94, and -96, so we place them first.

- Next, we look at the remaining numbers. The next smallest numbers are -58, -56, -51, -42, -40, -35, -34 is not in the list, -35 is, -35 is smaller than -42, -40, -51, -56, and -58, so we place them next.

- Next, we look at the remaining numbers. The next smallest numbers are -21, -19, -18, -16, -10, -2, -2 is smaller than -10, -16, -18, -19, and -21, so we place them next.

- Next, we look at the remaining numbers. The next smallest numbers are 5, 24, 25, 26, 36, 47, 50, 80, 95, 97, 98, so we place them next.

- Finally, we look at the remaining number, which is 91.

The sorted list in ascending order is:

-96, -94, -88, -77, -73, -70, -69, -58, -56, -51, -42, -40, -35, -21, -19, -18, -16, -10, -2, 5, 24, 25, 26, 36, 47, 50, 80, 91, 95, 97, 98
\\

\textbf{Parsed Sorted List:}
-96, -35, -77, -73, -40, 36, 91, 47, -18, -42, -58, 25, 5, -70, -10, -88, 98, -61, -69, 97, -2, 24, 80, -56, -19, 26, -94, 95, -51, -21, -16, 50
\\

\textbf{Accuracy:} 0
