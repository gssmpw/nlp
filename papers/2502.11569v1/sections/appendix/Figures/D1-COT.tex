\textbf{Prompt:} A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
\\

\textbf{Ground Truth:} It takes $2/2=<<2/2=1>>1$ bolt of white fiber. So the total amount of fabric is $2+1=<<2+1=3>>3$ bolts of fabric.

\#\#\#\# 3 
\\

\textbf{Model Response:} To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Blue Fiber:** The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:** The problem states that the robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, we need to calculate half of 2 bolts:
   \[
   \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. **Total Fiber:** To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
   \[
   \text{Total bolts} = 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is **3 bolts**.

\textbf{Prompt:} A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
\\

Let's think step by step. 
\\

\textbf{Ground Truth:} It takes $2/2=<<2/2=1>>1$ bolt of white fiber. So the total amount of fabric is $2+1=<<2+1=3>>3$ bolts of fabric.

\\

\textbf{Model Response:} Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   - The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **Determine the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Since 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, half of that amount would be:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ bolts}}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber needed:**
   - To find the total amount of fiber, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
     \[
     2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

So, in total, it takes 3 bolts of fiber to make the robe.
