\section{Related Work}
Considering the importance of mitigating and managing vulnerabilities in software ecosystems, a number of studies have been conducted in the area of vulnerability management, with efforts spanning alerting systems, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, and empirical studies on vulnerability lifecycles. Cadariu et al. ____ introduce a Vulnerability Alert Service for proactive risk identification, while Dietrich et al. ____ focus on detecting code clones, addressing gaps in SCA tools.

Prior research has examined vulnerability lifecycles in PyPI ____ and npm ____, but fewer studies focus on Maven. For example, Heng et al. ____ manually analyze 312 CVEs in Maven, whereas our automated approach scales to 3,362 CVEs, providing broader insights. Wu et al. ____ explore transitive dependency risk, while we examine how direct dependents adopt security patches.

To mitigate dependency risks, Zhang et al. ____ propose Ranger, an automated solution for restoring compatibility in vulnerable Maven packages. Mir et al. ____ use reachability analysis to assess transitive vulnerability impacts. Our work differs by empirically measuring maintainer response times, offering new insights into how security fixes propagate in Maven.
