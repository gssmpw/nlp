The design of an efficient and effective AGV-based transportation system requires to address many tactical and operational issues. Among the others, the scheduling of transfer jobs on the AGVs represents one of the main operational issues that has to be solved to overcome delays in production and material handling processes. In this context, a significant research activity on AGV systems and on related scheduling problems has been conducted in the last twenty years. However, most of the contributions neglected the issues related to the AGV battery depletion and recharge. Thus, in this work, we study the AGV scheduling problem with battery constraints (ASP-BC). It consists in determining the scheduling of transfer jobs and charging operations of a fleet of homogeneous AGVs such that the makespan of the handling process is minimized. The methodological contribution of our work is twofold. On one side, we propose an original mixed integer linear programming formulation based on the bottleneck generalized assignment problem. On the other side, we propose a three step matheuristic based on the sequential solution of the two subproblems arising from the natural decomposition of the ASP-BC and a local search heuristic. The proposed approaches have been tested and validated on simulated and real instances provided by a manufacturing company. The results show the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed solution methods.}, number={2}, journal={European Journal of Operational Research}, author={Boccia, Maurizio and Masone, Adriano and Sterle, Claudio and Murino, Teresa}, year={2023}, month=jun, pages={590–603} }

They can provide on-demand computing services for ground users (GUs) without relying on any communication infrastructures and have the potential to provide better computing services with lower latency, compared with the conventional ground-based MEC or cloud-based systems. Considering the limited battery capacity of the UAVs, existing studies on UAV-based MEC have focused on using UAVs to serve GUs over small areas so that all tasks can be completed during a single flight. In this paper, we aim to remove this restriction and expand the range of users the UAV-based MEC system can serve, by integrating charge stations into the system. A joint task scheduling, routing, and charging problem is then formulated with the objective to minimize the total energy consumption, total service time, and total energy charged simultaneously. To solve this problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Comparative numerical studies demonstrate the optimal solutions found by the proposed approaches.}, booktitle={ICC 2022 - IEEE International Conference on Communications}, author={Chen, Jun and Xie, Junfei}, year={2022}, month=may, pages={1–6} }

Thanks to the recent advances of hardware technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are starting to be used for photogrammetric sensing of large areas in several application domains, such as agriculture, rescuing, and surveillance. However, most of the research focused on finding the optimal path taking only geometrical constraints into account, without considering the peculiar features of the robot, like available energy, weight, maximum speed, sensor resolution, etc. This paper proposes an energy-aware path planning algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying a set of other requirements, such as coverage and resolution. The algorithm is based on an energy model derived from real measurements. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through a set of experiments.}, booktitle={2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Robot Systems and Competitions}, author={Di Franco, Carmelo and Buttazzo, Giorgio}, year={2015}, month=apr, pages={111–117} }

We suggest an efficient online trajectory planning algorithm, which minimizes a practical cost function as the energy that is drawn from batteries to motors, which is based on an accurate TOMR dynamic model that includes both the Coriolis force and the actuator motor dynamics. Using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we find the minimum-energy rotational velocity trajectory in analytic form. Then, the minimum-energy translational velocity trajectory is found using a novel algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n), which is based on a linearity condition on the state transition of TOMRs. Moreover, a trajectory control system is implemented using the resolved-acceleration control to validate the actual performance. Simulation and experiment results show that these minimum-energy trajectories can save energy up to 4.76% compared with the energy-efficient trapezoidal velocity profile and up to 5.29% compared with the loss-minimization control.}, number={9}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics}, author={Kim, Hongjun and Kim, Byung Kook}, year={2014}, month=sep, pages={4771–4779} }

GA has been widely applied in path optimization problem which consists in finding a valid and feasible path between two positions while avoiding obstacles and optimizing some criteria such as distance (length of the path), safety (the path must be as far as possible from the obstacles) ...etc. Several researches have provided new approaches used GA to produce an optimal path. Crossover operators existing in the literature can generate infeasible paths, most of these methods dont take into account the variable length chromosomes. The proposed crossover operator avoids premature convergence and offers feasible paths with better fitness value than its parents, thus the algorithm converges more rapidly. A new fitness function which takes into account the distance, the safety and the energy, is also suggested. In order to prove the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to many different environments and compared with three studies in the literature. The simulation results show that using GA with the improved crossover operators and the fitness function helps to find optimal solutions compared to other methods.}, journal={Procedia Computer Science}, author={Lamini, Chaymaa and Benhlima, Said and Elbekri, Ali}, year={2018}, month=jan, pages={180–189}, collection={PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT COMPUTING IN DATA SCIENCES, ICDS2017} }

However, the expensive computing and storage associated with networks impose significant challenges for their deployment on low-cost robots. Motivated by this practical challenge, we develop a lightweight neural path planning architecture with a dual input network and a hybrid sampler for resource-constrained robotic systems. Our architecture is designed with efficient task feature extraction and fusion modules to translate the given planning instance into a guidance map. The hybrid sampler is then applied to restrict the planning within the prospective regions indicated by the guide map. To enable the network training, we further construct a publicly available dataset with various successful planning instances. Numerical simulations and physical experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, our approach has nearly an order of magnitude fewer model size and five times lower computational while achieving promising performance. Besides, our approach can also accelerate the planning convergence process with fewer planning iterations compared to sample-based methods.}, booktitle={2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}, author={Li, Jinsong and Wang, Shaochen and Chen, Ziyang and Kan, Zhen and Yu, Jun}, year={2023}, month=oct, pages={6713–6718} }

The scheduling choices impact these requirements. This presents a challenge: How do we find efficient schedules for CPS with heterogeneous processing units, such that the schedules are resource-bounded to meet the physical requirements? For example, tasks that require significant computation time in a self-driving car can delay reaction, decreasing available braking time. Heterogeneous computing systems —&nbsp;containing CPUs, GPUs, and other types of domain-specific accelerators&nbsp;— offer effective capabilities to reduce computation time or energy consumption and expand such operating conditions. However, doing so under physical requirements presents several challenges that existing scheduling solutions fail to address. We propose the creation of a structured system, the Constrained Autonomous Workload Scheduler (CAuWS). This structured and system-agnostic approach determines scheduling decisions with direct relations to the environment and differs from current ad hoc approaches which either lack heterogeneity, system generality, or this consideration of the physical world. By using a representation language (AuWL), timed Petri nets, and mixed-integer linear programming, CAuWS offers novel capabilities to represent and schedule many types of CPS workloads, real-world constraints, and optimization criteria, creating optimal assignment of heterogeneous processing units to tasks. We demonstrate the utility of CAuWS with a drone simulation under multiple physical constraints. The autonomous computation for the drone is made up of commonly used workloads (i.e., SLAM, and vision networks) and is run on a popular heterogeneous system-on-chip, NVIDIA Xavier AGX.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 38th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={McGowen, Justin and Dagli, Ismet and Dantam, Neil T. and Belviranli, Mehmet E.}, year={2024}, month=jun, pages={298–311}, collection={ICS ’24} }

PDRA enables autonomous robotic agents to share computational resources for computationally expensive tasks such as localization and path planning. It sits between an existing single-agent planner/executor and existing computational resources (e.g. ROS packages), intercepts the executor’s requests and, if needed, transparently routes them to other robots for execution. PDRA is pluggable: it can be integrated in an existing single-robot autonomy stack with minimal modifications. Task allocation decisions are performed by a mixed-integer programming algorithm, solved in a shared-world fashion, that models CPU resources, latency requirements, and multi-hop, periodic, bandwidth-limited network communications; the algorithm can minimize overall energy usage or maximize the reward for completing optional tasks. Simulation results show that PDRA can reduce energy and CPU usage by over 50% in representative multi-robot scenarios compared to a naive scheduler; runs on embedded platforms; and performs well in delay- and disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs).

The mammalian brain solves SLAM via a network of specialized neurons, exhibiting asynchronous computations and event-based communications, with very low energy consumption. We propose a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) architecture that solves the unidimensional SLAM by introducing spike-based reference frame transformation, visual likelihood computation, and Bayesian inference. We integrated our neuromorphic algorithm to Intel’s Loihi neuromorphic processor, a non-Von Neumann hardware that mimics the brain’s computing paradigms. We performed comparative analyses for accuracy and energy-efficiency between our neuromorphic approach and the GMapping algorithm, which is widely used in small environments. Our Loihi-based SNN architecture consumes 100 times less energy than GMapping run on a CPU while having comparable accuracy in head direction localization and map-generation.
