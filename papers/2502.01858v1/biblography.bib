A promising concept in this context are truck-and-robot systems with robot depots, as they enable significant cost and traffic reduction compared to classic truck deliveries. The system relies on small autonomous delivery robots to cover the last meters to a customer. Existing concepts consider home deliveries by robots, while trucks are only used to transport robots and not for deliveries. This assumption disregards the fact that regular truck deliveries are still needed for some delivery requests, such as for the delivery of bulky items, or for customers who do not accept robots. Our research addresses this issue and proposes the first mixed truck and robot delivery concept with robot depots in which both robots and the delivery truck can visit customers. Our tailored solution approach is based on a General Variable Neighborhood Search that efficiently solves the routing problem and outperforms existing truck-and-robot routing algorithms (reducing the runtime by 37 to 94% in experiments). The numerical experiments show that this approach enables cost reductions of up to 43% compared to classical truck deliveries and up to 22% compared to a truck-and-robot system that does not allow deliveries by both truck and robots on the same tour. Further analyses reveal additional benefits of such mixed tours and the robustness of our approach for different problem settings.}, number={1}, journal={European Journal of Operational Research}, author={Heimfarth, Andreas and Ostermeier, Manuel and Hübner, Alexander}, year={2022}, month=nov, pages={401–421} }

Consider a set of deployed “task robots” that request resources (e.g. batteries) from a distribution center, which can deploy “delivery robots” to fulfill those requests. We address the scheduling problem with multiple incoming time-bound requests from the task robots. Our proposed framework incorporates priorities on working robots that can be adjusted by a human operator during scheduling, since mission priorities can change over time. The framework allows a relaxed delivery schedule when available resources are scant and permits dynamic re-routing of delivery robots. The problem is posed as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, and solved as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program using a branch and bound based solver. We present the specific case of a battery distribution system and validate the results in simulation.}, booktitle={2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)}, author={Kamra, Nitin and Ayanian, Nora}, year={2015}, month=aug, pages={612–617} }

This growth can be attributed to advancements in technology and legislation, exacerbated conventional delivery challenges, and pandemic-mediated need for contactless deliveries. A growing number of studies have investigated the various aspects pertaining to ADR-based delivery operations. Nevertheless, there is a lack of extensive literature review that holistically reports on various problems in ADR-based delivery operations, adopted methodologies, novel findings, and future needs. This paper aims to systematically survey the existing research on ADR-based delivery systems and associated operations. Foremost, we discuss various technology, design, and legal factors that impact ADR operations. Subsequently, we are the first to review the state-of-the-art research in ADR-based deliveries concerning the following areas—routing, infrastructure and fleet planning, factors affecting efficiency, technology acceptance, and social intelligence. Finally, we anticipate potential challenges from an operations management perspective, identify research gaps, and delineate future research opportunities for ADR-based deliveries.}, journal={Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review}, author={Srinivas, Sharan and Ramachandiran, Surya and Rajendran, Suchithra}, year={2022}, month=sep, pages={102834} }

However, most of the research focused on finding the optimal path taking only geometrical constraints into account, without considering the peculiar features of the robot, like available energy, weight, maximum speed, sensor resolution, etc. This paper proposes an energy-aware path planning algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying a set of other requirements, such as coverage and resolution. The algorithm is based on an energy model derived from real measurements. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through a set of experiments.}, booktitle={2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Robot Systems and Competitions}, author={Di Franco, Carmelo and Buttazzo, Giorgio}, year={2015}, month=apr, pages={111–117} }

However, the expensive computing and storage associated with networks impose significant challenges for their deployment on low-cost robots. Motivated by this practical challenge, we develop a lightweight neural path planning architecture with a dual input network and a hybrid sampler for resource-constrained robotic systems. Our architecture is designed with efficient task feature extraction and fusion modules to translate the given planning instance into a guidance map. The hybrid sampler is then applied to restrict the planning within the prospective regions indicated by the guide map. To enable the network training, we further construct a publicly available dataset with various successful planning instances. Numerical simulations and physical experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, our approach has nearly an order of magnitude fewer model size and five times lower computational while achieving promising performance. Besides, our approach can also accelerate the planning convergence process with fewer planning iterations compared to sample-based methods.}, booktitle={2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}, author={Li, Jinsong and Wang, Shaochen and Chen, Ziyang and Kan, Zhen and Yu, Jun}, year={2023}, month=oct, pages={6713–6718} }

We suggest an efficient online trajectory planning algorithm, which minimizes a practical cost function as the energy that is drawn from batteries to motors, which is based on an accurate TOMR dynamic model that includes both the Coriolis force and the actuator motor dynamics. Using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we find the minimum-energy rotational velocity trajectory in analytic form. Then, the minimum-energy translational velocity trajectory is found using a novel algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n), which is based on a linearity condition on the state transition of TOMRs. Moreover, a trajectory control system is implemented using the resolved-acceleration control to validate the actual performance. Simulation and experiment results show that these minimum-energy trajectories can save energy up to 4.76% compared with the energy-efficient trapezoidal velocity profile and up to 5.29% compared with the loss-minimization control.}, number={9}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics}, author={Kim, Hongjun and Kim, Byung Kook}, year={2014}, month=sep, pages={4771–4779} }

GA has been widely applied in path optimization problem which consists in finding a valid and feasible path between two positions while avoiding obstacles and optimizing some criteria such as distance (length of the path), safety (the path must be as far as possible from the obstacles) ...etc. Several researches have provided new approaches used GA to produce an optimal path. Crossover operators existing in the literature can generate infeasible paths, most of these methods dont take into account the variable length chromosomes. The proposed crossover operator avoids premature convergence and offers feasible paths with better fitness value than its parents, thus the algorithm converges more rapidly. A new fitness function which takes into account the distance, the safety and the energy, is also suggested. In order to prove the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to many different environments and compared with three studies in the literature. The simulation results show that using GA with the improved crossover operators and the fitness function helps to find optimal solutions compared to other methods.}, journal={Procedia Computer Science}, author={Lamini, Chaymaa and Benhlima, Said and Elbekri, Ali}, year={2018}, month=jan, pages={180–189}, collection={PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT COMPUTING IN DATA SCIENCES, ICDS2017} }

The design of an efficient and effective AGV-based transportation system requires to address many tactical and operational issues. Among the others, the scheduling of transfer jobs on the AGVs represents one of the main operational issues that has to be solved to overcome delays in production and material handling processes. In this context, a significant research activity on AGV systems and on related scheduling problems has been conducted in the last twenty years. However, most of the contributions neglected the issues related to the AGV battery depletion and recharge. Thus, in this work, we study the AGV scheduling problem with battery constraints (ASP-BC). It consists in determining the scheduling of transfer jobs and charging operations of a fleet of homogeneous AGVs such that the makespan of the handling process is minimized. The methodological contribution of our work is twofold. On one side, we propose an original mixed integer linear programming formulation based on the bottleneck generalized assignment problem. On the other side, we propose a three step matheuristic based on the sequential solution of the two subproblems arising from the natural decomposition of the ASP-BC and a local search heuristic. The proposed approaches have been tested and validated on simulated and real instances provided by a manufacturing company. The results show the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed solution methods.}, number={2}, journal={European Journal of Operational Research}, author={Boccia, Maurizio and Masone, Adriano and Sterle, Claudio and Murino, Teresa}, year={2023}, month=jun, pages={590–603} }

The mammalian brain solves SLAM via a network of specialized neurons, exhibiting asynchronous computations and event-based communications, with very low energy consumption. We propose a brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) architecture that solves the unidimensional SLAM by introducing spike-based reference frame transformation, visual likelihood computation, and Bayesian inference. We integrated our neuromorphic algorithm to Intel’s Loihi neuromorphic processor, a non-Von Neumann hardware that mimics the brain’s computing paradigms. We performed comparative analyses for accuracy and energy-efficiency between our neuromorphic approach and the GMapping algorithm, which is widely used in small environments. Our Loihi-based SNN architecture consumes 100 times less energy than GMapping run on a CPU while having comparable accuracy in head direction localization and map-generation.

PDRA enables autonomous robotic agents to share computational resources for computationally expensive tasks such as localization and path planning. It sits between an existing single-agent planner/executor and existing computational resources (e.g. ROS packages), intercepts the executor’s requests and, if needed, transparently routes them to other robots for execution. PDRA is pluggable: it can be integrated in an existing single-robot autonomy stack with minimal modifications. Task allocation decisions are performed by a mixed-integer programming algorithm, solved in a shared-world fashion, that models CPU resources, latency requirements, and multi-hop, periodic, bandwidth-limited network communications; the algorithm can minimize overall energy usage or maximize the reward for completing optional tasks. Simulation results show that PDRA can reduce energy and CPU usage by over 50% in representative multi-robot scenarios compared to a naive scheduler; runs on embedded platforms; and performs well in delay- and disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs).

The scheduling choices impact these requirements. This presents a challenge: How do we find efficient schedules for CPS with heterogeneous processing units, such that the schedules are resource-bounded to meet the physical requirements? For example, tasks that require significant computation time in a self-driving car can delay reaction, decreasing available braking time. Heterogeneous computing systems —&nbsp;containing CPUs, GPUs, and other types of domain-specific accelerators&nbsp;— offer effective capabilities to reduce computation time or energy consumption and expand such operating conditions. However, doing so under physical requirements presents several challenges that existing scheduling solutions fail to address. We propose the creation of a structured system, the Constrained Autonomous Workload Scheduler (CAuWS). This structured and system-agnostic approach determines scheduling decisions with direct relations to the environment and differs from current ad hoc approaches which either lack heterogeneity, system generality, or this consideration of the physical world. By using a representation language (AuWL), timed Petri nets, and mixed-integer linear programming, CAuWS offers novel capabilities to represent and schedule many types of CPS workloads, real-world constraints, and optimization criteria, creating optimal assignment of heterogeneous processing units to tasks. We demonstrate the utility of CAuWS with a drone simulation under multiple physical constraints. The autonomous computation for the drone is made up of commonly used workloads (i.e., SLAM, and vision networks) and is run on a popular heterogeneous system-on-chip, NVIDIA Xavier AGX.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 38th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={McGowen, Justin and Dagli, Ismet and Dantam, Neil T. and Belviranli, Mehmet E.}, year={2024}, month=jun, pages={298–311}, collection={ICS ’24} }

Cartographer has been used in commercial applications such as Google Street View and in robotics applications such as interior mapping based on robot operating system (ROS) bag file recordings. However, cartographer is a complex system and incurs heavy computation demand. This paper aims at alleviating this demand by utilizing an FPGA-based approach to accelerate key components of Cartographer. Based on our analysis, we found that candidate scoring is the most time-consuming component of Cartographer. By implementing the candidate scoring function on an FPGA, the candidates can be scored at a much faster rate, which in turn allows Cartographer to generate a map much more quickly. In addition, our FPGA-based approach can lead to significant reduction in energy consumption when compared with traditional CPU-based approach, which makes it more suitable to be deployed in mobile and embedded computing scenarios.}, booktitle={2021 Fourth International Conference on Connected and Autonomous Driving (MetroCAD)}, author={Frank, Joshua and Yang, Zhiliu and Liu, Chen}, year={2021}, month=apr, pages={48–53} }

In this paper, an ultra-low-power artificial intelligence processor (AIP) is proposed for real-time decision making of autonomous mobile robots. To achieve low power consumption while maintaining high performance, it adopts four key features: 1) an 8-thread tree search processor for real-time path planning; 2) a reinforcement learning accelerator for the avoidance of unexpected obstacles; 3) a 3-level transposition table cache for the reduction of duplicated computations; and 4) a PVT compensation circuit for the stable operation at near-threshold voltage. The proposed 16 mm^2 AIP is fabricated using 65-nm triple-well CMOS technology. It consumes only 1.1 mW at 0.55 V supply voltage and 7 MHz operating frequency, and 151 mW at 1.2 V supply voltage and 245 MHz operating frequency. The AIP achieves fast search speed (470 000 search/s) and low energy consumption (79 nJ/search), and it is successfully applied to a battery-powered robot system for autonomous navigation without any collision in dynamic indoor environments.}, number={2}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers}, author={Kim, Youchang and Shin, Dongjoo and Lee, Jinsu and Lee, Yongsu and Yoo, Hoi-Jun}, year={2018}, month=feb, pages={567–580} }

They can provide on-demand computing services for ground users (GUs) without relying on any communication infrastructures and have the potential to provide better computing services with lower latency, compared with the conventional ground-based MEC or cloud-based systems. Considering the limited battery capacity of the UAVs, existing studies on UAV-based MEC have focused on using UAVs to serve GUs over small areas so that all tasks can be completed during a single flight. In this paper, we aim to remove this restriction and expand the range of users the UAV-based MEC system can serve, by integrating charge stations into the system. A joint task scheduling, routing, and charging problem is then formulated with the objective to minimize the total energy consumption, total service time, and total energy charged simultaneously. To solve this problem, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model.

abstract = {In recent years, with the continuous breakthrough of computer vision technology, the accuracy of object detection and target recognition has been improved by leaps and bounds. Face recognition is one of the important research directions in the field of computer vision, which is widely used in mobile payment, safe city, criminal investigation and other fields. Traditional face recognition methods need to extract face image features manually. The extracted features are greatly affected by subjective factors, and time-consuming and laborious. Deep learning is the most important technology in the field of computer vision at present. Compared with traditional face recognition methods, it can extract more essential features of face image without manual participation. In this paper, we build a face recognition system based on neural computing model and the principle of neural network. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high detection rate and short processing time.}

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are a special class of robotic systems that can move a payload from one location to the other or perform a specific task. They allow efficient, precise, and streamlined workflow that makes human work less arduous. The market and research work related to these robots is increasing in anticipation of industry 5.0, where humans and machines are expected to co-exist and co-work. The future mobile robots are desired to have clean and cost-effective energy sources to have longer operation times and compliance with environmental requirements to allow application in diverse fields. The research on mechanical design, perception, navigation and control has carved out many commercially viable solutions for mobile robots. However, their widespread application is still limited due to the lack of efficient power systems for use in diverse and largely unknown/uncontrolled environments. The current power solutions incur high initial costs and require recharging or refuelling, which makes them unsuitable for unattended long-haul worktimes and cost-effective applications. These drawbacks are major hurdles in the wider applicability of terrain-based mobile robots to new domains and daily life scenarios, which are possible with the existing mechanical, perception, and control technologies. Keeping in view the need for advancement in this field and to gain a better understanding of the current state of the art and future directions, this work summarizes and reviews the energy solutions presented in the literature and used in notable commercially available terrain-based mobile robots. The provided solutions are categorized and discussed while the prospects and research gaps are also highlighted. A comparison of discussed power techniques is also provided, which can serve as a guideline for selecting a robot’s energy source according to the desired requirements.}

To ensure seamless and uninterrupted operations, an effective coordination of task allocation and charging schedules is crucial while considering the preservation of battery sustainability. Moreover, regular preventive maintenance plays an important role in enhancing the robustness of AMRs against hardware failures and abnormalities during task execution. However, existing works do not consider the inﬂuence of properly scheduling AMR maintenance on both task downtime and battery lifespan. In this paper, we propose MTC, a maintenance-aware task and charging scheduler designed for ﬂeets of AMR operating continuously in highly automated environments. MTC leverages Linear Programming (LP) to ﬁrst help decide the best time to schedule maintenance for a given set of AMRs. Subsequently, the KuhnMunkres algorithm, a variant of the Hungarian algorithm, is used to ﬁnalize task assignments and carry out the charge scheduling to minimize the combined cost of task downtime and battery degradation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MTC, reducing the combined total cost up to 3.45 times and providing up to 68% improvement in battery capacity degradation compared to the baselines.}, number={6}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing}, author={Atik, Syeda Tanjila and Chavan, Akshar Shravan and Grosu, Daniel and Brocanelli, Marco}, year={2023}, month=nov, pages={7394–7407}, language={en} }

However, one of the major limitations of AMRs is their limited battery life, which often results in interruptions to their task execution and the need to reach the nearest charging station. Optimizing energy consumption in AMRs has become a critical challenge in their deployment. Through empirical studies on real AMRs, we have identified a lack of coordination between computation and control as a major source of energy inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive energy prediction model that provides real-time energy consumption for each component of the AMR. Additionally, we propose three path models to address the obstacle avoidance problem for AMRs. To evaluate the performance of our energy prediction and path models, we have developed a customized AMR called Donkey, which has the capability for fine-grained (millisecond-level) end-to-end power profiling. Our energy prediction model demonstrated an accuracy of over 90% in our evaluations. Finally, we applied our energy prediction model to obstacle avoidance and guided energy-efficient path selection, resulting in up to a 44.8% reduction in energy consumption compared to the baseline.}, booktitle={2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}, author={Liu, Liangkai and Zhong, Ren and Willcock, Aaron and Fisher, Nathan and Shi, Weisong}, year={2023}, month=may, pages={11569–11575} }
