\section{Limitation and Future Work}

Although our method can automatically rig a variety of objects, there are several limitations and potential avenues for future work.
% 
 First, our current approach does not allow for control over the level of detail in the rigs. Specifically, artists may need varying levels of detail in different parts of an object to achieve different degrees of motion control.
To get this feature, more detailed rigging data shall be collected to allow for finer rigging (\textit{e.g.}, head and hand area), and we can introduce a condition in the network to provide control over the level of detail.
% 
In addition, our method relies solely on geometry information to infer rigs, which can sometimes lack sufficient cues for the rig structure, leading to ambiguities. To improve this, texture information can be incorporated as an additional cue for automatic rigging in future iterations.

Furthermore, our skinning weight prediction does not account for different motion styles, such as those influenced by materials. This limitation could be alleviated by incorporating dynamic data into the training process. However, high-quality dynamic data are scarce, and it would be interesting to explore the possibility of collecting such data to further improve rigging performance.
