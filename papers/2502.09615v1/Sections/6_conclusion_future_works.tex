\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present RigAnything, an autoregressive transformer-based method that automatically predicts rigs for 3D assets. 
% 
To address the challenges posed by objects with diverse topologies and eliminate the inherent ambiguities in rigging, RigAnything probabilistically predicts the skeletons and assigns skinning weights, eliminating the need for any templates.
% 
This approach allows RigAnything to be trained end-to-end on both RigNet and the diverse Objaverse dataset, ensuring its versatility.
% 
Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of RigAnything across a wide range of object categories, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.
