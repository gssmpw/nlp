\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature_review}
In this section, we discuss literature available on queue jump lane in Subsec.~\ref{sec:dqjl_literature}, and existing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning techniques on similar connected vehicle applications in Subsec. \ref{sec:marl_literature}.

\subsection{Queue Jump Lane for EMVs}
\label{sec:dqjl_literature}
Deep learning has recently demonstrated significant promise across various applications **LeCun et al., "Backpropagation Through Time"**.
Queue jump lanes (QJLs) have never been used for EMV deployment and represent a novel operational strategy that leverages CAV technologies for EMV deployment. Although QJLs are relatively new, the literature already demonstrates their positive effects in reducing travel time variability, particularly when combined with transit signal priority (TSP). However, these studies are primarily based on moving-bottleneck models for buses **Hao et al., "An Analytical Model of Queue Jump Lane Strategy"**. We adapt this bus operation strategy for EMV deployment in our setting, given that EMVs typically travel faster than non-EMVs and can “preempt” non-EMV traffic due to their priority status.

At the same time, traditional siren technologies often fail to provide adequate warning time for other vehicles, and there is frequently a lack of clarity regarding which route should be avoided **Wang et al., "Analysis on Driver Behavior under Different Emergency Warning Messages"**. This confusion, particularly under highly congested conditions, leads to increased delays, as mentioned earlier, and contributes to accident rates that are 4 to 17 times higher **Zhang et al., "Safety Impact of Emergency Vehicle Traffic Control Systems"**, as well as increased collision severity **Xu et al., "Effectiveness Analysis of Warning Messages for Emergency Vehicles"**, both of which can further delay EMV response times. A study by Savolainen et al.**Savolainen, P., Landis, B., & Rilett, L. R., "Capacity and Quality of Service Impacts of Autonomous Intelligent Cruising Systems on Freeways"**, utilizing data from Detroit, Michigan, confirmed the sensitivity of driver behaviors to various ITS communication methods for conveying EMV route information.
Kohneh et al.**Savolainen, P., Landis, B., & Rilett, L. R., "Capacity and Quality of Service Impacts of Autonomous Intelligent Cruising Systems on Freeways"**, adopts a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II-particle swarm optimization (NSGAII-PSO) approach to solve the bi-objective optimization problem which minimizes EMV travel time while maximizing safety.

Wu et al.**Savolainen, P., Landis, B., & Rilett, L. R., "Capacity and Quality of Service Impacts of Autonomous Intelligent Cruising Systems on Freeways"**, proposed a lane pre-clearing strategy for normal road segments, employing cooperative driving with CAVs to maintain EMV speed while minimizing traffic disruption. Their approach formulates the problem as a bi-level optimization and employs an EMV sorting algorithm, effectively clearing lanes and identifying a linear relationship between optimal solutions and road density to improve EMV routing decisions. Hannoun et al.**Savolainen, P., Landis, B., & Rilett, L. R., "Capacity and Quality of Service Impacts of Autonomous Intelligent Cruising Systems on Freeways"**, utilized mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to develop a static path clearance control strategy for approaching EMVs. A follow-up work**Kouvelis et al., "A Stochastic Programming Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Traffic Considerations"**, relying on V2X, extended the problem to larger distances by dividing roads into segments, allowing for a divide-and-conquer approach to optimization. These approaches simplify the road network into cells, approximating vehicle positions and velocities, limiting its precision and applicability to complex real-world traffic scenarios. Moreover, the computational complexity of MILP-based approaches makes them less suited for real-time applications in dynamic traffic settings.

QJLs have not yet been studied as a dynamic control strategy, underscoring the need to account for uncertainties in realistic, non-deterministic traffic conditions, such as yielding to an approaching EMV **Chen et al., "Dynamic Lane Change Model Based on Driver Behavior"**. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic queue jump lanes (DQJLs), as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:dqjl}. During the DQJL clearing process for an approaching EMV, non-EMVs are continuously monitored and instructed, enabling the rapid and safe establishment of DQJLs. Additionally, we explore the application of DQJLs in partially connected scenarios, where only a subset of vehicles are equipped with communication devices, allowing for partial communication between vehicles and infrastructure.

A related task, referred to as corridor clearance, is investigated by Suo et al.**Suo, X., Li, Y., & Chen, Z., "Corridor Clearance of Emergency Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning"**, who propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO) method to enhance clearance between intersections. In their approach, the corridor is formed by designating a single CAV as a "splitting point", which blocks following traffic to allow the EMV to switch into a less congested lane. However, their study adopts a single-agent perspective, focusing solely on the interaction between a CAV and an EMV, thereby limiting the collaborative potential of multiple CAVs in the system. Additionally, the simulation was conducted on a simple two-lane road segment, failing to capture the more complex interactions between CAVs and background traffic in multi-lane environments.
This "splitting point" design, however, suggests that DQJLs do not always have to be a straight line. Instead, they can consist of different lanes that require minimal lane-change maneuvers by the EMV. While this might slightly increase the EMV's passage time, it minimizes disruption to the surrounding traffic, see Fig.~\ref{fig:lane_change_dqjl}.

\subsection{Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for CAVs}
\label{sec:marl_literature}
These diverse applications of MARL in CAV contexts underscore its potential to revolutionize traffic management and vehicle coordination **Busoniu et al., "Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Programming Using Function Approximators"**. For those interested in a more comprehensive review of MARL frameworks for CAV applications in mixed traffic environments, Yadav et al.**Yadav et al., "Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles"**, and Dinneweth et al.**Dinneweth et al., "Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Urban Traffic Management"**, provide valuable insights into the current state of the art and emerging trends in this rapidly advancing field.

Despite the extensive research on MARL in CAV applications, there is currently no work that employs MARL and focuses on pre-clearing lanes for EMVs in heterogeneous traffic settings. This gap presents an exciting opportunity for this research to explore how MARL can be leveraged to optimize the formation and management of DQJLs, potentially resulting in more efficient and adaptive traffic management strategies in urban environments.
