abstract = {Background and Purpose— The phrase “time is brain” emphasizes that human nervous tissue is rapidly lost as stroke progresses and emergent evaluation and therapy are required. Recent advances in quantitative neurostereology and stroke neuroimaging permit calculation of just how much brain is lost per unit time in acute ischemic stroke. Methods— Systematic literature-review identified consensus estimates of number of neurons, synapses, and myelinated fibers in the human forebrain; volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke; and interval from onset to completion of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke. Results— The typical final volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke is 54 mL (varied in sensitivity analysis from 19 to 100 mL). The average duration of nonlacunar stroke evolution is 10 hours (range 6 to 18 hours), and the average number of neurons in the human forebrain is 22 billion. In patients experiencing a typical large vessel acute ischemic stroke, 120 million neurons, 830 billion synapses, and 714 km (447 miles) of myelinated fibers are lost each hour. In each minute, 1.9 million neurons, 14 billion synapses, and 12 km (7.5 miles) of myelinated fibers are destroyed. Compared with the normal rate of neuron loss in brain aging, the ischemic brain ages 3.6 years each hour without treatment. Altering single input variables in sensitivity analyses modestly affected the estimated point values but not order of magnitude. Conclusions— Quantitative estimates of the pace of neural circuitry loss in human ischemic stroke emphasize the time urgency of stroke care. The typical patient loses 1.9 million neurons each minute in which stroke is untreated.}}

abstract = {Emergency vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in providing timely help for the general public in saving lives and avoiding property loss. However, very few efforts have been made for EV prioritization on normal road segments, such as the road section between intersections or highways between ramps. In this paper, we propose an EV lane pre-clearing strategy to prioritize EVs on such roads through cooperative driving with surrounding connected vehicles (CVs). The cooperative driving problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem aiming at (i) guaranteeing the desired speed of EVs, and (ii) minimizing the disturbances on CVs. To tackle this NP-hard MINP problem, we formulate the model in a bi-level optimization manner to address these two objectives, respectively. In the lower-level problem, CVs in front of the emergency vehicle will be divided into several blocks. For each block, we developed an EV sorting algorithm to design optimal merging trajectories for CVs. With resultant sorting trajectories, a constrained optimization problem is solved in the upper-level to determine the initiation time/distance to conduct the sorting trajectories. Case studies show that with the proposed algorithm, emergency vehicles are able to drive at a desired speed while minimizing disturbances on normal traffic flows. We further reveal a linear relationship between the optimal solution and road density, which could help to improve EV routing decision makings when high-resolution data is not available.}

    abstract = { Emergency response vehicles (ERVs) need to move fast, which can lead to potential accidents. A system is proposed to utilize connected vehicle technology for facilitating the movement of multiple ERVs in a two-way roadway. A biobjective model was developed to minimize the ERVs’ travel/response times while maximizing safety. The proposed system can help non-ERVs stop in assigned locations and wait for the ERVs to pass. According to mission priority, different types of ERVs (ambulance, fire truck, and police car) can use a travel lane from the opposite direction (contraflow) to move faster. A hybrid nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II-particle swarm optimization (NSGAII-PSO) approach was used to solve the model faster than CPLEX. To evaluate the system’s performance, different experiments, including various road types, numbers and types of ERVs, direction priorities, and congestion levels, have been conducted. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve the travel time of ERVs that have the priority to use the contraflow lane in cases where the other side of the roadway is less congested and has a shoulder (when opposing ERVs use a two-way roadway simultaneously). The proposed system can eliminate weaving and passing among non-ERVs in all cases compared to two current strategies (going to the right edge and vacating the ERV lane without receiving instructions). }

abstract = {This paper proposes a cooperative strategy of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) longitudinal control for a mixed connected and automated traffic environment based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which enhances the string stability of mixed traffic, car following efficiency, and energy efficiency. Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV’s characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model has a great generalization capability of dampening oscillations, fulfilling the car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration rates and various leading HDVs behaviors.}

abstract={In the near future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) may cohabit with human drivers in mixed traffic. This cohabitation raises serious challenges, both in terms of traffic flow and individual mobility, as well as from the road safety point of view. Mixed traffic may fail to fulfill expected security requirements due to the heterogeneity and unpredictability of human drivers, and autonomous cars could then monopolize the traffic. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, researchers have attempted to design autonomous vehicles for both scenarios, and this paper investigates their recent advances. We focus on articles tackling decision-making problems and identify four paradigms. While some authors address mixed traffic problems with or without social-desirable AVs, others tackle the case of fully-autonomous traffic. While the latter case is essentially a communication problem, most authors addressing the mixed traffic admit some limitations. The current human driver models found in the literature are too simplistic since they do not cover the heterogeneity of the drivers' behaviors. As a result, they fail to generalize over the wide range of possible behaviors. For each paper investigated, we analyze how the authors formulated the MARL problem in terms of observation, action, and rewards to match the paradigm they apply.},

abstract = "The transportation demand is rapidly growing in metropolises, resulting in chronic traffic congestions in dense downtown areas. Adaptive traffic signal control as the principle part of intelligent transportation systems has a primary role to effectively reduce traffic congestion by making a real-time adaptation in response to the changing traffic network dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach in machine learning that has been applied for designing adaptive traffic signal controllers. One of the most efficient and robust type of RL algorithms are continuous state actor-critic algorithms that have the advantage of fast learning and the ability to generalize to new and unseen traffic conditions. These algorithms are utilized in this paper to design adaptive traffic signal controllers called actor-critic adaptive traffic signal controllers (A-CATs controllers). The contribution of the present work rests on the integration of three threads: (a) showing performance comparisons of both discrete and continuous A-CATs controllers in a traffic network with recurring congestion (24-h traffic demand) in the upper downtown core of Tehran city, (b) analyzing the effects of different traffic disruptions including opportunistic pedestrians crossing, parking lane, non-recurring congestion, and different levels of sensor noise on the performance of A-CATS controllers, and (c) comparing the performance of different function approximators (tile coding and radial basis function) on the learning of A-CATs controllers. To this end, first an agent-based traffic simulation of the study area is carried out. Then six different scenarios are conducted to find the best A-CATs controller that is robust enough against different traffic disruptions. We observe that the A-CATs controller based on radial basis function networks (RBF (5)) outperforms others. This controller is benchmarked against controllers of discrete state Q-learning, Bayesian Q-learning, fixed time and actuated controllers; and the results reveal that it consistently outperforms them."

abstract = "The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) into cellular network infrastructure is gaining much attention from the research community and standardisation groups, where new cellular-based enabling communication technologies are proposed to provide data links over existing cellular networks for IoT deployment. The Long Term Evolution (LTE) network and the emerging 5G system (New Radio) are widely acknowledged as the main driving forces for the connected-vehicle in the mobile network domain. On the other hand, vehicular networks are characterised by high mobility, high node density, dynamic network topology, time sensitivity and high transmission reliability. These unique characteristics of vehicular networks introduce new security implications and therefore, necessitate enhancement of existing LTE security or provision of new security techniques, in order to ensure fast, secure and reliable vehicular communications under mobile network. In this paper, an introduction to Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services alongside the corresponding service requirement is presented. Then, the potential benefits of using cellular infrastructure for V2X services and the reference architectures for cellular-based V2X systems are described. We then focus on the security requirements of V2X in cellular network, specifically; on the authentication of V2X entities, as any violation or breach of authentication process can expose the entire network to serious consequences. The paper discusses common V2X threats and surveys existing V2X authentication solutions proposed in the literature. Finally, paper presents security issues related to V2X communication in cellular network leading towards possible research challenges."

abstract = "Vehicle communications are becoming the cornerstone in the future vehicle equipment. More specifically, vehicle to vehicle communications (V2V) are the main object of researching nowadays, because vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) approximations are already being developed as commercial solutions. Cellular networks (CN) are usually applied in V2I solutions, whereas ad hoc networks are practically the only technology considered in V2V communications. Due to fact that CN are currently a reality and the operators are continuously improving the network, this communication technology could be considered as a candidate to deal with V2V necessities as well. The present paper defends the applicability of CN in the V2V field, and presents a novel communication paradigm for vehicles which unifies both V2V and V2I paradigms into one system. A peer to peer network technology has been used over the CN basis to create a group-based communication infrastructure which enables the message propagation among vehicles and between the car and the road side infrastructure. The architecture has been implemented in both hardware and software terms, and multitude of field tests have been carried out, whose main performance results are shown in the paper."

abstract = "The significant increment in the number of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in mass-produced cars suggest the idea of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles driving in roads in a medium-large term. Consequently, a system to allow the communication among this kind of vehicles and manual driven vehicles will have to be used in order to permit the circulation of both of them at the same time. Two communication modes have to be taken into account. First, a vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) to permit the traffic data flow among cars. Second, a vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I) to allow a central station to coordinate the movements of the vehicle in case of a failure in the V2V. In this paper we present an architecture capable of operating either in autonomous vehicles or manual driven vehicles and coordinating their movements based on a V2I communication. Two mass-produced vehicles are used in order to test the behavior of the architecture implementation. Experimental trials to study the response of the system and the information flow have been carried out."

However, Indian traffic stream is weak lane disciplined and heterogenous, containing various vehicle types like truck, motorized three and two wheeler and diesel and petrol driven cars. Also, the reported studies are based on out of date data, collected using traditional and less accurate methods. Hence, this work aims to study the A/D behaviour of various vehicle types using modern instruments like Global Positioning System (GPS) in controlled manner including maximum A/D envelop. It is observed that acceleration rates of vehicles observed in this study, differed from acceleration rates reported in literature. On finding existing acceleration models insufficient to explain the acceleration behaviour of vehicles observed in this study, new models have been proposed and validated using statistical tools. Acceleration behaviour of cars varied with the change in gears, though the pattern remained similar in all gears."

	abstract ={We consider the problem of designing (perhaps massively distributed) collectives of computational processes to maximize a provided "world" utility function. We consider this problem when the behavior of each process in the collective can be cast as striving to maximize its own payoff utility function. For such cases the central design issue is how to initialize/update those payoff utility functions of the individual processes so as to induce behavior of the entire collective having good values of the world utility.  Traditional "team game" approaches to this problem simply assign to each process the world utility as its payoff utility function. In previous work we used the "Collective Intelligence" (COIN) framework to derive a better choice of payoff utility functions, one that results in world utility performance up to orders of magnitude superior to that ensuing from use of the team game utility. 

In this paper we extend these results using a novel mathematical framework. We review the derivation under that new framework of the general class of payoff utility functions that both i) are easy for the individual processes to try to maximize, and ii) have the property that if good values of them are achieved, then we are assured of a high value of world utility. These are the "Aristocrat Utility" and a new variant of the "Wonderful  Utility" that was introduced in the previous COIN work. We demonstrate experimentally that using these new utility functions can result in significantly improved performance over that of previously investigated COIN payoff utilities, over and above those previous   utilities' superiority to the conventional team game utility. These results also illustrate the substantial superiority of these payoff functions to the perhaps the most natural version of the economics technique of "endogenizing externalities".},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

    abstract = { A general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the “politeness factor.” The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane-changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density. }

abstract = "Traffic flow theory has come to a point where conventional, fixed time averaged data are limiting our insight into critical behavior both at the macroscopic and microscopic scales. This paper develops a methodology to measure relationships of density and vehicle spacing on freeways. These relationships are central to most traffic flow theories but have historically been difficult to measure empirically. The work leads to macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships in the congested regime derived entirely from dual loop detector data and then verified against the NGSIM data set. The methodology eliminates the need to seek out stationary conditions and yields clean relationships that do not depend on prior assumptions of the curve shape before fitting the data. Upon review of the clean empirical relationships a key finding of this work is the fact that many of the critical parameters of the macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships depend on vehicle length, e.g., upstream moving waves should travel through long vehicles faster than through short vehicles. Thus, the commonly used assumption of a homogeneous vehicle fleet likely obscures these important phenomena. More broadly, if waves travel faster or slower depending on the length of the vehicles through which the waves pass, then the way traffic is modeled should be updated to explicitly account for inhomogeneous vehicle lengths."

The definition of a threshold speed that is acceptable to users is implied. Travelers expect different things of different roads, and in the case of two-lane highways the desire to pass and the stress or mild frustration of being delayed are not a function only of headway or of the difference between actual and desired travel speed. Therefore, simplistic approaches do not accurately reflect the point of view of the roadway user. The procedure can be adapted to various two-lane highway types. It could be used for Types I and II already in HCM procedure and for other types that may be considered in the future. }

In this research, we capture the interaction between travellers’ route choice and traffic signal control in a coherent framework. For travellers’ route choice, a VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork) is considered, where travellers have access to the real-time traffic information through V2V/V2I (Vehicle to Vehicle/Vehicle to Infrastructure) infrastructures and make route choice decisions at each intersection using hyper-path trees. We test our algorithm and control strategy by simulation in OmNet++ (A network communication simulator) and SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) under several scenarios. The simulation results show that with the proposed dynamic routing, the overall travel cost significantly decreases. It is also shown that the proposed adaptive signal control reduces the average delay effectively, as well as reduces the fluctuation of the average speed within the whole network.}

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a promising approach in various decision-making tasks. Among them, traffic signal control is the one where RL makes a great breakthrough. However, these methods always suffer from the prominent exploration problem and even fail to converge. To resolve this issue, we make an analogy between agents and humans. Agents can learn from demonstrations generated by traditional traffic signal control methods, in the similar way as people master a skill from expert knowledge. Therefore, we propose DemoLight, for the first time, to leverage demonstrations collected from classic methods to accelerate learning. Based on the state-of-the-art deep RL method Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), training with demos are carried out for both the actor and the critic and reinforcement learning is followed for further improvement. Results under real-world datasets show that DemoLight enables a more efficient exploration and outperforms existing baselines with faster convergence and better performance.},

Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented trend in applying reinforcement learning for traffic signal control. However, the primary challenge is to control and coordinate traffic lights in large-scale urban networks. No one has ever tested RL models on a network of more than a thousand traffic lights. In this paper, we tackle the problem of multi-intersection traffic signal control, especially for large-scale networks, based on RL techniques and transportation theories. This problem is quite difficult because there are challenges such as scalability, signal coordination, data feasibility, etc. To address these challenges, we (1) design our RL agents utilizing ‘pressure’ concept to achieve signal coordination in region-level; (2) show that implicit coordination could be achieved by individual control agents with well-crafted reward design thus reducing the dimensionality; and (3) conduct extensive experiments on multiple scenarios, including a real-world scenario with 2510 traffic lights in Manhattan, New York City}, number={04}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Chen, Chacha and Wei, Hua and Xu, Nan and Zheng, Guanjie and Yang, Ming and Xiong, Yuanhao and Xu, Kai and Li, Zhenhui}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={3414-3421} }

abstract = "The aim of this paper is to develop a robust methodology for the dispatching and routing of emergency vehicles (EVs) in a post-disaster environment with the support of data fusion. In this work, we consider an earthquake scenario with a large number of casualties needing medical attention. Given an influx of information (regarding casualties, road, traffic conditions, etc.), data are fused to provide estimates of the entities under consideration. We use this information to dispatch and route EVs to casualty pickup locations, followed by delivery to appropriate hospitals. Key factors here include patient priorities, clustering criteria, and distance. Similarly, factors affecting the dispatching of EVs from patient locations to hospitals include waiting time at hospital emergency rooms, hospital capacity, and distance. Routes must be generated for EVs by accounting for real-world road networks, existing road damage, congestion, and related issues. We develop a dispatching and routing simulation model, and utilize a case study to evaluate the performance of our proposed methodology."

abstract = "We consider a routing problem for ambulances in a disaster response scenario, in which a large number of injured people require medical aid at the same time. The ambulances are used to carry medical personnel and patients. We distinguish two groups of patients: slightly injured people who can be assisted directly in the field, and seriously injured people who have to be brought to hospitals. Since ambulances represent a scarce resource in disaster situations, their efficient usage is of the utmost importance. Two mathematical formulations are proposed to obtain route plans that minimize the latest service completion time among the people waiting for help. Since disaster response calls for high-quality solutions within seconds, we also propose a large neighborhood search metaheuristic. This solution approach can be applied at high frequency to cope with the dynamics and uncertainties in a disaster situation. Our experiments show that the metaheuristic produces high quality solutions for a large number of test instances within very short response time. Hence, it fulfills the criteria for applicability in a disaster situation. Within the experiments, we also analyzed the effect of various structural parameters of a problem, like the number of ambulances, hospitals, and the type of patients, on both running time of the heuristic and quality of the solutions. This information can additionally be used to determine the required fleet size and hospital capacities in a disaster situation."

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the max pressure control is a throughput-optimal policy that can stabilize the store-and-forward traffic network when the demand is within the network capacity. Most of the existing studies on the max pressure control do not consider the loss of capacity associated with phase switching, which will undermine the stability of the network. This work proposes a novel framework that utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize a max pressure controller considering the phase switching loss. We extend the max pressure control by introducing a switching curve and prove that the proposed control method is throughput-optimal in a store-and-forward network. Then the theoretical control policy is extended by using a distributed approximation and position-weighted pressure so that the policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithms can be utilized to optimize the parameters in the policy network including the switching curve and the weight curve. Simulation results show that the proposed control method greatly outperforms the conventional max pressure control. The proposed framework combines the strengths of the data-driven method and the theoretical control model by utilizing reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the max pressure controller, which is also of great significance for real-world implementations because the proposed control policy can be generated in a distributed fashion based on local observations.}

Police play an important role in the evacuation process, as they can handle traffic accidents immediately and help people move smoothly on roads. This paper investigates an evacuation routing problem that involves police resource allocation. We propose a novel k-th-shortest-path-based technique that uses explicit congestion control to optimize evacuation routing and police resource allocation. A nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is presented to formulate the problem. The model’s objective is to minimize the overall evacuation clearance time. Two algorithms are given to solve the problem. The first one linearizes the original model and solves the linearized problem with CPLEX. The second one is a heuristic algorithm that uses a police resource utilization efficiency index to directly solve the original model. This police resource utilization efficiency index significantly aids in the evaluation of road links from an evacuation throughput perspective. The proposed algorithms are tested with a number of examples based on real data from cities of different sizes. The computational results show that the police resource utilization efficiency index is very helpful in finding near-optimal solutions. Additionally, comparing the performance of the heuristic algorithm and the linearization method by using randomly generated examples indicates that the efficiency of the heuristic algorithm is superior.},

For numerous large-scale engineering and science problems, domain decomposition (DD) has generally been accepted by research communities as among the most attractive methods to obtain solutions efficiently. As a prerequisite for the DD solution process, a large domain must be partitioned into several smaller subdomains, with the key to success (of any DD partitioning algorithm) being the number of system boundary nodes. The lower this number, the more efficiently the subdomains can be processed. Although various transportation researchers have hinted at the use of DD, for example, in intelligent transportation systems-enabled decentralized traffic management, it is assumed that the partition is given. This article presents a simple, efficient, and effective algorithm to decompose a transportation network into a predefined number of interconnected subdomains such that the number of system boundary nodes is small (first priority) and the number of nodes in each subdomain is of similar size (second priority). To assess the effectiveness (in terms of minimizing the number of system boundary nodes) of the proposed Shortest Distance Decomposition Algorithm, it is compared with METIS version 5.1.0, currently among the most widely used graph partitioning algorithms worldwide. Using large-scale, real-world transportation test networks, it was found that the Shortest Distance Decomposition Algorithm is better than METIS in 21 of the 27 examples tested; on average, it provided (approximately) 42.0\% of the system boundary nodes (as compared to METIS results) in our large-scale examples.}

abstract = {Max-pressure traffic signal control has many desirable properties. It is analytically proven to maximize network throughput if demand could be served by any signal control. Despite its network-level stability properties, the control itself is decentralized and therefore easily computed by individual intersection controllers. Discussions with city engineers have suggested that a major barrier to implementation in practice is the non-cyclical phase actuation of max-pressure control, which can actuate any phase, in arbitrary order, to serve the queue(s) with highest pressure. This arbitrary phase selection may be confusing to travelers expecting a signal cycle, and is therefore unacceptable to some city traffic engineers. This paper revises the original max-pressure control to include a signal cycle constraint. The max-pressure control must actuate an exogenous set of phases in order, with each phase actuated at least one time step per cycle. Each cycle has a maximum length, but the length can be reduced if desired. Within those constraints, we define a modified max-pressure control and prove its maximum stability property. The revised max-pressure control takes the form of a model predictive control with a one cycle lookahead, but we prove that the optimal solution can be easily found by enumerating over phases. The policy is still decentralized. Numerical results show that as expected, the cyclical max-pressure control performs slightly worse than the original max-pressure control due to the additional constraints, but with the advantage of greater palatability for implementation in practice.}

abstract = {Decentralized intersection control techniques have received recent attention in the literature as means to overcome scalability issues associated with network-wide intersection control. Chief among these techniques are backpressure (BP) control algorithms, which were originally developed of for large wireless networks. In addition to being light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance at the network level, specifically in terms of network-wide stability. The dynamics in backpressure control are represented using networks of point queues and this also applies to all of the applications to traffic control. As such, BP in traffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along the intersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a position weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic applying continuum modeling principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along network roads and spill-back dynamics. PWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP. To prove stability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial distribution of vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network is formally defined in the context of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it is proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within the capacity region, that PWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against a real-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection. Comparisons are also performed against other BP approaches in addition to optimized fixed timing control at the network level. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of PWBP over the other control policies in terms of capacity region, network-wide delay, congestion propagation speed, recoverability from heavy congestion (outside of the capacity region), and response to incidents.}

abstract = {This paper develops a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) scheme for multi-intersection adaptive traffic signal control (TSC), called “CVLight”, that leverages data collected from connected vehicles (CVs). The state and reward design facilitates coordination among agents and considers travel delays collected by CVs. A novel algorithm, Asymmetric Advantage Actor-critic (Asym-A2C), is proposed where both CV and non-CV information is used to train the critic network, while only CV information is used to execute optimal signal timing. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of CVLight over state-of-the-art algorithms under a 2-by-2 synthetic road network with various traffic demand patterns and penetration rates. The learned policy is then visualized to further demonstrate the advantage of Asym-A2C. A pre-train technique is applied to improve the scalability of CVLight, which significantly shortens the training time and shows the advantage in performance under a 5-by-5 road network. A case study is performed on a 2-by-2 road network located in State College, Pennsylvania, USA, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under real-world scenarios. Compared to other baseline models, the trained CVLight agent can efficiently control multiple intersections solely based on CV data and achieve the best performance, especially under low CV penetration rates.}

    abstract = { Hard shoulder running (HSR), used in many large cities for reducing peak hour recurring congestion, has been proved effective. This paper looks at another perspective of using hard shoulders and proposes dynamic hard shoulder running (D-HSR) for traffic incident management. The purpose of this paper is to show the benefits and make recommendations to state departments of transportation and local agencies on how to use hard shoulders dynamically to reduce the effects of nonrecurring traffic incidents. An approach based on microscopic simulation with factorial experimental design is adopted in this study, and interesting results are obtained from the discussion and statistical analyses of simulation results: (a) D-HSR strategies are more suitable for property damage only incidents in which traffic operations centers have more flexibility in managing traffic; (b) only the part of the shoulder that is 0.5 mi upstream and downstream of the incident location needs to be opened to achieve maximum benefits for relieving a bottleneck; (c) the opened shoulder can be closed after the incident is cleared, and opening the shoulder for a longer time will not improve traffic conditions; and (d) the effectiveness of D-HSR is significant across different roadway geometry, traffic, and incident scenarios. Equations to estimate potential benefits are also available in this paper. These results are favorable particularly in practice because shoulders need to serve as refuge areas for incident vehicles and be used by emergency vehicles. It is recommended that departments of transportation and local agencies consider D-HSR for relieving congestion during incidents. }

abstract = {Improvement of traffic signal control (TSC) efficiency has been found to lead to improved urban transportation and enhanced quality of life. Recently, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in various areas of TSC has gained significant traction; thus, we conducted a systematic literature review as a systematic, comprehensive, and reproducible review to dissect all the existing research that applied RL in the network-level TSC domain, called as RL in NTSC or RL-NTSC for brevity. The review only targeted the network-level articles that tested the proposed methods in networks with two or more intersections. This review covers 160 peer-reviewed articles from 30 countries published from 1994 to March 2020. The goal of this study is to provide the research community with statistical and conceptual knowledge, summarize existence evidence, characterize RL applications in NTSC domains, explore all applied methods and major first events in the defined scope, and identify areas for further research based on the explored research problems in current research. We analyzed the extracted data from the included articles in the following seven categories: (i) publication and authors’ data, (ii) method identification and analysis, (iii) environment attributes and traffic simulation, (iv) application domains of RL-NTSC, (v) major first events of RL-NTSC and authors’ key statements, (vi) code availability, and (vii) evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive view of the past 26 years of research on applying RL to NTSC. It also reveals the role of advancing deep learning methods in the revival of the research area, the rise of using non-commercial microscopic traffic simulators, a lack of interaction between traffic and transportation engineering practitioners and researchers, and a lack of proposal and creation of testbeds which can likely bring different communities together around common goals.}

abstract = {This research studies how populations depend on road networks for access to health care during crises or natural disasters. So far, most researchers rather studied the accessibility of the whole network or the cost of network disruptions in general, rather than as a function of the accessibility of specific priority destinations like hospitals. Even short delays in accessing healthcare can have significant adverse consequences. We carry out a comprehensive stress test of the entire Austrian road network from this perspective. We simplify the whole network into one consisting of what we call accessibility corridors, deleting single corridors to evaluate the change in accessibility of populations to healthcare. The data created by our stress test was used to generate an importance ranking of the corridors. The findings suggest that certain road segments and corridors are orders of magnitude more important in terms of access to hospitals than the typical one. Our method also highlights vulnerable municipalities and hospitals who may experience demand surges as populations are cut off from their usual nearest hospitals. Even though the skewed importance of some corridors highlights vulnerabilities, they provide policymakers with a clear agenda.}
