abstract={In the near future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) may cohabit with human drivers in mixed traffic. This cohabitation raises serious challenges, both in terms of traffic flow and individual mobility, as well as from the road safety point of view. Mixed traffic may fail to fulfill expected security requirements due to the heterogeneity and unpredictability of human drivers, and autonomous cars could then monopolize the traffic. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, researchers have attempted to design autonomous vehicles for both scenarios, and this paper investigates their recent advances. We focus on articles tackling decision-making problems and identify four paradigms. While some authors address mixed traffic problems with or without social-desirable AVs, others tackle the case of fully-autonomous traffic. While the latter case is essentially a communication problem, most authors addressing the mixed traffic admit some limitations. The current human driver models found in the literature are too simplistic since they do not cover the heterogeneity of the drivers' behaviors. As a result, they fail to generalize over the wide range of possible behaviors. For each paper investigated, we analyze how the authors formulated the MARL problem in terms of observation, action, and rewards to match the paradigm they apply.},

    abstract = { Emergency response vehicles (ERVs) need to move fast, which can lead to potential accidents. A system is proposed to utilize connected vehicle technology for facilitating the movement of multiple ERVs in a two-way roadway. A biobjective model was developed to minimize the ERVs’ travel/response times while maximizing safety. The proposed system can help non-ERVs stop in assigned locations and wait for the ERVs to pass. According to mission priority, different types of ERVs (ambulance, fire truck, and police car) can use a travel lane from the opposite direction (contraflow) to move faster. A hybrid nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II-particle swarm optimization (NSGAII-PSO) approach was used to solve the model faster than CPLEX. To evaluate the system’s performance, different experiments, including various road types, numbers and types of ERVs, direction priorities, and congestion levels, have been conducted. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve the travel time of ERVs that have the priority to use the contraflow lane in cases where the other side of the roadway is less congested and has a shoulder (when opposing ERVs use a two-way roadway simultaneously). The proposed system can eliminate weaving and passing among non-ERVs in all cases compared to two current strategies (going to the right edge and vacating the ERV lane without receiving instructions). }

abstract = {This paper proposes a cooperative strategy of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) longitudinal control for a mixed connected and automated traffic environment based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which enhances the string stability of mixed traffic, car following efficiency, and energy efficiency. Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV’s characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model has a great generalization capability of dampening oscillations, fulfilling the car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration rates and various leading HDVs behaviors.}

abstract = {Emergency vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in providing timely help for the general public in saving lives and avoiding property loss. However, very few efforts have been made for EV prioritization on normal road segments, such as the road section between intersections or highways between ramps. In this paper, we propose an EV lane pre-clearing strategy to prioritize EVs on such roads through cooperative driving with surrounding connected vehicles (CVs). The cooperative driving problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem aiming at (i) guaranteeing the desired speed of EVs, and (ii) minimizing the disturbances on CVs. To tackle this NP-hard MINP problem, we formulate the model in a bi-level optimization manner to address these two objectives, respectively. In the lower-level problem, CVs in front of the emergency vehicle will be divided into several blocks. For each block, we developed an EV sorting algorithm to design optimal merging trajectories for CVs. With resultant sorting trajectories, a constrained optimization problem is solved in the upper-level to determine the initiation time/distance to conduct the sorting trajectories. Case studies show that with the proposed algorithm, emergency vehicles are able to drive at a desired speed while minimizing disturbances on normal traffic flows. We further reveal a linear relationship between the optimal solution and road density, which could help to improve EV routing decision makings when high-resolution data is not available.}
