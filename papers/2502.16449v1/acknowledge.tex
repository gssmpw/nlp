I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisors, Professor Joseph Y.J. Chow and Professor Li Jin, for their patience, guidance, and inspiration, without which this dissertation would not have been possible. Their guidance and encouragement have shaped not only this dissertation but also my growth as a researcher and as an individual.



To my colleagues at C2SMARTER—Yueshuai He, Saeid Rasulkhani, Gyugeun Yoon, Ted Pantelidis, Qi Liu, Srushti Rath, Xi Xiong, Yu Tang, Qian Xie, and others—you have made this journey both meaningful and memorable.

Special thanks to my co-author and my mentor at Siemens, Yaofeng Desmond Zhong, for an inspiring summer internship that culminated in the honor of presenting our work at NeurIPS and AAAI. 

I would also like to acknowledge the financial support by Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship, C2SMARTER, NSFC Project 62103260, SJTU UM Joint Institute, and J.Wu\&J.Sun Endowment Fund.

My parents are my role models and my best friends. Though I have been frustrated and struggling, they never doubt what I could achieve. Every storm runs out of rain and I am sincerely proud to be your son.

I still remember the reviews received for my very first manuscript: "\textit{this work makes very trivial contributions to academics or the society.}" I hope this dissertation can be of a little help when it comes to saving patients and fighting fires or crimes in the future.
