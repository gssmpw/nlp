\caption{TM feedback procedure, independently performed for each clause. For binary classification, $y$=1 or 0 suggests the sample belongs to the class or not, respectively; for multiclass classification and a TM for a certain class, $y$=1 or 0 suggests the sample belongs to the class or other classes, respectively.}
