The RSE accounts for any possible up-to-δ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different --- in some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation}, pages = {735}, numpages = {1}, keywords = {stackelberg game, robust equilibrium}, location = {London, United Kingdom}, series = {EC '23} }
