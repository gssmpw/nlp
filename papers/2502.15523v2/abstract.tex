	Principal-agent problems model scenarios where a principal incentivizes an agent to take costly, unobservable actions through the provision of payments.
	%
	Such problems are ubiquitous in several real-world applications, ranging from blockchain to the delegation of machine learning tasks.
	%
	In this paper, we initiate the study of hidden-action principal-agent problems under \emph{approximate best responses}, in which the agent may select \emph{any} action that is not too much suboptimal given the principal's payment scheme (a.k.a.~\emph{contract}).
	%
	Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal contract under approximate best responses.
	%
	This positive result is perhaps surprising, since, in Stackelberg games, computing an optimal commitment under approximate best responses is computationally intractable.
	%
	We also investigate the learnability of contracts under approximate best responses, by providing a no-regret learning algorithm for a natural application scenario where the principal has \emph{no} prior knowledge about the environment.
