The principal would like to achieve her desired outcomes by hiring agents to work for her. The agent wishes to make money by working for the principal. They develop agreements in the form of a contract, which specifies how much the principal would pay under the different possible outcomes of the agent's work.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation}, pages = {1188}, numpages = {1}, location = {London, United Kingdom}, series = {EC '23} }

The RSE accounts for any possible up-to-δ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different --- in some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation}, pages = {735}, numpages = {1}, keywords = {stackelberg game, robust equilibrium}, location = {London, United Kingdom}, series = {EC '23} }
