\section*{Limitation}
This paper uninstalls knowledge by removing entire FFN layers after identifying those with greater neuron inhibition. While \method{} demonstrates promising results, the pruning process may possibly affect some non-knowledge-related neurons. Regarding evaluation, we have employed ConR and MemR metrics, consistent with established practices in the field. Although these rule-based metrics provide valuable insights, we acknowledge that more sophisticated evaluation methodologies could offer more comprehensive evaluations. 

\section*{Ethics Statement}
Our data construction process involves prompting LLMs to elicit their parametric knowledge for studying knowledge conflicts. This process may result in some hallucinated content. We commit to the careful distribution of the data generated through our research, ensuring it is strictly used for research purposes. Our goal is to encourage responsible use of LLMs while advancing understanding of knowledge conflicts. Additionally, no personally identifiable information or offensive content is included in our dataset. We adhere to ethical guidelines for responsible AI research and data sharing.

We also employed human evaluation to assess the reliability of GPT-4o-mini in identifying knowledge conflicts. Evaluation data was carefully distributed to human evaluators solely for research purposes, ensuring it adheres to ethical standards and contains no content that violates these standards.
