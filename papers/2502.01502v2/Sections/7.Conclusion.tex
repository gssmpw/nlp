\section{Conclusions}\label{s:Conclusion}
In this paper, we demonstrate that frequent ReRAM cell updates needed for DNN inference significantly shorten the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators due to the limited endurance cycles of ReRAM cells. To address this challenge, we introduce \textit{Hamun}, an approximate computation method designed to extend the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators through multiple optimizations. Hamun features a novel fault-handling scheme that identifies worn-out cells and retire them to prevent their impact on DNN accuracy. Additionally, Hamun employs wear-leveling and batch execution techniques to further increase longevity. To reduce the overhead of retiring cells, Hamun also incorporates an approximation method, thereby extending the acceleratorâ€™s lifespan with minimal degradation in DNN accuracy. Across a set of popular DNNs, Hamun achieves a $13.2\times$ lifespan improvement over the baseline on average, highlighting its potential in making ReRAM-based accelerators more viable for long-term use.
