\subsection{Use Cases Specialization}\label{sec:usecase}

In this section, we define five specialized use cases of \chatiot. 
Each use case is defined by \textit{four} fundamental properties: \textit{User Role}, \textit{Background}, \textit{Actions}, and \textit{Example Query}, within the IoT security domain.
The detailed specifications are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:usecasedef}.
The roles include \textit{Consumer}, \textit{Security Analyst}, \textit{Technical Officer}, \textit{Developer}, and \textit{Trainer}. 
Recall that we have discussed background in \S~\ref{sec:resgen}, we present the detailed actions and example query in the following context.


Table~\ref{tab:usecase} highlights the key actions associated with each user role, such as assessing the security of IoT devices, deploying security patches, or developing training programs on IoT security.
Additionally, it provides example queries for each role, demonstrating how \chatiot\ can be utilized to address the unique needs of various users. 
This structured approach ensures that \chatiot\ caters to a diverse range of users, offering tailored assistance and enhancing IoT security management across different scenarios.
Note that while we provide five use cases, they are not rigid or fixed. 
The use cases can be easily extended by defining new user roles, specifying the background (including knowledge, goals, and requirements), and outlining actions. Example queries can also be added to further clarify the context and functionality of each user role.
