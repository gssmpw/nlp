This work introduces \modelname, a Unified Commented Retrieval Network that unifies discriminative retrieval and generative commenting. 
We combined the strengths of composed multimodal retrieval methods with generative language capabilities, resulting in a system that surpasses traditional RAG techniques.
%
Our approach preserves the original capabilities of the base LMM while extending its functionality to perform both retrieval and text generation tasks within a single framework.
We introduced the \tasknameshort task and a corresponding dataset to evaluate these new abilities of LMMs.
%
%
Future work could focus on further improving the integration of multimodal information, exploring additional tasks, and investigating the scalability of our approach. %
