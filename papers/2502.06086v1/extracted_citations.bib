    abstract = "Inferences from adjective-noun combinations like {\textquotedblleft}Is artificial intelligence still intelligence?{\textquotedblright} provide a good test bed for LLMs' understanding of meaning and compositional generalization capability, since there are many combinations which are novel to both humans and LLMs but nevertheless elicit convergent human judgments. We study a range of LLMs and find that the largest models we tested are able to draw human-like inferences when the inference is determined by context and can generalize to unseen adjective-noun combinations. We also propose three methods to evaluate LLMs on these inferences out of context, where there is a distribution of human-like answers rather than a single correct answer. We find that LLMs show a human-like distribution on at most 75{\%} of our dataset, which is promising but still leaves room for improvement."
