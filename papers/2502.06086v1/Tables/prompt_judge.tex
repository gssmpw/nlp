Concepts are characterized by properties. For example, the concept "a chicken in front of a fox" strongly exhibits the property "in danger." When given a concept and a property, your task is to evaluate how much the concept has the property on a scale from 1 to 10. You should follow the format: \{\{"relevance": your\_relevance\_score\}\}\\
\\
Use the following scoring criteria to assign a relevance score:\\
- \{\{"relevance": 1\}\}: The concept does not have the property at all.\\
- \{\{"relevance": 2-3\}\}: The concept rarely has the property.\\
- \{\{"relevance": 4-6\}\}: The concept sometimes has the property.\\
- \{\{"relevance": 7-8\}\}: The concept usually has the property, but not always.\\
- \{\{"relevance": 9\}\}: The concept almost always has the property.\\
- \{\{"relevance": 10\}\}: The concept always has the property.\\
