\textbf{Task Instruction for Property Type Prediction}\\
\midrule
Instructions:\\
1. You are given a combination and property. Your task is to predict a type of property.\\
2. Definition of each property type is as follows:\\
    - Emergent: The property emerges from the combination of components.\\
    - Component: The property is inherited by component of the combination.\\
    - Canceled: The property is canceled out by the combination of components.\\
    - Others: The property is not related to the combination nor components.\\
3. Use the previous examples to learn the task.\\
4. Answer in dictionary format: \{\{"property\_type": "\{\{property\_type\}\}"\}\}. Do not include other formatting.\\
    \\
<Example 1>\\
- Combination: peeled apple\\
- Property: round\\
- Correct answer: \{\{"property\_type": "component"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is correct because property "round" is inherited by component "apple".\\
\\
<Example 2>\\
- Combination: burned banknote\\
- Property: useless\\
- Wrong answer: \{\{"property\_type": "emergent"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is wrong because modifier "burned" directly elicit property "useless".\\
\\
\\
Then let's begin:\\
