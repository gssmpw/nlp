\textbf{Task Instruction for Chain-of-Thought Method in Noun Phrase Completion}\\
\midrule
Instructions:\\
1. You are given a head noun and emergent property. Your task is to generate a conceptual combination by adding one modifier.\\
2. You can use function word without any constraint.\\
3. Modifier should not have the given emergent property on its own, but the combination exhibits the emergent property.\\
4. Come up with your reasoning process before giving your final answer.\\
5. Use the previous examples to learn the task.\\
6. Answer in dictionary format: \{\{"combination": "\{\{generated\_combination\}\}", "modifier": "\{\{generated\_modifier\}\}"\}\}. Do not include other formatting.\\
    \\
<Example 1>\\
- Head noun: apple\\
- Emergent property: unappetizing\\
- Correct answer: Let's think step-by-step. A typical apple is fresh and appetizing, but certain modifications can make it unappetizing. Factors like discoloration, decay, or unusual texture can contribute to this perception. A brown apple, for instance, appears spoiled or oxidized, making it less appealing to eat. So the answer is \{\{"combination": "brown apple", "modifier": "brown"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is correct because each component "brown" and "apple" do not possess "unappetizing" but "brown apple" does.\\
\\
<Example 2>\\
- Head noun: banknote\\
- Emergent property: useless\\
- Wrong answer: Let's think step-by-step. A typical banknote has value and can be used for transactions, but certain modifications can make it useless. Burning a banknote destroys its structure, making it unrecognizable and invalid as currency. So the answer is \{\{"combination": "burned banknote", "modifier": "burned"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is wrong because modifier "burned" directly elicit property "useless". Avoid modifier which has given property in itself.\\
\\
\\
Then let's begin:\\
