\textbf{Task Instruction for Base Method in Property Induction (Emergent)}\\
\midrule
Instructions:\\
1. You are given a combination of concepts. Your task is to generate emergent property of a combination.\\
2. Find a property that does not belong to any of the individual component in the combination but emerges when the words are combined.\\
3. Use the previous examples to learn how to do this.\\
4. Answer in dictionary format: \{\{"property": "\{\{generated\_property\}\}"\}\}. Do not include other formatting.\\
    \\
<Example 1>\\
- Combination: Brown apple\\
- Correct answer: \{\{"property": "unappetizing"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is correct because property "unappetizing" does not belong to either "brown" and "apple", but belong to brown apple\\
\\
<Example 2>\\
- Combination: burned banknote\\
- Wrong answer: \{\{"property": "useless"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is wrong because "burned" something can directly belong to property "useless". Ensure that the emergent property you generate does not directly describe any of the individual words but is a characteristic of the combination as a whole.\\
\\
Then let's begin:\\
