\caption{Correlation between LLM-as-a-judge and human ratings in relevance score, assessing how strong a concept \( \mathcal{X} \) possesses a property \( \mathcal{P} \). To avoid overlapping points, random jitters sampled from $\mathcal{N}(0, 0.05^2)$ are added to LLM-as-a-judge and human ratings after fitting the regression.}
