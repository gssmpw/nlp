\textbf{Task Instruction for Spread Activation Method in Noun Phrase Completion (Emergent)}\\
\midrule
Instructions:\\
1. You are given a combination of concepts and a set of relevant concepts to solve a task. Your task is to generate emergent property of a combination.\\
2. Find a property that does not belong to any of the individual component in the combination but emerges when the words are combined.\\
3. Come up with your reasoning process before giving your final answer.\\
4. Final answer should follow dictionary format: \{\{"property": "\{\{generated\_property\}\}"\}\}. Do not include other formatting.\\
    \\
<Example 1>\\
- Combination: Brown apple\\
- Relevant concepts: ['fruit', 'apple', 'core', 'cider']\\
- Correct answer: The goal is to find an emergent property of "brown apple" that does not exist in "brown" or "apple" individually. "Fruit" and "apple" describe general attributes, so they are excluded. "Core" and "Cider" are unrelated to "brown apple." "Withered" relates to a decayed state, which applies to "brown apple" but not to "brown" or "apple" alone. To interpret "withered" naturally, we select "unappetizing" as the emergent property. So the answer is \{\{"property": "unappetizing"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is correct because property "unappetizing" does not belong to either "brown" and "apple", but belong to brown apple\\
\\
<Example 2>\\
- Combination: burned banknote\\
- Relevant concepts: ['paper', 'ash', 'money', 'value']\\
- Wrong answer: The goal is to find an emergent property of a “burned banknote” that does not exist in either “burned” or “banknote” individually. The attributes “paper” and “money” describe general properties of a banknote, so they are excluded.Likewise, “ash” describes a general property of something that is burned, so it is also excluded. While a banknote possesses “value,” this characteristic disappears once the banknote is burned. Consequently, to convey the idea of “valueless” naturally, we choose “useless” as the emergent property. So the answer is is: \{\{"property": "useless"\}\}\\
\\
Above answer is wrong because "burned" something can directly belong to property "useless". Ensure that the emergent property you generate does not directly describe any of the individual words but is a characteristic of the combination as a whole.\\
