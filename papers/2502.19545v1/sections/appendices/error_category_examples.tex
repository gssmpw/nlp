\section{Error Category Examples}
\label{app:error_category_examples}

The following examples come from the regular and challenge dev sets and were included in the tutorial for human evaluation in Appendix \ref{app:human_eval}. The error categories are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hallucination}: The response contains information not present in the manual.
    \item \textbf{Non-Answer}: The response does not answer the question.
    \item \textbf{Partial Answer}: The response does not fully answer the question, or omits important information.
    \item \textbf{IDK - Bad}: The manual section has the information required to answer the question, but the response is mistakenly ``I don’t know''.
    \item \textbf{Disfluent}: The response contains grammatical or fluency problems.
    \item \textbf{Other}: The response contains some other type of error.
    \item \textbf{IDK - Good}: The manual section does not contain the information required to answer the question and the response is appropriately ``I don’t know''.
    \item \textbf{Good}: There are no errors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example Set 2}

\textbf{Question}: how many inches does it stick out off the wall?

\vspace{.25cm}

\noindent\textbf{Retrieved Passage}:

\noindent English > Precautions and Notes > Read After Installing the TV > Installing an Anti-theft Lock

\noindent An anti-theft lock is a physical device that can be used to protect the TV against theft. Look for the lock slot on the back of the TV. The slot has a [LOCK] icon next to it. To use the lock, wrap the lock cable around an object that is too heavy to carry and then thread it through the TV's lock slot. The lock is sold separately. The method of using an anti-theft lock may differ for each TV model. Refer to the lock's user manual for more information.

\noindent [NOTE] This function may not be supported depending on the model or geographical area.


\vspace{.25cm}

\noindent \textbf{Responses:}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Response:} The provided document does not mention the inches of protrusion off the wall. It only discusses the anti-theft lock installation. \\
          \textbf{Evaluation:}  IDK – Good \\
          \textbf{Explanation:} The answer cannot be found in the retrieved passage, so the response is appropriate.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Response:} Yes, the TV has an antenna output, and you can connect an antenna cable to it. Additionally, the TV has a VESA hole pattern for wall mounting. \\
          \textbf{Evaluation:} Hallucination \\
          \textbf{Explanation:} While the answer to the antenna question is correct, the response makes up information about the VESA hole pattern.

    \item \textbf{Response:} Yes, this TV has an antenna output. \\
          \textbf{Evaluation:} Partial answer \\
          \textbf{Explanation:} The answer only contains a response to the first part of the question.

    \item \textbf{Response:} Yes, this TV has an antenna output, but the user manual passage doesn’t mention the VESA hole pattern for wall mounting, so I cannot answer that question. \\
          \textbf{Evaluation:} IDK – good \\
          \textbf{Explanation:} Even though the answer to the first question is correct, it still contains an “IDK” response to the second question

\noindent \textbf{Responses:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Response:} No, this document does not mention HDR 10 or any other HDR format. \\
          \textbf{Evaluation:}  Other \\
          \textbf{Explanation}: This response has an “other” error because it correctly says “IDK” but it starts the response with “No, …” which makes it seem like the answer to the user’s question is no, which is misleading.
