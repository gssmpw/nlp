\section{FactScore}
\label{app:factscore}


\subsection{Sentence Splitting}
The FactScore methodology consists of breaking generated responses first into sentences, and then takes each of those sentences and generates atomic facts from them. These atomic facts are then individually verified as True or False.

As mentioned, we found that FactScore often unfairly penalized responses that contained structured formatting (e.g., lists, topic headers) which are most common in the outputs of GPT-4o and SynthGPT. This seems to occur due to the sentence splitting not handling such formatting well. For example, this generated response from GPT:

\begin{quote}
    To get Samsung Remote Support for your TV, follow these steps:

    1. Call the Samsung Contact Center and ask for remote support.
    
    2. On your TV, go to the menu and select [HOME] > Settings > Support.
    
    3. In the Support section, select Remote Management, then read and agree to the service agreements.
    
    4.. When the PIN screen appears, provide the PIN number to the agent.
    
    5. The agent will then access your TV to provide remote support.

\end{quote}

When we calculate FactScore with the original preprocessing step (using sentence splitting), we get these atomic facts with their annotations:

%%%% ENDED UP SPLITTING THIS TABLE INTO TWO SO IT WOULD FIT WELL 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cp{5.5cm}c}
1 & Samsung Remote Support is available for your TV. & True \\ 
2 & There are specific steps to follow to access Samsung Remote Support. & True \\ 
3 & \textbf{The steps for accessing support are not provided in the sentence.} & False \\ 
4 & You should call the Samsung Contact Center. & True \\ 
5 & \textbf{The number for the contact center is 1.} & False \\ 
6 & You should ask for remote support. & True \\ 
7 & You should go to the menu on your TV. & True \\ 
8 & Select [HOME]. & False \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cp{5.5cm}c}
9 & Choose Settings. & False \\ 
10 & Select Support. & False \\ 
11 & There is a Support section. & True \\ 
12 & Users should select Remote Management in the Support section. & True \\ 
13 & Users need to read the service agreements. & True \\ 
14 & Users are required to agree to the service agreements. & True \\ 
15 & A PIN screen appears. & True \\ 
16 & The user should provide the PIN number to the agent. & True \\ 
17 & \textbf{The PIN number is 5.} & False \\ 
18 & The agent will access your TV. & True \\ 
19 & The purpose of accessing the TV is to provide remote support. & False \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


In this example you can see that the deconstruction of the list makes the numbers confusing to the model (facts 5 and 17) and that the model is confused by not having access to the remainder of the response in fact 3.

In contrast, without the sentence splitting, the following facts are generated from this response:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cp{5.5cm}c}

1 & To get Samsung Remote Support for your TV, you need to call the Samsung Contact Center. & True \\ 
2 & You should ask for remote support when you call. & True \\ 
3 & On your TV, you need to go to the menu. & True \\ 
4 & You should select [HOME] > Settings > Support. & True \\ 
5 & In the Support section, you need to select Remote Management. & True \\ 
6 & You must read and agree to the service agreements. & True \\ 
7 & When the PIN screen appears, you need to provide the PIN number to the agent. & True \\ 
8 & The agent will access your TV to provide remote support. & True \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


As you can see, these facts are much more sensible and better reflect the content of the response.



\subsection{\textit{I Don't Know} Responses}

As mentioned, FactScore turns out to be unhelpful in assessing ``I don't know'' responses. For example, the generated response is:

\begin{quote}
    Unfortunately, the provided section does not mention turning on the TV using voice. It only provides information on turning the TV on using the [POWER] button.
\end{quote}

And the decomposed atomic facts are:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cp{5.5cm}c}
1 & The provided section does not mention turning on the TV using voice. & False \\
2 & It provides information on turning the TV on using the [POWER] button. & True \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The resulting FactScore for this response is .5 (quite low) despite the response being appropriate. Because of this undesired penalty, we do not use FactScore to evaluate the challenge set, as it consists of mostly \textit{I don't know} responses.
