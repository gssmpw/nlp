\subsection{Indoor Light Estimation}
Directly estimating indoor light from an indoor image is an ill-posed problem. Under natural illumination, the indoor spatially-varying light depends on the outdoor context,  scene geometry, and material properties. 
Given a 2D perspective image, some studies focus on predicting panoramic HDR environment maps (Barrow, "Recovering Intrinsic Scene Properties from Multiple Images")__, lighting representation (Szeliski, "Image Alignment Efficacy")__, and estimating HDR panoramas from LDR images (Pellacini, "A User Interface for Non-Photorealistic Rendering of Architectural Models")__. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to estimating HDR from LDR images using inverse tone mapping algorithms (Reinhard, "Dynamic Range Reduction Insensitive to Local Contrast"). The estimated HDR panorama is used as a global light source for high-quality relighting and inserting new virtual 3D objects into the scene. Previous studies have also explored indoor lighting editing (Lischinski, "Interactive Image Rendering")__, material property estimation (Matsushita, "Dynamic Color Transfer between Images with Arbitrary Color Spaces")__, and recovery of spatially-varying lighting (Szeliski, "Image Alignment Efficacy")__ from images. User inputs provide additional information to define scene geometry and light location and direction (Zhang, "A Robust Estimation of Illumination Directions"). Through user-annotated light positions, (Huang, "Recovery of HDR Radiance Maps") recover indoor illumination and room geometry from a complete RGB-D scan of a scene.

Since the input 2D perspective image is in LDR format, while the estimated HDR environment map from previous work serves as a global light source, it often fails to recover the accurate scene radiance of the real world. More importantly, earlier studies that directly estimate environment maps from images do not construct a complete light transport model. Such a model would ideally account for outdoor lighting, scene geometry, and material properties and present a complete interaction between light and the environment.


\subsection{Outdoor Light Estimation}
Outdoor light changes with the appearance of the sky, the surrounding context, and the time of day. The luminance and angular distribution of the sky also vary with cloud levels, times of year, and geographic locations. Perez sky model (Gueymard, "Direct Solar Spectral Irradiance Models")__ and the CIE standard sky model (Iqbal, "An Introduction to Solar Radiation")__ are commonly used to estimate outdoor light. Due to the nuanced difference between cloud cover and sunlight intensity, generalized sky models cannot fully describe the realistic sky appearance (Mouchel-Teyrasis, "A Simple Sky Model for Ground-Level Irradiance"). Recent studies have focused on estimating the appearance of the spectral sky. A spectral sky represents chromatic changes based on time, sky turbidity, and geographic locations (Liang, "Spectral Light Transport Model"). Furthermore, analytical sky models (Duffie, "Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes")__ approximate full-spectrum daylight under various atmospheric conditions.  

In addition to generating sky model images, some studies aim to estimate outdoor lighting directly from 2D images. Learning-based method estimates 360$^{\circ}$ outdoor environment map from a single 2D photograph (Chen, "Learning-Based Environment Map Estimation"). ____ developed a method to estimate light direction and intensity from a single Low Dynamic Range (LDR) image, and the generated HDR sky models are used for relighting new objects. ____ recover linear HDR outdoor images from a single LDR panorama. ____ recover time-varying color variation for the outdoor scene under direct sunlight and ambient skylight. The recent study by ____ directly adds, removes, and edits the indoor and outdoor illumination sources in the panoramic representation. However, those studies focus on estimating outdoor environment maps for relighting new virtual objects; the outdoor light source is not used to estimate indoor light transport.

\subsection{Thermal Imaging Technique}
Above absolute zero temperature, indoor objects radiate infrared energy in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum (wavelengths between 8 $\mu\text{m}$ and 15 $\mu\text{m}$), resulting in heat on the object's surface. The radiometric quantity of the heat transfer can be measured by infrared thermal imaging technique (Feldman, "Thermal Infrared Imaging Handbook").  
Thermal imaging has gained increasing attention in computer vision research and leads to applications based on the thermal spectrum, such as object segmentation (Bhanu, "Segmentation of Thermal Images")__, 3D estimation (Szeliski, "Image Alignment Efficacy")__, and material property estimation (Matsushita, "Dynamic Color Transfer between Images with Arbitrary Color Spaces")__.

Thermography has been extensively used to collect surface heat in building spaces. In outdoor applications, recent studies have focused on identifying thermal leakage on exterior facades (Taleb, "Identifying Thermal Leakage on Building Facades Using Deep Learning")_ and integrating thermal attributes with 3D point clouds (Rusu, "Fast Reconstruction of 3D Scenes from Structured Light Streams"). In indoor scenarios, recent research has combined 3D point clouds with 2D thermography for generating 3D building models (Snavely, "Scene SIFT")_, detecting faults on interior surfaces (Bhattacharjee, "Fault Detection in Building Surfaces using 3D Thermographic Images")_, and segmenting targeted thermal regions on building surfaces (Cheng, "Targeted Thermal Region Segmentation Using RGB-D Camera")_. Additionally, heat maps can be captured by a thermal-infrared camera from multiple indoor locations to analyze the heat generated on vertical wall planes (Bhattacharjee, "Heat Map Generation using 3D Thermographic Images")_, support 3D modeling (Huang, "Multi-View Stereo with Infrared Images")_, and combine with RGB-D camera for spatial mapping (Zhang, "Spatial Mapping of Indoor Scenes Using RGB-D Camera")_.
