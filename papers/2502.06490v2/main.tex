\begin{abstract}
% With the rapid development of speech generation in the era of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech tokens have emerged as a fundamental representation for speech.
% These tokens are discrete, short and compact representations not only favorable for transmission and storage, but also convenient for incorporating speech into the language modeling paradigm.
% There are two major categories of discrete speech tokens, acoustic and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into rich research fields with various motivations, designs and methods.
% This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the existing taxonomy and recent advances in building discrete speech tokens, takes an in-depth look at the pros and cons in each research direction, and presents unified experimental comparisons for different types of tokens.
% We also discuss and summarize existing challenges in academia, with which we anticipate to provide inspirations for the future development of discrete speech tokens. 
The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: \textit{acoustic} tokens and \textit{semantic} tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.
