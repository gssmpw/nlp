\section{Conclusion}
The problem of device-level write amplification (DLWA) is becoming exceedingly important given the increased deployment of Flash caches and the sustainability challenges faced by modern data centers. Our work of segregating Flash cache data in Flash media using FDP SSDs shows an ideal DLWA of \textasciitilde1 is possible without any host overprovisioning and overhead to Flash cache metrics. This results in massive cost (2x) and carbon emission (4x) reductions at scale. The reduction in DLWA, along with increased device utilization, opens up new deployment opportunities for hybrid caches that were previously unfeasible. For example, this approach can reduce DRAM consumption while enabling SSD sharing in multi-tenant settings. Our work to isolate data using FDP in a state-of-the-art Flash cache, CacheLib has already been merged in the upstream repository. This highlights its impact and the appeal of reduced engineering cost of FDP SSDs for Flash caches where data placement is key to reduce their DLWA and carbon emissions.
