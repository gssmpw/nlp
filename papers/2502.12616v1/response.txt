\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Logical Reasoning} Logical reasoning tasks require the capability to process complex logical structures **Hernandez, "Understanding Complex Logical Structures"**. Traditional methodologies contain rule-based systems **Koller, "Rule-Based Systems for Symbolic Reasoning"** and neural network-based paradigms **Battaglia, "Neural-Symbolic Learning Systems"** for solving and manipulating symbolic representations. Recent advancements introduced hybrid frameworks **Lake, "Hybrid Frameworks for Logical Reasoning"**, which integrate large language models (LLMs) into symbolic reasoning pipelines **Liao, "Large Language Models for Symbolic Reasoning"**. These frameworks operate LLMs to map natural language inputs into symbolic syntax, subsequently processed by external reasoning tools. This integration improves reasoning performance through techniques such as self-consistency **Chen, "Self-Consistent Reasoning with Large Language Models"**. Nevertheless, these frameworks commonly depend on external tools predicated on the assumption that LLMs lack the reliability to parse symbolic expressions with the precision of rule-based reasoning systems alone.

\paragraph{Symbolic Reasoning}
Symbolic reasoning integrates natural language (NL) and symbolic language (SL) to decompose complex queries into sub-problems solved by SL programs and deterministic solvers, ensuring interpretability and precision **Damas, "Interpretable Symbolic Reasoning"**. Recent efforts have leveraged LLMs to decrease dependence on SL programs **Grave, "Large Language Models for Efficient Reasoning"**, but these approaches primarily address logical reasoning and depend on verifiers for accuracy, limiting their applicability to complex mathematical tasks.

On the other side, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies have demonstrated significant performance improvements in mathematical symbolic reasoning **Carpenter, "Chain-of-Thought Strategies for Mathematical Reasoning"**, reinforced by advancements in problem understanding **Goyal, "Understanding Complex Problems with Large Language Models"**, structured formats **Feng, "Structured Formats for Symbolic Reasoning"**, and supervision models **Dai, "Supervision Models for Efficient Reasoning"**. Further, premise selection and symbolic frameworks have facilitated systematic evaluations across logical and mathematical reasoning **Xu, "Premise Selection and Symbolic Frameworks for Logical and Mathematical Reasoning"**
