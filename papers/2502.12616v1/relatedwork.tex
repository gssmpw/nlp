\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Logical Reasoning} Logical reasoning tasks require the capability to process complex logical structures \cite{cummins1991conditional}. Traditional methodologies contain rule-based systems \cite{robinson1965machine} and neural network-based paradigms \cite{amayuelas2022neural,gerasimova2023comparative} for solving and manipulating symbolic representations. Recent advancements introduced hybrid frameworks \cite{pan2023logic,ye2024satlm,jiang2024leanreasoner}, which integrate large language models (LLMs) into symbolic reasoning pipelines \cite{quan2024verificationrefinementnaturallanguage}. These frameworks operate LLMs to map natural language inputs into symbolic syntax, subsequently processed by external reasoning tools. This integration improves reasoning performance through techniques such as self-consistency \cite{wang2023plan,zhang2022automatic}. Nevertheless, these frameworks commonly depend on external tools predicated on the assumption that LLMs lack the reliability to parse symbolic expressions with the precision of rule-based reasoning systems alone.

\paragraph{Symbolic Reasoning}
Symbolic reasoning integrates natural language (NL) and symbolic language (SL) to decompose complex queries into sub-problems solved by SL programs and deterministic solvers, ensuring interpretability and precision \cite{lyu2023faithful}. Recent efforts have leveraged LLMs to decrease dependence on SL programs \cite{xu2024faithful}, but these approaches primarily address logical reasoning and depend on verifiers for accuracy, limiting their applicability to complex mathematical tasks.

On the other side, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies have demonstrated significant performance improvements in mathematical symbolic reasoning \cite{jiang2024llms}, reinforced by advancements in problem understanding \cite{zhong2024achieving}, structured formats \cite{tam2024let}, and supervision models \cite{ranaldi2024aligning,ranaldi-freitas-2024-self,jiang2024rationalystpretrainingprocesssupervisionimproving}. Further, premise selection and symbolic frameworks have facilitated systematic evaluations across logical and mathematical reasoning \cite{meadows2023symbolic,ferreira2020premise}.
