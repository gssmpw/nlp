\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Logical Reasoning} Logical reasoning tasks require the capability to process complex logical structures ____. Traditional methodologies contain rule-based systems ____ and neural network-based paradigms ____ for solving and manipulating symbolic representations. Recent advancements introduced hybrid frameworks ____, which integrate large language models (LLMs) into symbolic reasoning pipelines ____. These frameworks operate LLMs to map natural language inputs into symbolic syntax, subsequently processed by external reasoning tools. This integration improves reasoning performance through techniques such as self-consistency ____. Nevertheless, these frameworks commonly depend on external tools predicated on the assumption that LLMs lack the reliability to parse symbolic expressions with the precision of rule-based reasoning systems alone.

\paragraph{Symbolic Reasoning}
Symbolic reasoning integrates natural language (NL) and symbolic language (SL) to decompose complex queries into sub-problems solved by SL programs and deterministic solvers, ensuring interpretability and precision ____. Recent efforts have leveraged LLMs to decrease dependence on SL programs ____, but these approaches primarily address logical reasoning and depend on verifiers for accuracy, limiting their applicability to complex mathematical tasks.

On the other side, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies have demonstrated significant performance improvements in mathematical symbolic reasoning ____, reinforced by advancements in problem understanding ____, structured formats ____, and supervision models ____. Further, premise selection and symbolic frameworks have facilitated systematic evaluations across logical and mathematical reasoning ____.
