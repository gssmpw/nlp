Resource Category & Barriers & Examples \\ 
\SetCell[r=3]{m}{Technological} &  Aversion of technology & \pquote{The search engines, these, online things are too general. They are helpful when you search for a road trip, but it's not the mental health thing} (P10).  \\ 
& Emotional frustration & \pquote{having to dig for it can be a little bit demoralizing. I just want instant gratification, but when your brain's all cluttered, the last thing you really want is to have to fight for help.} (P15)\\
& Lack experience-based personalization & \pquote{I get more worried when I look for it because there's just so much information out there... this information on Google might just be like for everybody. I get more anxious because I can't find information that is tailored to my needs.} (P08)\\
\SetCell[r=1]{m}{Interpersonal} & Difficulties in disclosure &  \pquote{My family don't really talk about things [mental health related] like that. } (P03) \\

\SetCell[r=3]{m}{Community} 
 & Varying professionality & “there are so many people talking while they are not qualified to talk” (P14) \\
  & Temporality & \par \pquote{It can be hard when you go from university to an external institution because you have to find one that matches your insurance. The first time, I called at least 10 or so people before I got the practitioner. They were like, 'We are not taking patients or we're not taking certain types of patients.' The whole process can be lengthy and challenging}. (P01) \\ 
  & Varying service investment & P15's university provides free and unlimited therapy sessions, while P07's university imposes a three-session limit. \\
  
\SetCell[r=2]{m}{Societal} & Compatibility & \pquote{the first one I had was just really weird and would like tell me her personal problems. And then the second one... she wasn't helpful.} (P06) \\
 & Impersonal & \pquote{She kept talking about sadness and stuff. And I tried to tell her, I'm not sad, I'm tired. I stopped seeing her because I felt like she wasn't really listening to me but just reacting.} (P01) \\
