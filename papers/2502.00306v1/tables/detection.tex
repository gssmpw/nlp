    \caption{Evaluating the effectiveness of malicious-input detection against prompt-based methods proposed in the literature for privacy leakage (via membership inference or dataset extraction) for RAG-based systems.
    For prompts that require the query, we compute scores based on aggregate statistics over 500 samples from various datasets.
    Both few-shot GPT-4 and Lakera can easily detect attempts to infer retrieved documents. Our attack achieves near-zero detection rate, unlike prior attacks that are almost always detected.}
