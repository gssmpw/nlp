\section{RAG Without Query-Rewriting}
\label{raw_rag}

As mentioned in \Cref{sec:exp_setting}, in addition to the RAG setting with query rewriting, we also evaluate the vanilla RAG setting, where the input query is sent directly to the retriever without any modification. For this evaluation, we use LLaMA 3.1-8B as the generator and GTE as the retriever. The results are presented in \Cref{tab:llama8b_norewrite}. In the vanilla setting, without any detection filter or query rewriting, the MBA attack demonstrates better performance compared to our attack, although our attack achieves high AUC across all settings. However, it is important to note that, in a realistic scenario, the MBA attack's queries are unlikely to pass detection filters, limiting its practical applicability.
