\section{Prompts for Experimental Stages}
\label{app:prompts}

In this section, we document the exact prompts used at various stages of our experimental setup. The prompt used to deploy GPT-4o as a prompt injection detector, including detailed instructions and examples, is presented in \Cref{fig:classifier_prompt}. The few-shot prompt used to generate 30 yes/no questions with GPT-4o is shown in \Cref{fig:corpus_question_generation}. Following question generation, the prompt for generating the general description of each target document with GPT-4o is provided in \Cref{fig:topic_description_task}. Additionally, the short prompt for rewriting the input query of the RAG system is illustrated in \Cref{fig:copy_editing_task}. This prompt is a modified version of the best-performing prompt reported in \citep{kirchenbauer2023reliability}. Finally, the RAG system prompt and the prompt used to generate ground-truth answers are presented in Figures \ref{fig:rag_system_prompt} and \ref{fig:shadow_llm_prompt}, respectively.
