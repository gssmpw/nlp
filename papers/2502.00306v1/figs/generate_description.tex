    \textbf{Task Description:}\\[1em]

    You are tasked with generating a concise and accurate topic-focused description of a document based on its content and title (if provided). The description should:\\[0.5em]
    1. Be a single, short sentence.\\
    2. Focus only on the main topic or subject of the document, avoiding verbs and conclusions.\\
    3. Include important keywords from the document.\\
    4. Avoid referencing the document itself with phrases like "The document discusses," "The report highlights," or "This paper investigates."\\
    5. Output only a short, noun-phrase-like description or topic sentence.\\[1em]

    \textbf{Examples:}\\[1em]
    - \textbf{Instead of:} "The report from the Düsseldorf conference highlights advancements in green energy technologies."\\
    - \textbf{Generate:} "Advancements in green energy technologies and discussions at the Düsseldorf conference."\\[0.5em]
    - \textbf{Instead of:} "The document investigates the cyclooxygenase pathway in inflammatory responses."\\
    - \textbf{Generate:} "The cyclooxygenase pathway and its role in inflammatory responses."\\[1em]

    Ensure the description is concise, focused on the main topic, and includes relevant keywords. Avoid any extra text, explanations, or labels.\\[1em]

    \textbf{Input:}\\[1em]
    Title: \texttt{\{Title\}}\\
    Text: \texttt{\{Text\}}\\[1em]

    \textbf{Output:}\\[0.5em]
