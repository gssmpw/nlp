\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose Igformer, an end-to-end antibody co-design framework that simultaneously generates both 1D sequences and 3D structures for epitope-binding antibody CDRs. Igformer advances existing models through a novel intra-graph refinement process, which is capable of capturing intricate residue interactions within the epitope-paratope binding region. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Igformer, providing a new perspective for end-to-end antibody co-design tasks.
