\section{Conclusion}
In this survey, we have proposed a communication-centric framework for understanding LLM-based multi-agent systems. By distinguishing between system-level communication and system-internal communication, we highlighted how various architectures, communication goals, strategies, paradigms, and content types collectively shape the performance and flexibility of multi-agent solutions. We also discuss challenges and future opportunities, hoping this survey encourages researchers to pursue these unexplored avenues and better develop LLM-MAS.
