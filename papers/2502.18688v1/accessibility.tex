Figure 1: Medical crash cart robot prototypes. We built a series of teleoperated medical crash cart robots (MCCRs). MCCR 1 delivers supplies using a hoverboard circuit. MCCR 2 also delivers supplies, recommends supplies using drawer opening capabilities, and was deployed at a medical training event which revealed insights which led to the design of MCCR 3 that communicates recommendations and reminders using drawer lights, speech, and alerts.


Figure 2: Medical crash cart robot v1. We built Prototype 1 by connecting the Garbatrage hoverboard circuit to a tool cart using metal chassis, cardboard, and tape.

Figure 3: Schematic of linear actuator array for drawer opening mechanism and CAD of actuator and holder. The actuator holder includes a back wall to withstand recoil and an extra shaft attachment.

Prototype 4: Linear actuator casings and assembly of medical crash cart robot v1. (Top) We built two linear actuator casing prototypes. The case for the first actuator prototype pushed the actuator back when it opened so we built a more stable casing to hold it in place. (Bottom) Assembly of hardware components.
