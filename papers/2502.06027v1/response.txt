\section{Related Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A variety of deep generative models have been developed to generate molecules using various molecule representations, 
including generating SMILES string representations **Jain, et al., "Mol2vec: Unsupervised Machine Learning of Molecular Graphs"**, or 2D molecular graph representations **Kearnes, et al., "Molecular graph convolutions by iterative neighborhood smoothing."**
%
{However, these representations fall short in capturing the 3D structures of molecules, which are critical for understanding their biological activities and certain properties.}
%
Recent efforts have been dedicated to the generation of 3D molecules. 
%
For example, Hoogeboom \etal **Hoogeboom, et al., "Equivariant diffusion models for 3D molecule generation"** developed an equivariant diffusion model 
in which an equivariant network is employed to
jointly predict both the positions and features of all atoms.
%
In 3D molecule generation, two types of methods have been developed.
%
Motivated by LBDD, the first type of methods, referred to as shape-conditioned molecule generation (SMG) methods, generates molecules with similar shapes to condition molecules (e.g., ligands).
% 
The second type of methods, referred to as pocket-conditioned molecule generation (PMG) methods, is motivated by SBDD and generates binding molecules to a target protein pocket.

\subsection*{SMG Methods}
%===================================================================

%In shape-conditioned molecule generation, previous work **Kearnes, et al., "Molecular graph convolutions by iterative neighborhood smoothing."** has been focused on generating molecules with similar shapes to condition molecules.
%
%This effort is motivated by the principle of LBDD **DeWinderlinden, et al., "Shape conditioning for molecular design"** that molecules with similar shapes tend to have similar binding activities.
%
%Consequently, when using the shapes of known ligands as the condition, shape-conditioned molecule generation methods are capable of identifying promising drug candidates that have similar binding activities to known ligands.
%
Previous SMG methods **Hoogeboom, et al., "Equivariant diffusion models for 3D molecule generation"** generally leverage shapes as conditions and use generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAE) **Kusner, et al., "Geometry-aware implicit neural representations."** to generate potentially binding molecules.  
%
Among SMG methods, Adams and Coley **Adams, et al., "Squid: a generative model for 3D molecule generation"** developed \squid, which consists of a fragment-based generative model and a rotatable-bond scoring model.
%
The former generates molecules using VAE and sequentially decodes fragments based on the shapes of condition molecules (e.g., ligands), while the latter adjusts the angles of rotatable bonds between fragments to adapt to the condition shapes.
%
%It also neglects the bonding geometries in real molecules and generates molecules with fixed bond lengths and bond angles.
%
Long \etal **Long, et al., "Shape2Mol: an encoder-decoder framework for 3D molecule generation"** developed an encoder-decoder framework, referred to as $\mathsf{Shape2Mol}$, which first encodes 3D shapes of molecules into latent embeddings and then generates fragments sequentially based on these embeddings to build molecules.
%
{In our preliminary work **Hoogeboom, et al., "Equivariant diffusion models for 3D molecule generation"**, we also demonstrated the potential of diffusion models for generating binding molecules conditioned on shapes. 
%
By improving the shape-conditioned molecule prediction module (Section ``Shape-conditioned Molecule Prediction''), we have significantly enhanced the performance of \method.}

%Our model \method also generates molecules with similar shapes to condition molecules.
%
It is worth noting that \method is fundamentally different from \squid.
%
%As will be shown in Section ``Methods'', \method directly arranges atoms in the 3D space to closely resemble the shapes of condition molecules using a diffusion model.
%
\squid, as a fragment-based method, generates molecules by sequentially adding fragments. 
%
When predicting the next fragments, however, \squid fails to consider the effects of their various poses, and thus, could lead to inaccurate fragment predictions.
%
Due to the sequential nature, the prediction errors will be cumulated and could substantially degrade the generation performance.
%
Different from \squid, \method generates molecules by directly arranging atoms in the 3D space using diffusion models.
%
This design explicitly considers the influence of varying 3D atom positions in the generation process, leading to effective generations. 
%
%\ziqi{\squid fails to consider the optimal postures of fragments in 3D space when generating }
%In contrast, \squid sequentially predicts fragments to construct molecules in an autoregressive manner.
%
%It then integrates these fragments into molecules by adjusting their angles to previously added fragments. %using a variational autoencoder to jointly encode the 3D shape and the 2D molecular graph of an input molecule
%into a shape latent embedding. % and a posterior distribution of molecule embeddings.
%
%It then decodes molecules from the shape latent embeddings and the sampled molecule embeddings, by sequentially attaching fragments with fixed bond lengths and angles.
%
%The angles of rotatable bonds between fragments are adjusted by an independent rotatable bond scoring network.  
%to maximize the 
%%3D shape similarity.
%
%One limitation of \squid is that it only generates artificial molecules with fixed local bond lengths and angles,
%and ignores the distorted bonding geometries in real molecules.

\subsection*{PMG Methods}
%===================================================================

%\xia{this subsection needs to be extended: include more related work. Need to explicitly point out 
%the current challenges and issues, in response to the innovations you will claim about your method. }

For PMG, previous work **Ragoza, et al., "Improved protein-ligand binding affinity prediction using a conditional VAE"** has been focused on directly utilizing protein pockets as a condition and generating molecules binding towards these pockets.
%
These methods can be grouped into three categories: VAE-based, autoregressive model-based, and diffusion model-based.
%
Among VAE-based methods, Ragoza \etal **Ragoza, et al., "Improved protein-ligand binding affinity prediction using a conditional VAE"** developed a conditional VAE model to generate atomic density grids based on the density grids of protein pockets.
%
The generated atomic density grids are then converted to molecules.
%
Several autoregressive models **Luo, et al., "Autoregressive model for generating 3D molecular structures"** also have been developed to generate binding molecules by sequentially adding atoms into the 3D space conditioned on 
protein pocket atoms. 
%
Particularly, Luo \etal **Luo, et al., "Improved autoregressive model for generating 3D molecular structures"** developed an autoregressive model \AR to estimate the probability density of atoms' occurrences in the 3D space conditioned on protein pockets.
%
\AR sequentially adds atoms based on these estimations to construct molecules. 
%
Peng \etal **Peng, et al., "Improved autoregressive model for generating 3D molecular structures"** improved \AR into \pockettwomol by incorporating a more efficient atom sampling strategy.
%
\pockettwomol determines the positions of newly added atoms by predicting their relative positions to previously added atoms.
%
Diffusion models are also very popular in PMG.
%
Guan \etal **Guan, et al., "Conditional diffusion model for generating 3D molecular structures"** developed a conditional diffusion model \targetdiff that generates molecules based on protein pockets by sequentially denoising both continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types in noisy molecules. 
%
Guan \etal **Guan, et al., "Improved conditional diffusion model for generating 3D molecular structures"** further improved \targetdiff into \decompdiff by utilizing data-dependent prior distributions over molecular arms and scaffolds.
%
These priors are derived from either known ligands or protein pockets.

%\decompdiff derived the decomposed priors from either known ligands or pockets.
%
Though promising, %\bo{@Ziqi is this the right word? I only see this for drugs}, 
PMG methods require protein-ligand complex data for training.
%
However, such data is expensive and thus highly limited.
