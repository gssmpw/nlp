    Your task is to evaluate whether the given dataset description faithfully represents the facts from the provided dataset sample, dataset profile, and semantic profile. For each sentence in the description, verify whether it accurately reflects the information from the inputs. Carefully check step-by-step for every sentence to determine if it is true or false. Use Example 1 as a reference and respond to Example 2. \\

    \textbf{Dataset Sample:} \\
    \texttt{Time Stamp, Average Wind Speed, Standard Deviation, Average Wind Direction} \\
    \texttt{7/22/2003 1:40, 1.8, 1.66, 315} \\
    \texttt{6/18/2003 10:50, 6.0, 1.44, 225} \\
    \\
    \textbf{Dataset Profile:} \\
    - **Time Stamp:** Data is of type text, 13,576 unique values, semantic type: datetime. \\
    - **Average Wind Speed:** Data is of type float, range: 0 to 30.2. \\
    - **Standard Deviation:** Data is of type float, range: 0 to 3.05. \\
    - **Average Wind Direction:** Data is of type integer, 16 unique values, range: 0 to 338.0. \\
    \\
    \textbf{Semantic Profile:} \\
    - **Time Stamp:** Represents temporal entity, resolution: Hour. \\
    - **Average Wind Speed:** Represents measurement, domain: climate, function: measurement. \\
    - **Standard Deviation:** Represents statistical measure, domain: general, function: measurement. \\
    - **Average Wind Direction:** Represents measurement, domain: climate, function: measurement. \\

    \textbf{Data Topic:} Wind Speed Data \\
    \\
    \textbf{Generated Description:} \\
    "This dataset contains 13,576 hourly records of wind speed and direction, with wind speed ranging from 0 to 30.2 m/s and wind direction values spanning from 0 to 360°. It includes detailed hourly timestamps as temporal entities, with wind speed and direction categorized as climate measurements. This dataset is useful for renewable energy planning, meteorological research, and understanding wind patterns." \\
    \\
    \textbf{Evaluation:} \\
    - **(Sentence 1):** "This dataset contains 13,576 hourly records of wind speed and direction, with wind speed ranging from 0 to 30.2 m/s and wind direction values spanning from 0 to 360°." \\
      **Explanation:** The dataset profile specifies 13,576 records, the correct wind speed range (0–30.2 m/s), and the correct timestamp type. However, the wind direction range is incorrectly stated as 0–360° instead of 0–338°. \\
      **Verification:** F \\
    - **(Sentence 2):** "It includes detailed hourly timestamps as temporal entities, with wind speed and direction categorized as climate measurements." \\
      **Explanation:** The semantic profile confirms that the timestamps are temporal entities, and wind speed and direction are categorized as climate measurements. \\
      **Verification:** T \\
    - **(Sentence 3):** "This dataset is useful for renewable energy planning, meteorological research, and understanding wind patterns." \\
      **Explanation:** These applications are reasonable inferences based on the dataset's focus on wind speed and direction. \\
      **Verification:** T \\

%     \textbf{Evaluation:} \\
%     - **Faithfulness Score:** \textbf{8} \\
%     - **Explanation:** Most claims in the description are supported by the dataset profile and semantic profile. Statements about "predicting weather changes" and "renewable energy policies" are reasonable inferences based on the dataset's focus on wind speed and direction. However, "advancements in technology for wind energy generation" is speculative and reduces the score slightly. \\
