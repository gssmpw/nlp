The main limitation of our work lies in the reliance on prior knowledge of the task structure, which is essential for augmenting the training experience to simulate diverse task conditions. 
This dependency restricts the selection of transformations to those that satisfy the necessary invariance assumptions, potentially limiting generalization in cases where such assumptions are difficult to establish.
That said, this reliance on prior knowledge also offers the advantage of systematically utilizing our understanding of the system's dynamics. 
By incorporating domain-specific insights, we can design targeted transformations that align with the inherent properties of the task.
In the future, we aim to broaden the applicability of our method by exploring more flexible augmentation techniques to simulate a wider range of OOD task conditions and enhance generalization across diverse and unstructured environments.
