\noindent\textbf{Definition of EgoNormia Sample.} A sample in EgoNormia consists of:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item Frames prior $f_p$ to the sample point, sampled at one frames / second.
    \item Questions asking for the best next action and its justification.
    % \item Frames subsequent $f_d$ to the sample point, sampled at one frames / second, used in the action-following task.
    \item A set of potential actions $A = \{a_1, \cdots, a_N \}$ and justifications $J = \{j_1, \cdots, j_N \}$, including None, describing potential actions to be taken and reasoning for the former.
    % Exactly one response is correct (which can be None); the model chooses a single best response for action and justification respectively.
