% \section{Evaluation Protocol}
% \label{appendix:evaluation}
% EgoNormia includes five-way multiple-choice questions, for which we report accuracies per task and in aggregate across the entire dataset. A significant challenge in evaluating MCQs over many questions is information leakage; thus, each MCQ and individual Q is evaluated independently to avoid this issue.
