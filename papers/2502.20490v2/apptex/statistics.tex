The word count distribution of action descriptions, correct behaviors, distractor behaviors, correct justifications, and distractor justifications is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wc}. The word frequency distribution is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:wf}. Both the word count distribution and word frequency patterns for correct and distractor responses are highly similar. This suggests that the correct and distractor answers do not differ significantly in length or lexical distribution. Consequently, selecting the correct answer requires a deeper understanding of meaning rather than relying on surface-level cues such as length or individual word occurrences.
