\section*{Ethics Statement}
\label{sec:ethics}
\paragraph{Ethical Assumptions.} 
We emphasize that \dataset{} is designed as a descriptive benchmark rather than a prescriptive one --- 
the dataset is intended to evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand physical social norms in egocentric videos, rather than to dictate what these norms should be or how they should be enforced.
We thus acknowledge that the norms depicted in the dataset may not be universally applicable or appropriate in all contexts and that the interpretation of these norms may vary across cultures, communities, time periods, and individuals.

\paragraph{Bias and Fairness.}
Despite our best efforts to create a diverse and representative dataset, 
we acknowledge that \dataset{} may contain biases that reflect the perspectives and experiences of the dataset creators and annotators.
Consequently, the norms and justifications depicted in the dataset may be influenced by the cultural, social, and demographic characteristics of the individuals who contributed to the dataset.
While all of our annotators are from the United States, norms often differ in different cultures \citep{rao2024normad, shi2024culturebank}.
To address these concerns, 
we recommend that researchers using \dataset{} for training or evaluation critically assess potential biases and ensure they align with the intended application context.

\paragraph{Human Subjects and Privacy.}
\dataset{} is constructed from Ego4D videos, 
which are publicly available and do not contain personally identifiable information.
The Ego4D dataset is released under a non-exclusive, non-transferable license that permits its use for academic research, as outlined in the license agreement. Our work complies with the terms of this license, using the Ego4D data solely for research purposes. Our annotation process was conducted with proper informed consent,
ensuring annotators are fully aware of the task, its purpose, and how their contribution would be used.
Annotators were compensated fairly for their time and effort (details in Appendix~\ref{sec:HumanValidationProcess}).
The data used in this work does not include personally identifiable information.
No sensitive information about the annotators or individuals appearing in the video data was collected or used in the study.
% This work was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the institution where the work was conducted. %\mohammad{I'm not sure about this part.}
Notably,
this work was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Stanford University (IRB-77185).

\paragraph{Risks in Deployment.}
The deployment of AI systems trained on \dataset{} may pose risks if these systems are used to make decisions that impact individuals' safety, well-being, or rights.
To mitigate these risks, 
we stress that \dataset{} should not be used for prescriptive advice or to make decisions with ethical, or safety implications without extensive human oversight. 
By using \dataset{},
researchers should be aware of the limitations of the dataset and the potential risks associated with deploying systems trained on it.
