\section{Conclusion}
%\hao{Future work? How should researchers improve norm reasoning?}
We introduce \dataset{}, a novel benchmark and dataset designed to rigorously evaluate the ability of VLMs to understand physical social norms (PSN) in egocentric embodiments. We demonstrate that, despite SOTA models' strong visual recognition and abstract reasoning capabilities, they remain inferior to humans in PSN understanding, primarily due to norm sensibility and prioritization errors. We demonstrate \dataset{}'s direct utility in augmenting normative understanding by testing a retrieval-based method, demonstrating improvements across out-of-domain and out-of-embodiment videos. Finally, we identify opportunities for future work in embodied norm understanding, suggesting post-training on large norm datasets as a promising direction for study.
