\textbf{Bias Assessment Metric} & \textbf{Ref Publication} &  \textbf{Year} &\textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
Inequity Rate (IR) & NIST / Grother \etal~\cite{grother2021demographic} & 2021 & This metric involves the analysis of the minimum and maximum ratios of False Match Rate (FMR) and False Non-Match Rate (FNMR), with the application of weighted exponents. \\ 
Statistical Approaches & Schuckers \etal~\cite{schuckers2022statistical} & 2022 & Utilizes a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing approach to assess bias. \\ 
Separation/Compactness Metrics & Kotwal \& Marcel \cite{kotwal2022fairness} &  2022 & Investigates the distributions of genuine and impostor scores, focusing on shape and compactness characteristics. \\ 
Fairness Discrepancy Rate (FDR) & Pereira \& Marcel \cite{de2021fairness} & 2021 &  A weighted combination of the maximum differential values of FMR and FNMR. \\ 
GARBE (Gini Coefficient Based Metric) & MdTF / Howard \etal~\cite{howard2022evaluating} & 2022 & Measures statistical dispersion in FMR and FNMR, integrating these through linear weighting. \\ 
Sum of Group Error Differences & Elobaid \etal~\cite{elobaid2024sum} & 2024 & Examines relative deviations in group-level FMR and FNMR compared to global scores, providing insight into disparities. \\ 
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) & Solano \etal~\cite{solano2024comprehensive} & 2024 & A weighted combination that assesses disparities in both tail and central distributions of performance metrics. \\ 
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) & Villalobos \etal~\cite{villalobos2022fair} & 2022 & Calculates the relative deviation of FMR from a pre-established benchmark. \\ 
Standard Deviation & - &  - & The standard deviation of FMR, FNMR, and True Match Rate (TMR) is assessed to gauge variability. \\ 
Skewed Error Ratio (SER) & - &  - & A ratio that compares the worst-case error rates across different demographic groups. \\ 
Trade-Off (TO) & - &  - & Evaluates the trade-off between performance metrics, particularly the difference in average accuracy and standard deviation. \\ \bottomrule
