publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples at test time ("few-shot prompting"). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting methods such as "chain-of-thought", which employ LLMs for both understanding the problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and others. In all these natural language reasoning tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using CODEX achieves state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing PaLM-540B which uses chain-of-thought by absolute 15\% top-1.},

abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ>0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf{δ:there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k)s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε>0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε>0.}

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",
