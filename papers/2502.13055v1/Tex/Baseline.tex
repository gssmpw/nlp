\section{Baseline Models}
\label{baseline}
\noindent The details of baseline models are shown as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Drebin}: Drebin~\cite{Arpdrebin} detects malware using binary feature vectors derived from nine data types (e.g., hardware components, API calls, permissions) and classifies samples via a linear classifier. 
    \item \textbf{DeepDrebin}: DeepDrebin~\cite{Grossedeepdrebin} extends Drebin by replacing the linear classifier with a three-layer deep neural network (DNN) while retaining the same feature space for feature extraction and classification.
    \item \textbf{Malscan}: Malscan~\cite{malscan} employs a graph-based approach, extracting sensitive API calls from APKs and computing four centrality measures (degree, Katz, proximity, and harmonic wave centralities) as features. We use the optimal feature with a Random Forest classifier, which leads to the lowest overhead.
\end{itemize}
