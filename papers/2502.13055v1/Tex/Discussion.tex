\section{Discussion}
While LLMs improve Android malware detection, their general pre-training limits fine-grained behavior analysis. Future research should enhance security expertise through domain-specific fine-tuning or external knowledge integration. Meanwhile, learning-based methods remain essential for capturing overall insights in non-drift scenarios, highlighting effective strategies to combine these two paradigms and maximize their complementary strengths.
% While LLMs enhance Android malware detection, their general pre-trained nature limits the analysis of complex and fine-grained malware behaviors. Future research should integrate domain-specific knowledge, such as fine-tuning LLMs or leveraging external knowledge bases, to enhance their security expertise. Meanwhile, learning-based methods remain crucial, as large training datasets help capture detailed insights and improve detection without drift. A key challenge is developing effective strategies to combine these approaches, maximizing their complementary strengths.
