\section{Conclusion}
Large language modelsâ€™ superior zero-shot inference offers a promising solution for Android malware detectors to handle distribution drift, dataset bias and explainability gaps in real-world scenarios but struggle with excessive support code and complex program structures. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, the first practical framework enabling LLMs for explainable Android malware detection. Our evaluation in the real-world setting demonstrates that LAMD outperforms conventional detectors by effectively analyzing complex structures and semantics. LAMD unlocks LLMs' potential in Android security, paving the way for AI-driven malware analysis. 

% The rapid evolution of Android malware demands more effective real-world detection. LLMs offer a promising solution to concept drift, dataset bias, and explainability gaps in traditional learning-based methods but struggle with excessive support code and complex program structures. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, the first practical framework enabling LLMs to detect and reason about Android malware. Our evaluation in the real-world setting demonstrates that LAMD improves detection accuracy and interpretability, surpassing conventional detectors. By effectively handling complex structures and semantics, LAMD unlocks LLMs' potential in Android security, paving the way for AI-driven malware analysis.
