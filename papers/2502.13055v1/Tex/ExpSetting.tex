\section{Experiment Details}
\label{expSet}
Our experiments are conducted on an RTX A6000 GPU. For LLM-based reasoning, we utilize GPT-4o-mini~\cite{openai}, selected for its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and strong reasoning capabilities. The Data Relation Coverage (DRC) threshold $\theta$ is set to 0.95 to balance computational efficiency and accuracy.
