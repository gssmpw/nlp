Variable-to-API & Direct      & A variable directly determines API execution.                          \\
                & Transitive  & A variable is propagated through a call chain to an API.               \\
                & Conditional & A variable influences API execution via control flow (e.g., if/else ). \\
Inter-variable  & Parallel & Two variables jointly contribute to computing another variable.        \\
                & Derived     & A variable is derived from another through computation.
