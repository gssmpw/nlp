\section{Conclusions \label{conc}}

This paper constructs a \toctou-resilient \sa protocol (\system) 
for networks of low-end IoT devices. It facilitates simultaneous attestation across the network while 
minimizing runtime/energy overhead by computing HMAC over minimal fixed-size input. 
Two variants of the protocol, based on the availability of real-time clocks, are present.

An open-source prototype implemented on TI MSP430 demonstrates the practicality of \system on commodity hardware.
