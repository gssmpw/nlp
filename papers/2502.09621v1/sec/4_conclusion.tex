\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced MME-CoT, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Chain-of-Thought reasoning in Large Multimodal Models. 
Our dataset comprises six categories to cover most scenarios of visual reasoning tasks.
To gain a thorough understanding of the reasoning process, we design a novel CoT evaluation suite with three metrics. 
Our systematic evaluation obtains useful insights into the issues within the current state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models.
We identify critical flaws in all the tested open-source models.
As the field continues to evolve, MME-CoT stands as a valuable tool for measuring progress and identifying areas for improvement in the development of more sophisticated multimodal AI systems.
