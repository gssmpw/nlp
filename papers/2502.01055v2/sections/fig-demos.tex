\captionof{figure}{\crisp computes entirely new contact sequences from naive and even all-zero initializations. For (a), (b), (c), and (d), the left side shows the initial trajectories and the right side displays the optimized trajectory from \crisp. For (e) the hopper problem, the initial guess is a free-fall motion released from the origin. The color gradient represents the progression of time (from blue to yellow). For (f), we implement the policy derived from \crisp in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-world push tasks. Detailed descriptions of these tasks are provided in \S\ref{sec:exp}.
