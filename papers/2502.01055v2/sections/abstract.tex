% Contact-implicit motion planning has gained popularity in modern robotic systems for its ability to handle diverse motion patterns arising from interactions with surrounding environments. This approach leverages complementarity constraints between contact states and forces to implicitly encode motion transitions across varying contact scenarios, providing a unified representation of the system behaviors under different contact conditions.
% However, despite its modeling prowess, the effective solution of Mathematical Programming with Complementary Constraints (MPCC) problems has long been a challenge in numerical optimization. This difficulty primarily stems from the inherent lack of classical constraint qualification and the resulting failure of certifiable optimality conditions. These theoretical challenges translate into significant numerical difficulties and lead to disappointing results for existing nonlinear programming solvers.
% In practice, many implementations of contact-implicit approaches often depend on informed initial guesses to achieve convergence, which limits their ability to fully explore diverse motion patterns and exploit the inherent flexibility of contact-implicit formulations in solving contact problems.
% In this study, we present a novel sequential convex optimization algorithm tailored for motion planning problems with general nonlinear contact-implicit constraints, named \textsc{CRISP} (\underline{R}obust \underline{C}ontact-\underline{I}mplicit motion planning with \underline{S}equential convex \underline{P}rogramming). Considering the ineffectiveness of primal-dual optimality conditions in the original problem, we discard dual aspects and design a merit function with exact weighted $\ell_1$ penalty to measure primal feasibility and objective reduction. We ensure the descent of this merit function through solving a series of convex subproblems and employing designed globalization techniques. We further 1)~prove that \textsc{CRISP}, without relying on second-order constraint information, is guaranteed to converge locally to the stationary point of the merit function, 2)~provide contact-implicit formulations on several representative multi-modal robot motion planning tasks, and conduct extensive comparative analyses with benchmark solvers. The results reveal the exceptional effectiveness and robustness of \textsc{CRISP}, consistently converging to high-quality and feasible solutions with naive initial guesses, 3)~release a high-performance numerical solver for the C++ implementation of \textsc{CRISP}, which provides an easy-to-use interface for defining and solving robot motion planning problems with complementarity and general nonlinear constraints.

Contact-implicit motion planning---embedding contact sequencing as implicit complementarity constraints---holds the promise of leveraging continuous optimization to discover new contact patterns online. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization, being an instance of Mathematical Programming with Complementary Constraints, fails the classical constraint qualifications that are crucial for the convergence of popular numerical solvers.  
We present \underline{r}obust \underline{c}ontact-\underline{i}mplicit motion planning with \underline{s}equential convex \underline{p}rogramming (\scenario{CRISP}), a solver that departs from the usual primal-dual algorithmic framework but instead focuses only on the primal problem. \crisp solves a convex quadratic program with an adaptive trust region radius at each iteration, and its convergence is evaluated by a merit function using weighted $\ell_1$ penalty. We (\emph{i}) prove sufficient conditions on \crisp's convergence to first-order stationary points of the merit function; (\emph{ii}) release a high-performance C++ implementation of \crisp with a generic nonlinear programming interface; and (\emph{iii}) demonstrate \crisp's surprising robustness in solving contact-implicit planning with naive initializations. In fact, \crisp solves several contact-implicit problems with an all-zero initialization.
