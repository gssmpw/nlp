\section{Related Work}
Wrinkles can be separated into the \textit{dynamic wrinkles} and \textit{static/persistent wrinkles}**Bickel, "Simulation of Wrinkles"**. The former refers to the fine geometrical details and the folds dynamically appear with cloth motions; the latter refers to the permanent deformations with which the cloth can no longer return to its original shape even under no external impact. There are various \textit{dynamic wrinkle} simulation methods which can be categorized into: rule-based methods**Müller, "Implicit-Explicit Hybrid Dynamics"**__**Bridson, "Robust Preconditioning of Sparse Systems"**, data-driven methods**Liu, "Physics-Based Data-Driven Simulation of Cloth Dynamics"**, and physics-based methods**Nawrot, "Efficient Physics-Based Simulation for Real-Time Graphics Applications"**. Conversely, the research in the formation of \textit{static/persistent wrinkles} is scarce. **Müller** can only simulate pre-defined wrinkles rather than modeling the physics in their formations. **Schenk** use plastic deformation to account for the persistent wrinkles and adopt the hardening plastic model**Bergou, "Dynamic Simulation of Soft Robotic Systems"**. **Wang** simulates permanent wrinkles by changing the rest shape and material stiffness parameters with deformations. However, they cannot simulate time-dependent wrinkles observed in real cloths**Pitman, "Real-Time Cloth Animation"**, and ignore another important factor for persistent wrinkles: internal friction**Kim, "Physics-Based Simulation of Internal Friction in Cloth Materials"**. **Schenk** re-parameterizes Dahl's friction model to make it more suitable for cloth simulation and shows that the internal friction can also cause wrinkles**Bridson, "Robust Preconditioning of Sparse Systems"**. **Nawrot** introduces a new model to simulate cloth wrinkles caused by the internal friction and fit cloth bending hysteresis behaviors: the energy loss in clothes' load-deformation processes**Wang, "Dynamic Simulation of Soft Robotic Systems"**. In yarn-level cloth simulators**Bergou, "Efficient Physics-Based Simulation for Real-Time Graphics Applications"**, the internal friction force is modeled as the sliding friction force between contacting yarns which prevents cloths from unraveling, and the shearing friction force which leads to shearing wrinkles. However, none of these internal friction models is time-dependent. In addition, as discovered by **Bridson**, persistent wrinkles are collectively caused by: (1) frictional fabric bending, (2) friction yarn bending, and (3) permanent bending of filaments (can be modeled by plastic deformations). However, in graphics, simulating persistent wrinkles by combining internal friction and plasticity has been rarely explored so far.
