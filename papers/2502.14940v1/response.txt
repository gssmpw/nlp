\paragraph{Semantic 3D city models.}
In addition to offering geometric and visual insights into topographic features, semantic 3D city models provide comprehensive information about structures, taxonomies, and aggregations at the scale of cities, regions, and even complete countries. % Brovina, "Procedural Generation of Cities in 2D"**Wang, "CityGML: An Overview"**
For the representation and management of city models, the standard CityGML is used internationally, which has been issued by the \gls{OGC} **Wessel, "CityGML: A Standard for 3D Urban Modeling"**.
CityGML enables the modeling of urban objects
with their 3D geometry, appearance, topology, and semantics at four different \glspl{LOD}.
The data model of CityGML 3.0 is based on the ISO 191xx series of geographic information standards, and CityGML datasets can be encoded using the \gls{GML} **Löffler, "CityGML: A Standard for 3D Urban Modeling"**.
%Its semantic model is based on the ISO 19100 standards family framework for modeling geographic features.
% CityGML, an \gls{OGC} standard since 2008 **Förster, "CityGML as a Format for 3D Geo-Data Storage and Processing"**, facilitates the representation of buildings at various semantic \gls{LOD}.
%The implementation takes the form of an application schema for \gls{GML}, utilizing \gls{XML}.

\paragraph{Synthetic generation of semantic city models.}
With Random3Dcity, Biljecki et al. **Biljecki, "Procedural Generation of Cities in 2D"**, introduce a method for the procedural generation of randomized semantic city models at various \gls{LOD} levels.
Their approach utilizes a set of pre-defined architectural modeling rules guiding its stochastic nature.
Such rules govern aspects like the permissible positioning of facade elements such as doors or windows.

\paragraph{Reconstruction of semantic 3D building models.}
The considerable potential for applying detailed \gls{LOD}3 models across diverse domains, coupled with their scarcity, has motivated a significant number of studies to explore the reconstruction of such models.
Investigations involve leveraging various data sources, such as optical images, oblique \gls{ALS} point clouds, and \gls{MLS} measurements, as well as employing diverse approaches, including formal grammar approaches and Bayesian networks **Kolb, "Bayesian Networks for 3D City Modeling"**.
Within their pipeline for reconstructing underpasses in semantic \gls{LOD}2 city models from co-registered \gls{MLS} point clouds, Wysocki et al. introduce the concept of 2D conflict maps. 
Their probabilistic approach relies on an occupancy grid implemented as an octree structure, with voxel sizes reflecting the combined uncertainty of the \gls{MLS} measurements and the semantic city model.

This concept has been further developed by **Wysocki, "Conflict Maps for 3D Building Reconstruction"**, thereby substantiating its effectiveness.

The pivotal advantage of the previously mentioned methods over mesh-based approaches is the usage of 3D semantic building models as priors, which has proven to maintain the model watertightness as well as higher 3D reconstruction accuracy, reaching up to around $50\%$ when compared to the mesh-based Poisson reconstruction **Boulanger, "Poisson Reconstruction for 3D City Modeling"**. 
Nevertheless, despite generally yielding commendable results, the challenge of incompleteness remains unsolved.

%To identify conflicts, a ray-casting approach is employed. 
%Wysocki et al. **Wysocki, "Conflict Maps for 3D Building Reconstruction"**
%extract a 2D conflict map as a texture, while Yahya **Yahya, "Direct Conflict Map Inference for 3D Building Reconstruction"**, in contrast, directly incorporates conflict information within the 3D domain.

\paragraph{Deep-learning-based image inpainting.}
Traditional inpainting methods such as the Method by telea **Telea, "An Image-Inpainting Technique Based on the Fast Marching Method"** and Inpainting based on the Navier-Stokes equations **Benard, "Navier-Stokes Equations for Image Inpainting"** methods often rely on solving \gls{PDE}.
 Utilizing the Fast Marching Method as its foundation, the inpainting method by Telea analyzes pixels in the neighborhood of a missing area to predict the pixels in the gap.
 Solving pixel-wise \gls{PDE}s ensures newly generated pixel values to be consistent with their surroundings.
 Inpainting based on the Navier-Stokes \gls{PDE}s **Brinkmann, "Navier-Stokes Equations for Image Inpainting"** conceptualizes an image as a dynamic fluid system.
% \gls{PDE}s are leveraged to direct the flow of information into the missing regions, akin to the natural filling of empty spaces by fluids.

\paragraph{Synthetic generation of semantic city models}
 %The scarcity of \gls{LOD}3 building models poses a challenge in utilizing real \gls{LOD}3 buildings as a source for training data.
With Random3Dcity, Biljecki et al. **Biljecki, "Procedural Generation of Cities in 2D"**, introduce an application for the procedural generation of randomized semantic city models.
 %Originally intended to create datasets for testing CityGML functionalities,
Their software can be deployed for generating random CityGML datasets at various \gls{LOD} levels according to a set of pre-defined rules **Biljecki, "Procedural Generation of Cities in 2D"**.

%\olafworries{I think it's still okay, just start that "In contrast to traditional methods... deep learning methods use..."}
%\olafworries{Otherwise, we'd need to elaborate more on traditional methods here}
