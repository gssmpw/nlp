We find that one of the main reasons for that is the lack of an effective receptive field in both the inpainting network and the loss function. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method called large mask inpainting (LaMa). LaMa is based on i) a new inpainting network architecture that uses fast Fourier convolutions (FFCs), which have the image-wide receptive field; ii) a high receptive field perceptual loss; iii) large training masks, which unlocks the potential of the first two components. Our inpainting network improves the state-of-the-art across a range of datasets and achieves excellent performance even in challenging scenarios, e.g. completion of periodic structures. Our model generalizes surprisingly well to resolutions that are higher than those seen at train time, and achieves this at lower parameter&time costs than the competitive baselines.

  abstract      = {Reconstructing semantic 3D building models at the level of detail (LoD) 3 is a long-standing challenge. Unlike mesh-based models, they require watertight geometry and object-wise semantics at the fa\c{c}ade level. The principal challenge of such demanding semantic 3D reconstruction is reliable fa\c{c}ade-level semantic segmentation of 3D input data. We present a novel method, called Scan2LoD3, that accurately reconstructs semantic LoD3 building models by improving fa\c{c}ade-level semantic 3D segmentation. To this end, we leverage laser physics and 3D building model priors to probabilistically identify model conflicts. These probabilistic physical conflicts propose locations of model openings: Their final semantics and shapes are inferred in a Bayesian network fusing multimodal probabilistic maps of conflicts, 3D point clouds, and 2D images. To fulfill demanding LoD3 requirements, we use the estimated shapes to cut openings in 3D building priors and fit semantic 3D objects from a library of fa\c{c}ade objects. Extensive experiments on the TUM city campus datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Scan2LoD3 over the state-of-the-art methods in fa\c{c}ade-level detection, semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building model reconstruction. We believe our method can foster the development of probability-driven semantic 3D reconstruction at LoD3 since not only the high-definition reconstruction but also reconstruction confidence becomes pivotal for various applications such as autonomous driving and urban simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional city models are increasingly being used for analyses and simulations. To enable such applications, it is necessary to standardise semantically richer city models and, in some cases, to connect the models with external data sources. In this study, we describe the development of a new Swedish specification for 3D city models, denoted as 3CIM, which is a joint effort between the three largest cities in Sweden&mdash;Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm&ouml;. Technically, 3CIM is an extension of the OGC standard CityGML 2.0, implemented as an application domain extension (ADE). The ADE is semantically thin, mainly extending CityGML 2.0 to harmonise with national standards; in contrast, 3CIM is mainly based on linkages to external databases, registers, and operational systems for the semantic part. The current version, 3CIM 1.0, includes various themes, including Bridge, Building, Utility, City Furniture, Transportation, Tunnel, Vegetation, and Water. Three test areas were created with 3CIM data, one in each city. These data were evaluated in several use-cases, including visualisation as well as daylight, noise, and flooding simulations. The conclusion from these use-cases is that the 3CIM data, together with the linked external data sources, allow for the inclusion of the necessary information for the visualisation and simulations, but extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes are required to tailor the input data. The next step is to implement 3CIM within the three cities, which will entail several challenges, as discussed at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {In the realm of 3D reconstruction pipelines, 2D conflict maps that indicate the presence openings in façades such as windows and doors, represent an intermediate output [1]. However, these maps often fall short of completeness due to insufficient coverage or occlusions caused by objects such as vegetation. This research delves into the exploration of deep learning strategies to address this limitation by inpainting unseen façade objects into the 2D conflict maps. The central focus of this study revolves around deploying the Stable Diffusion inpainting model [2, 3] and the LaMa GAN [4] for this purpose. Specifically, I investigate in the potential of personalizing a pre-trained Stable Diffusion inpainting model with Dreambooth [5] to facilitate its application in inpainting unseen façade objects within 2D conflict maps. Simultaneously, I undergo training for the LaMa GAN with a similar objective. By utilizing synthetic conflict maps that are derived from randomly generated semantic city models [6] and such that are derived from databases of annotated optical façade images [7] as data for training the LaMa GAN and personalisation a pre-trained Stable Diffusion with Dreambooth, I investigate if such data sources can facilitate the deployment of deep learning models. My results demonstrate the general capability of deep learning based methods for inpainting unseen objects into the 2D conflict maps. I find that the personalisation with Dreambooth yields improvements regarding the behaviour of diffusion based models when considering tree-shaped masks. This, and the successful training of the LaMa GAN demonstrate the utility of synthetic conflict maps and such derived from annotated images. The insights gained in this paper can be applied to existing pipelines for the reconstruction of LOD3 models. This way my work contributes to improving the reconstruction accuracy of such approaches. It also serves as the basis for further exploration.},
