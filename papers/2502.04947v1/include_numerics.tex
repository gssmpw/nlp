\section{Numerical results}\label{sec:numerical_results}

This section is dedicated to validating the proposed method on several numerical experiments, which are instances of the problem \eqref{eq:ob_pde} presented in \cref{sec:introduction} with spatial dimension $d \in \{1,2\}$, and with increasing complexity.
The idea is to compare, in different ways, the additive and multiplicative approaches presented in \cref{sec:additive_prior} and \cref{sec:multiplicative_prior} to the standard finite element method presented in \cref{sec:FEM}.
The multiplicative approach will only be considered in dimension $d=1$, showing that only in rare cases, and with a good choice of the lifting constant $M$, does it provide better results than the additive one.
We will also show that the approach proposed in \cref{sec:prior_construction} for choosing the prior is more efficient than more classical ones, considering the 1D case.

In \cref{sec:setup}, we present the two tests that will be performed for each test case. We are interested in two 1D test cases ($d=1$): the Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions in \cref{sec:Lap1D} and a general elliptic system and convection-dominated regime problem in \cref{sec:Ell1D}. We then consider two 2D cases ($d=2$): We start with a Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions on a square domain in \cref{sec:Lap2D}. We then continue with a slightly more complicated elliptic problem, still with Dirichlet conditions and on a square domain, in \cref{sec:Ell2D}. In \cref{sec:Lap2DMixRing}, we return to the 2D Poisson problem, but this time considering mixed boundary conditions on a ring-shaped domain.



The implementation of the numerical results obtained on the various test cases is available at the following address:
