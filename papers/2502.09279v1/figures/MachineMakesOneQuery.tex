    \caption{Illustration of the circuit construction mentioned in the proof of \Cref{thm:CircuitLowerBoundsImplyNoMembershipInRPH}. In the first step of construction, each input node in the old circuit gets replaced by depth-$2$ circuits which have a fan-in of at most $P(n)$ for the gates that are the parents of the input nodes and have a fan-in of at most $2^{P(n)}$ for the gates that are the grandparents of the input nodes; here $P(n)$ is a polynomial. Furthermore, its input nodes are outputs of $M'^{O}$. The second step of the construction is to contract consecutive edges with the same labels. The final depth of the new circuit is $1$ more than the depth of the original circuit.}
